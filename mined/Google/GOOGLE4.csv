,07062017,Reuters,06292017,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are weighing another record fine against Google over its Android mobile operating system and have set up a panel of experts to give a second opinion on the case, two people familiar with the matter said. The move by the EU competition authority, which hit the company with a 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty for unfairly favoring its shopping service last month, could pose a bigger risk for the world’s most popular internet search engine because of Android’s huge growth potential. The potential fine is expected to top that 2.4 billion euro penalty. The EU’s charge sheet issued to Google in April last year said the anti-competitive practices started from January 2011 and the Commission is likely to tell the company to stop them. They are still ongoing, telecoms industry sources said. Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso and Google both declined to comment. The EU ruling has the scope to do the most damage compared with a third case against Google’s AdSense, Richard Windsor, an independent financial analyst who tracks competition among the biggest U.S. and Asian internet and mobile companies, said in a recent note. “If Google was forced to unbundle Google Play from its other Digital Life services, handset makers and operators would be free to set whatever they like by default potentially triggering a decline in the usage of Google’s services,” he said, referring to Google’s apps store. The long-running case is taking its toll on users and rivals, FairSearch lawyer Thomas Vinje said. “A decision would come none too soon. Google is hurting Android users, including by surreptitiously commandeering ever-increasing amounts of personal data,” Vinje said. The EU competition enforcer said Google’s tactics include requiring smartphone makers to pre-install Google Search and the Google Chrome browser in return for access to other Google apps, and barring the manufacturers from using rival versions of Android. The company was also accused of paying smartphone makers and mobile network operators to only install Google Search on their devices. Google said at the time that Android was a remarkable system based on open-source software and open innovation and was good for competition and for consumers. The Commission had planned to establish a peer review panel, also known as a devil’s advocate, in June, the people said. Such panels are usually made up of three to four experienced officials who examine the case team’s conclusions with a fresh pair of eyes to ensure that the case is robust. They usually take three to four weeks to complete their work although this could be extended. It was not clear if the panel has started work yet. ","

,07062017,Reuters,06292017,"Tellenes wind farm, a 50-turbine strong wind farm of 160-megawatt (MW) capacity that is currently under development, will become Norway’s largest wind farm and Google’s biggest in Europe. “We’ll purchase power as soon as the wind farm becomes fully operational, which we expect will take place in early September 2017,” a Google spokesman told Reuters. Google last year signed a 12-year deal to buy 100 percent of the plant’s output. The company, which has four European data centers in Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland, said the wind power will be used to supply one or several of them. The Tellenes wind farm’s first turbine will begin to generate power by next week, said Olav Rommetveit, a spokesman for farm maker Zephyr, although Google will not receive the initial output. “Google will not immediately get the supply. It has an exclusive contract for 12 years and they will begin getting the electricity at some point after commercial operations begins,” said Rommetveit. The electricity produced until Google starts receiving the farm’s full capacity, will be sold on the Nord Pool power exchange, he added. Google has also bought the future output of a smaller wind farm in Sweden, due to start operation in 2018, bringing the total capacity of its renewable power purchases in Europe to 500 MW, the company said.

,07062017,Reuters,06292017,"SUNNYVALE, Calif. (Reuters) - Baidu, China’s leading internet search company, is set to announce the first vehicle manufacturing partners for its self-driving software next week, including Chery Automobile, one of the country’s biggest carmakers, according to a person familiar with the matter. The partnerships may be announced in Beijing, but they are the result of work that is happening 6,000 miles away in Silicon Valley, where Baidu and more than 30 other Chinese companies are busy developing and funding software and hardware to power internet-connected, autonomous vehicles. The goal is to get those vehicles on the roads in China, the world’s biggest auto market. The hope is that the same technology, embedded in exported Chinese vehicles, can then conquer the United States. Baidu Inc, known as China’s Google, is playing a central role in that effort. Like Waymo, the self-driving arm of Google parent Alphabet Inc, Baidu is using what it has learned in mapping and artificial intelligence to design the software and systems necessary to make self-driving cars a reality. Its project, unveiled in April, is named Apollo after NASA’s moon-landing program. The name indicates the scale of Baidu’s ambition, but also the difficulty of the project. It is by no means clear that it will succeed in one of the most competitive parts of the technology industry. Chief scientist Andrew Ng and self-driving unit manager Jing Wang left earlier this year to form their own startups. “The competition for talent is keen,” Jingao Wang, the new head of Baidu’s Silicon Valley self-driving team, said in an interview at its technology center in the shadow of NASA’s Ames Research Center in Sunnyvale, California. “There is never enough.” Baidu has at least one advantage over Waymo, based just five miles away at the sprawling Googleplex in Mountain View. It now has a presence in the United States, whereas Alphabet has no footprint in China, after Google shuttered its website there in 2010 rather than bow to the government’s internet censorship. In 2011, Baidu was one of the first of the new generation of Chinese companies to set up a base in Silicon Valley, in order to tap the world’s deepest tech talent pool. Since then, it has made itself the center of a “China network” of almost three dozen firms there, through investments, acquisitions and partnerships. For a graphic on the links between some of China's tech firms in Silicon Valley tech firms, click on tmsnrt.rs/2sW51iZ Over six years, Baidu has assembled a formidable 200-person tech team, recruiting from top U.S. universities and established leaders in the auto and tech industry, including Google, Facebook Inc and Microsoft Corp. It has expanded its technical capability through the acquisition of vision and robotics startup xPerception, a close partnership with chipmaker Nvidia Corp, and investments in other Silicon Valley firms such as Velodyne, an expert in lidar, the light-sensing technology key to letting self-driving cars “see” where they are going. Baidu was followed by Tencent Holdings Ltd, China’s largest internet company, which has bought its way into Silicon Valley, including a $1.8-billion investment earlier this year in Tesla Inc, the California electric car maker which is also working on self-driving technology. Baidu and Tencent have teamed up to bankroll Nio, a startup aiming to put autonomous electric vehicles on American and Chinese roads by 2020, which is now valued at $2.8 billion. Nio has its main offices in Shanghai and San Jose in Silicon Valley. Not far away, another Chinese-funded self-driving startup, Faraday Future, has a small team of engineers working from the U.S. office of sister company LeEco. The money that Baidu and other Chinese investors have invested in Silicon Valley has driven up the value of mobility startups such as Zoox, said Evangelos Simoudis, a Palo Alto venture investor. Chinese newcomers have now spread across the San Francisco Bay Area. Palo Alto, the birthplace of Silicon Valley, has emerged as a financial hub for China-connected venture capital firms such as GSR Ventures and ZhenFund. In neighboring Menlo Park, the center of U.S. venture capital, China’s largest automaker Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp has a tech center that houses the state-owned company’s investment arm. China-backed Lucid Motors, a self-driving electric vehicle startup, also makes its home in Menlo Park. “It takes the whole industry to make self-driving become real, instead of one company,” said Amy Gu, managing partner of Hemi Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm that invests in autonomous vehicle startups. “It is not only about spending money, but about being able to come up with real products for which customers will pay.” It is not clear how quickly - if at all - Baidu will get to the point of producing such a product. The company is struggling with a decline in its core advertising business, hurt by government curbs on medical ads in China and some unsuccessful side ventures. It is now looking to shift its focus to artificial intelligence under the guidance of Qi Lu, a former Microsoft executive. Self-driving is a key application of that. Baidu has not specified how it intends to make money from the open-source Apollo project, but it has said it will integrate cloud-based data services into the platform, much as Google has done with its ubiquitous Android smartphone operating system. The company may fill in some details at a developer conference it has scheduled for July 5 in Beijing, when it releases some Apollo technology for cars driving on urban streets and will announce its first manufacturing partners. That could be a turning point when the technology focus will begin to shift from California to China, according to Simoudis. “The dependence on Silicon Valley talent may not be eliminated, but it will continue to diminish as the Chinese build their own capabilities,” he said.

,07062017,Reuters,06292017,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe’s top court will rule on Sept. 6 whether to uphold Intel’s appeal against a 1.06-billion-euro ($1.2 billion) EU antitrust fine, a case with ramifications for Google’s challenge against a record sanction handed out this week. The European Commission penalized U.S. chipmaker Intel in 2009 because it tried to squeeze out rival Advanced Micro Devices by giving rebates to PC makers Dell [DI.UL], Hewlett-Packard Co, NEC and Lenovo for buying most of their computer chips from Intel. The fine was a record for an individual company for an antitrust violation and was only eclipsed this week by Google’s 2.4-billion-euro penalty. Intel challenged the it in court. Judges at the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice (ECJ) will announce their verdict on Sept. 6, a court spokeswoman said, ending a saga that has stretched back more than a decade. Intel won backing from ECJ court adviser Nils Wahl last year who doubted if the company’s actions had really harmed competition. The top court follows such non-binding recommendations in four out of five cases. In 2014, a lower court however backed the Commission. Google, penalized on Tuesday by the EU competition authority for unfairly promoting its shopping service at the expense of rivals, will be keenly watching the verdict for pointers on how to fight its legal battle. It is expected to appeal the EU fine. ","

,07062017,Reuters,06292017,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd launched on Wednesday a cut-price voice assistant speaker, similar to Amazon.com Inc’s “Echo”, its first foray into artificially intelligent home devices. The “Tmall Genie”, named after the company’s e-commerce platform Tmall, costs 499 yuan ($73.42), significantly less than western counterparts by Amazon and Alphabet Inc’s Google, which range from $120 to $180. These devices are activated by voice commands to perform tasks, such as checking calendars, searching for weather reports, changing music or control smart-home devices, using internet connectivity and artificial intelligence. China’s top tech firms have ambitions to become world leaders in artificial intelligence as companies, including Alibaba and Amazon, increasingly compete for the same markets. Baidu, China’s top search engine, which has invested in an artificial intelligence lab with the Chinese government, recently launched a device based on its own siri-like “Duer OS” system. The Tmall Genie is currently programmed to use Mandarin as its language and will only be available in China. It is activated when a recognised user says “Tmall Genie” in Chinese. In a streamed demonstration on Wednesday, engineers ordered the device to buy and deliver some Coca Cola, play music, add credit to a phone and activate a smart humidifier and TV. The device, which comes in black and white, can also be tasked with purchasing goods from the company’s Tmall platform, a function similar to Amazon’s Echo device. Alibaba has invested heavily in offline stores and big data capabilities in an effort to capitalise on the entire supply chain as part of its retail strategy, increasingly drawing comparisons with similar strategies adopted by Amazon. It recently began rolling out unstaffed brick-and-motor grocery and coffee shops, using QR codes that users can scan to complete payment on its Alipay app, which has over 450 million users. Amazon launched a similar concept of stores in December. ($1=6.7962 yuan) ","

,07062017,Reuters,06292017,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Parliament on Tuesday passed a directive requiring big multinationals to report tax and financial data separately in all countries where they operate, a measure aimed at tackling tax avoidance and profit shifting to countries with lower taxes. The new rules are part of a wider overhaul of tax regulation spurred by the so-called Panama Papers and other revelations of widespread tax avoidance by companies and wealthy individuals. They do, however, still need approval from the EU member states in coming months, and would then have to be enacted into national law in each country within a year. EU countries lose between 50 and 70 billion euros in revenues every year because of tax avoidance, the vice president of the European Commission, Valdis Dombrovskis, told lawmakers. The new measure would require firms with activities in the EU and an annual turnover of at least 750 million euros ($850 million) to disclose data such as profits, revenues, taxes paid and number of employees for each country where they operate. Currently, multinationals disclose their operations in one consolidated report. Tax-dodging schemes often hinge on the transfer of taxable profits from the higher-tax states where they are made to countries with lower taxation or none at all. Tax-saving schemes used by Apple, Amazon, Google, Starbucks and other companies have raised public pressure for EU-wide rules to close these loopholes. The original legislative proposal made by the European Commission required country-by-country disclosures only for operations in EU states and in tax havens, although there is no common EU list of such jurisdictions. The European Parliament changed the proposed rules to extend the reporting requirement to all countries where firms operate. To protect Europe’s competitiveness, the conservative and liberal groups in the EU legislature successfully pushed for companies to be allowed to apply for limited-period exemptions from disclosing information that is commercially sensitive. But the bill does not specify what would be considered sensitive. The anti-corruption group Transparency International called the exemption a “massive loophole” that could undermine the new legislation, and another campaign group, Oxfam, said lawmakers were “bowing to big business”. German conservative legislator Markus Ferber said the clause was necessary to prevent companies “handing away business secrets to the competition on a silver platter”. ","

,07062017,Reuters,06292017,"LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s top medical technology companies are turning to robots to help with complex knee surgery, promising quicker procedures and better results in operations that often leave patients dissatisfied. Demand for artificial replacement joints is growing fast, as baby boomers’ knees and hips wear out, but for the past 15 years rival firms have failed to deliver a technological advance to gain them significant market share. Now U.S.-based Stryker and Britain’s Smith & Nephew  believe that is about to change, as robots give them an edge. Robots should mean less trauma to patients and faster recovery, although they still need to prove themselves in definitive clinical studies, which will not report results for a couple of years. Fares Haddad, a consultant surgeon at University College London Hospitals, is one of the first in Britain to use the new robots and has been impressed. However, he agrees healthcare providers need decisive data to prove they are worth an investment that can be as much as $1 million for each robot. “The main reason for using a robotic system is to improve precision and to be able to hit very accurately a target that varies from patient to patient,” he said. “It is particularly useful in knees because they are more problematic (than hips) and there are a chunk of patients that aren’t as satisfied as we would like with their knee replacement.” Satisfaction rates are only around 65 percent for knee operations, against 95 percent for hips, according to industry surveys. The rival types of robots vary in cost and sophistication, assisting surgeons with precision image guidance for bone cutting and the insertion of artificial joints. Orthopaedic companies hope to emulate the success of Intuitive Surgical, an early pioneer of robots in hospitals, which now has more than 4,000 of its da Vinci machines installed around the world for procedures including prostate removal, hernia repair and hysterectomies. In addition to selling into big Western markets, they also want to expand robot use in India, China and other emerging markets, where owning a prestigious high-tech system can be a marketing advantage for private hospitals. Stryker is leading the charge with its MAKO robotic arm, a platform it acquired for $1.65 billion in 2013 and which has pioneered robot-assisted whole-knee operations by determining optimal positioning and then helping with bone cutting. But it has competition from smaller rival Smith & Nephew, which last week launched a cheaper product called Navio for total knee replacements in the United States. The British group bought the company behind Navio for $275 million in 2016. That has kicked off the battle in earnest, since both companies are now able to do total knee replacements, which represent the vast majority of knee procedures. MAKO, which uses only Stryker’s joints and implants, costs around $1 million to install, while Navio, which does not have as many features and is not tied exclusively to Smith & Nephew’s products, is less than half the price. Both companies believe their robots will help them capture a bigger share of an orthopaedic market that has been split between four big players for more than a decade. Indeed, Smith & Nephew Chief Executive Olivier Bohuon said it was his company’s most important strategic investment for a decade. “We are now basically head to head with Stryker,” he said in an interview. “I do believe we are going to gain market share due to the fact we have robots, whether it’s Stryker or us.” COST-EFFECTIVENESS QUESTION Stryker, meanwhile, expects its MAKO system to start delivering market share gains from the end of 2017. “As we exit this year, we expect to start to see evidence in our knee market shares,” Katherine Owen, head of strategy at Stryker, told an investment conference in June. “Our goal with MAKO on knees is to capture hundreds of basis points of market share. What that time frame looks like, we haven’t been specific about.” Zimmer Biomet and Johnson & Johnson, the two other big players in orthopaedics, are lagging in the robotics race but both have plans to enter the area in different ways. J&J is working on surgical robotics with Verily, the life sciences arm of Google parent Alphabet, while Zimmer last year bought a majority stake in France’s Medtech, a specialist in neurosurgery. Analysts at Morgan Stanley believe robots have the potential to disrupt a market in artificial joints that has arguably become commoditised, with no knee or hip implant emerging as supreme in recent years. That chimes with the view of Smith & Nephew’s Bohuon, who argues that robots give his company a chance to punch above its weight, despite ranking No. 4 in reconstructive surgery. He reckons robotics could account for 20 to 40 percent of knee operations. Much will depend, however, on how the rival systems stack up. Jefferies analysts said the semi-automated bone resection offered by MAKO might well win out in the long term, but Navio offers a far cheaper option and is still well ahead of anything the other two major manufacturers have today. Orthopaedic surgeon Haddad, who has experimented with both, said the machines were very different and healthcare systems would need to assess their cost-effectiveness in the light of clinical trial results. “I think the clinical benefit will be pretty obvious but whether that justifies the upfront outlay is a big question.” ","

,07062017,Reuters,06292017,(本文由台湾《今周刊》杂志提供，节选自7月6日出版的当期「老谢开讲」专栏) 上周有三件大事发生，都是牵动世界的巨大变化，一个是改变苹果电脑命运，也是近半个世纪以来，除了网际网路外，人类发展第二重要产业的智慧型手机，苹果从第一代iPhone进化到第七代iPhone，苹果iPhone手机售出超过十亿支，也带动产业巨大变化。 第二个是脸书（Facebook）的创办人祖克柏（Mark Zuckerberg）亲自发文，宣布脸书每月用户突破二十亿，占了全球四分之一的人口，祖克柏接受《今日美国》（USA TODAY）专访时表示，尽管脸书每月使用人口超过二十亿人，但脸书尚未达到「连系世界上每一个人」的目标，未来仍有待努力，脸书不会大肆庆祝。 脸书在二○○四年创立，短短四年时间，每月使用人数即突破上亿，但随着智慧型手机App上线，脸书到一二年，每月使用人数突破十亿，如今只花五年时间就又扩张了另一个十亿。这几年脸书在竞争对手Snapchat追击之下，很多人担心脸书市占版图会缩小，但祖克柏仍奋力巩固版图。 第三件事是欧盟执委会对Google开罚二十四．二亿欧元。理由是Google滥用近乎独占的地位，扭曲搜寻结果，以推广自家购物，妨碍其他网购比价服务业者的公平竞争，欧盟开出史上最大的反托辣斯天价罚款。上次遭到欧盟裁罚的微软是十．六亿欧元，这次罚款金额倍增，欧盟执委会勒令Google必须在九十天之内停止违规行为，且在六十天内要告知欧盟相关计画；若在期限内未采积极作为，欧盟会进一步对Google祭出每月全球平均营收五％的罚金，如果以首季Google营收来算，每日罚金收一百万欧元，这是很大的利空。 最近美国前五大市值科技股FAAMG（Apple，Google，Microsoft，Amazon，Facebook）股价回档压力大，但是欧盟加重对Google裁罚，加大Google回档的压力，Google股价从九八八．二五美元跌到八九八．七美元，让Google市值缩减了大约六百亿美元。 **全球竞争力集中少数巨头** 其实这三样事都标示着同样一件事，全球竞争集中化，而且是赢家通吃的现象愈来愈凸显。Google这次被欧盟裁罚，背后最大的着力点是Google的搜寻引擎占全欧盟九成以上，这是一个赢家通吃的新资本主义时代（winner-take-all capitalism），现在全世界都开始担心科网巨擘不断攻城掠地，最后会不会重创世界，造成百业萧条，著名的市场分析机构MarketWatch最近有一篇专题报导，直指美国最成功的企业「正在杀死经济」。 大型企业不断攻城掠地，像最近亚马逊（Amazon）宣布以一三七亿美元购并拥有四三○个实体卖场的有机商品零售店Whole Foods Market，十年前亚马逊市值不到六百亿美元，根本买不起Whole Foods Market，但今天亚马逊膨胀到四千五百亿美元，吞下Whole Foods Market易如反掌，亚马逊正是一家不断创造破坏的企业。 亚马逊先在线上累积资本和客源，然后逐步淘汰线下的实体店，彻底颠覆原来零售业的生态，一九九四年贝佐斯（Jeff Bezos）创办亚马逊，原先这只是一家网路书店，但贝佐斯一开始就把目标订得很清楚，他曾说要让亚马逊成为「万货店」（The Everything Store），他要让亚马逊什么都卖。 **亚马逊〞创造性的破坏〞打趴传产** 经过二十三年，亚马逊一步一脚印朝着这个目标前进，不断地制造「创造性的破坏」，从电子书Kindle开始，亚马逊打残了Borders，还有Barnes & Nobles；亚马逊卖歌曲、录影带，甚至电影，让百视达（Blockbuster）毫无招架之力。现在亚马逊也投资电视剧、电影，下一步要和Netflix正面交锋。亚马逊卖电子产品，RadioShack和Circuit City都宣布破产倒闭，这次再拿下Whole Foods Market，已让零售业巨人包括特易购（Tesco），好市多（Costco）和沃尔玛感到压力。 早在一九四二年之前，经济学家熊彼得称资本主义总是不断「创造性地破坏」，如今资本主义加上新科技，这个创造性破坏威力更大，工业革命如此，九○年代崛起的网路时代更是如此，在这个时代，科技巨擘一方面从科技创新中带来效益，用科技的力量带来减价效果，为消费者带来好处，同时也为股东创造价值；但是这些拥有品牌、产品以及服务的明星公司，藉着强大竞争力，蚕食了传统产业的利润，压低了打工仔的酬劳，遏阻了整体经济成长，同时也让社会分化加剧。 **市场赢家用购并〞缩减〞竞争对手** 根据美国人口普查局资料统计，过去二十年，顶尖企业的市场占有率快速扩增，全球有四分之三的行业，市场集中度愈来愈高，其中一○％行业的利润集中在几家龙头企业，许多其他企业也由少于十家企业垄断。经济学家Jason Furman和Peter Orszag共同研究发现，少数公司利用其竞争优势，获得超过一○○％的回报率，比一般公司的二○％利润，高出很多倍。 巨无霸企业拥有经营许可证、专利、版权及其他智慧产权，可以阻止潜在竞争者进入市场，他们拥有强大品牌，使旗下产品得以更高溢价销售，并且利用网路巩固其垄断地位，而且手握足够筹码，可争取政府提供补贴和放宽监管，还有为了消除潜在劲敌，大型企业还可以直接收购竞争对手，或锁定进入行业所需资源，包括技术人才及销售通路，并且藉其购并筑起保护壁垒。 许多新创公司根本还来不及跟这些科技巨擘一较高下，在他们萌芽时已被大企业购并。这样的故事在以色列天天发生，很多萌芽的企业一旦被认定具有发展潜力，通常很快遭到购并。美国FAAMG五大科技巨擘，过去十年共并进五百多家企业，由于进入门槛愈来愈高，现在的新创公司明显比十年前减少很多。 像亚马逊的扩张，新发展的Amazon Go，消费者进入店内不用付款，随意取走任何货品，电脑会自动记录，并透过App支付，这样的扩张将逐步威胁到美国本土零售业，甚至是餐饮业员工素质。到去年底为止，美国约有一六五○万零售从业人员及一一四○万的餐饮从业人员，很多零售业从业人员纷纷遭到资遣解雇，餐饮人员虽未直接受到冲击，但随着传统商场或实体店业务收缩，下一个挑战也无可逃避。 **全球广告业被鲸吞半壁江山** 更不幸的是，仓储中的工作愈来愈多由机器人取代，物流业人员将急速缩编，亚马逊现在正考虑部署无人机，直接把包裹递送到顾客家门前。很多人认真在思考亚马逊这一步转型，将「杀死」更多美国职位，而这个现象最显着的冲击是传统广告业。 市调机构Harket对一七年的预测，今年全球网路广告Google拿走八○八亿美元，脸书分走三六三亿美元；换言之，Google加上脸书，已拿走全球网路广告的半壁江山，这个现象连台湾也强力感受到，去年脸书拿走超过新台币一百亿元的媒体广告量，以台湾媒体广告量一年约新台币四百至五百亿元来估算，Google加上脸书大概分走媒体广告四成，其他传统媒体业生机当然遭到压缩。 这次亚马逊拿下Whole Foods Market，着眼的是吃得健康。跨入二十一世纪，人类愈来愈爱吃，吃得好几乎变成一个宗教，工业生产带来污染，让愈来愈多的人认真寻找安全健康食材；全球化带来各国美食，但中产阶级更重视吃得健康，宁可花更多钱购买有机食品。 根据资料统计，美国人平均花费六％购买食物，一五年食物消费六○二○亿美元，这个数字高于汽车和手机，一六年美国人每周平均花费一一○美元在食物上，成长率超过通膨；因此，亚马逊对Whole Foods Market下手卡位，这是破坏性创造的必杀手段。 而造就这个破坏创新的大推手，显然是苹果带来过去十年新革命，这场科技变革最大推手，应该是iPhone带来的巨大改变。大家回想一下，十年前的今天跟现在有什么差别？最大的差别是：十年前这个世界没有「低头族」，因为智慧型手机改变了这个世界。 ○七年六月二十九日iPhone正式发售，在此之前，苹果已凭藉着Mac、iPod开启贾伯斯（Steve Jobs）的第二春。当时苹果每股不到二十美元，市值约九○○亿美元，现在市值跑到七四七○亿美元，股价在一四三．五美元，股价乍看涨不多，原来是苹果在一○年时，一股拆七股，以○七年到今天，苹果市值从九○○亿美元变成七四七○亿美元，大约成长七．三倍。而这段期间，道琼指数上涨六○％，那斯达克（Nasdaq）涨了一．四倍，股神巴菲特的波克夏涨了一．三倍，Google则涨了二六○％。 ○七年的iPhone第一代，全球卖出六一○万支，去年推出的iPhone 7累积有一亿支的销售量，iPhone一至七总共销售了十亿支。过去的手机只有通话功能，直到智慧型手机真正开启了智能的时代，苹果带来很多赢家，像帮苹果代工的鸿海、光学的大立光、舜宇光学，以及其他如瑞声科技、高通、蓝思科技、立讯精密等，都是苹果创出来的大赢家。 六月二十六日，《富比世》（Forbes）以「The 11 Taiwanese Tycoons Who Built Fortunes By Selling To Apple」为题，介绍十一位靠着苹果发迹的老板。这十一人是鸿海的郭台铭、广达林百里、大立光的林耀英及陈世卿、日月光的张虔生、张洪本、台达电郑崇华、国巨陈泰铭、可成洪水树及台积电张忠谋，以及和硕童子贤。 **智能手机开启腾讯巨大的成长** 其实中国的腾讯，可能也是智慧型手机带来变革最大赢家。腾讯十年前主打电脑上使用的QQ软件，主要收入靠广告。○六年腾讯的营业额是二十八亿元人民币，净利十亿元人民币，当时市值六百亿港币；iPhone推出之际，未在中国发售，后来随着智慧型手机全面化，腾讯也推出微信，智能手机真正开启腾讯巨大的成长。如今腾讯市值高达二．六六兆港币，这个十年成长令人目眩。 鸿海也是代工的赢家，○六年鸿海的营业额一．三兆元台币，净利约六六二亿元，过去鸿海帮摩托罗拉、诺基亚代工，到去年为止，鸿海营收四．四兆新台币，净利一四八七亿台币，来自苹果的订单带给鸿海巨大的成长。 这是一个十年的巨变，大家可以想想，下一个十年，这个世界会再出现怎样让你意想不到的巨大变化。(完) 注: 1.专栏作者老谢--谢金河，为《今周刊》发行人兼财讯文化事业执行长。 2.以上评论不代表路透立场。 ,"

Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google launched its hybrid mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) back in 2015; MVNOs purchase wholesale capacity from wireless carriers in order to resell service under a different brand, but Google's twist was to combine the networks of Sprint and T-Mobile while supplementing coverage with Wi-Fi calling. Project Fi added U.S. Cellular to its ""network of networks"" last year. Even the billing system was extremely competitive and pro-consumer: Google only charges you for what you use, crediting back pro-rated refunds at the end of each billing cycle for unused data. The biggest problem? Project Fi only works with Google's own Nexus or Pixel phones. Currently, the only four devices that are officially supported are the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel, and Pixel XL. That may finally be about to change. The Pixel is one of the few supported devices. Image source: Google. The official Project Fi account has shared a new tidbit on social media this morning, saying a ""mid-tier"" phone from a hardware partner may launch later this year and support Project Fi. We hear you loud and clear. Keep an eye out for a new Fi-compatible device at a mid-tier price from one of our partners later this year. https://t.co/74U3bq16pa  A couple months back, there were reports and rumors that Google would be bringing its Android One initiative to the U.S. Android One is the effort to standardize Android phones in emerging markets, both in terms of hardware and software. Those reports suggested that any U.S.-bound Android One devices would support Project Fi. It's not clear which phone we're talking about, and it's not as if there's a lack of midtier smartphones in the U.S., but this could give Project Fi the shot in the arm that it needs. Google has dipped its toes into effectively becoming an internet service provider in more ways than one. There was Google Fiber, which failed mostly due to the fact that building out fiber-optic infrastructure is prohibitively expensive. The high costs served as a natural limiting factor that prevented Google Fiber from becoming widespread, despite overwhelming demand among consumers for gigabit speeds at competitive prices. Project Fi is Google's take on cellular connectivity. While MVNOs in general have always faced tough economics, it's better than the aforementioned wired route. By purchasing wholesale capacity, Google doesn't need to worry much about investing in infrastructure. Like other MVNOs, Project Fi's primary operational tasks are marketing and customer support. Seeing as how customer support is not one of Google's strengths (being predominantly a search engine and all), it's feasible that Google consciously chose to limit Project Fi's availability because it knew it couldn't handle the scale. Google is signaling that it's ready for Project Fi to expand. ","

Harsh Chauhan,07062017,Fool,06292017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have turned out to be the unlikeliest of rivals in a slugfest for a greater share of the artificial intelligence (AI) market. So far, Alphabet has been using NVIDIA's GPUs (graphics processing units) to power AI applications on the Google Cloud Platform, though it looks like the search giant has now decided to go it alone in this lucrative space. Let's take a closer look at NVIDIA and Google's AI feud and the potential implications for both companies. Alphabet revealed its plans for its own AI chip -- the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) -- at last year's Google I/O conference. The TPU chip was already deployed across a variety of applications, including optimizing search results and speech recognition, and in Alphabet's data centers. At the same time, Google was sourcing NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs for use in its cloud computing platform and helping customers train AI models. For instance, in November 2016, NVIDIA announced that Google had selected its Tesla P100 GPUs and K80 accelerators to provide AI services to Google Compute Engine and Google Cloud Machine Learning users. But Google shocked the tech world at May's I/O conference when it revealed that the company's second-generation TPU chip will be available for use by its cloud users. Google said in an April blog post that its TPU is 15 to 30 times faster than current-generation CPUs (central processing units) and GPUs. Earlier, Google's TPU was good enough only for inferencing (applying what it knows to new data) but the company has now added AI training capabilities (teaching a machine to make inferences) in the second generation. What's more, Google users can use multiple stand-alone TPUs in a custom high-speed network to build machine learning-capable supercomputers with a lot of computing power. In fact, Google says it has been able to cut down the time to train certain AI models to just a few hours, while the same used to take a day using other commercially available GPUs. This could possibly spell the end of NVIDIA's relationship with Google in AI chips once the TPU roll-out happens by the end of the year. NVIDIA is contesting Alphabet's claims regarding TPU speed, saying that the TPU has been benchmarked against older Kepler GPUs and not against the new Pascal GPUs. What's more, the graphics specialist isn't going to sit idle and let Google take the lead in this space, claiming that its upcoming Volta-based GPUs will be even better at deep learning applications. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. Image Source: NVIDIA. In fact, NVIDIA aims to become more than just a hardware provider as it is working on a new offering known as NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC), which will stack a GPU, such as the Volta-based Tesla V100, along with the company's deep learning libraries. The chipmaker is focusing on providing its AI computing as a platform-as-a-service, which is different from Google's approach. Google isn't going to sell its AI chip externally; rather it will use them to power its own Google Compute platform. Therefore, NVIDIA's worries remain lmited for now as it potentially runs the risk of just losing the Google account. The Volta GPU platform has already started gaining traction as Amazon has committed to buying the V100 chips as soon as they are commercially available later this year. Another advantage for NVIDIA is that Google hasn't yet decided to open source its AI framework, so users of its TPUs will remain locked into Google's platform. Meanwhile, the NVIDIA GPUs support a wide range of cloud computing platforms, including those of Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and IBM, giving users the opportunity to choose from different cloud service providers (CSPs). Image Source: NVIDIA. Additionally, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang took a jab at Google when he wrote in a blog post that the company is open-sourcing its deep learning accelerator, which performs the functions of TPU. ""No one else needs to invest in building an inferencing TPU. We have one for free -- designed by some of the best chip designers in the world,"" he wrote in the blog. The open-source nature of the graphics specialist's AI platform as compared to Google's constraints has made it the chip of choice for the largest CSPs, including Amazon and Microsoft. Meanwhile, Google's cloud platform isn't as successful as Amazon's and Microsoft's, which could restrict the growth of its AI chips. ","
      
    NVIDIA vs. Alphabet in the World of AI Technology -- The Motley Fool

Danny Vena,07062017,Fool,06292017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. This comparison between ubiquitous search leader Google, a division of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) the online search leader in its native China, is a classic tale of follow the leader. Baidu was founded in early 2000, more than a year after Google launched its search effort, and has been playing catch up ever since. The financial press often refers to Baidu as ""the Google of China."" Both companies are synonymous with search, both are investing heavily and seeing success in the nascent area of artificial intelligence and self-driving cars, and both offer a variety of services to their respective users, far outside the purview of their core search engine. But the bottom line for investors is, which is the better buy now? Which company has a better forecast for growth? Image source: Getty Images. Baidu has been going through a rough patch that began last year, as the company sought to arrest slowing growth in its core search. A college student died as the result of undergoing an unproven medical treatment for cancer he found advertised on Baidu's search. The company also came under intense scrutiny after a revelation that it sold rights to some of its online health forums to unlicensed medical groups and hospitals that were later accused of deleting users' comments and promoting their own services. These events led to a Chinese government crackdown on advertising for internet companies. Baidu moved swiftly to overhaul the screening practices it used and weeded out unscrupulous and misleading advertisers. This move dented its advertising revenue, as the company sought to replace lost revenue Baidu has also been investing in a number of areas outside its core search, and spending heavily to do so. The largest such investment is in the area of artificial intelligence (AI), and Baidu is among the foremost companies in the world in the field, and likely the leader in its native China. The company has also been investing heavily in self-driving cars and recently open-sourced its autonomous-driving technology, in an effort to advance development in the area. The company's iQiyi division is a leader in video streaming in China, and the company has been investing heavily in content. Both companies have ventured into artificial intelligence. Image source: Pixabay. Google has been seeing success across its endeavors, though it, too, has been in a negative spotlight. It was revealed earlier this year that brand advertising on Google's YouTube has been paired with videos containing homophobic, racist, terrorist, and anti-Semitic material. This revelation led to a boycott from advertisers, though the uproar has since subsided. Google was among the first to begin investing heavily in artificial intelligence and has produced remarkable gains in the area. Its research in image recognition led to the first AI system that was able to independently recognize cats from YouTube videos. Its Deep Mind unit produced a system that beat the world champion in the complex and ancient game of Go. Another system was able to beat human pathologists at detecting cancer. Its Waymo division is one of the leaders in AI-based self-driving-car technology. In its most recent quarter, Baidu's revenue grew to $2.45 billion, a 6.8% year-over-year increase. Online advertiser numbers fell 23%, but those that remained spent 27% more. Net income for the period fell to $258 million, a 10.6% decrease from the prior-year quarter. During the same period, Alphabet produced revenue of $24.75 billion, up 22% year over year. Net income increased to $5.4 billion, up 29% over the prior-year quarter. This gain was driven by increases in advertising in its core search and on YouTube. Google has the edge in current results. Baidu's search serves a much smaller customer base, which hamstrings its efforts somewhat. Alphabet's revenue is 10 times larger, Google's search is ubiquitous, and it continues to grow revenue. Furthermore, while it's too early to call a winner in the field of AI and both companies have produced astonishing results, Google's developments have been broad based and compelling, giving the company excellent growth prospects and the edge for our purposes. Data by YCharts Over the past 12 months, Alphabet has returned 36%, handily beating the broader market. During the same period, Baidu's stock languished, returning a lackluster 12%. You might expect that since Alphabet has produced greater returns, it would be more highly valued, but that just isn't the case. Based on its earnings over the past four quarters, Baidu currently trades at nearly 39 times trailing earnings, while Alphabet has an earnings multiple of 32. Looking into the future provides similar, if surprising, results. Baidu's forward multiple is 32, which is still higher than Alphabet's forward valuation of 27. This may be the result of the cleanup of Baidu's advertisers, and the market is expecting the company to resume its upward trajectory shortly. Whatever the reason, Alphabet comes out ahead in both stock performance and valuation metrics. PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts In a landslide, Google is the stock you want to buy now. In terms of recent results, growth prospects, valuation, and stock performance, Google has it all. Don't count Baidu out, though. Its financial difficulties are likely to be short lived, and the area of AI is still in its infancy and new developments are occurring on a regular basis. There can -- and probably will be -- more than one winner in the space. ","
      
    Better Buy: Baidu vs. Google -- The Motley Fool

Andrew Tonner,07062017,Fool,06292017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In business, there's rich, and then there's Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rich. The world's largest search provider and most popular website virtually prints profits. In fact, Alphabet so dominates the online advertising market that it was estimated to have captured 43% of the $181 billion online advertising market in 2016. Thanks to this kind of massive success, Alphabet's coffers have ballooned to contain $92.4 billion in cash and investments as of the company's most recent quarterly report. Here are three ideas about how Alphabet could put all that capital to work. Alphabet's mergers and acquisitions machine routinely snatches up smaller start-ups for their talent or technologies. According to research firm CB Insights, Alphabet has purchased at least 23 different start-ups since the start of 2016. The largest group (eight) of these start-ups have focused on what CB Insights categorizes as ""dev tools/cloud platforms,"" though other areas of focus include enterprise tools, as well as media and entertainment. It's also interesting to consider larger public names that Alphabet could potentially buy. The tech giant is clearly intent on capitalizing on coming tech trends including artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and more. Google is already one of the leaders in AI, and other large companies like Baidu or IBM probably aren't feasible acquisitions given size and regulatory considerations. Alphabet has gone on record saying it will not manufacture its own self-driving cars, but it's worth noting that even the largest automakers such as Ford, General Motors, or Tesla are all theoretically within its purchasing power. These kinds of large acquisitions are difficult to execute for a wide range of reasons. However, the point is that Alphabet has so much cash on hand that it can effectively buy its way into any industry, should its management deem it prudent. Image source: Alphabet. The matter of whether -- or when -- Alphabet will begin paying a dividend is by no means a new discussion. Of course, its financial resources are so vast that the company could easily afford to initiate a dividend policy, though it has made its aversion to doing so quite clear over the years. That being said, it will be increasingly difficult for Alphabet to continue to avoid paying a dividend as its cash balances continue to swell. The classic point of reference here, of course, is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The Mac maker initiated its own capital return program in 2012, earmarking a total of $45 billion to be returned to investors via dividends and buybacks over the following three years. Up until that point, Apple had avoided paying a dividend at least in part due to the fear that doing so might shift investor perception that it had become a mature company; Alphabet could certainly be holding off for similar reasons. Interestingly enough, Apple carried $97.6 billion in cash and investments at the time it initiated its own capital return program, an amount Alphabet should soon surpass under current conditions. Of course, that doesn't mean Alphabet will need to start its own dividend if, or when, its cash war chest balloons to twelve figures, but this once seemingly unimaginable idea becomes more of a reality the richer Alphabet becomes. The last option -- and the most likely one in my opinion -- is that Alphabet could initiate some kind of stock buyback program. Buybacks can be an incredibly effective way to drive shareholder returns under the right circumstances. However, when misused, they can prove damaging. However, even this move is by no means a certainty. More specifically, stock buybacks are best used when a company's stock can be fairly seen as undervalued, and this might be a difficult case to make, at least in the near term, for Alphabet. The company's stock currently trades at a multiple of 31 times its last 12 months' earnings per share and 23 times its 2018 consensus EPS estimates. Though the company can likely continue to grow its earnings at above average rates, Alphabet stock still trades at a clear -- and likely deserved -- premium to the market. As the company's cash balances continue to swell, Alphabet will feel increased pressure to put its cash war chest to work in one fashion or another. However, it isn't necessarily clear what the best option for Alphabet is in addressing its embarrassment of riches. ","
      
    How Alphabet Can Use Its $92 Billion War Chest -- The Motley Fool

Sean Williams,07062017,Fool,06292017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Have you heard about the next big thing in investing? No, it's not legal marijuana, albeit pot stocks have been nothing short of unstoppable over the past year. It's actually digital currency bitcoin, which has risen by nearly 900% over the trailing-two-year period. What once cost a consumer or investor around $255 per bitcoin will now set you back around $2,500. Why have digital cryptocurrencies like bitcoin been such a hot commodity of late? It appears to be a confluence of catalysts that have accelerated momentum behind bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies. Image source: Getty Images. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are relishing in newfound media coverage. Between the sheer outperformance of these digital currencies compared to the broader stock market, to recent ransomware attacks (e.g., WannaCry) where the perpetrators demand payment in bitcoin in order to ""unlock"" a computer, bitcoin is in the spotlight. The more media coverage it receives, the more interest there will likely be in this burgeoning payment and investment platform. Weakness in the world's most prominent currency, the U.S. dollar, may be helping as well. President Trump has, on numerous occasions, proclaimed the U.S. dollar to be too strong. A weaker dollar can help promote the export of American goods, but U.S. consumers aren't typically huge fans of seeing their currency weakened. Some investors have used the dollar's weakness as an opportunity to invest in bitcoin, which is a ""finite"" resource since the maximum number of bitcoin is limited to 21 million. The fact that the dollar's monetary base can be expanded infinitely and bitcoin is limited provides the belief to some investors that bitcoin could be a better means to preserve and grow wealth over time. Bitcoin has also benefited from a growing acceptance of the currency by countries, industries, and businesses. Japan declared the cryptocurrency legal tender earlier this year, while some retailers within the marijuana industry have been using bitcoin as a bridge currency between bank-issued debit and credit cards and marijuana product purchases. Since marijuana is a federally illegal substance, most banks won't deal with pot-based businesses, so bitcoin services act as an intermediary by allowing consumers to buy bitcoin and pay for their pot products that way. Bitcoin services then transfer that bitcoin back to cash for the marijuana business in return for a nominal service charge. Image source: Getty Images. Yet what might be most surprising is just how many brand-name businesses are now accepting bitcoin as payment. Here are five businesses that have welcomed bitcoin with open arms. The very first large consumer-facing company to lead the charge for bitcoin was online e-tailer Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK), which in January 2014 partnered with bitcoin exchange Coinbase to allow customers to pay for thousands of items with bitcoin. Shortly after its decision to carry bitcoin, CEO Patrick Byrne announced that his company would carry between 5% and 10% of its bitcoin paid as reserves. If this policy still holds true, Overstock would have seen a very handsome appreciation in those reserves by now, albeit bitcoin remains a nominally small component of its business. In May 2014, satellite television operator DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) announced that it would begin accepting bitcoin as payment for its content services. As with Overstock, DISH partnered with Coinbase as the payment processor for its bitcoin transactions. Bernie Han, who was at the COO of DISH at the time, said, ""DISH is now accepting bitcoin because we are listening to customers and providing them with the choice and convenience they want."" Image source: Microsoft. While governments have resisted referring to bitcoin as a ""currency,"" tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has embraced it. Since December 2014, Microsoft users have been able to use their bitcoin to purchase content in the Windows and Xbox stores. Microsoft was also behind the launch of Azure Blockchain as a service platform that allowed large-scale businesses to use blockchain to facilitate the settlement of financial data. More recently, Microsoft announced that it was adapting Excel 2017 so users can calculate, format, and analyze bitcoin on the platform. Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), the software giant behind do-it-yourself tax preparation software TurboTax and business accounting software QuickBooks, also accepts bitcoin. In late 2014, Intuit and BitPay announced integration of bitcoin payments into the QuickBooks PayByCoin service. This service allowed for next-day settlement into customers' bank accounts, thus eliminating a lot of the volatility inherent with bitcoin, and also provided an attractive business-to-business opportunity for cross-border clients who would otherwise face traditional banking obstacles and delays in the form of a bank transfer. Payment processing platform PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has also broadened its horizons by accepting bitcoin -- albeit in a roundabout way. In September 2014, PayPal announced that it would begin accepting bitcoin as payment via its integration with Braintree. This was also the same month that partnerships with CoinBase, GoCoin, and BitPay were announced. At the time of its announcement, Scott Ellison suggested that PayPal would merely act as the intermediary, with costs of the transaction to be decided by the merchant and payment processor. However, since its spinoff from eBay, PayPal's promotion of bitcoin has slowed. Image source: Getty Images. Following bitcoin's massive run higher and growing legitimacy with brand-name businesses, you might be wondering why more businesses haven't jumped on board. The answer can probably be boiled down to two factors. First, bitcoin is still exceptionally volatile, and even overnight settlements could result in businesses losing out on a lot of money. For example, bitcoin prices plunged by more than $200 in a single day between June 25 and June 26. Businesses that had conducted transactions in bitcoin with next-day settlement could have seen between 7% and 10% of their deal value depleted in a matter of hours. While bitcoin's lack of governmental backing is one reason investors like it so much, this same absence of backing, and the thinness of its trading volume, create substantial volatility that keeps businesses away. The other big issue is that bitcoin could draw the ire of regulators. For example, bitcoin acting as a bridge currency for marijuana purchases looks like the perfect reason for U.S. lawmakers to consider imposing regulations on the cryptocurrency. As long as the government leaves bitcoin alone, it has an opportunity to thrive, but this Fool doesn't believe the U.S. government is going to allow bitcoin to expand without imposing a system of checks and balances. Any sort of regulations on acquiring or holding bitcoin could crush the digital currency's price. I remain steadfast in my belief that bitcoin belongs nowhere near your portfolio for the time being, regardless of its recent performance or its acceptance by brand-name companies. ","
      
    5 Brand-Name Businesses That Currently Accept Bitcoin -- The Motley Fool

Scanning regulatory filings for a hot initial public offering (IPO) is often seen as a poor use of time. The sellers are perceived to be more informed, knowing more about their companies than investment firms and financial analysts who have only a short amount of time to acquaint themselves with a new company. But amid the blowups and flameouts, Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have rewarded their investors with extraordinary returns. Looking back, there were plenty of reasons to pass on Mastercard's intial public offering in 2006. Lending was red hot. Banks were trading at some of the highest valuations in history, fueled by excessive leverage and loose lending standards in everything from credit cards to mortgages. You might have rightfully questioned whether you were the ""dumb money"" if you lined up to snap up shares of Mastercard stock when it listed on the NYSE. After all, the people on the other side were smarter than you. The sellers in the IPO included more than 1,000 member banks in the Mastercard network who had a firsthand look at card data going back decades. It seemed as though they would have a better idea of what they were selling than what you were buying. MA data by YCharts. In the case of Mastercard, you would have watched as all these concerns were reconfirmed when the stock priced $1 below its expected range on the day of the IPO. But then you would have been proven a fool. Mastercard got off to a fast start, rising 18% in its debut, and shares never really looked back. Even at their financial crisis nadir, shares traded for more than three times their IPO price. Mastercard (and Visa, for that matter) may have the most lucrative business in existence. As a payments network, Mastercard collects a microscopic fee on every swipe of its cards, thus acting as a toll road that generates a steady stream of ever-growing revenue and profits as more transactions shift from cash and check to cards. While there have been many reasons to fear that the business could only get worse, most obviously when the Durbin Amendment put a legal cap on debit card fees in 2010, these issues proved to be mere bumps on the road to Mastercard's $133 billion valuation. Image source: Getty Images. When Alphabet (then known as Google) filed its S-1 with the intention to go public in 2004, it had all the makings of a company that was trying way too hard to be different. The S-1 included an ""owner's manual"" for its shareholders that explained how it wanted its investors to view the company. A snippet of that owner's manual appears below: Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one. Throughout Google's evolution as a privately held company, we have managed Google differently. We have also emphasized an atmosphere of creativity and challenge, which has helped us provide unbiased, accurate and free access to information for those who rely on us around the world. Creativity? Challenge? Didn't they understand that investors only cared about profits? The company decided to flip the script on the IPO process, choosing to sell shares through an unconventional Dutch auction. Its odd corporate culture was evident in its IPO filing. Google, which is named after a ""googol,"" or a number equal to 1 followed by 100 zeros, chose to sell 14.159265 million shares in its IPO. That number refers to the eight digits that follow the decimal place in the mathematical pi -- 3.14159265. As for the maximum amount of money it wanted to raise, it pinned the number at $2.718281828 billion, a reference to the constant ""e"" in mathematics. The size of the offering puzzled analysts who followed the company, who suspected Alphabet would use the proceeds to buy another web business of significant size. (Its most significant acquisition after its IPO was YouTube, which it acquired more than two years after going public.) GOOGL data by YCharts. At the reduced offering price of $85 per share, Alphabet was priced at more than 100 times its 2003 earnings. But that price ultimately proved cheap. It opened at a price 17% higher than its IPO price of $85 per share, closing with a one-day gain of 18%. It reached a closing low in the next month that followed, but after that, shares never traded at a discount to their opening price. In fact, shares only once ended a calendar year at a lower price than at the beginning of the year, and that was in 2008, when virtually every stock cratered in value. The social networking company was the first big tech IPO since Google, and the hoopla surrounding its debut on public exchanges echoed the hysteria of the 1990s dot-com boom. Ordinary investors who couldn't tell the difference between an income statement and a balance sheet, and who learned to distrust their brokers after the financial crisis, were now clamoring to get shares in Wall Street's most anticipated IPO. That set off some alarm bells. FB data by YCharts. You may have seen Facebook's IPO as the ultimate sign of a bubble in technology valuations. The first page of its S-1 filing referred to the 2.7 billion ""likes and comments"" on the website each day. That had an eerie resemblance to the dot-com boom, where start-ups were valued based on ""hits"" and ""eyeballs"" perusing their pages on any given day. Critics asked how Facebook wasn't another iteration of Friendster or Myspace, two early social media flameouts. Why should Facebook sell for more than a century of earnings at its then-current run-rate, given that most social media sites struggled to remain relevant for a fraction of a decade? Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, quickly became a punching bag for Wall Street, as he wore a hoodie and jeans to meet with analysts and investors who dressed in their very best suits. One analyst slammed him for his appearance: Mark and his signature hoodie: He's actually showing investors he doesn't care that much; he's going to be him. I think that's a mark of immaturity. I think that he has to realize he's bringing investors in as a new constituency right now, and I think he's got to show them the respect that they deserve because he's asking them for their money. Zuckerberg was going to be him, that's for sure. Just one month before its planned IPO, Facebook acquired Instagram, a company that had just 13 employees and no real revenue model, for cool billion dollars. Generally, companies tend to shy away from big deals before going public, so as not to give the appearance that the company will use its publicly traded stock as an endless source of currency to pay for transformative acquisitions. Few batted an eye at Facebook's strange behavior. Facebook originally filed for an IPO that would price its shares at $28 to $35. Then it filed to sell 25% more shares due to high demand. Two days before its IPO, it raised the target range to $34 to $38 per share. This was, according to many observers (myself included), a sign of pure irrationality. Facebook, which was expected to trade at 11 a.m., didn't start trading until 11:30 a.m. due to technical problems. The stock finally opened for trading at $42 per share, 50% higher than the bottom of its earlier range. Then it all came crashing down. Two weeks after its listing, Facebook had lost nearly a quarter of its value. This marked the ultimate ""I told you so"" moment for its detractors, who were later proven wrong. Dead wrong. Facebook's Instagram acquisition easily earns a spot in one of the greatest acquisitions of all time. And its ad-driven business is perhaps one of the very best. Last year, Facebook generated an astonishing $62.23 of revenue per user in the U.S. and Canada, nearly 360% more than the $13.58 in revenue it generated per user in 2012, helped by a mobile business that few people believed in at the time of its IPO. Long-term studies regularly show that IPOs generally underperform the average for periods as long as five years after initial listing. Conventional wisdom is likely right about why IPOs underperform: Companies choose when to go public, and are unlikely to sell out on terms that are more favorable for the buyer than the seller. Admittedly, it's difficult to draw the line on what defines the ""best"" IPOs. Should it be one-year performance, or 10-year performance? Should companies that list at $10 million valuations be put in the same group as those that list as billion-dollar behemoths? Ultimately, I settled on Mastercard, Alphabet, and Facebook for the simple reason that they have all trumped the market's return, and did so from a less-than-privileged position. Each company on this list was a billion-dollar company at the time of the IPO, and each one had plenty of detractors (myself included) who believed that their IPO prices represented a top, rather than a bottom. Time proved what these businesses were truly worth. ","

Despite a last-minute minor sell-off late Friday, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to post first-half 2017 gains of 8.2% and 8%, respectively, which is a phenomenal six months for investors. Further, there was some positive economic data out of Chicago. The Chicago Business Barometer, a regional index of business conditions in the Chicago area, rose from May's 59.4 reading up to 65.7 during June. While those numbers may seem arbitrary, June marked the highest level in over three years, which emphasizes that the U.S. economy is humming along nicely. There were many more intriguing things in the markets this week than Chicago data -- here are some highlights. There is an incredible amount of work that goes into becoming a public company. Just valuing and correctly pricing your company's stock to persuade investors that the business story is one worth buying into required an immense amount of time, effort, and preparation. Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN) had been preparing and filed its original S-1 documentation with the SEC at the beginning of the month, right before Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) bombshell acquisition of Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM). The well-known meal-kit delivery service then amended its S-1 with the SEC to adjust its stock offering price range from between $15 and $17 to between $10 and $11 -- and nothing shows confidence like a stock shedding 35% of its value before it even goes public. Image source: Getty Images. While the meal-delivery concept is popular, there are relatively no barriers to entry, and there is already a long list of competitors in the space taking similar approaches. Further, with Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, it's eyeballing the same target consumer. ""It's a very high-end, desirable customer base, but it is very limited,"" Kurt Jetta, chief executive officer of retail and consumer-analytics provider Tabs Analytics, told Bloomberg in an interview. ""They are both just clawing for that share of the wallet, and now you'll have a stronger presence from Amazon-Whole Foods."" Despite competition, the company posted a 133% revenue increase in 2016, up to $795.4 million. However, the top line during the first quarter slowed to 42% growth. Sure, that's still a strong pace, but the significant deceleration leaves investors skeptical about how much room there is to grow in this market. Blue Apron, like many companies going public, isn't yet profitable, and the industry will probably need some consolidation to entice investors to buy into the story -- but Amazon's entry into the grocery business comes at the worst time for Blue Apron. The auto industry is accelerating toward a future of driverless car technology. It's one of the most exciting times in the industry in decades, as automakers and tech companies combine to completely change the way we think about vehicles and travel. But this week brought us a partnership that nobody saw coming: Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Waymo division and Avis Budget Group (NASDAQ:CAR). Avis started the week announcing its agreement with Waymo, Alphabet's driverless-car program, to offer fleet support and maintenance services for Waymo's self-driving program through its network of Avis Car Rental and Budget Car Rental locations in the Phoenix area. Although the two companies are almost polar opposites, the agreement does make sense for both parties. Consider that Waymo gains physical access to a wide-reaching network of roughly 11,000 store locations capable of maintenance in 25 countries, which could come in handy if Waymo expands the reach of its driverless testing. On the flip side, Avis' rental business has been struggling. That's no secret, and management's task has been focused on creating new revenue streams. That's one reason Avis now owns Zipcar and is focused on creating mobility businesses, and this development with Waymo and its parent Alphabet gives it a serious name brand and credibility in the rapidly evolving driverless-car arena. Avis is serious about its enhanced mobility projects, and it has to be to keep investors around, predicting that it has a $50 million to $100 million opportunity over the next five years in the space. It also anticipates its margin growth to come from such programs, aiming to grow its margins from roughly 10% to between 13% to 15% over the same five-year timespan. Of course, these mobility ambitions are much easier said than done, and investors have been quick to sell Avis shares. The stock is down more than 50% over the past three years. Avis has a long battle ahead of it. On the other hand, this is a very smart development for the company, and it gives investors a fighting chance as the auto industry accelerates toward a wildly different future. ","
      
    What Investors Missed in the Market Last Week -- The Motley Fool

Chris Neiger,07062017,Fool,06292017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. We're only halfway through 2017, and this year has already been a big one for emerging technologies. While there are lots of cool things happening in the tech industry, three specific trends are outpacing nearly everything else: self-driving cars, artificial intelligence (AI), and virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR). Some of the trends focus on digital services and software (as opposed to devices), and some are already having a transformative impact on how people experience technology and how businesses sell products -- but all are likely to add massive value to their respective markets. Here are some of the key players investors should be watching. Data source: Yahoo Finance. Admittedly, some of these companies are making big waves in multiple trends this year, but I'm highlighting one or two key players in each space. Additionally, you can find many more companies that are making big plays in autonomous vehicles, AR/VR, and AI, but the companies listed here are each dominating in such a way as to build up their competitive advantages. Image source: Pexels. While driverless cars haven't taken to the road en masse just yet, we've still seen lots of huge moves in this space. One of the most visible was Alphabet's Google spinning out its driverless car division into its own company, called Waymo, just two weeks before the new year began. Since then, Waymo has announced a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to test its technology in 600 of the company's vans and has set up a free riding program in Arizona for people to sign up to use the vehicles for their everyday commuting needs. Waymo is aiming to eventually earn revenue from its technology through autonomous-vehicle rental services and by licensing its technology to automakers. Waymo gets most of the attention these days, but it's actually an old automotive paragon that's leading the driverless revolution: Ford. The company is currently building out its autonomous-car fleet from 30 to 90 vehicles by the end of this year and is even revamping one of its factories so it can assemble driverless cars. These moves come as Ford is investing $1 billion in an artificial intelligence company, Argo AI, over the next five years. Argo is building Ford's driverless car system so that the automaker can release fully autonomous vehicles by 2021. Ford's commitment to driverless car technologies was pushed forward recently when Jim Hackett, formerly the head of the company's Smart Mobility division, was named as Ford's new CEO in May. Both Ford and Alphabet are betting on the growing driverless car market that will be worth an estimated $77 billion by 2035. But they're also betting on the shared mobility market -- where people rent out driverless vehicles -- which Morgan Stanley predicts will be worth $2.6 trillion by 2030. Machine learning has quickly become a buzzword this year, and investors should pay attention. As part of the broader artificial intelligence (AI) market, machine learning is already transforming how companies process information. Case in point, here's what Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos said earlier this year in his investor note: But much of what we do with machine learning happens beneath the surface. Machine learning drives our algorithms for demand forecasting, product search ranking, product and deals recommendations, merchandising placements, fraud detection, translations, and much more. Though less visible, much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type -- quietly but meaningfully improving core operations. Based on Bezos' own words, machine learning is influencing nearly everything the company does, including its fast-growing Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS now offers machine-learning services like image analysis, natural language processing, and speech generation for apps and services hooked into Amazon's cloud service. The broader AI market is growing rapidly, and Tractica estimates that AI-specific revenues will pop from less than $1.4 billion in 2016 to $59.8 billion by 2025. There have been too many big moves in the virtual reality and augmented reality space in 2017 to ignore. One of the first came at Facebook's F8 conference back in May, where the company showed off a slew of new augmented reality features for its flagship Facebook app. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been calling VR the next potential computing platform for a while now, and the company took another step in that direction when it showed off its Spaces app at F8. The app lets people interact with their Facebook friends in a VR environment; it's in beta mode right now. The company has also launched new features in its flagship Facebook app to bring AR filters to the platform and allow developers to create their own with the company's AR Studio. Aside from Facebook, Apple is also making some big moves in the AR space. Apple unveiled a new AR software development kit (SDK) at its recent Worldwide Developers Conference. The new SDK means developers will be able to create AR features and apps for iOS 11. That's important because it means that once Apple updates its software on millions of devices, it'll create the largest AR platform and could spark more adoption for the technology. That's particularly notable as Apple is rumored to be working on its own AR headset or pair or glasses. UBS analyst Steven Milunovich believes Apple might use the iPhone to process all the AR data for its glasses -- essentially doing all the heavy lifting for image processing -- and use the glasses as a catalyst for more iPhone sales. There's still plenty of time in the year for more tech trends to emerge, but I think it's more likely that we'll see these companies build out these trends even further. Investors should remember that there are plenty of other companies that are making big strides in driverless cars, artificial intelligence, and AR and VR -- but the above companies are clear leaders in the space and will likely remain such for years to come.

    3 Tech Trends That Have Dominated 2017 So Far -- The Motley Fool

  "
Danny Vena,07062017,Fool,06292017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The key to successful investing is elusive for some, but I believe it boils down to two things: buying shares in quality companies and holding those shares through both the triumphs and failures that occur during the life of every company. The hardest part of this process can be resisting the temptation to sell -- for a variety of reasons. When doubt or uncertainty regarding the future hits, or the stock price has doubled (or even tripled) in a short period of time, many investors see an opportunity to cut their losses, or lock in profits. There isn't anything wrong with that, but I believe that the path to significant gains remains holding for the long term. This isn't merely a mental exercise. I've held each of these companies for at least three years -- and some for much, much longer. Here's why I believe I will be holding The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) indefinitely. These stocks represent great opportunities over the long term. Image source: Getty Images. Nobody has mastered the art of leveraging intellectual property better than Disney, and that's why I've been a shareholder for more than eight years. The company already had one of the largest and best-loved collections of characters in the world, and that was before it purchased Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. Disney has been making hit movies for decades, but that's just the beginning of the process. The characters from the movies find their way into toys, apparel, and household goods, while becoming attractions at the company's multiple theme parks and staples on its broadcast and cable networks. Every company faces a period of uncertainty and Disney is no different. Investors have increasingly focused on the loss of subscribers at ESPN, the company's flagship sports network, but I believe they are placing far too much weight on the issue. Even in the face of declining subscribers, Disney grew revenue 6% last year to a record $55.6 billion year over year, while earnings increased 12% to a record $9.4 billion. Flat results in the media networks segment -- where ESPN revenue is located -- was more than covered by impressive growth resulting from hit movies and increased visits to its theme parks. Alphabet is primarily known for its ubiquitous search engine, but the company offers investors so much more, which is why I've owned shares for more than three years. Its YouTube service has over 1.5 billion daily active users, and is a plentiful source of new advertising revenue. Android is the most widely used mobile operating system in the world, which provides a large user base for the company's continued growth in other areas. Google has made significant advances in artificial intelligence, a field which is only in its infancy, and its recently released Google Home speaker is quickly emerging as a serious contender to take the crown from Amazon.com, Inc.'s Echo family of smart speakers. The company's Waymo self-driving car unit is arguably the most advanced program of its kind, and its partnership in ride-hailing could provide a glimpse of the future. These emerging technologies are not yet producing significant income for Alphabet, but they lay the foundation for future growth. Last year, Alphabet increased its revenue to over $90 billion, up 20% over the prior year and net income that grew 23% year over year. This is phenomenal growth for a company its size. Combine that with the multiple platforms for future opportunities and you can see why I don't expect I'll ever be selling shares of the search giant. Netflix was the pioneer of online streaming and has come a long way from the familiar red envelopes that delivered DVDs by mail. After perfecting its streaming model in the U.S., Netflix took its show on the road, introducing its fare to over 200 countries around the world. The company now boasts over 100 million subscribers worldwide and that number continues to grow. Some investors are concerned about the increasing obligations the company incurs to develop new shows and the resulting negative cash flow, but its growing library of original content attracts new subscribers, which funds new content, resulting in a virtuous cycle that should continue to fuel growth. The company also has a potential billion-dollar opportunity selling merchandise related to its hit shows. In the last year, Netflix generated $8.3 billion in streaming revenue, an increase of 35% year over year, and grew its subscriber base to 94 million, a 25% increase over the prior year. The company also achieved profitability ahead of schedule from its worldwide expansion and continues to expand its local content offerings. Netflix was one of my very first investments and the largest single holding in my portfolio. I've held the stock for nearly a decade, and I don't plan on parting with any shares for the foreseeable future. ","
      
    3 Stocks I'm Never Selling -- The Motley Fool

  "
Leo Sun,07062017,Fool,06292017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) investors probably know that the telecom giant evolved from the AT&T's (NYSE:T) forced divestment of the Bell Operating Companies in the 1980s. Bell Atlantic, one of the seven ""Baby Bells"", merged with a few other Bells to become ""Verizon"" -- a portmanteau of veritas (Latin for ""truth"") and horizon -- in 2000. Verizon subsequently became the largest wireless carrier in the U.S. Over the past two years, it dramatically reduced its wireline presence, shuttered its public cloud business, and aggressively expanded into the online media space by gobbling up AOL and Yahoo's internet businesses. Source: Getty. Today, let's examine five lesser-known facts about Verizon which might change your overall perception of the evolving telecom company. Newer investors might think that Verizon always owned Verizon Wireless. However, that business was actually founded as a joint venture between Verizon and British telco Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) in 1999. In 2014, Verizon paid a whopping $130 billion to acquire Vodafone's 45% stake. However, that buyout increased Verizon's debt, reduced its free cash flow, and doubled its exposure to the saturated wireless market. Last quarter, Verizon posted its first-ever decline in wireless subscribers -- making the intelligence of that deal seem questionable. To offset that softness, Verizon is investing in the Internet of Things (IoT) market. Verizon's IoT business generated nearly $1 billion in revenue last year, a drop in the pond relative to its total revenue of $126 billion, but still an indication that it's reaching drones, connected cars, wearables, and other IoT gadgets. In the drone market, Verizon developed new long-range autonomous drone applications with Sierra Wireless and American Aerospace Technologies, a drone monitoring partnership with NASA, and launched its new ThingSpace IoT platform for connected devices. It also acquired Skyward, a drone management start-up, earlier this year. That start-up makes a suite of tools for tracking drones, handling pilot records, and organizing administrative paperwork. That's also why Verizon acquired Telogis -- a developer of cloud-based telematics, compliance, and navigation systems used by major automakers and telcos -- last year. That purchase helps Verizon connect to vehicle fleets and gather data from their routes. It also enhances its own Verizon Telematics business, which is used in over 40 countries. Verizon also previously launched Hum, a two-piece hardware system which connects any old car manufactured since 1996 to Verizon's network. Hum also adds diagnostics and telematics functions to the tethered mobile app, which essentially turns any car into a ""connected"" one. Those moves lay down the foundations for fully autonomous drones and cars to travel across Verizon's wireless networks in the near future -- which could cause widespread paradigm shifts across multiple industries. AT&T and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) have repeatedly opposed ""One Touch Make Ready"" rules, which allow ISPs to attach their own wires on utility poles themselves without waiting for other providers to move their own. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, which is expanding its Fiber network nationwide, claims that AT&T and Comcast aren't violating the rules by refusing to move their wires to make room for Google Fiber's. Verizon also supports the enforcement of those rules, because it plans to roll out a lot of new fiber to support its wireless network in the near future. In a blog post and FCC filing, Verizon complains that it takes ""six months to a year"" and ""piles of paperwork"" to get a new attachment approved and placed on a pole. If the FCC sides with Verizon over AT&T and Comcast, Google Fiber might experience an unexpected growth spurt. In a previous article, I discussed how Starbucks' (NASDAQ: SBUX) liberal statements often antagonized conservative customers -- yet had no long-term impact on its revenue growth. On the other side of that coin is Verizon, with its staunchly conservative views often casting a shadow over its core businesses. Back in 2007, Verizon blocked text messages from a pro-choice group. In 2009, it sponsored a controversial climate change denier rally organized by a pro-coal group in West Virginia. Three years ago, it killed off its own fledgling tech news site, Sugarstring, reportedly because it published too many stories on net neutrality and surveillance -- both hot button topics for its parent company. Verizon's near-term future still relies heavily on the expansion of its wireless customer base and its ability to digest AOL and Yahoo's online business. However, the financial impact of the Vodafone deal can still be felt today, its expansion into new IoT markets can reduce its dependence on smartphones, and the enforcement of ""One Touch Make Ready"" rules could help it expand its wireless infrastructure to meet next-gen 5G needs.

    5 Things You Didn't Know About Verizon Communications Inc. -- The Motley Fool

  "
Sean Williams,07062017,Fool,06292017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. I've been alive for nearly 37 years, and for as long as I can remember, the investing world has revolved around the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI). The Dow, as it's more commonly known, isn't America's oldest index. That title goes to the Dow Jones Transportation Index, which also happened to be created by Charles Dow. Nevertheless, it was the Dow, currently featuring a complement of 30 U.S. multinational companies from a variety of industries, that grew into the index widely followed by retail investors and Wall Street bigwigs. Earlier this year, you couldn't read a financial newspaper without a back-and-forth discussion as to when the Dow would eclipse the 20,000-point mark. Shortly after the Dow did eclipse 20,000, attention turned to when it'd hit the 21,000-point threshold, albeit the hoopla surrounding 21,000 was tame compared to 20,000. This pattern of milestone-breaking, and the focus on what are perceived to be America's most prominent multinational companies, is what keeps the Dow relevant. Image source: Getty Images. But I have news for Wall Street and retail investors: It's time to let your love affair with the Dow go. What was once the most esteemed of investing indexes is now as outdated as the rotary phone. Here are five reasons to stop paying close attention to the Dow and instead make the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) your go-to market barometer. Arguably the biggest issue with the Dow Jones is that it's a price-weighted index. This means that companies with a higher share price, not a higher market capitalization, hold more weighting in the index, which makes no sense. The Dow Jones divisor, which helps determine what each ""point"" is worth for the 30 companies that are represented in the index, changes occasionally to reflect stock splits and the addition and removal of companies from the index. The S&P 500, which is weighted by market cap, makes sense. Bigger companies should have more influence over the index, regardless of their share price. Image source: Getty Images. Another issue is that the Dow isn't all that representative of the U.S. stock market. Based on its closing price on June 29, the total market capitalization of the companies in the index was about $6.37 trillion. That's certainly no small sum of value, but it is dwarfed in comparison to the S&P 500. Based on the S&P 500's June 29 close, it had a total market capitalization of $21.8 trillion, or approximately 3.4 times higher than the Dow. In other words, if you follow the Dow, you may not be getting a complete look at true stock market and economic health. The S&P 500, which actually has a hair over 500 companies in the index, gives you a broader look at the health of the market. To build upon the previous point, the Dow Jones also doesn't fully represent all of the stock market's sectors. As of mid-October 2016, nearly 20% of the Dow Jones' market value was made up of industrial sector stocks, while there was absolutely no representation from the utilities and real estate sectors. By comparison, the S&P 500 had a tamer 9.7% weighted to industrials, and gave utilities and real estate respective weightings of 3.3% and 3%. In short, with the S&P 500 you get a more realistic sector-weighting distribution because there are far more data points to count, whereas the Dow only utilizes 30 multinational companies in its index, minimizing the opportunity for sector diversity. Image source: Getty Images. Further building the case against the Dow, some very prominent companies are missing from the index. For example, Alphabet, the parent company of dominant search engine Google, is the second-largest company by market cap in the U.S., and it's not part of the Dow. E-commerce powerhouse Amazon.com is the fourth-largest company by market cap, and it, too, isn't in the Dow. Just heading down the list of the top 10 largest companies, Facebook, Berkshire Hathaway, and Alibaba Group aren't in the Dow, either. What about the S&P 500, you ask? With the exception of Alibaba, which has only been a publicly traded company for less than three years, every other company among the stocks with the largest market cap is in the S&P 500. Once again, it's far more representative of the actual health of the stock market than the Dow. Lastly, there's a pretty decent chance that your investment portfolio is probably going to perform very differently from the Dow Jones, which again is only made up of a small handful of U.S. multinationals. Comparing the performance of your portfolio to the Dow is akin to comparing an apple to an orange. The S&P 500, on the other hand, has enough market-cap and sector diversity that its movements should be more representative of how the overall market is performing. This isn't to say that your investment portfolio is going to mirror the S&P 500, but it gives you a proper benchmark that you should be regularly trying to outperform. Look, the Dow is overflowing with history, and no one can take that away. But that's exactly what the index has become: a historic novelty. It's time for Wall Street to end its love affair with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and proclaim the S&P 500 as the one true market barometer. ","

,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Intel Corp on Tuesday announced a new line of microprocessors for data centers, setting up a battle with Advanced Micro Devices and others for the lucrative business of supplying the chips that power cloud computing. The new Xeon Scalable Processor chips provide far greater support for next-generation computing applications such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars, said Naveen Rao, vice president of Intel’s artificial intelligence products group, in an interview with Reuters. The chips are aimed at companies including Alphabet’s Google, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc  and others that operate data centers with thousands of computers, both to power their own services and to provide computing horsepower for customers who don’t want to own and maintain their own computer systems. Google Cloud Platform was the first data center to adopt the new Intel processors. Paul Nash, project manager for Google Compute Engine, called the deal an “expansion and deepening of our partnership” with Intel. But Intel will face stiff competition from historic rival AMD, which recently launched its own next-generation data center processor. The big Internet companies are also doing more of their own hardware design and experimenting with chips based on technology from ARM Holdings and others, partly as a way of pushing Intel to keep prices in line. Martin Reynolds, an analyst at Gartner, said the new Intel processor is a step up from its previous generation with better power efficiency, improvement on artificial intelligence workload and more advanced storage. Reynolds noted that the biggest risk for Intel may be its dependence on a relatively small number of big data center operators. “The challenge now is so much of our their work is going to these big internet guys,” he said, and thus demand for chips is subject to how successful the companies are in the fierce battle for customers who are moving their computing to the cloud.

General Motors Co’s estimated $1 billion acquisition of self-driving vehicle company Cruise Automation and Uber Technologies Inc’s [UBER.UL] purchase of self-driving truck startup Otto have accelerated this trend. In the self-driving vehicle arena, the Autotech Ventures fund will focus on companies developing specific technology, “rather than a jack of all trades,” Garcia said. Autotech Ventures has invested in Deepscale, a startup developing technology that processes the information a car gets from sensors about the surrounding environment but is not trying to build an entire operating system for an autonomous vehicle.

,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - SoundCloud, the world’s biggest music-streaming service, is still struggling to find a business model - it now has enough cash to last until fourth quarter, after laying off 40 percent of its staff, a representative said on Thursday. The Berlin-based start-up is different from rivals Apple, Spotify and Amazon in that it relies more on amateur musicians, for whom it provides a rare platform, and less on major commercial artists. But like them, it has yet to turn a profit. The big music labels on which most of the services depend - themselves under pressure from the shift to digital music - strike hard bargains. And SoundCloud - which said three years ago it had an audience of 175 million, a figure it has not updated - lacks either Spotify’s large base of paying subscribers or the deep pockets of Apple and Amazon that can subsidize their music services. Last week, SoundCloud said it was firing 173 staffers and closing its London and San Francisco offices to focus on Berlin and New York. “We’re on our path to profitability and in control of SoundCloud’s independent future,” co-founder Alex Ljung wrote in a blog post. Technology website TechCrunch reported, however, that staff were told at a meeting this week that the layoffs only saved the company enough cash to hold out until the fourth quarter. A spokeswoman the SoundCloud declined to comment on the TechCrunch article in depth. She did say, “SoundCloud is fully funded into the fourth quarter. We continue to be confident the changes made last week put us on our path to profitability and ensure SoundCloud’s long-term viability.” She declined to comment on funding beyond the end of the year. The news has reignited speculation that SoundCloud will be acquired by a rival. It was targeted by Spotify last year in a bid that was later aborted. Spotify, recently valued at $13 billion, is now planning a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange later this year or in early 2018, sources told Reuters in May. “The biggest problem I see is that the financial problems will absorb much of management’s time in trying to raise more money, meaning that the real problems of the business go unaddressed,” independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note. “Of all the potential suitors, I think Google makes the most sense,” he said, noting SoundCloud’s similarity to Google’s YouTube in its focus on user-generated content. “Google will probably be most able to monetize what SoundCloud cannot.” SoundCloud, which was launched in 2008 and has never said how many paying subscribers it has, last month launched a budget subscription package in the hope of persuading more listeners to convert from the free service. SoundCloud raised $100 million last June from a group of investors including Twitter, valuing the company at roughly $700 million, according to Re/code. In March, it raised a further $70 million in debt from Ares Capital, Kreos Capital and Davidson Technology to meet its expected 2.5 times year-on-year revenue growth in 2017, a company spokeswoman said. Co-founder Alex Ljung said in a public interview at the Tech Open Air conference in Berlin this week that the company was fundraising, although he declined to comment on a rumor it was trying to raise $250 million.

 ,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"Supported by Hundreds of companies coordinated a huge online protest on Wednesday against the Federal Communications Commission’s plan to scrap net neutrality rules. By Cecilia Kang For one day, tech companies big and small united on a common cause: to protest the government’s rollback of rules for the internet. Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon and hundreds of smaller tech companies coordinated a huge online protest on Wednesday against the Federal Communications Commission’s plan to scrap net neutrality rules, which guarantee that broadband service providers treat all internet traffic equally. The tech companies want the rules to remain to protect them from unfair treatment by broadband providers like Comcast or AT&T, which could create faster delivery lanes for some websites and not others. Silicon Valley approached this fight against the Trump administration’s plans its own way — by taking to the internet. Some of the biggest users of internet lanes were at the forefront. Netflix, which depends on free and open internet lanes to transmit its streaming video, had a small banner ad on its home page reading “Protect Internet Freedom. Defend Net Neutrality. Take Action,” which linked to the net neutrality information page of its trade group, the Internet Association. (The banner didn’t appear on the app for television viewers.) Twitter promoted the hashtag topic #NetNeutrality on its home page and app and posted a link to a blog post with an explainer on the issue and a direct link to comment on the F.C.C. website. Those who use Reddit, the online forum, were greeted with a pop-up promotion that gave its take on why net neutrality is important. Amazon’s gaming site Twitch also promoted its protest of the F.C.C. plan with a banner ad on its site, a post on Twitter, and an electronic letter to users explaining the issue. Expedia, the online travel company, had banners across all its sites, including Expedia.com, VBRO.com, Hotels.com, and HomeAway.com. Some tech companies did not make their displeasure as overt on their home pages. On Amazon’s home page, the company placed a “Net Neutrality? Learn More” ad between promotions for a streaming Starz show and Amazon’s Prime Music service. Google, one of the biggest supporters of net neutrality, also was not in-your-face with the issue. The company posted a link to a blog on Twitter warning that the rules were in danger and that people should make their voices heard by telling the F.C.C. to stop its rollback. Facebook didn’t promote the issue on its site but chose to speak through its leaders, with posts by chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. Some smaller websites were among the most vocal in online protests. Etsy, the online market for crafts, had a major promotion on its home page with a tool that let visitors directly send comments to lawmakers and the F.C.C.

Arjun Kharpal,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"More than 80,000 websites including giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Google, are taking part in an online protest on Wednesday against the U.S. telecoms regulator's plan to roll back net neutrality rules. Under the Barack Obama administration in 2015, rules were put in place that meant internet service providers (ISPs) such as Comcast, Charter, and AT&T, had to treat all internet content equally. Essentially these ISPs are not allowed to block content or speed up or slow down data from certain websites. This principle of net neutrality came under threat in May after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is headed up by Ajit Pai who was appointed by President Donald Trump, voted to reverse rules put in place under Obama. The FCC argues that this will boost investment in new technology by removing regulation. But internet companies have been vocal in their opposition to Pai's plans. That's why on Wednesday, many of these services are planning an online protest called the ""Day of Action"". Among the companies taking part are Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Reddit, Netflix, Airbnb, and Spotify. ""The FCC needs to listen to the voices of real people who will be affected by this attack on net neutrality protections – not just lobbyists from telecom companies in pursuit of more power,"" Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, one of the organizations behind the protests said in a statement on Tuesday. ""The goal of the protest … is to ensure that ordinary people have a voice and are heard by decision makers in Washington, D.C. No one – regardless of their political affiliation – wants their cable company to control what they can see and do on the Internet, or to charge extra fees to access the content they want."" These sites are planning to show messages on their homepages speaking out against the FCC's plans. Signs like the one below will begin to appear on some websites urging people to send a letter to the FCC. Twitter meanwhile has put out a blog post encouraging people to use the hashtag #NetNeutrality. ""The FCC should abandon its misguided effort to obviate all the work that has been done on behalf of all Internet users,"" Lauren Culbertson, public policy manager at Twitter, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.

Karen Gilchrist,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"The news industry is to band together to seek a limited antitrust exemption from Congress in an effort to fend off growing competition from Facebook and Google. Traditional competitors including The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, as well as a host of smaller print and online publications, will temporarily set aside their differences this week and appeal to federal lawmakers to let them negotiate collectively with the technology giants to safeguard the industry. Antitrust laws traditionally prevent companies from forming such an alliance which could see them becoming over-dominant in a particular sector. However, the media companies will be hoping that Congress will look favorably on a temporary exemption, particularly giving the recent clampdown on the technology industry which saw Google slapped with a $2.7 billion antitrust fine. The campaign is led by newspaper industry trade group News Media Alliance and it is intended to help the industry collaborate in order to regain market share from Facebook and Google, which have been swooping in on newspapers' distribution and advertising revenues. The two companies currently command 70 percent of the $73 billion digital advertising industry in the U.S., according to new research from the Pew Research Centre. Meanwhile, U.S. newspaper ad revenue in 2016 was $18 billion from $50 billion a decade ago. The News Media Alliance argue that, despite their growing dominance in news distribution, Facebook and Google lack the resources and ability to guarantee the accuracy of reporting upheld by reputable news associations. Facebook in particular came under fire during the 2016 U.S. presidential election when it failed to suitably monitor the news content on its platform and was seen to host unverified articles. ""(Facebook and Google) don't employ reporters: They don't dig through public records to uncover corruption, send correspondents into war zones, or attend last night's game to get the highlights. They expect an economically squeezed news industry to do that costly work for them,"" David Chavern, president and chief executive of the News Media Alliance, wrote in anopinion piece published Sunday in the Wall Street Journal. ""The only way publishers can address this inexorable threat is by banding together,"" he continued. ""If they open a unified front to negotiate with Google and Facebook — pushing for stronger intellectual-property protections, better support for subscription models and a fair share of revenue and data — they could build a more sustainable future for the news business."" Chavern added that antitrust laws are currently ""insulating"" Google and Facebook from market forces, but said that news publishers remain committed to ""unleashing those forces to defend their investments in great journalism."" When contacted by CNBC Monday, Facebook's head of news partnerships, Campbell Brown, said the business, which recently celebrated 2 billion users, was committed to aiding quality journalism. ""We're committed to helping quality journalism thrive on Facebook. We're making progress through our work with news publishers and have more work to do,"" Brown said via email. Google added that it wanted to support the news industry's continued transition towards digital. ""We want to help news publishers succeed as they transition to digital. In recent years we've built numerous specialized products and technologies, developed specifically to help distribute, fund, and support newspapers. This is a priority and we remain deeply committed to helping publishers with both their challenges, and their opportunities,"" a Google spokesperson told CNBC via email.

Jordan Novet,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"Alphabet has officially launched Gradient Ventures, a new firm within Google that will invest in early-stage artificial intelligence start-ups. The announcement on Tuesday is the latest sign of Alphabet's growing interest in AI, a futuristic technology that's also gaining significance at Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft.  Axios reported on the new program in May, but the details were not yet public. Gradient will invest in 10 to 15 deals this year and will typically commit $1 million to $8 million in each, said Anna Patterson, founder and managing director of the firm. ""If we're really going to help AI happen faster, we needed to be more involved in the community,"" said Patterson, who's spent about a decade at Google working on Android, search, advertising and AI.  ""That's why we decided to do this -- to spur innovation in the AI space."" But Gradient isn't just another Silicon Valley funding source for start-ups, or even a typical corporate venture capital group. Alphabet already has GV (formerly Google Ventures), which backs start-ups at all stages, and CapitalG (formerly Google Capital), which invests in later-stage companies. Gradient portfolio companies will have the opportunity to receive advanced AI training from Google. They can also have a Google engineer work onsite and provide assistance as needed for a set period of time, said Patterson. The details haven't been fully ironed out, but the idea is to have a Google engineer do a rotation for six months -- or perhaps longer if a project needs more time -- and potentially have the engineer split time across multiple portfolio companies. Patterson, who spent three years as co-founder and president of search start-up Cuil, said that Google engineers ""would love to have a super-productive break."" Another perk is that portfolio companies will be able to access vast swaths of training data that Google has accumulated to train their own AI systems. That's a meaningful perk for Cape, a start-up that runs an online service for remotely controlling drones. The additional data will help Cape in its security and asset inspection work, said Louis Gresham, the company's co-founder and operating chief. Google is the sole investor in Gradient. GV did 63 deals last year, while CapitalG did six, according to data from PitchBook. Ankit Jain and Shabih Rizvi are Gradient's other partners. While some start-ups will surely welcome the extra help that comes with having a Google engineer temporarily on board, others might be concerned about compromising their valuable intellectual property. Patterson stressed that there will be an agreement expressly forbidding Google employees from bringing that IP back in-house. And Patterson said that seasoned entrepreneurs are welcoming the Google help. ""The pitch has resonated more with more experienced entrepreneurs,"" she said.

Jordan Novet,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"Alphabet on Monday said it has kicked off a new research initiative aimed at improving human interaction with artificial intelligence systems. The People + AI Research (PAIR) program currently encompasses a dozen people who will collaborate with Googlers in various product groups — as well as outsiders like Harvard University professor Brendan Meade and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Hal Abelson. The research could eventually lead to refinements in the interfaces of the smarter components of some of the world's most popular apps. And Google's efforts here could inspire other companies to adjust their software, too. ""One of the things we're going to be looking into is this notion of explanation — what might be a useful on-time, on-demand explanation about why a recommendation system did something it did,"" Google Brain senior staff research scientist Fernanda Viegas told CNBC in an interview. The PAIR program takes inspiration from the concept of design thinking, which highly prioritizes the needs of people who will use the products being developed. While end users — such as YouTube's 1.5 billion monthly users — can be the target of that, the research is also meant to improve the experience of working with AI systems for AI researchers, software engineers and domain experts as well, Google Brain senior staff research scientist Martin Wattenberg told CNBC. The new initiative fits in well with Google's increasing focus on AI. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly said the world is transitioning from being mobile-first to AI-first, and the company has been taking many steps around that thesis. Recently, for example, Google formed a venture capital group to invest in AI start-ups. Meanwhile Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft have been active in AI in the past few years as well. As for design, that isn't new to Google, either. The company implemented a redesign for several of its apps in 2011 and in more recent years has been sprucing up many of its properties with its material design principles. And in 2016 John Maeda, then the design partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, pointed out in his annual report on design in technology that Google had been perceived as improving the most in design. What is new is that Googlers are trying to figure out how to improve design specifically for AI components. And that's important because AI is used in a whole lot of places around Google apps, even if you might not always realize it. Video recommendations in YouTube, translations in Google Translate, article suggestions in the Google mobile app and, yes, even Google search results are all enhanced with AI.

Anita Balakrishnan,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"After a series of twists and turns on Friday, Uber's legal struggle with Alphabet's Waymo just got much simpler — in a way. Indeed, in a new legal filing, Uber argues the fight basically comes down to one star engineer and his $120 million bonus from Alphabet — which he allegedly really, really wanted. The battle centers around Anthony Levandowski, who was deeply involved in Google's self-driving car initiative before leaving to found a start-up, Otto, which Uber later acquired. Waymo's lawyers have asserted that Levandowski stole 14,000-plus documents from Alphabet, and that Levandowski was already negotiating with Uber before he left Alphabet. The question now before the courts is whether Levandowski's documents, including Alphabet trade secrets, were used to develop Uber's self-driving cars. Levandowski was paid generously at Google, by a division that is now Alphabet's Waymo. He  collected $120 million from Google, despite involvement with at least one start-up that would ultimately compete with his employer, Waymo said. But Uber said on Friday that Levandowski downloaded the documents to compile extensive evidence that he deserved a bonus, and just happened to hang on to them. Indeed, Uber said that Levandowski admitted as much to former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and that the corresponding files were supposed to be destroyed during Uber's acquisition of Otto. ""Levandowski downloaded the files in connection with ensuring payment of his $120 million Google bonus,"" an Uber spokesperson said. ""Even if Levandowski did what Waymo says he did, he did it as a Google employee, for reasons unrelated to his future employment at Uber."" Uber has proposed a detailed line of questioning, with more than 10 questions directly related to how concerned Levandowski was about his bonus. To be sure, these allegations are just one side of the story.  Waymo labeled Uber's claim as fictitious, intended to distract people from Waymo's evidence showing Uber used Waymo's trade secrets. The timeline of when Levandowski downloaded the documents and when he stopped working at Waymo has also been under dispute — outlets like Bloomberg previously reported that Levandowski said he used the documents to work from home. ""We initiated legal action because we came across evidence showing stolen Waymo files made their way into Uber's technology, and despite Uber's attempt to distract with constantly changing storylines, Waymo has continued to build its case with more evidence uncovered during expedited discovery,"" a Waymo spokesperson said. Levandowski has invoked his Fifth Amendment rights throughout the process, and his lawyers were not immediately available for comment. Uber said it might not even call Levandowski as a witness during a trial. But Uber could depose Google founder Larry Page. Google parent Alphabet has already walked back most of its accusations against Uber, with only one piece of technology still under dispute. ""We found after fighting for discovery a device created by Anthony Levandowski at Uber that infringed Waymo patents,"" Waymo said. ""Uber has assured the court in statements made under penalty of perjury that it no longer uses and will not use that device, so we have narrowed the issues for trial by dismissing the patent claims as to that device, with the right to re-file suit if needed. ""We continue to pursue a patent claim against Uber's current generation device and our trade secret claims, which are not at all affected by this stipulated dismissal. We look forward to trial.""

Lora Kolodny,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"The moonshot factory formerly known as Google [X] revealed one of its secret projects today — Dandelion, a maker of geothermal systems for home use. The company ""graduated"" from X to operate as a standalone venture as of today. Dandelion co-founder and CEO Kathy Hannun told CNBC that her start-up has raised $2 million in seed funding in a round led by Collaborative Fund, and joined by ZhenFund and Borealis Ventures. Alphabet, credited with starting the company, also holds equity in Dandelion. Hannun explained how the company's systems work: ""Geothermal systems like ours let you pump heat out of your house, into the ground. This takes advantage of the fact that the ground is always around fifty to fifty-five degrees. So you don't have to pump heat against its natural gradient, like you do if you're running a conventional air conditioner on a hot day, blowing hot air out of the house into a very hot atmosphere, outside."" The main innovation she and her co-founder James Quazi developed concerns the installation of geothermal systems, she said. ""The hardest part of installing a geothermal system used to be getting these things called the 'loops' into the ground. Until today people used tools like they would use to dig a well, general excavation tools to do this. We developed a much more efficient means of installation, which makes the whole thing relatively inexpensive."" For now, Dandelion is selling its systems through installers to home owners in New York state. Why New York? There's a lot of variation in weather, for starters. Geothermal systems can be used for efficient heating or cooling, which makes them appealing versus separate heating and air conditioning systems. Additionally, New York is a densely populated state where an estimated 2 million homes still rely on oil or propane for temperature controls. Those are each more costly and polluting when compared to geothermal. Installation of a Dandelion system would cost a homeowner between $20,000 to $25,000 upfront, or between $160 to $180 a month over 20 years, the company said. ""For an average fuel oil homeowner in New York, switching to geothermal would save 110 tons of CO2 and $35,000 over 20 years,"" Hannun said. ""For the average propane home, the homeowner would save over 130 tons of CO2 and $63,000 over 20 years,"" she said. The start-up intends to use its funding to ramp up its production and sales of its systems in New York, and then to expand into new states, especially in the Northeast and Midwest. The company is the second to launch from X at Alphabet as an independent company. Earlier, X-born project Flux.io, which makes data sharing software for the buildings industry became a standalone, venture-backed startup. Other X affiliated projects have become part of Alphabet's own business, including G-cam which now comprises the camera technology within Pixel phones, and Verily, now part of Alphabet's life sciences initiatives.

AdvisorShares on Wednesday debuted its New Tech and Media ETF under the ticker FNG. The fund will initially track 28 ""disruptive innovators,"" the company said. The acronym FANG was created by CNBC's Jim Cramer and refers to four high-growth technology stocks: Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix and Google's parent, Alphabet. While the four stocks have soared, Wall Street has been jittery about them, with analysts raising concerns about the valuations of large-cap technology bellwethers. Talk about a FANG bubble is growing louder, with all four stocks up 20 percent or more this year. The fund holds 24 other ""similar-type companies,"" AdvisorShares said in a statement, such as Nvidia, Microsoft, and Broadcom. The ETF opened trading at around $20 per share, seeded with $2.5 million. ""Typically these high-performing technology and media leaders drive commerce and can outperform broad market benchmarks,"" AdvisorShares said. When asked whether the ETF's launch is calling the top for FANG, AdvisorShares CEO Noah Hamman said, ""I hope not.""

Emmie Martin,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"One day, Facebook employees will only have to cross the street to commute to the tech giant's Menlo Park headquarters. In a blog post on Friday, Facebook announced plans to turn the 56-acre Menlo Science & Technology Park it bought in 2015 into a company town, dubbed the Willow Campus. Located across the street from the company's current campus, it will include a grocery store, pharmacy and shopping center. ""Working with the community, our goal for the Willow Campus is to create an integrated, mixed-use village that will provide much needed services, housing and transit solutions as well as office space,"" Facebook writes. Of the 1,500 new housing units the company plans to build, 15 percent will be affordable, priced below the market rate. The village won't be comprised of only Facebook employees, either. Facebook will open up the units to the community at large,  Business Insider reports. Affordable housing is much needed in the Bay Area, where prices have reached such insane heights that some Facebook engineers reportedly asked Mark Zuckerberg for help paying rent and some Twitter employees earning $160,000 can feel like they're barely scraping by. Even some residents making six-figures can qualify as ""low-income"" and receive housing subsidies. ""These efforts complement our ongoing work to address the [housing] issue, including the  Catalyst Housing Fund for affordable housing we established in partnership with community groups to fund affordable housing for our local area,"" Facebook writes. It's worth noting, however, that prominent tech companies such as Facebook are in some ways responsible for the crisis they're now facing. As Quartz's Frederick Kuo reports, San Francisco's thriving technology industry has spurred economic growth, and the housing market can't keep up. ""The strength of recent job growth combined with policies that have traditionally limited housing development in the city and throughout the peninsula has proven to be a perfect recipe for an affordability crisis,"" Kuo writes. ""In 2015 alone,  the Bay Area added 64,000 in jobs; in the same year, only 5,000 new homes were built."" Another Silicon Valley heavyweight is attempting a solution as well. Google's parent company, Alphabet, is paying about $30 million to provide temporary, prefab housing for 300 of its employees. According to  The Wall Street Journal, Alphabet is making a significant investment in modular housing built and shipped in from elsewhere by the start-up Factory OS, because the current local offerings are so overpriced: ""San Francisco rents have jumped by almost 50 percent since 2010, while home prices have increased 98 percent since the bottom of the market in 2009."" But rents for Alphabet's apartments are expected to be more moderate. Factory OS founder and CEO Rick Holliday tells the Journal that ""a previous project that Holliday built using modular technology saved tenants $700 a month in rent because of reduced construction costs."" The concept of a company town is nothing new. These insular communities first began cropping up during the Industrial Revolution, as corporations such as Hershey chocolate and Corning glass tried to ""woo workers with fancy amenities,""  Smithsonian reports. While some company towns encapsulated the picturesque ""American Dream,"" others festered with poverty and abuse from bare-bones housing and harsh working conditions. In many textile, coal and steel towns, employees  earned company credit in place of actual wages, which was only valid for use in high-priced company stores. While modern-day examples of company towns can offer better conditions, it's still unclear if they're the answer to the housing crisis plaguing Silicon Valley.

Perhaps no company is more aware of how important advertising can be than Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. It will earn an estimated 78% of all search ad revenue this year -- or $28.5 billion -- according to eMarketer, and it's expected to grab 80% of the market by 2019. So, when Google talks about how it's working on new adverting opportunities -- this time within virtual reality (VR) -- it's worth paying attention. Image source: Google. The company posted on its Google Developer blog last week that it's already experimenting with how to serve up non-intrusive ads on its own Google Cardboard and Daydream View VR headsets, as well on the Samsung Gear VR. Here's a glimpse of one of the VR ads the company has already created. Screen capture of Google's VR ad testing. Image source: Google. The small, white dot in the video represents where a user is looking with their eyes, or where their hand gestures are moving. These actions are what trigger a small cube to open up and then start playing a video ad, which then offers the option to download an app. Google said on its blog that the trick to getting VR ads right is to make them non-disruptive to the user experience, and easy to implement for developers. ""So our first idea for a potential format presents a cube to users, with the option to engage with it and then see a video ad. By tapping on the cube or gazing at it for a few seconds, the cube opens a video player where the user can watch, and then easily close, the video,"" the company said. Google is in the process of opening up VR ad testing beyond its handful of initial partners, and is asking for more developers to sign up. The company also just released a new software development kit. Research firm Strategy Analytics says that Google dominated VR headset shipments in 2016 with a 69% market share, followed by Samsung's Gear VR, which had 17%. Here's how all the VR headset competitors stacked up last year: Image source: Strategy Analytics. Strategy Analytics expects the VR headset market to be worth more than $10 billion annually and reach an installed base of over half a billion units by 2022. Most of those units will be in the ultra-low price tier that Google's Cardboard and Daydream View headsets fall into. Google's new and most expensive Daydream View headset costs just $79. Dominating the mobile VR headset space is good, but Google's real advantages will come from getting users to watch more ads on the devices, and buy apps for them. Daydream apps are downloaded through the company's Google Play Store, just like Android's mobile apps, and Google will eventually earn money from them by taking a cut of the revenue earned by paid VR apps, and when users engage with video ads on their VR headsets. A recent App Annie report forecasts that Google Play revenue will jump from about $16 billion in 2016 to $42 billion in 2021. It's unclear right now how much of that app revenue will derive from VR ads, but Google's early forays into VR advertising should be seen as signs of things to come. The company has built out its search business with ads, gives its Android software away for free by using in-app purchases and advertising to pay for it. Expect to see it use all that experience to become a dominant force in virtual reality ads in the coming years. ","

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google both operate in the online arena and dominate in their core businesses -- Netflix in the realm of video streaming, and Google in the area of internet search. Each has also been a stellar performer and rewarded shareholders handsomely over the last several years. Google and Netflix both have their roots in Silicon Valley, were founded in the late 1990s, and have gone on to become household names. Still, these companies operate in very different spaces. Which is the better buy now? Or are they both great opportunities? Is Google or Netflix the better stock to own now? Image source: Getty Images. Netflix: Netflix became the worldwide leader in online streaming by deploying its video on demand in the U.S., perfecting it, and then expanding its service to 190 countries around the world in early 2016. That said, the company has barely scratched the surface in many of those markets and could foreseeably achieve penetration rates similar to those in its U.S. market. With 51 million subscribers out of 126 million U.S. households, this equates to a 40% penetration rate. Even excluding the few countries where Netflix streaming isn't available (China, Crimea, North Korea, and Syria), its subscriber base could grow to as many as 240 million worldwide. The company's cash flow will remain negative for some time while Netflix builds out its library of original content. Thereafter, decreasing incremental costs will kick in and a greater portion of revenue from each subscriber will become mostly profit. Netflix has also begun the process of licensing merchandise from its popular shows, potentially creating a billion-dollar opportunity in the process. Netflix's growth has been fueled by a virtuous cycle -- more and better content leads to more subscribers, and revenue from its growing subscriber base funds additional content. With its worldwide expansion well under way, this should continue for some time. In its most recent quarter, Netflix's revenue grew to $2.6 billion, an increase of 35% over the prior-year quarter, and posted net income of $178 million, a fivefold increase year over year. Alphabet: To understand how dominant Alphabet's Google is, consider that Google has become a verb. Advertising revenue from Google search and YouTube account for the majority of the company's sales, but Alphabet is investing heavily in a number of areas with an eye toward future growth. Alphabet is also one of the leaders in the emerging field of artificial intelligence (AI), resulting in gains in the areas of language processing, translation, and image recognition, among others. Each of these helps to improve Google's core search and provide tools for users of the company's Android operating system for smartphones. Alphabet has developed one of the leading self-driving car technologies with its Waymo division, and recently released its AI-based Home speaker powered by Google Assistant. At some point, Google's advertising revenue will top out, and Alphabet is betting on these initiatives to drive future results. To date, however, they have yet to produce quantifiable revenue. In Alphabet's most recent quarter, the company produced revenue of $24.75 billion, an increase of 22% over the prior-year quarter, while net income grew to $5.4 billion, an increase of 29% year over year. Both companies dominate in their core markets. It's still too early to determine how the success of non-core businesses will play out, and recent financial results are both stellar, so thus far, this is too close to call. Over the last year, both stocks have beat the broader market. Alphabet's stock has returned 29%, while Netflix shares have risen an incredible 51%. If you think investors have serious expectations baked into Netflix's stock price as a result, you'd be right. Based on its earnings over the last four quarters, Netflix currently trades at a nosebleed 190 times trailing earnings, while Alphabet has an earnings multiple of 31, making it a much better value. Looking to the future and the results aren't much different. Netflix's forward multiple is 142, compared to Alphabet's forward valuation of 27. Netflix shares have produced greater returns, while Alphabet shares are a better value, leading to a tie. PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to call an outright winner in this competition. Netflix is much earlier in its expansion story than Alphabet and will likely still see years of subscriber gains across the globe. Alphabet's growth will be slower, but should still be impressive for a company its size. Artificial intelligence and Alphabet's other initiatives could provide huge upside in the future, but have yet to produce any significant revenue. Since both Alphabet and Netflix look poised to succeed for years to come, there simply isn't a clear winner. Investors, therefore, may want to consider investing in both stocks. ","

Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars, may sound futuristic and like a bit of cheesy '50s-era science fiction, but the reality is that those cars are on the roads now. Waymo, the self-driving-car unit spun out of Google's moonshot lab and owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), reported in November 2017 that it had completed over 4 million test miles on public roads. The company's Early Rider Program is shuttling people about their daily lives and enlisting additional riders in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Projections regarding the number of driverless cars in our future vary. A Business Insider report from 2016 indicates that there will be 10 million autonomous cars on the roads by 2020. IHS Automotive thinks there will only be 600,000 in the world by 2025, but looking further out it forecasts that the number will reach 21 million by 2035. Boston Consulting Group estimates that the 30 million vehicles with varying levels of autonomy will be sold per year, valuing the total market at $77 billion. Whatever the future market, there are dozens of companies developing cars and systems that can drive autonomously. And with that many players, it's tough for investors to identify the top ways to capture the growing trend toward our driverless future. Here are three companies, each taking a different approach with these technological wonders: Alphabet, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU). Waymo has the most advanced autonomous driving system. Image source: Waymo. The company then known as Google began work on self-driving systems way back in 2009 and has by far the most developed driverless-car program. Waymo, the company spun off to commercialize that technology, disclosed that it will not be manufacturing a car but the system that will pilot it. The company will not only provide the software but also manufacture the entire complement of hardware for its autonomous systems, which will include the vision system, the radar, and the light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems. Waymo has been able to significantly reduce the cost of the system, reducing the cost of the LiDAR by 90%. LiDAR is the system that uses radar-like laser light pulses to detect other cars and pedestrians, as well as other obstructions. Waymo has recently announced several partnerships that will advance its driverless ambitions. The company has partnered with ride-hailing service Lyft in an effort to bring self-driving-car technology closer to mass adoption. Waymo is collaborating with Avis Budget Group to provide the support to maintain and clean its fleet of 600 autonomous vehicles participating in the early rider program. The company is also working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which provided the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans that make up the bulk of the early rider fleet and are outfitted with both the hardware and software that make up the driverless system. Waymo announced in November 2017 that the safety drivers would no longer be behind the wheel and the cars would be completely self-driving. The multiyear head start, the millions of test miles, and the fleet of test cars already on the road put Waymo light-years ahead of any competition. NVIDIA supplies systems that run self-driving cars. Image source: NVIDIA. NVIDIA has taken a different path in its quest to dominate the self-driving-car market. The company is known primarily for the graphics processor units (GPUs) that render images for video games. Lately, though, its GPUs have become the product of choice for all things artificial intelligence (AI). The sheer number-crunching power of the GPU worked remarkably well for training nascent AI systems, the same systems that underlie much self-driving technology. NVIDIA leveraged its advantage in the area and built customized platforms specifically designed for autonomous systems. NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2, the first in-car supercomputer, fuses data from the various cameras, radar, LiDAR, and ultrasonic sensors, and feeds the data into its AI system, which is designed to interpret the information and operate the vehicle. The company has partnered with a veritable Who's Who of automakers and top-tier parts suppliers that are using NVIDIA's processors and AI advancements to integrate into their own self-driving programs. By dispersing its technology across the widest cross-section of the market, NVIDIA is betting it will wind up in the system of choice in the future. Baidu has open-sourced its autonomous driving system. Image source: NVIDIA. Baidu, the leader in online search in its native country, has been called the ""Google of China,"" and like its U.S. counterpart, it has been working on self-driving systems. The company is widely believed to have developed the most advanced system in its home country and surprised many with its recent move to open-source its autonomous-driving technology, in what the company called Project Apollo. Baidu has since formed a broad alliance of more than 70 partners, from well-known automakers such as Ford Motor Company to tech giants such as Microsoft Corporation, to boost its efforts in the field. The company's chief operating officer, Qi Lu, had this to say: It is in essence the ""Android"" of the autonomous driving industry, but more open and more powerful. Apollo is not solely Baidu's. It belongs to everyone in the ecosystem. And as we and our partners contribute to the platform in our areas of specialty, we all gain more, with the results far greater than just our own."" By taking the same path that Google took with its Android operating system, Baidu hopes to become the industry standard software platform that any automaker can deploy for their own self-driving program.

    3 Top Stocks in Self-Driving Cars -- The Motley Fool

Brian Stoffel,07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There are very few similarities between action-camera maker GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- better known as the parent company of Google. The former primarily provides hardware and has been struggling mightily, while the latter is a big-data advertising behemoth. Perhaps, the only real similarity they have is that they would both be considered technology companies. Beyond that, there isn't too much to tie them together. Image source: Getty Images. That being said, investors have endless possibilities when it comes to where to put their money. With GoPro down so far, and Alphabet having been on a great run, which would be the better stock to buy now? Of course, we can't answer that question with 100% certainty. But we can examine it through three different lenses to get a better idea of what we're buying. Here's how the two stack up. Nothing is more important for long-term, buy-to-hold investors than the sustainable competitive advantage -- or ""moat"" -- a company possesses. While balance sheet and valuation are important -- more on that below -- the moat is paramount. In its most basic sense, a solid moat is what keeps customers coming back for more, year after year, while holding the competition at bay for decades. It is what separates you from all of your competition. Alphabet's moat is its data trove. While everyday humans are the ones using Google's seven products with over one billion users -- search, YouTube, Android, Chrome, Play Store, Maps, and Gmail -- advertisers are the ones paying the company's bills. The ubiquity of all seven products allows Google to collect gobs of data that can only be matched by Facebook. Given the ubiquity of all seven products, I don't see anyone else matching Alphabet's data scale. GoPro, on the other hand, has a much narrower moat. Because it produces a commodity -- whether an action camera or a drone -- competition can come in and offer the same thing for less. That's why brand is so important. Unfortunately, a number of product mis-steps and encroachment from others has shown that GoPro's brand doesn't provide a very wide moat. Investors in both Alphabet and GoPro are likely excited about growth possibilities. For that reason, they probably like seeing cash being reinvested in future opportunities. But there's something to be said for keeping a cash stash on hand. That's because every company, at one point or another -- will face difficult economic times. If they have a healthy pile of cash on hand, they will not only survive, but emerge stronger: by buying back shares on the cheap, acquiring rivals, and grabbing market share. Those that are debt heavy are often in peril of filing for bankruptcy. Keeping in mind that Alphabet is valued at over 400 times the size of GoPro, here's how the two stack up on these metrics. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow GoPro $75 million $0 ($423 million) ($252 million) Alphabet $99 billion $4 billion $21 billion $27.7 billion Clearly, it's a huge bonus that GoPro has zero debt. In fact, without that, the company would likely have been forced to sell itself or declare bankruptcy. Case in point: Just one year ago, there was $280 million in cash on the books versus no debt. While today's balance of $75 million isn't bad, it's a far cry from what it was just 12 months ago. Alphabet, on the other hand, has a war chest that few can match, and it generates tons of free cash flow. Finally, we have the murky science of valuation. While there's no single metric that can tell you if a stock is cheap or expensive, there are a number of data points we can consult. Here are five I like to use. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio GoPro N/A N/A 3.1 Alphabet 28 24 1.5 Here again, we have a pretty easy winner. It's already a strike against GoPro that we can't get a beat on an earnings or cash-flow-based valuation. But it's another in that relative to growth prospects (PEG ratio), Alphabet appears to be trading for a 50% discount as well. There you have it: Alphabet wins in a landslide. I used to be a GoPro shareholder, but once commoditization became evident, I checked out of the stock. Alphabet, on the other hand, accounts for 13% of my family's real-life holdings. I suggest you consider putting shares in your own portfolio; as you can see above, you've got three great reasons to do so. ","

Andrew Tonner,07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In business, there's rich, and then there's Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rich. The world's largest search provider and most popular website virtually prints profits. In fact, Alphabet so dominates the online advertising market that it was estimated to have captured 43% of the $181 billion online advertising market in 2016. Thanks to this kind of massive success, Alphabet's coffers have ballooned to contain $92.4 billion in cash and investments as of the company's most recent quarterly report. Here are three ideas about how Alphabet could put all that capital to work. Alphabet's mergers and acquisitions machine routinely snatches up smaller start-ups for their talent or technologies. According to research firm CB Insights, Alphabet has purchased at least 23 different start-ups since the start of 2016. The largest group (eight) of these start-ups have focused on what CB Insights categorizes as ""dev tools/cloud platforms,"" though other areas of focus include enterprise tools, as well as media and entertainment. It's also interesting to consider larger public names that Alphabet could potentially buy. The tech giant is clearly intent on capitalizing on coming tech trends including artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and more. Google is already one of the leaders in AI, and other large companies like Baidu or IBM probably aren't feasible acquisitions given size and regulatory considerations. Alphabet has gone on record saying it will not manufacture its own self-driving cars, but it's worth noting that even the largest automakers such as Ford, General Motors, or Tesla are all theoretically within its purchasing power. These kinds of large acquisitions are difficult to execute for a wide range of reasons. However, the point is that Alphabet has so much cash on hand that it can effectively buy its way into any industry, should its management deem it prudent. Image source: Alphabet. The matter of whether -- or when -- Alphabet will begin paying a dividend is by no means a new discussion. Of course, its financial resources are so vast that the company could easily afford to initiate a dividend policy, though it has made its aversion to doing so quite clear over the years. That being said, it will be increasingly difficult for Alphabet to continue to avoid paying a dividend as its cash balances continue to swell. The classic point of reference here, of course, is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The Mac maker initiated its own capital return program in 2012, earmarking a total of $45 billion to be returned to investors via dividends and buybacks over the following three years. Up until that point, Apple had avoided paying a dividend at least in part due to the fear that doing so might shift investor perception that it had become a mature company; Alphabet could certainly be holding off for similar reasons. Interestingly enough, Apple carried $97.6 billion in cash and investments at the time it initiated its own capital return program, an amount Alphabet should soon surpass under current conditions. Of course, that doesn't mean Alphabet will need to start its own dividend if, or when, its cash war chest balloons to twelve figures, but this once seemingly unimaginable idea becomes more of a reality the richer Alphabet becomes. The last option -- and the most likely one in my opinion -- is that Alphabet could initiate some kind of stock buyback program. Buybacks can be an incredibly effective way to drive shareholder returns under the right circumstances. However, when misused, they can prove damaging. However, even this move is by no means a certainty. More specifically, stock buybacks are best used when a company's stock can be fairly seen as undervalued, and this might be a difficult case to make, at least in the near term, for Alphabet. The company's stock currently trades at a multiple of 31 times its last 12 months' earnings per share and 23 times its 2018 consensus EPS estimates. Though the company can likely continue to grow its earnings at above average rates, Alphabet stock still trades at a clear -- and likely deserved -- premium to the market. As the company's cash balances continue to swell, Alphabet will feel increased pressure to put its cash war chest to work in one fashion or another. However, it isn't necessarily clear what the best option for Alphabet is in addressing its embarrassment of riches. ","

Last month, we got a different glimpse inside the Oval Office with details of investments that President Trump held prior to becoming the president. The Office of Government Ethics released a report that covers the period from January 2016 to April 2017 in a financial disclosure form. Serving presidents typically sell their stock holdings or create a blind trust to avoid conflicts of interest. The latest financial disclosure form includes publicly traded stocks President Trump owned during that 16 month period (and from which he has since divested). Image source: Getty Images. Three things stand out when looking at President Trump's holdings: One thing all investors can take as a lesson from President Trump's portfolio is the importance of diversification. By investing in so many different companies across a wide variety of sectors, his holdings could weather turbulence caused by market volatility, seasonality, and more: Data source: Government filing. Chart by author. President Trump invested with four different brokerages. Perhaps not a concern for a billionaire, but there are some advantages to using multiple brokers. For example, different brokerage firms provide different access to stock research, analysis, and other investing resources. Then, there is the matter of the SIPC, or Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which protects investors who have cash or securities at SIPC member brokerage firms. If a brokerage firm encounters financial trouble, the SIPC may step in to protect investors with a limit of $500,000, including $250,000 for cash. So if your portfolio grows to exceed this protection threshold, it may be worth considering having your portfolio divided among several brokers. Otherwise, if you've ever tried to make a trade and been thwarted by a technical glitch, simply having access to another account would solve that problem as well. Going back to President Trump's affinity for dividend payers, keep in mind that of the 10% annual return the S&P 500 has delivered on average since 1928, not all of that is from stock price appreciation. In fact, 44% of those returns came from dividends, according to Standard and Poor's. Overall, the disclosure form gives us an interesting glimpse into the investments of POTUS with the reminder that even a billionaire head of state follows universal tenets like keeping a diversified portfolio.

Have you heard about the next big thing in investing? No, it's not legal marijuana, albeit pot stocks have been nothing short of unstoppable over the past year. It's actually digital currency bitcoin, which has risen by nearly 900% over the trailing-two-year period. What once cost a consumer or investor around $255 per bitcoin will now set you back around $2,500. Why have digital cryptocurrencies like bitcoin been such a hot commodity of late? It appears to be a confluence of catalysts that have accelerated momentum behind bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies. Image source: Getty Images. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are relishing in newfound media coverage. Between the sheer outperformance of these digital currencies compared to the broader stock market, to recent ransomware attacks (e.g., WannaCry) where the perpetrators demand payment in bitcoin in order to ""unlock"" a computer, bitcoin is in the spotlight. The more media coverage it receives, the more interest there will likely be in this burgeoning payment and investment platform. Weakness in the world's most prominent currency, the U.S. dollar, may be helping as well. President Trump has, on numerous occasions, proclaimed the U.S. dollar to be too strong. A weaker dollar can help promote the export of American goods, but U.S. consumers aren't typically huge fans of seeing their currency weakened. Some investors have used the dollar's weakness as an opportunity to invest in bitcoin, which is a ""finite"" resource since the maximum number of bitcoin is limited to 21 million. The fact that the dollar's monetary base can be expanded infinitely and bitcoin is limited provides the belief to some investors that bitcoin could be a better means to preserve and grow wealth over time. Bitcoin has also benefited from a growing acceptance of the currency by countries, industries, and businesses. Japan declared the cryptocurrency legal tender earlier this year, while some retailers within the marijuana industry have been using bitcoin as a bridge currency between bank-issued debit and credit cards and marijuana product purchases. Since marijuana is a federally illegal substance, most banks won't deal with pot-based businesses, so bitcoin services act as an intermediary by allowing consumers to buy bitcoin and pay for their pot products that way. Bitcoin services then transfer that bitcoin back to cash for the marijuana business in return for a nominal service charge. Image source: Getty Images. Yet what might be most surprising is just how many brand-name businesses are now accepting bitcoin as payment. Here are five businesses that have welcomed bitcoin with open arms. The very first large consumer-facing company to lead the charge for bitcoin was online e-tailer Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK), which in January 2014 partnered with bitcoin exchange Coinbase to allow customers to pay for thousands of items with bitcoin. Shortly after its decision to carry bitcoin, CEO Patrick Byrne announced that his company would carry between 5% and 10% of its bitcoin paid as reserves. If this policy still holds true, Overstock would have seen a very handsome appreciation in those reserves by now, albeit bitcoin remains a nominally small component of its business. In May 2014, satellite television operator DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) announced that it would begin accepting bitcoin as payment for its content services. As with Overstock, DISH partnered with Coinbase as the payment processor for its bitcoin transactions. Bernie Han, who was at the COO of DISH at the time, said, ""DISH is now accepting bitcoin because we are listening to customers and providing them with the choice and convenience they want."" Image source: Microsoft. While governments have resisted referring to bitcoin as a ""currency,"" tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has embraced it. Since December 2014, Microsoft users have been able to use their bitcoin to purchase content in the Windows and Xbox stores. Microsoft was also behind the launch of Azure Blockchain as a service platform that allowed large-scale businesses to use blockchain to facilitate the settlement of financial data. More recently, Microsoft announced that it was adapting Excel 2017 so users can calculate, format, and analyze bitcoin on the platform. Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), the software giant behind do-it-yourself tax preparation software TurboTax and business accounting software QuickBooks, also accepts bitcoin. In late 2014, Intuit and BitPay announced integration of bitcoin payments into the QuickBooks PayByCoin service. This service allowed for next-day settlement into customers' bank accounts, thus eliminating a lot of the volatility inherent with bitcoin, and also provided an attractive business-to-business opportunity for cross-border clients who would otherwise face traditional banking obstacles and delays in the form of a bank transfer. Payment processing platform PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has also broadened its horizons by accepting bitcoin -- albeit in a roundabout way. In September 2014, PayPal announced that it would begin accepting bitcoin as payment via its integration with Braintree. This was also the same month that partnerships with CoinBase, GoCoin, and BitPay were announced. At the time of its announcement, Scott Ellison suggested that PayPal would merely act as the intermediary, with costs of the transaction to be decided by the merchant and payment processor. However, since its spinoff from eBay, PayPal's promotion of bitcoin has slowed. Image source: Getty Images. Following bitcoin's massive run higher and growing legitimacy with brand-name businesses, you might be wondering why more businesses haven't jumped on board. The answer can probably be boiled down to two factors. First, bitcoin is still exceptionally volatile, and even overnight settlements could result in businesses losing out on a lot of money. For example, bitcoin prices plunged by more than $200 in a single day between June 25 and June 26. Businesses that had conducted transactions in bitcoin with next-day settlement could have seen between 7% and 10% of their deal value depleted in a matter of hours. While bitcoin's lack of governmental backing is one reason investors like it so much, this same absence of backing, and the thinness of its trading volume, create substantial volatility that keeps businesses away. The other big issue is that bitcoin could draw the ire of regulators. For example, bitcoin acting as a bridge currency for marijuana purchases looks like the perfect reason for U.S. lawmakers to consider imposing regulations on the cryptocurrency. As long as the government leaves bitcoin alone, it has an opportunity to thrive, but this Fool doesn't believe the U.S. government is going to allow bitcoin to expand without imposing a system of checks and balances. Any sort of regulations on acquiring or holding bitcoin could crush the digital currency's price. I remain steadfast in my belief that bitcoin belongs nowhere near your portfolio for the time being, regardless of its recent performance or its acceptance by brand-name companies. ","

When Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) introduced the Echo smart speaker powered by its virtual assistant, Alexa, what started off as a novelty soon blossomed into an industry. Every major tech company has its own version, and it won't be long before smart speakers will be found in a majority of homes. The capabilities and performance vary by device, but the trend is undeniable. A forecast by Global Market Insights predicts that growth in the smart speaker market will hit $13 billion by 2024, with sales of over 100 million units. These devices are at their core wireless speakers, but with a host of other capabilities. In addition to streaming music from a variety of sources, the speakers use far-field microphones to accept voice commands, and they can function as the heart of a home automation system. Some can link with other smart speakers. The most intriguing feature of these devices is the artificial intelligence (AI) powered virtual assistant at the heart of each one, similar to those found on any smartphone. The more they are used, the more useful they become. They can perform a variety of tasks, including checking the weather, ordering a pizza, scheduling a Lyft, and checking credit card accounts. Investors looking to capitalize on this trend should look no further than three of the biggest companies in tech: Amazon, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). How should investors buy into the growing trend of smart home speakers? Image source: Getty Images. With no early competition, Amazon's Echo quickly emerged as the dominant force in smart speakers. The company released a skills kit to developers early on, which allowed them to incorporate voice commands. The number of apps that integrate with Echo now total more than 15,000. The novelty and utility of the device has resulted in a groundswell of consumer interest. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) estimates that since its release in 2014, 10.7 million Amazon customers in the U.S. have purchased one of the devices. Amazon has expanded its lineup of Echo devices to include the smaller form feature Dot and the portable, battery-operated Tap. The Echo Look includes a camera and can make fashion recommendations, and the recently released Show features a touchscreen for a variety of uses, including video chat and viewing content from Amazon Prime Video. Amazon currently dominates the market it created. Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon's advantage extends beyond its early installed base. Mark Mahaney and Jim Shaughnessy from RBC Capital Market's estimate that 17% of consumers have used the Echo family of devices to order products from Amazon's website, which could result in an additional $10 billion in sales annually by 2020. Google Home has several distinct advantages over the competition. Google was an early pioneer in artificial intelligence, and it combines that with its search capability to form a powerful one-two punch. Due to its work in voice recognition, Google Home can be trained to recognize up to six different users in a household and differentiate between them. It also has the ability to daisy-chain multiple speakers for a seamless experience. Google Assistant will also venture to answer any request, while Echo is limited by the syntax of very specific commands. In a test conducted by search and digital agency 360i, a series of 3,000 questions were asked to both Google Home and Amazon Echo. The test concluded that Google Home was six times more likely to provide an answer. This innate ability to answer based on search data and provide answers will give Google the advantage in years to come. Google Home is quickly stealing market share. Image source: Google. Apple is known for taking its time when entering a new market and developing a high-end product. The HomePod is Apple's entry into the smart speaker market, though it won't be available until December. Apple is focusing on the musical capabilities of its smart speaker, which features an upward-facing woofer and an array of 7 beam-forming tweeters marketed to the music lover. HomePod will also feature spatial awareness or ""room-sensing technology,"" which will adjust and optimize the sound based on its position and size of the room, along with the ability to detect and balance multiple speakers. The smart part of HomePod will have Apple's virtual assistant Siri at its core and will be able to check the weather, get news and sports updates, and control smart home accessories that integrate with its HomeKit. We'll have to wait until the release of the HomePod to get a full understanding of its capabilities, but historically, Apple has been a force to be reckoned with in any market it enters. HomePod will focus on the music. Image source: Apple. Let's be clear: These devices are not yet a meaningful part of any company's revenue stream -- yet. eMarketer estimates that Amazon controls over 70% of the smart speaker segment, a market it created, but competition is heating up. Google Home was released in November 2016, and it has already garnered nearly 24% of the market. The smart home speaker market is still in its infancy and is expected to grow dramatically, reaching 36 million users in the U.S. by year-end, an increase of 129% year over year. These three companies provide investors with a way to tap into this fast-growing segment. ","
      
    3 Top Stocks in the Exploding Smart Speaker Market -- The Motley Fool

Danny Vena,07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The smart speaker market didn't exist until late 2014, with the debut of the Echo home smart speaker by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Since then, potential competitors have been scrambling to catch up. For the last several years, Amazon has had the market of voice-controlled wireless speakers to itself, but competition has recently ramped up. In November 2016, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) released the Google Home, and last month, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced its HomePod, which will be in stores in December. A number of smaller players will also be releasing competing devices. Each of these devices is powered by a virtual assistant and possesses the ability to check the weather, play music, read the news, and manage connected smart home devices. They can also provide assistance with credit card statements, schedule ride-hailing, or order a pizza. Each company has taken a slightly different approach, hoping to differentiate their product in what is quickly becoming a crowded field. To almost no fanfare whatsoever, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that it will release the Invoke speaker in partnership with Harman Kardon, a division of Samsung Electronics (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), which will check traffic, play music, and deliver the latest headlines. Sound familiar? Why is Microsoft delivering what seems like an also-ran product without anything to set its device apart? Harman Kardon Invoke Intelligent Speaker with Cortana from Microsoft. Image source: Harman. Microsoft has serious market share for its Cortana voice-activated virtual assistant when it comes to PCs, by virtue of its Windows operating system, but it loses any advantage in the mobile market to Google's Android and Apple's iOS, which together account for 99% of new smartphone sales. These run Google Assistant and Siri, respectively, which affords Microsoft very little chance to get a toehold in the market. Being tethered to the desktop isn't doing the company any favors. Microsoft is trying to augment its position in the office and reach into other areas of consumers' lives by deploying Cortana across a variety of devices, thereby making up for its missed opportunity in the smartphone market. Outside of its desktop stronghold, Cortana can be found on the Invoke speaker and the Xbox, and Microsoft has partnered with various automakers to integrate Cortana into cars via its Connected Vehicle Platform. The company also released a software development kit for Cortana, giving manufacturers the opportunity to embed Cortana into any number of connected appliances and Internet-of-Things devices, which will allow them to respond to voice commands. Amazon has relied primarily on the advantage of being first to market and currently boasts 15,000 ""skills"" or commands for its Echo family of products powered by its Alexa virtual assistant. While it has no specific phone to call home, Alexa is available via the Amazon app and has found its way into a number of cars, appliances, and smart home devices. It appears to be working, as Amazon controls an estimated 70% of the smart speaker market, according to eMarketer. The other advantage for Amazon is the potential for voice-driven shopping from its e-commerce website. A survey by RBC Capital Markets found that 17% of Amazon customers already use the Echo family of devices to order products. Google Home is relying on its massive installed base of Android devices and the strength of the company's underlying artificial intelligence and search capabilities for its advantage, which appears to by paying off. In a recent test by 360i Data of Google Home and Amazon Alexa, Home was six times more likely to provide an answer than Alexa. According to eMarketer, despite the short time it has been available, Google Home has quickly garnered 24% of the smart speaker market. Apple's advantage will be its focus on quality, the legion of diehard fans of its products, and the strength of its ecosystem. It will also emphasize the pairing of its speaker with an Apple Music subscription. Meanwhile, its virtual assistant, Siri, made the leap from the iPhone and has been deployed into the iPad and Apple Watch, as well as the company's laptop and desktop computers. HomePod is another way for Apple to expand its presence in its customers' lives. Smart speakers establish a beachhead in the home. Image source: Harman. The appeal of these speakers to their big tech creators is not necessarily the income that will be derived from the sale of the devices, but the information the companies will glean about their consumers. Additionally, the AI-based virtual assistants that underlie these speakers become smarter and more useful the more they are used, so getting them in front of as many consumers as possible is essential.

    Is Microsoft Already Too Late to the Smart Home Speaker Market? -- The Motley Fool

Danny Vena,07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Over the last several years, investors looking to benefit from the ongoing developments in the field of AI needed to look no further than graphics processing pioneer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The massive parallel computing capability that made GPUs the best choice for rendering images turned out to be just as effective for training artificial intelligence (AI) systems. NVIDIA positioned itself to leverage that advantage and began optimizing processors specifically for that purpose. For a time, the GPU giant had the field to itself and financial results soared. For its fiscal 2018 third quarter (which ended Oct. 29, 2017) NVIDIA grew revenue to $2.64 billion, an increase of 31.5% over the prior-year quarter, while GAAP net income of $833 million jumped 55% year over year. The stock has doubled in the last year, and its valuation has jumped as well. NVIDIA now trades at an astonishing 48 times trailing earnings, with an only slightly less expensive forward multiple of 43. At these levels, any actual or perceived failure to execute could bring the stock crashing down. The good news is that investors looking to capitalize on the growing trend of AI can invest in a pioneer in the field that offers solid growth without the potential downside risk -- Google, a division of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG). Alphabet is a way to invest in AI for more risk-averse investors. Image source: Getty Images. Google has been at the forefront of AI, and early research in deep learning, a specific discipline of AI, has led to advances in image recognition, language processing, and voice recognition. Suggesting the name of a friend to ""tag"" in a photo and the ability to ask questions of the virtual assistant on your smartphone are examples of the developments resulting from early successes in AI. Google developed TensorFlow, its open-source AI framework that developers use to more easily build their own AI systems. The company also created the tensor processing unit (TPU), a specialized chip that delivers optimized performance while achieving significant improvements in energy efficiency. These were previously only used in the execution or ""inference"" phase of running AI systems that had previously been trained using GPUs. Google recently revealed that its second-generation TPU is now capable of both the inference and training phases of AI systems, putting it into direct competition with NVIDIA's GPUs. Google has not yet announced plans to market the chip but is currently using the processor internally. The use of cloud services is becoming particularly relevant to development in the field of AI. The ability to train these systems requires the intersection of big data and vast computing power, and many companies don't possess the financial resources to develop AI programs from scratch. The ability to piggyback off the systems offered by cloud providers has been key to advancing the research capability of smaller companies. AI will continue to revolutionize business. Image source: Getty Images. It is difficult to quantify the future revenue potential of AI, but certain anecdotal evidence can provide insight. In 2014, Google acquired AI start-up DeepMind in a deal estimated at $600 million. At the time, Google sought to eek further energy efficiency from its already miserly data centers and applied DeepMind's AI to the task. By regulating cooling systems, windows, and servers, and controlling 120 condition-based variables, the company was able to reduce the amount of energy used for cooling by 40%. This cut Google's total power consumption by 15%, saving the company hundreds of millions of dollars. While investors wait for the potential financial windfall that could result from AI, they can take heart that Google's principle business still thrives. In its 2017 third quarter, Alphabet increased revenue to $27.77 billion, up 24% over the prior-year quarter. Net income was similarly impressive at $6.7 billion, an increase of 33% year over year. Alphabet stock is up 35% over the last year, respectable by any measure, but nowhere near the blistering pace of NVIDIA's 100% rise. Still, as the old saying goes ""what goes up must come down."" Google's development of the TPU illustrates a stark reality for NVIDIA. Should any processor or solution become generally available that improves the performance of the GPU, NVIDIA's future growth could slow considerably, and the stock will adjust to reflect that reality. That's why you might want to forget NVIDIA. ","

Wallace Witkowski,07132017,MarketWatch,07062017,"Published: July 13, 2017 3:18 p.m. ET More mainstream users are turning to the anonymous internet By A growing trend of mainstream internet users looking to avoid data collection and mask their online presence poses a potential risk to companies like Facebook and Google. The emergence of the so-called “Dark Net,” a network of internet sites geared for anonymous online use and not accessible to traditional search engines, poses a “potentially disruptive risk” to sites that depend upon data collection for advertising revenue, said Goldman Sachs internet analyst Heath Terry in a recent note. While the so-called Dark Net has more than often been associated with illegal activities like the underground online drug bazaar Silk Road and cryptocurrency transactions like Bitcoin

Terry cited a Pew Research Center survey from as far back as 2013 that 86% of adult online users take steps to become more anonymous on the web. A rise in those two factors—criminal activity and users looking for a more anonymous internet presence—could potentially combine to undercut growth at large internet-based companies. “The presence of high-profile illegal activity could lead to efforts to more directly regulate the internet,” Terry noted. “Companies that have their own communication services, like Facebook

Getting back to the Fed and its friends, one key point is they’ve signaled the start of another epoch, says Ray Dalio, founder and chief investment officer of the world’s largest hedge fund. And Janet Yellen, Mario Draghi and their sidekicks are now closer to getting it wrong, so investors should prepare to hit the eject button, the Bridgewater Associates big shot suggests, delivering our call of the day. The world is now at “the beginning of the late-cycle phase of the business/short-term debt cycle, in which central bankers try to tighten at paces that are exactly right in order to keep growth and inflation neither too hot nor too cold, until they don’t get it right and we have our next downturn,” Dalio writes in a fresh post on LinkedIn. “Recognizing that, our responsibility now is to keep dancing but closer to the exit and with a sharp eye on the tea leaves.” But Bridgewater doesn’t see “a big debt bubble bursting any time soon (because of the balance sheet repairs that have taken place), though we do see an increasingly intensifying ‘Big Squeeze,’” Dalio adds. See: Dalio warns of squeeze for the economy and markets And it’s time to say “thank you” to the world’s central bankers, according to the storied investor. “Generally speaking (depending on the country), it is appropriate for central banks to lessen the aggressiveness of their unconventional policies because these policies have successfully brought about beautiful deleveragings,” he writes. “We should savor this accomplishment and thank the policy makers who fought to bring about these policies. They had to fight hard to do it and have been more maligned than appreciated.” Go here to read Dalio’s full take.

Emma Court,07132017,MarketWatch,07062017,"Published: July 8, 2017 10:42 a.m. ET Despite rising opioid overdose deaths, illicit drug use hasn’t risen dramatically, analyst David Mericle said By America’s opioid crisis has taken lives, wrecked families and communities and placed huge financial pressures on the country’s local governments, health care systems and prisons. Will it prevent changes in unemployment, too? Not necessarily, says a new Goldman Sachs report. America’s opioid crisis is “at most a modestly large barrier” to reducing unemployment going forward, the Wednesday report said, adding that rising overdose fatalities don’t show a full picture of opioid abuse. Opioids encompass a wide range of drugs, from prescription painkillers like Vicodin and OxyContin to illegal drugs like heroin and the potent synthetic opioid fentanyl. Accordingly, routes to opioid addiction also vary, with some patients getting hooked on prescription painkillers and then moving on to something like heroin. Importantly, the opioid crisis has been underway since the late 1990s, when pharmaceutical companies pushed prescription pain treatments and said they were not addictive. See more:  Opioids are ravaging the U.S., but they’re still the best pain drug we’ve got Today, overdose deaths appear to be rising faster than ever, according to a New York Times analysis last month that used preliminary 2016 data. But those kinds of data give “an exaggerated sense of the prevalence of illicit drug use,” said Goldman Sachs analyst and author of the report, David Mericle. Fentanyl has been shown to play an outsize role in overdose deaths but drugs like it “account for a small share of all drug use.” Meanwhile, illicit drug use hasn’t risen dramatically, and positive pre-employment drug tests have only risen modestly, with a small increase attributed to opiates specifically, Mericle said. To be sure, it may just depend on what data are being examined. For example, an analysis done by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found diagnoses of opioid-use disorder surged by nearly 500% over the past seven years. Read:  America’s opioid epidemic is everywhere, but it’s especially bad in these 5 states The Goldman Sachs report also said that, as the unemployment rate fell following the Great Recession, the percentage of unemployed people using illicit drugs went up only slightly, counter to what might be expected. Related:  FDA asks Endo to stop selling opioid, in first such move There is also evidence that prescription pain relievers are used at fairly similar rates among employed and unemployed persons, although unemployed people have slightly higher rates, according to the report. Though there is a “complex” relationship between the opioid crisis and the labor market, “we see little basis for writing off the remaining pool of unemployed, whose rate of drug use has not risen nearly as much as one might think from the surge in drug deaths,” the report said.

Maria LaMagna,07132017,MarketWatch,07062017,"Published: July 10, 2017 11:03 a.m. ET Higher-earning residents tend to be at higher risk of becoming victims By If you or your neighbors have been victims of identity theft recently, there’s a pretty good chance you live in Florida. The Sunshine state is the most vulnerable in the U.S. for identity theft, according to a recent analysis from the personal-finance website SmartAsset. Florida was followed by Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and Connecticut. The site ranked each state based on factors including Federal Trade Commission data on how many consumers complained about identity theft and identity fraud in 2015, per 100,000 residents.(Identity theft and identity fraud are similar terms and both used to refer to crimes that involve wrongfully obtaining and using another person’s personal data for crimes of deception.) The top five states all had more than 550 complaints about identity fraud per 100,000 residents, and Florida topped the list with 1,510. Maryland had 749 complaints about identity fraud per 100,000 residents and also ranked high for household income, with 49.8% of households making more than $74,999, compared to 29.8% of Floridians. SmartAsset used additional data to create the index for its state-by-state ranking, including the average number of credit cards per person in each state, from credit bureau Experian’s

Nearly 30% of Florida’s residents are younger than 10 or older than 65, SmartAsset found, compared to an average of about 27% for the other states. See also: Why you shouldn’t answer the phone when the bank calls Higher-earning residents tend to be at higher risk of becoming identity-theft and fraud victims, and children and seniors are also more at risk than young and middle-aged adults, said AJ Smith, SmartAsset’s vice president of financial education. The number of credit cards open was also a factor, she said, because having more lines of credit open leaves more possible channels open for theft. Retirees and children are frequent victims of identity theft, said Rick McElroy, a security strategist at the security firm Carbon Black. Senior citizens may be less knowledgeable about how to keep their personal information safe, he added. Many retired before cybersecurity training came to their workplaces, he said. “They’re a little more trusting.” Plus, elderly consumers also must give personal information out during medical appointments, he said, which can fall into the wrong hands if medical professionals mishandle it. Children may also accidentally give too much personal information away online, he said. And, worse, parents may not realize fraudsters have stolen their children’s identities because they’re less likely to check a minor’s credit report. Children who have never applied for credit, and who haven’t been designated as authorized users on their parents’ accounts, should not have credit reports nor histories; if fraudsters have stolen their identities, however, they might have accounts fraudulently opened in their names, McElroy said. About one in 10 adults lost money in a phone scam in the last year, and on average lost $430 each, according to an analysis by TrueCaller, a Stockholm-based company that offers including caller ID and spam detection.

He reiterated a buy rating. PayPal’s partnerships are also a bigger sign of companies and payment processors “embracing choice,” Carcache said. The move is helpful for consumers, as they are able to pay using a physical or digital wallet at more locations, but is also beneficial to PayPal as more large merchants move toward adding it as an option. “We view this as the latest in a string of recent announcements highlighting that the ‘consumer choice’ philosophy already adopted by the major payment networks and issuers,” Carcache wrote.

Those threats are not an issue yet, he said, as the 2% cash back likely only appeals to less affluent debit customers and Amazon Pay will not be able to attract the merchants it seeks. “We’re also skeptical of Amazon’s ability to push into payments with Amazon Pay given that merchants will always fear that Amazon is out to supplant them,” Carcache wrote.

Shirley S. Wang,07132017,MarketWatch,07062017,"Published: July 7, 2017 4:58 a.m. ET Real-time apologies and coffee in the waiting room By When Basil Besh, an orthopedic hand surgeon based in Fremont, Calif., decided in 2009 to start his own surgery center, he knew he had to have a strong presence on the web to be competitive. He set up a Google alert to tell him whenever his name was mentioned and signed up for a service run by Empathiq, a health-care-focused online reputation-management service, that monitors his online reviews on rating sites such as those run by Healthgrades Operating Co. and Yelp Inc.

                                   He routinely reads his reviews and calls patients who express dissatisfaction to find out what if anything he can change. This has led him to make improvements to his practice, says Besh, and to a 4.5-star rating (out of 5) on Yelp. It is standard practice for large and small businesses to closely monitor their online reputations, and now more services are helping doctors, clinics and hospitals do the same. In addition to monitoring reviews and ensuring accuracy about the details of the practice, some of these firms will solicit patient reviews and generate other positive content to push down negative press in web-search results. Some also help their clients contact patients to address their concerns and ask them to change their reviews. Bad online ratings can wreak havoc on doctors’ businesses, in extreme cases driving physicians to leave a particular state to practice elsewhere, according to doctors and reputation-management companies. Ratings sites will take down reviews that use profanity or can be proven fake, but they typically won’t edit or remove a review simply because a doctor (or any business) disputes what is in it. And unlike restaurants or plumbers, doctors can’t change their company name if their reputations are damaged. But doctors and reputation-management firms say paying close attention to reviews and other feedback doesn’t just benefit doctors; consumers also benefit if doctors make changes that result in a better patient experience. More than 70% of consumers search for health information online, according to Pew Research Center, and 77% of consumers say they use online reviews as the first step in finding a new physician, according to a 2015 survey of 1,438 patients by Software Advice, a software research and advisory firm. Andrea Pearson, chief marketing officer at Healthgrades, one of the largest rating sites for doctors, with one million visitors a day, says reputation-management firms can play a beneficial role by increasing the volume of feedback from patients—but only if the reviews are truthful and come from real patients. (Healthgrades has several checkpoints in place to help it verify the authenticity of reviewers, she says.) Still, she says most physicians will find these firms’ offerings are limited, and will have more success when they work directly with the online sources themselves. Others are more critical of any practice that attempts to skew consumers’ impression about a business. “Reputation-management firms are paid to make their clients’ online image as flattering as possible,” says Luther Lowe, who heads public policy at Yelp. Doctors, like other business owners, are able to respond to reviews, including negative ones, he says, adding that Yelp sees more failed attempts to mislead consumers with fraudulent positive reviews than it sees failed attempts to malign competitors with fake negative reviews. Yelp, he says, has several technologies in place to detect and pull down fake reviews. Also read:  How online reviews have been a blessing for travelers and a curse for some big hotels Reputation-management firms say patient-confidentiality rules mean physicians have to be more careful than other businesses in how they respond to negative reviews and complaints online. For example, if a patient says a doctor missed a particular diagnosis, physicians can’t publicly dispute the patient’s claim because it would violate confidentiality. Instead, doctors are encouraged to respond generically to the review online and ask the patient to contact the practice for a more specific response. Banner Health, a large integrated health service employing or affiliated with 9,000 doctors, monitors its online reviews through Reputation.com of Redwood City, Calif. Soon, Banner will start using natural-language recognition technology to analyze online comments on Facebook

                                   The software will divide comments into positive, neutral and negative buckets, and the negative comments will be monitored continuously during business hours. Complaints that require action will be issued a trouble ticket, just as if a patient had called the call center directly. For instance, if a patient is in the emergency room and complains about a long wait, Banner may send a staff member to apologize and give them a coffee, says Alexandra Morehouse, chief marketing officer of Banner. The health system also solicits phone- and email-based patient-satisfaction scores directly and will have doctors call patients to discuss negative reviews. “One woman hung up three times because she didn’t believe the doctor would call” about a review, says Morehouse. The doctor eventually connected with her and was able to clear up a miscommunication, she says. IHealthSpot, another reputation-management service used by health-care professionals, builds separate websites called microsites that are embedded in its clients’ pages. These microsites pull in reviews from ratings sites and the web but display only those that are three, four or five stars—effectively hiding the most negative reviews. The microsites also provide an overall rating based on that subset of reviews. “From our perspective, there are often reviews on sites that are unfair, [yet] you can’t get them removed,” says Mary Hall, iHealthSpot’s chief executive. “We’re not getting rid of the bad ones, just highlighting the best ones. It is a bit of a gray area.” Carolyn Murray, who owns a medical weight-loss clinic called Physicians Weight Loss Centers in Columbia, Md., says she turned to iHealthSpot a few years ago when a prospective patient wanted to cancel her appointment after seeing a negative review about the clinic on Yelp. The review was left by an unhappy patient who had missed several appointments without canceling and wanted her visit fee back even though the cancellation policy stated she would forfeit it, says Murray, who isn’t a physician herself but employs one in the business. Another negative Yelp review described a patient experience that clearly didn’t happen at her clinic, she says. Murray says she appealed to Yelp, which declined to take down the reviews, saying she could respond to them if she wanted. Yelp declined to comment. Murray says that employing a reputation-management firm has been helpful because she now knows when patients leave reviews, good or bad, and can respond to them quickly. But she is frustrated that people can say whatever they want about her clinic even if it isn’t truthful. She says that several patients have threatened to leave bad reviews if they don’t get their money back. Also read:  How doctors are getting patients more involved in their own care The clinic has an average 2-star rating out of 5 on Yelp, based on eight reviews, and a 3.7-star rating out of 5 on Google, based on 15 reviews. The microsite on her clinic’s website, however, lists a 5-star average patient rating, with most of the reviews coming from Google. Murray says she believes the microsite reviews “are helpful, not misleading, because a lot of the negative reviews are incorrect.” Most doctor reviews are positive, according to industry research. About 75% of the time, negative reviews of doctors and clinics are about things like wait times, grumpy receptionists or parking—things can easily be addressed, those in the industry say. The other complaints tend to center on the physician’s bedside manner, confusion about treatment or follow-up care, or lack of follow-up. Only occasionally do reviews state that a doctor treated them incorrectly, they say. Dr. Besh, the California hand surgeon, learned from reading a review that patients were waiting a long time to see him. He reduced wait times in part by emailing forms in advance through a patient portal. At the same time, “there’s a price to be paid for that—what patients want versus what patients need,” he says. For instance, a patient once wrote a negative review because Besh refused to order an MRI. “We work by guidelines, and the MRI wasn’t warranted,” he says. But “I can see how a doctor could say we’re going to order MRIs on everyone” so they won’t get bad reviews. “Online reputation review is really a double-edged sword,” says Besh. Shirley S.

Leslie Albrecht,07132017,MarketWatch,07062017,"Published: July 10, 2017 10:37 a.m. ET The relationship between generosity and political affiliation and gender By Tipping can be a social and cultural maelstrom. And social media doesn’t always help. A National Basketball Association player who has a $30 million contract drew internet ire last week after leaving a $13.97 tip on a $487.13 bill. Andre Roberson of the Oklahoma City Thunder made headlines for the paltry tip, and the strong reaction shows just how emotional the question of tipping can be. But it wasn’t quite as clear-cut as it seemed. Roberson released a statement on Twitter

Roberson said he also had a $100 tab on shots for which he left a $200 tip. “I thought he’d be grateful for the $200 tip,” he wrote of the barman who served him. Meanwhile, some restaurants have banned tipping while Uber is finally encouraging riders to open their wallets to drivers who go the extra mile. Now comes new data to add fuel to this fire: Republican men are better tippers than Democrat women, according to a survey released Monday by CreditCards.com. The survey, based on phone interviews with 1,002 adults in the U.S., found that Republicans, men, people who live in the northeast and people paying with credit and debit cards are the most generous tippers — all of those groups leave a median tip of 20%. Women tip a median of 16% and Democrats, southerners and cash users tip a median of 15%, the survey found. See more: Meet the most generous tipper in America Some of the findings seemed to play out in real life when three supporters of President Donald Trump left a $450 tip for a Washington, D.C. waitress in January, though they were from Texas, not the relatively more generous northeast. Matt Schulz, a senior analyst with CreditCards.com, pegged the disparity in tipping in different parts of the country to income levels. “The more money you have, the more likely you are to leave a little extra on the table at the end of the night,” Schulz said. “What ties those groups of big tippers together is that they tend to be a little higher income than their counterparts. It’s a lot easier to throw a few extra bucks your server’s way when you have more expendable income and you’re more confident about financial situation.” The survey also looked at which service providers we tip, and found that the ones we interact with the most get the best tips. For example, most people (67%) tip their hair stylists, while only 27% tip their hotel housekeeper. “Part of that is about personal connection,” Schulz said. “If you never interact with someone or you don’t see them, you probably won’t feel a big need to tip them.” Don’t miss: How much to tip everyone The same pattern seems to happen when people donate money to charities, said Stacy Palmer, editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which has researched how Americans give to charities. People who live in areas where they come face-to-face with poverty are generally more generous donors, Palmer said. “If you encounter people in need, you’re more likely to give generously, because you see people who need money,” Palmer said. “Wealthy people in cities versus people who live in gated communities tend to give more.” Also read: Is this the worst tipper in America? She noted that when it comes to measuring generosity, it’s not about the dollar amount you give, it’s about what portion of your income you’re giving. Women of all income levels give higher portions of their income to charity than men do, she said. And though men were better restaurant tippers than women, females were more likely than men to tip hotel housekeepers, hair stylists and baristas, the CreditCards.com survey found. As for how the red-blue split in tipping compares to the political divide in charitable giving, Palmer said the most recent research shows that Republicans give a bigger share of their incomes than Democrats to charity. But that could shift along with the country’s changing political climate. Palmer said. Democrats surveyed after the 2016 election said they planned to give more to charities. Liberal groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union have seen record donations as their causes have come under threat from Trump administration policies.

The Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp., which runs a nuclear power plant in Kansas, was one company hit by cyberintruders, both the New York Times and Bloomberg News reported. Other energy facilities and manufacturing plants have also been targeted since May, the reports said, citing a joint report by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI. Bloomberg reported Russia is the chief suspect in the hacks. Wolf Creek is owned by Westar Energy Inc.

The government report could not tell if the intrusions were an attempt at industrial espionage or sabotage, but concluded the hackers appeared to be mapping out networks for possible future attacks, the Times said. Wolf Creek officials told the Times that no “operations systems” were affected, and that its corporate network is separate from the network that controls the nuclear plant’s operations. “There is no indication that hackers had been able to jump from their victims’ computers into the control systems of the facilities,” the Times reported. A spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute told the Times that no nuclear-plant operator had reported operational security breaches in the recent wave of attacks. Still, the report is especially troubling following massive cyberattacks in May and June that wreaked havoc with companies and organizations around the world. Russian hackers have been suspected in attacks against Ukraine’s power grid, and in June computer security experts warned malicious code that was used against Ukraine could be repurposed to disrupt the U.S. power grid. In April, energy industry officials told a Senate committee that the Energy Department needs to cooperate more with businesses to help them prevent cyberattacks. “The threat is very real,” Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. chief executive Duane D. Highley told senators. ",Hackers targeting U.S. nuclear power plant operators: reports - MarketWatch

 ,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc reported a 21 percent jump in quarterly revenue on Monday, maintaining a growth rate that is rarely seen among companies its size and suggesting the big sales gains enjoyed recently by the other Internet firms are not done yet. Alphabet, the owner of Google and YouTube, said it made $3.5 billion in net income on sales of $26 billion. The profit would have been much larger but for a record $2.7 billion European Union antitrust fine. Still, the company noted that costs were rising faster than sales and warned that expenses would remain high as more searches shift to mobile devices. The squeeze on expected future profit appeared to weigh on Alphabet’s share price, which fell about 3 percent to $967 after the bell. Shares had closed up in regular trading and have gained 26 percent for the year. Alphabet’s cost of revenue, a measure of how much money the company must spend to keep its platforms running before added costs such as research, rose 28 percent, well above the growth in revenue itself. The rising costs, including what Google pays to drive traffic to its search engine, hurt operating margins more than most people had expected, said Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners Management. “This could be problematic going forward,” Kass said. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, asked about margins during a conference call with analysts, said the company was focused on getting bigger. “As we’ve often said, we’re focused on revenue and operating income dollar growth and not on operating margins,” she said. Increasing costs, Porat added, are a result of more money going into high-growth products that she said would create value for shareholders. With its latest profits, Alphabet reported $15.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and another $79 billion in marketable securities. Alphabet and social media rival Facebook Inc, which together dominate the online ad market, compete for advertising dollars. This year, Google is expected to have $73.75 billion in net digital ad revenue worldwide while Facebook is expected to take in $36.29 billion, according to research firm eMarketer. Together they will have about 49 percent of the market, eMarketer said. Facebook is due to report earnings on Wednesday. The technology sector has led a big rally in U.S. stocks. The S&P 500 information technology index is up 23.1 percent this year, compared with a 10.4 percent rise in the S&P 500. Antitrust risk has shadowed Google for years, and antitrust enforcers in the European Union last month fined Google 2.42 billion euro ($2.7 billion) for favoring its own shopping service. The fine came in the first of three EU probes of Google’s dominance in searches and smartphone operating systems, and analysts are going to monitor the downside closely, said Josh Olson, an analyst with Edward Jones. “It is not so much the money or the fine itself,” Olson said, but “questions linger about what impact that could have on Google’s Europe business, and they did not really comment on that.” U.S. antitrust enforcers thus far have chosen not to follow Europe’s lead. If not for the fine, Alphabet said that earnings per share would have been $8.90 in the second quarter, compared with $7 a year earlier. With the fine, Alphabet reported earnings per share of $5.01, beating an average estimate of $4.49. Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Google, said in response to an analyst question during Monday’s call that Google would fight to continue bundling its Android operating system with popular smartphone apps such as Google Maps — a practice the EU antitrust officials are investigating. “It’s a very open market, open ecosystem, and it works well for everyone, and I expect that to continue,” Pichai said, adding that billions of people use Google products. Pichai was also appointed to the Alphabet board of directors on Monday. Google’s ad revenue rose 18.4 percent to $22.67 billion. Revenue from other Google products, a category that includes the Pixel smartphone, the Play Store and Google’s cloud business, rose 42.3 percent to $3.09 billion. Alphabet competes heavily in the fast-growing cloud business with tech companies Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp. Losses from other Alphabet units - an array of businesses known as “other bets” that includes the Waymo self-driving car company, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily - narrowed to $772 million from $855 million a year earlier.

 ,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee on Tuesday asked chief executives from companies representing the two sides of the net neutrality debate, including Alphabet, Facebook, AT&T and Verizon, to testify at a Sept. 7 hearing. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is considering tossing out 2015 Obama administration net neutrality rules that reclassified internet service like a public utility. The current rules bar providers from blocking or slowing websites, or allowing websites to pay for “fast lanes” over competitors. Internet providers and major tech companies have been sharply divided over the rules. Many internet providers want Congress to step in and write permanent rules, while websites say the Obama era rules are critical to preserving the open internet. The outcome of the debate could have a major impact on the future of the internet economy and potentially profits of the companies involved. Other chief executives asked to testify include the heads of Comcast Corp, Netflix Inc and Charter Communications Inc. Several companies said they were reviewing the letter but none immediately said if they will testify. Comcast said it welcomed the hearing and “believes the best way to stop the regulatory ping-pong on this important issue is for Congress to enact bipartisan legislation.” “A strong consensus is forming across party lines and across industries that it’s time for Congress to call a halt on the back-and-forth and set clear net neutrality ground rules for the internet,” said Representative Greg Walden, a Republican, who chairs the committee. “The time has come to get everyone to the table and get this figured out.” Democrats on the committee want Republicans to invite small businesses and consumers, not just the CEOs from some of the “largest corporations in the world with a combined market capitalization of nearly $2.5 trillion,” said a statement from Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. and Communications and Technology Subcommittee Ranking Member Mike Doyle, both Democrats. Democrats have so far refused to work with Republicans on internet legislation. A group representing major technology firms last week urged the FCC to abandon plans to rescind the rules barring internet service providers from hindering consumer access to web content or offering paid “fast lanes.” Major internet service have urged the FCC, however, to reverse the rules, even as they vowed not to hinder internet access. In May, the FCC voted 2-1 to advance Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to withdraw the former Obama administration’s order reclassifying internet service providers as if they were utilities. The FCC is considering whether it has the authority to limit internet providers’ ability to block, throttle or offer “paid prioritization,” and, if so, whether it should keep any regulations in place. More than 12 million public comments have been filed on the proposal. The Internet Association, a group representing Facebook, Google, Microsoft Corp and Twitter Inc, said last week it was “open to alternative legal bases for the rules, either via legislative action codifying the existing net neutrality rules or via sound legal theories offered by the commission.” ","

 ,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union authorities have increased pressure on Facebook, Twitter and Google to amend their user terms to bring them in line with EU law after proposals submitted by the tech giants were considered insufficient. The European Commission and consumer protection authorities in the bloc wrote to the three companies in June, asking them to improve their proposed changes to user terms by the end of September, according to letters sent to the companies and seen by Reuters on Monday. The authorities have the power to issue fines if the companies fail to comply. Twitter did not respond immediately to an emailed request for comment and a Google spokesman declined to make immediate comment. Facebook said it believes that the company is compliant with EU law but recognised that its terms could be made easier to understand and would work to meet the authorities’ concerns. The concerns centre mainly on procedures the social media companies proposed to set up for the removal of illegal content on their websites, terms limiting their liability and terms allowing them unilaterally to remove content posted by users. The U.S. trio were given until July 20 to submit new proposals, which need to be implemented by the end of September, the letters said. A person familiar with the matter said that two of the companies had submitted amended proposals, while a third had asked for more time, declining to specify which one. The companies had first proposed changes to their terms and conditions in March to assuage the regulators’ concerns in March. The sticking points were terms such as those that forced European consumers to seek redress in California, where the companies are based, instead of the consumer’s home country. U.S. technology companies have faced tight scrutiny in Europe for the way they do business, from privacy issues to how quickly they remove illegal or threatening content. The authorities and the Commission asked the companies to provide more detail on the timeframe and deadlines they would apply to dealing with notifications of content deemed illegal under consumer law, as well as dedicating a page or email address to notifications from consumer authorities. In addition, the bodies are pressing for a procedure whereby consumers would be notified before their content is removed or given an opportunity to challenge it. In the case of Alphabet’s Google unit, the concerns were about its social network Google+. ","

 ,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Animated chatter spills out from a corner of tech giant Google’s Nairobi offices as five Kenyan schoolgirls discuss their upcoming trip to California where they hope to win $15,000 for I-cut, an app to end Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). The five teenagers, aged 15 to 17, are the only Africans selected to take part in this year’s international Technovation competition, where girls develop mobile apps to end problems in their communities. “FGM is a big problem affecting girls worldwide and it is a problem we want to solve,” Stacy Owino told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, while snacking on chocolate on a break from boarding school before flying to the United States on Aug. 6. “This whole experience will change our lives. Whether we win or not, our perspective of the world and the possibilities it has will change for the better.” The five girls from Kenya’s western city of Kisumu call themselves the ‘Restorers’ because they want to “restore hope to hopeless girls”, said Synthia Otieno, one of the team. One in four Kenyan women and girls have undergone FGM, which involves the partial or total removal of the external genitalia, even though it is illegal in the East African nation. Although the girls’ Luo community does not practice FGM, they have friends who have been cut. “We were very close but after she was cut she never came back to school,” said Purity Achieng, describing a classmate who underwent FGM. “She was among the smartest girls I knew.” I-cut connects girls at risk of FGM with rescue centers and gives legal and medical help to those who have been cut. Its simple interface has five buttons - help, rescue, report, information on FGM, donate and feedback – offering users different services. Kenya is one of the most technologically advanced countries in Africa, known for its pioneering mobile money transfer apps. Technovation, which is sponsored by Google, Verizon and the United Nations, aims to teach girls the skills they need to become tech entrepreneurs and leaders. “We just have to use this opportunity as a stepping stone to the next level,” said schoolgirl Ivy Akinyi who plans to become  computer programmer.

 ,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"(This July 24 story corrects paragraph 6 to read “share maps for free with customer consent” instead of “sell maps”) By Jan  Wolfe (Reuters) - The Roomba robotic vacuum has been whizzing across floors for years, but its future may lie more in collecting data than dirt. That data is of the spatial variety: the dimensions of a room as well as distances between sofas, tables, lamps and other home furnishings. To a tech industry eager to push “smart” homes controlled by a variety of Internet-enabled devices, that space is the next frontier. “There’s an entire ecosystem of things and services that the smart home can deliver once you have a rich map of the home that the user has allowed to be shared,” said Angle. Angle told Reuters that iRobot, which made Roomba compatible with Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant in March, could reach a deal to share its maps for free with customer consent to one or more of the Big Three in the next couple of years. Angle added the company could extract value from those agreements by connecting for free with as many companies as possible to make the device more useful in the home. Amazon declined to comment, and Apple and Google did not respond to requests for comment. So far investors have cheered Angle’s plans, sending iRobot stock soaring to $102 in mid-June from $35 a year ago, giving it a market value of nearly $2.5 billion on 2016 revenue of $660 million. But there are headwinds for iRobot’s approach, ranging from privacy concerns to a rising group of mostly cheaper competitors - such as the $300 Bissell SmartClean and the $270 Hoover Quest 600 - which are threatening to turn a once-futuristic product into a commoditized home appliance. Low-cost Roomba rivals were the subject of a report by short-seller Ben Axler of Spruce Point Capital Management, which sent the stock down 20 percent to $84 at the end of June. The company’s smart home vision has helped bring around some former critics. Willem Mesdag, managing partner of hedge fund Red Mountain Capital - who led an unsuccessful proxy fight against Angle last year and wound up selling his iRobot shares - is now largely supportive of the company’s direction. “I think they have a tremendous first-mover advantage,” said Mesdag, who thinks iRobot would be a great acquisition for one of the Big Three. “The competition is focused on making cleaning products, not a mapping robot.” Founded in 1990, iRobot saw early success building bomb disposal robots for the U.S. Army before launching the world’s first “robovac” in 2002. The company sold off its military unit last year to focus on the consumer sector, and says the Roomba - which ranges in price from $375 to $899 - still has 88 percent of the U.S. robovac market. All robovacs use short-range infrared or laser sensors to detect and avoid obstacles, but iRobot in 2015 added a camera, new sensors and software to its flagship 900-series Roomba that gave it the ability to build a map while keeping track of their own location within it. So-called simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology right now enables Roomba, and other higher-end Robovacs made by Dyson and other rivals, to do things like stop vacuuming, head back to its dock to recharge and then return to the same spot to finish the job. Guy Hoffman, a robotics professor at Cornell University, said detailed spatial mapping technology would be a “major breakthrough” for the smart home. Right now, smart home devices operate “like a tourist in New York who never leaves the subway,” said Hoffman. “There is some information about the city, but the tourist is missing a lot of context for what’s happening outside of the stations.” With regularly updated maps, Hoffman said, sound systems could match home acoustics, air conditioners could schedule airflow by room and smart lighting could adjust according to the position of windows and time of day. Companies like Amazon, Google and Apple could also use the data to recommend home goods for customers to buy, said Hoffman. One potential downside is that sharing data about users’ homes raises clear privacy issues, said Ben Rose, an analyst who covers iRobot for Battle Road Research. Customers could find it “sort of a scary thing,” he said. Angle said iRobot would not sharing data without its customers’ permission, but he expressed confidence most would give their consent in order to access the smart home functions. Another Roomba risk is that cheaper cleaning products are what consumers really want. In May, the New York Times’ Sweethome blog dethroned the $375 Roomba 690 as its most-recommended robovac in favor of the $220 Eufy RoboVac 11, saying the connectivity and other advanced features of the former would not justify the greater cost for most users. Short-seller Axler’s June report caused a stir mostly with its prediction that value-priced appliance maker SharkNinja Operating LLC could launch a robovac by year’s end. SharkNinja declined to comment. One potential iRobot bulwark against these new competitors: a portfolio of 1,000 patents worldwide covering the very concept of a self-navigating household robot vacuum as well as basic technologies like object avoidance. A lawyer for Hoover declined to comment. Lawyers for Bissell and Black & Decker did not respond to requests for comment. The patents are a “huge part of our competitive moat,” Angle said. “It is getting really hard not to step on our intellectual property.” ","

 ,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Adobe Systems Inc’s Flash, a once-ubiquitous technology used to power most of the media content found online, will be retired at the end of 2020, the software company announced Tuesday. Adobe, along with partners Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc’s Google, Facebook Inc and Mozilla Corp, said support for Flash will ramp down across the internet in phases over the next three years. After 2020, Adobe will stop releasing updates for Flash and web browsers will no longer support it. The companies are encouraging developers to migrate their software onto modern programming standards. “Few technologies have had such a profound and positive impact in the internet era,” said Govind Balakrishnan, vice president of product development for Adobe Creative Cloud. Created more than 20 years ago, Flash was once the preferred software used by developers to create games, video players and applications capable of running on multiple web browsers. When Adobe acquired Flash in its 2005 purchase of Macromedia, the technology was on more than 98 percent of personal computers connected to the web, Macromedia said at the time. But Flash’s popularity began to wane after Apple’s decision not to support it on the iPhone. In a public letter in 2010, late Apple CEO Steve Jobs criticized Flash’s reliability, security and performance. Since then, other technologies like HTML5 have emerged as alternatives to Flash. In the past year, several web browsers have begun to require users to enable Flash before running it. On Google’s Chrome, the most popular web browser, Flash’s usage has already fallen drastically. In 2014, Flash was used each day by 80 percent of desktop users. That number is now at 17 percent “and continues to decline,” Google said in a blog Tuesday. “This trend reveals that sites are migrating to open web technologies, which are faster and more power-efficient than Flash,” Google said. “They’re also more secure.” Flash, however, remains in use among some online gamers. Adobe said it will work with Facebook as well as Unity Technologies and Epic Games to help developers migrate their games. Adobe said it does not expect Flash’s sunset to have an impact on its bottom line. “In fact, we think the opportunity for Adobe is greater in a post-Flash world,” Balakrishnan said. ","

 ,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nasdaq hit a record high on Monday ahead of a big week of technology earnings reports, while the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials lagged behind as losses in healthcare heavyweight Johnson & Johnson took a toll. The major U.S. indexes are trading around record-high levels with a huge batch of second-quarter corporate reports due this week. The company’s report will be critical for supporting the run for the tech .SPLRCT sector, which has outperformed all major groups this year. “The tech sector is the leading sector so far this year,”said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Bank in Columbus, Ohio. “It’s going to be important that those FANG stocks set a positive tone and give positive guidance.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 66.9 points, or 0.31 percent, to 21,513.17, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 2.63 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,469.91 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 23.05 points, or 0.36 percent, to 6,410.81. Tech and financials .SPSY were the only two of the 11 major S&P sectors to finish in positive territory. The market’s run to record highs, including a 10.4 percent rise for the S&P 500 in 2017, has left equities relatively expensive and investors counting on earnings to justify the valuations. The S&P 500 is trading at around 17.7 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, well above their long-term average of 15 times. With more than one-fifth of the S&P 500 having reported results, earnings are now expected to have climbed 8.8 percent in the second quarter, up from a projection of an 8-percent rise at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. This week alone, 190 S&P 500 companies are expected to report quarterly results. “There is a lot of earnings coming out this week, so some people may just be sitting on the sidelines with a wait-and-see approach,” said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. “There’s a lot of anticipation about this earnings season.” Investors are also looking ahead to the Federal Reserve’s post-meeting statement due on Wednesday for clues about the future path of interest rate hikes. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 5.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.1 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. ","

Chris Neiger,08032017,Fool,07272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has its eye on the mobile virtual reality (VR) market and on its recent second-quarter, 2017 earnings call it looks as if the company is working to expand its reach in the nascent market. Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, said on the call that; We continue to work on the next generation of computing platforms, virtual and augmented reality. By the end of this year, there'll be 11 Daydream-ready devices on the market from manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Motorola and ASUS. Image source: Google. You can read about some of Google's recent augmented reality plans here, but let's focus right now on those 11 VR devices. The Daydream VR platform launched last year as a place for Android users to find and download VR apps, and it already has more than 150 apps on it. It might seem like a minor point Pichai made on the earnings call, but the growing number of devices point toward a large mobile VR market that Google is set on dominating. There are already a handful of Daydream VR-ready devices, like the company's own Google Pixel phones, Motorola's Moto Z, and Samsung recently said its Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus would soon receive updates to run Daydream. And Google is already leading the way in mobile VR headset sales. The company's Cardboard and Daydream View headsets accounted for 69% of mobile VR headsets last year. Adding additional VR-ready devices will allow Google to expand its Daydream platform and tap into the mobile VR market even further. A market which is expected to be worth $10.9 billion by 2021. The real opportunity here for Google is in getting more users to download Daydream apps, which fuels growth for the company's Google Play app store and, eventually, more ad revenue. App Annie recently said that Google Play revenue will jump from about $16 billion in 2016 to $42 billion in 2021. It's still unclear where that additional revenue will come from, but advertising revenue is likely a good bet. Google is already working on ways to serve up ads inside of Daydream apps that could help drive ad revenue inside the Play store higher. The disclosure that there will be 11 devices on the market this year that can run Daydream VR apps isn't going to bring in truckloads of cash for Google anytime soon. But it's yet another step toward the company dominating the mobile VR space. No other company is selling more mobile VR headsets right now and none have the mobile VR advertising opportunity that Google's VR apps could bring. This position will likely be a slow burn for Google over the coming years. But investors should remember that users downloaded 82 billion apps from the Google Play store in the last year alone and there are currently more than 2 billion monthly active Android devices worldwide.  As Google's Daydream VR platform is added to more devices the company's opportunity to profit from mobile VR grows. Because of that, investors should be pleased to see the news of more Daydream-ready devices hitting the market -- and keeping an eye out for future announcements as well. ","

"Travis Hoium, Jeremy Bowman, and Demitrios Kalogeropoulos",08032017,Fool,07272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When Google, now part of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) went public in 2004, it was a well-known search company, but it wasn't the internet behemoth we know today. It wasn't until years later that it began to dominate cellphones, online video, and the fabric of advertising as we know it. We asked three of our investors to name a company they think looks a lot like Google, with potentially misunderstood upside potential that investors can profit from. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) are three stocks that made the list. They may not be the next Google, but they have a better shot than most companies. Image source: Getty Images. Travis Hoium (Snap): In 2004, Google was a well-known company on the internet, but it was actually smaller than Yahoo! (which is now a subsidiary of Verizon) in terms of revenue, and there was genuine debate about which company was better positioned to capture growth on the internet. Today, Snap is in a similar position: revered by young users who can't take their eyes off the social network, and genuinely misunderstood by many, including Wall Street. But I think Snap has a much brighter future than the market is pricing in today, and has the potential to branch into new businesses, just as Google did. In 2004, Google's revenue jumped 117.6% to $3.19 billion. Snap hasn't been public for a full year, but in the first quarter its revenue was up 286% to $149.6 million. And with ads showing up more regularly on the platform, I think we can count on more growth in the future. Snap also has the opportunity to expand its product to compete with other social-media platforms. It's already added memories to its vanishing-image and video-sharing capabilities, and is moving toward allowing users to edit the videos they share, which would improve quality. Snap Spectacles may not have been the huge hit the company wanted them to be, but with more wearables on the horizon, it's possible the company will make its way onto other imaging platforms in the future, even if that isn't with its own hardware. Snap is popular and growing, but we don't know what the company will look like in a decade or two. That's not unlike Google. And with its current market cap around $15 billion, I like the upside Snap gives investors willing to bet on the platform. Jeremy Bowman (Netflix): At its initial public offering in 2004, Google had a market cap of just $23 billion. However, the company held a dominant position in search, and was deservedly one of the most coveted IPOs at the time. Shares quickly surged and have returned nearly 1,800% since then, as the company has grown organically and through acquisitions. The stock today that I think most resembles Google back then is Netflix. Like Google, Netflix has established a dominant position in a market that's just beginning to take off: video streaming. The company is valued at around $80 billion after posting blockbuster subscriber growth in its latest earnings report, but the stock could still double or triple from here. That's because video streaming, or ""internet TV"" as the company likes to call it, is an enormous market, and improvements in technology are only making it bigger. Netflix has just reached 100 million global subscribers, with about 50 million domestically and 50 million abroad, but the company envisions reaching 60 million to 90 million households in the U.S., and many more internationally. Netflix is currently posting minimal profits, but the company is targeting an operating margin of 7% this year and it should scale up from there. As profits grow, the stock should continue to move higher. Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Shopify): E-commerce software specialist Shopify boasts a few attractive qualities that will remind investors of an IPO-era Google. Here's the overarching one: The founder-led company is building a lead position in an industry with massive long-term growth prospects. The Canada-based business runs a platform that helps merchants connect with their customers online. Its recent business results demonstrate the strength of that business-to-consumer approach. Revenue jumped 75% in the fiscal first quarter. The company handled $4.8 billion of merchandise volume, for an 81% improvement over the prior year, as online sellers flocked to Shopify's flexible multichannel platform. Numbers like these add weight to management's claim that the company is ""becoming the de facto platform for sellers."" Like Google in its early days as a public company, Shopify is just scratching the surface on initiatives aimed at monetizing its engaged user base. Its high-margin subscription offerings, including the Shopify Plus plans, are an early hit with larger merchants and have helped push recurring revenue up to 16% of its sales base. As a result, gross profit grew at a faster pace than revenue in the first quarter. CEO Tobias Lutke and his executive team are aiming to scale up their merchant base as quickly as possible, while also keeping their products' functionality and customer service ahead of the competition. Those are expensive challenges that currently keep the company operating at a loss. Yet shareholders have good reasons to expect solid returns from this strategy if it yields a dominant market-share position in this surging industry. ","
      
    3 Stocks That Look Just Like Google in 2004 -- The Motley Fool

Image source: Getty Images. Social Security is a critical income source for most retired Americans, and how much you will receive from it each month depends in large part on when you start collecting -- at your ""full"" retirement age, before it, or after. The full retirement age for Social Security used to be 65 for everyone, but it has been increased for many of us. For those born in 1937 or earlier, it remains 65, for those born in 1960 or later, it's 67, and for those born between 1937 and 1960, it's somewhere in between. No matter whether your full retirement age is 65, 66, or 67, you can claim and start collecting your benefits as early as age 62 and as late as age 70. For every year beyond your full retirement age that you delay starting to receive benefits, you'll increase their value by about 8% -- until age 70. So delaying from age 67 to 70 can leave you with checks about 24% fatter. If your full retirement age is 67 and you start collecting benefits at age 62, they will be 30% smaller. Here's the kicker, though: The system is designed so that total benefits received are about the same -- a difference of $0 -- no matter when you start collecting, if you have an average life spans. Checks that start arriving at age 62 will be considerably smaller, but you'll receive many more of them. So for most people, it's close to a wash. The average monthly retirement benefit was recently $1,368. That amounts to $16,416 per year. If your earnings have been above average, you'll collect more than that -- but the overall maximum monthly Social Security benefit for those retiring at their full retirement age in 2017 is still just $2,687 -- or about $32,000 for the whole year. Image source: Getty Images. You may be wondering, though, just what kind of income beneficiaries receive by age. Below is an answer, in the form of average benefits paid by age as of the end of 2015, from the most recent (2016) Annual Statistical Supplement of the Social Security Administration (SSA): Age Average Monthly Benefit Annualized Benefit 62 $1,046 $12,552 63 $1,083 $12,996 64 $1,115 $13,380 65 $1,152 $13,824 66 $1,221 $14,652 67 $1,259 $15,108 68 $1,259 $15,108 69 $1,285 $15,420 70 $1,268 $15,216 Data source: Social Security Administration. It's worth noting that if you were to drill down into the SSA's data, you'd see that women's average benefits are significantly lower, on average. That reflects the fact that women often earn much less than men (often for the same work) and they are much more likely than men to be out of the workforce for some years, caring for children or parents. Image source: Getty Images. The table above might not be as useful to you as you would think, though, because the amount that, say, a 65-year-old is collecting now isn't likely to be close to what you'd be collecting when you turn 65. So let's look at some other tables. Here's how much smaller your checks will be if you start collecting them before your full retirement age. (Again, remember that you'll be collecting many more checks if you start early, and for those who live an average-length life, it will be a wash.) Start Collecting at: Full Retirement Age of 65 Full Retirement Age of 66 Full Retirement Age of 67 62 80% 75% 70% 63 86.7% 80% 75% 64 93.3% 86.7% 80% 65 100% 93.3% 86.7% 66 100% 93.3% 67 100% Data source: Social Security Administration. How much bigger can your checks get? It depends on how long you delay starting to collect benefits. For each year you delay from your full retirement age, your benefits will increase by a certain sum -- depending on your birth year. Check out the table below: Year of Birth Annual Increase in Benefits 1933-1934 5.5% 1935-1936 6% 1937-1938 6.5% 1939-1940 7% 1941-1942 7.5% 1943 or later 8% Data source: Social Security Administration. Of course, the best way to estimate what you'll receive from Social Security is to get the information from the horse's mouth, by checking with the Social Security Administration. Set up a ""my social Security"" account and you can get a lot of information on your estimated benefits. When you start to collect your benefits will have a big influence on how big your checks are, but there are other ways to maximize your Social Security benefits. The more you learn, the better off you may be in retirement. ","

All things considered, apart from Yandex's continued market-share slide in search -- which the company is working hard to stem per the terms of a settlement with Google earlier this year -- there was little not to like about this report.

Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) announced with its third-quarter earnings results that it will close all 379 Teavana locations over the next year. Starbucks bought Teavana in 2012 for $620 million, and modestly expanded its store count over the last five years. But as mall traffic falls and Starbucks struggles to live up to expectations for comparable-store sales, it's cutting some of the fat. ""Many of our Teavana mall-based stores have been persistently underperforming,"" CEO Kevin Johnson said on Starbucks' third-quarter earnings call. ""We conducted a strategic review of the Teavana mall-based store business and concluded that despite our efforts to reverse the trend through creative merchandising and new store designs, the underperformance was likely to continue."" Getting rid of Teavana stores may cause some short-term pain, but should result in a slimmer, faster-growing Starbucks. Image source: Starbucks Getting rid of Teavana stores will effectively dissolve Starbucks' ""all-other segments."" The only thing left will be its Starbucks Reserve stores, of which there are only a handful of locations right now. All-other segments has produced a modest operating loss for Starbucks every year since its Teavana acquisition. This past quarter, Starbucks took a $102 million asset-impairment writedown on Teavana. Overall, the writedown had a 0.6% negative impact on operating margin for the quarter. Starbucks will likely suffer more costs as it closes down most of the 379 Teavana stores over the next year. In the long term, however, it should pay off. As mentioned, Teavana stores were creating an operating loss for Starbucks. That totaled a $10 million loss in the third quarter (after discounting the writedown), and it was nearly $15 million in the same period last year. During the earnings call, CFO Scott Maw said, ""Removing the ongoing operating loss and associated overhead will result in a fairly rapid payback of our exit costs."" While Starbucks is closing its Teavana stores, it's not doing away with the Teavana brand like it did with La Boulange. Teavana is a strong, international brand, and Starbucks will continue to use it for tea sold in its stores and grocery distributors. Starbucks recently started a partnership with Anheuser-Busch InBev to distribute ready-to-drink Teavana tea. So far, it's going very well. ""We have already shipped over 2.5 million bottles of Teavana ready-to-drink teas in just 5 months, with all 4 flavors already ranking in the top 10 in the premium single-serve [ready-to-drink] category in our active markets,"" Maw told analysts. Additionally, Starbucks plans to launch packaged tea in grocery stores under the Teavana brand by the end of next year. It already sells packaged tea under its Tazo brand, but the Teavana brand could be an even more upscale product, further supporting its consumer packaged-goods sales. Meanwhile, Starbucks continues to innovate around tea in its retail stores. It recently introduced iced-tea infusions using fruit instead of sugar. Management says it expects to sell over $1.6 billion worth of Teavana handcrafted beverages around the world this year. What's more, these beverages carry a higher gross margin and operating margin compared to espresso drinks. Tea is still a rapidly growing category in Starbucks stores. It's growing fastest in China and Japan, up 60% year over year. Considering Starbucks just made a big investment in its Chinese operations, Teavana will continue to play a big role in its results going forward. Getting rid of the stores, which were dragging down operating profits, makes a lot of strategic sense. ","

"Steve Symington, Timothy Green, and Anders Bylund",08032017,Fool,07272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It can be both frustrating and delightful to watch a stock that you love continue to climb. One one hand, if you own shares already, you're participating in that stock's gains as you watch the value of your investment grow. On the other hand, it means that any shares you purchase going forward will need to be at that higher price -- unless, of course, the stock pulls back and gives you another chance to buy at a discount. To that end, we asked three top Motley Fool investors to each pick a stock they would consider buying on a pullback. Read on to learn why they chose Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST). Image source: Getty Images. Steve Symington (Alphabet): I would have happily pitched the opportunity to buy Alphabet stock on any pullback in recent weeks. But as luck would have it, opportunistic investors have been presented with just such a chance following the Google parent's second-quarter 2017 report last week. More specifically, Alphabet stock has dropped 5% since then despite the fact it exceeded Wall Street's expectations on both revenue (up 21% year over year to $26.01 billion) and earnings (down 28% to $3.524 billion, or $5.01 per share). To be fair, Alphabet's bottom line was held back by a massive $2.74 billion antitrust fine imposed against the company in late June by the European Commission (EC), which ruled that Google has unfairly boosted its own comparison-shopping service in search results over services by competitors. Alphabet, for its part, has promised to review the decision in detail as it considers its next steps and a potential appeal, but has insisted in the meantime that it disagrees with the EC's findings. But it's simply incredible that Alphabet can easily absorb that fine in its entirety through a single quarter's income statements. For that, the company can thank the relative health of its core advertising business, where revenue climbed more than 18% last quarter to just under $22.7 billion, driven by a 52% increase in aggregate paid clicks on strong performances from both mobile search and YouTube. At the same time, it didn't stop Alphabet from continuing to invest in its unprofitable ""Other Bets"" segment, comprised mostly of high-potential businesses like Fiber high-speed internet, Nest connected home products, Verily life sciences products, and the Waymo self-driving vehicle initiative. In short, not even a record-setting fine can put much of a dent in Alphabet's ironclad business. And even then, there's a chance it may not be on the hook if it can successfully plead its case. In the meantime, I think the recent pullback is a great chance for long-term investors to open or add to a position. Anders Bylund (Alibaba):  There's no doubt in my mind that Alibaba's business is going places. At the same time, the stock chart might be a bumpy ride and you might be able to get a better deal on Alibaba shares by waiting for a steep price dip. The China-based e-commerce specialist is enjoying fantastic growth right now. Sales are increasing by 51% year over year while earnings rose 83% in the latest quarterly report and free cash flows more than doubled. These are the growth rates of a young, hungry company that is earning a premium valuation the hard way. On top of that, Alibaba's business footprint is massive. I mean, the company managed $550 billion of gross merchandise value in the last four quarters, and that makes it the biggest retailer in the world. This massive business scale plus huge growth equals an even larger growth premium. But wait -- there's more. Yes, China is a large and growing retail market, but the rest of the world is still many times greater. 90% of Alibaba's revenues were generated in China last year, and management is explicitly ""laying the foundation for long-term growth"" in international sales. Alibaba is huge, is growing very fast, and is mapping out a next-level international growth strategy as we speak. Meanwhile, the stock is on sale for 26 times forward earnings. That's arguably expensive, unless you factor in the company's epic growth prospects. So yeah, feel free to wait for a dip before buying in -- the P/E ratio sure looks lofty. But to each, their own. Trying to time the market is a dangerous game, and you're just as likely to miss out on big gains if Alibaba's stock simply marches upward from here. In the immortal words of Warren Buffett, ""It is far better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price."" In my view, buying Alibaba on a large share price pullback might actually be the brave thing to do here. The stock is very likely to serve you well even if you start from a rich valuation. Tim Green (Costco): Shares of warehouse club Costco recently slumped following Amazon's bold entry into the brick-and-mortar grocery market with its proposed acquisition of Whole Foods Market. The stock is down about 16% from recent highs, with investors no doubt concerned that Amazon is set to become a larger threat. COST data by YCharts I think that threat is overblown, given Costco's unmatched price advantage thanks to its membership model. But I also think the stock is too expensive even after the Amazon-induced pullback. Costco trades for around 25 times last year's earnings, a lofty multiple for a company that isn't growing very fast. In fiscal 2016, revenue rose by just 2.2%, while per-share earnings dropped slightly. Costco is a great company, with a consistency that's almost unheard of in retail. It's also proven to be mostly Amazon-proof, giving it time to figure out its e-commerce strategy. But even the best company can be a bad investment if the price is too high. I think Costco falls into that category. One pullback isn't enough to make Costco an attractive investment. The company's results have been stellar lately, with comparable sales up 6% in June, so the pessimism that drove the stock lower may not last long. But more Amazon-related news could send the stock lower again, and at a more reasonable valuation Costco is a stock to consider. ","

The millennial generation, the demographic group that's currently between 21 and 35 years old, could be worth up to $24 trillion by 2020, according to UBS, thanks to higher incomes as well as entrepreneurial activities and inheritance. This is a massive amount of wealth, and here's how you could set up your stock portfolio to profit from it. One big driver of the wealth will be inheritance. In a recent report, UBS said the millennial generation will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of intergenerational wealth transfer in history. In addition, millennials are an entrepreneurial group -- millennials launch businesses twice as often as baby boomers -- and those who aren't growing their own businesses are entering the part of their careers where salaries tend to grow. Image source: Getty Images. Perhaps the most important factor when choosing investments that could profit from the millennial generation is understanding how this group spends its money. UBS points out in its report that millennials desire convenience and multi-channel delivery, with many millennials using social media as part of their shopping experience and doing more shopping online than previous generations have. In addition, one of the most investable trends is that millennials value experiences as opposed to ownership. In other words, millennials would rather do things than buy things. According to a report from Charles Schwab, millennials spend more on experiential and convenience-related expenses than previous generations have. For example, 79% of millennials report spending money at eating at ""one of the hot restaurants in town,"" compared with 66% of Generation X and 56% of baby boomers. Seventy-three percent report spending money on live events, such as concerts and sporting events, while the percentages drop to 65% and 55% for Gen-Xers and baby boomers, respectively. Since millennials value experiences and convenience, we can search for companies that provide these things. Here are three examples of companies with millennial-focused business models. One of my favorite ways to invest in the growth potential of the experience-based economy is through real estate. For example, EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) invests in properties such as megaplex movie theaters, waterparks, ski resorts, and other entertainment and recreation businesses. The company has grown impressively in recent years and reports that spending in movie theaters has been very strong, especially thanks to trends such as high-end food options and more luxurious surroundings. The company also invests in education properties such as public charter schools, another high-growth trend. Payment-processing company Square (NYSE:SQ) is another excellent millennial play, this time on the convenience factor. An investment in Square is a play on millennials' tendency to not carry cash, as Square aims to bring credit and debit card acceptance to small- and medium-sized businesses all over the world. The company's growth has been impressive so far, with payment volume up by 33% over the past year alone, and service revenue more than doubling. Even so, about two-thirds of businesses around the world don't yet accept credit cards, so there's still lots of room to grow. Consumers -- especially millennials -- clearly prefer non-cash payments, and Square's lower-cost and easy-to-use platform could become a favorite of businesses around the world. As a final example, internet-only bank BofI Holding (NYSE:AX) could be worth a look. Simply put, millennials don't go to the bank, so BofI's checking and savings products make lots of sense for millennials. Because of the bank's online-only business model, it doesn't have to pay for branches and other expenses involved with a physical banking operation, and it can offer higher interest rates on deposits than most of its competitors can. In addition, the low overhead translates into excellent efficiency and profitability, and the bank is growing fast. The combination translates into an excellent long-term opportunity. ","

Throughout most of Social Security's history, full retirement age was 65. Then, legislation passed in the early 1980s gradually increased the age, which is why it currently sits at 66 for beneficiaries reaching retirement age. If you're born after 1954, your retirement age will be even later than that. Here's what you need to know about your full retirement age, and what it could mean for your Social Security retirement benefits. Because of legislation passed in 1983, the full retirement age is set to gradually increase to 67 for future retirees. Image Source: Getty Images. Specifically, if you were born after 1954, here's a guide to help you find your full retirement age: If You Were Born in... Your Full Retirement Age Is... 1955 66 years, 2 months 1956 66 years, 4 months 1957 66 years, 6 months 1958 66 years, 8 months 1959 66 years, 10 months 1960 or later 67 years Data source: Social Security Administration. Here's why knowing your full retirement age is important. You can claim Social Security at any time between age 62 and 70. However, if you choose to claim benefits before your full retirement age, your monthly benefit amount is permanently lowered. On the other hand, if you choose to wait until after your full retirement age, your benefit will be permanently increased. Depending on how early or late you choose to claim your retirement benefit, your base monthly benefit -- known as your primary insurance amount, or PIA -- will be adjusted by these rules. If you're curious, a good estimate of your Social Security benefit can be found on your latest Social Security statement, available by creating an account at www.ssa.gov if you haven't already done so. The point is that as the full retirement age increases, Americans can get penalized more for claiming Social Security at a certain age before reaching full retirement age. Conversely, with a higher full retirement age, you'll have to delay Social Security for a longer amount of time to get a benefit increase. For example, let's say you were born in 1956 and your spouse was born in 1960. That means your full retirement age is 66 years and four months, while your spouse's full retirement age is 67. So if you both decide to claim Social Security at age 65, so that your benefits will begin at the same time you're eligible for Medicare, you'll be affected differently. You'll only be one year and four months away from your full retirement age, which means your benefit will be reduced by about 8.9%. Your spouse, on the other hand, will be claiming his or her benefit two years early, resulting in a reduction of 13.33%. In other words, if you both are eligible for $1,500 monthly Social Security benefits at full retirement age, you and your spouse would get benefits of $1,367 and $1,300, respectively, even though you both claimed benefits at the exact same age. The bottom line is that your full retirement age determines how your claiming age affects your Social Security benefits. Therefore, it's important to know your full retirement age and what it means to your benefits, so you can incorporate it into your retirement planning strategy. ","

Adam Levy,08032017,Fool,07272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported its second-quarter earnings results last week. While it surpassed expectations for revenue growth, the company's net income fell well below analysts' estimates. If investors were paying attention to what management has been saying for the past three or four quarters, perhaps expectations wouldn't have been that high. Amazon is in the midst of yet another investment cycle. And despite record amounts of cash coming in, the company is spending more than ever to continue growing its business. Management has talked about a ramp-up in investment since the second quarter of last year, when it made plans to double its video content spending and expand its fulfillment capacity. That growth in investment hasn't slowed down, and investors shouldn't expect it to anytime soon. Here are four big areas where Amazon is investing. Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon annoyingly lumps all of its technology and content spending into one line item. The biggest contributors, however, are its video content for Prime Instant Video and spending on Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing division. During the second quarter, technology and content spending increased 43% year over year. That's an acceleration from 37% in the first quarter and 28% growth in the second quarter last year. That incorporates the step up in spending on video content for Prime Video that Amazon started in the second half of last year. Growth in content spending may slow somewhat in the second half of the year as it laps its initial investment, but it won't slow too much as Amazon continues to expand its catalog, particularly internationally. The biggest driver last quarter was a significant increase in AWS infrastructure in the form of capital leases. CFO Brian Olsavsky told investors the company increased capital leases by 71% over the past year to service increased demand for AWS and expand geographically. That trend ought to continue as Amazon continues to battle for market share from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google in the rapidly growing cloud computing market. It's only natural that Amazon is hiring sales associates for two of its fastest growing businesses at a rapid clip. Overall headcount at Amazon expanded 42% year over year last quarter. Olsavsky says the sales teams for AWS and its burgeoning advertising business expanded at an even faster pace. Amazon reports its advertising revenue along with revenue from its co-branded credit card in its ""other"" category. Growth slowed to 53% last quarter, but reached $945 million. Olsavsky said, ""Advertising revenue growth has been strong and fairly consistent over the past three quarters,"" so it may be other items or legacy products in the other category producing the slowdown. Meanwhile, the increased marketing expenses (coupled with the increased infrastructure expense) caused AWS to exhibit a lower operating margin last quarter. Competitive pressure from Microsoft Azure also caused Amazon to institute lower pricing, as Microsoft starts to take away market share. The investments should help Amazon continue growing AWS at a strong pace. In case you hadn't heard, Amazon is growing extremely fast. Not only did revenue increase 25% last quarter, but paid units also grew 27%. (That may be a side effect of Prime, which enables customers to make more smaller orders without worrying about shipping fees.) What's more, revenue from third-party seller services increased 40% year over year. As a result of the growth in units and third-party shipments, Amazon continues to invest heavily in fulfillment capacity. Last year, it added about 30% more square footage to its distribution center network, and it plans to add a similar percentage this year. Most of those additions will come over the next few months as Amazon ramps up for the holiday season. Last year, 80% of its expansion took place in the second half of the year, and Olsavsky told investors to expect a similar split this year. Investors should see a big step up in capital spending next quarter. Amazon is an international business, and it's making a big push in some emerging markets, particularly in Asia. Last year, it expanded Prime to China and India, and it continues to invest billions of dollars in both countries. It's biggest focus, by far, appears to be India. ""We're very hopeful with the progress we've made with sellers and customers alike in India,"" Olsavsky said, ""and we see great momentum and success there. So we'll continue to invest."" Because of government regulations, Amazon doesn't sell items directly in India, instead operating a marketplace for third-party sellers. Just the same, Amazon is building out infrastructure to support its marketplace just as it's doing in the United States and other developed markets. That supports a valuable Prime membership, which offers similar benefits as in the U.S. -- free shipping, video streaming, and more. The size and growth of the opportunity in India and the rest of Asia make Amazon's investments a smart move for the long term. ","

That helped the Cupertino, California-based company earn a staggering $8.72 billion in its most recent three-month reporting period. No one denies that Apple makes high-quality products. Its smartphones and tablets are extremely popular for a reason, and though the company may benefit from a closed environment that can make it difficult for consumers to migrate elsewhere, the basis of that following started with forward-looking and advanced hardware.

Late in 2013, Apple released the second generation Mac Pro in its cylindrical form to wide praise for its design and innovation.

                                   have moved forward tremendously in terms of performance and efficiency, making the Mac Pro the most glaring example of a stalled development cycle. MacBook Even the MacBook, which is often promoted as one the best notebooks available for consumers, suffers from marginal technology stalls. The update cycles have recently been well behind that of their Windows-based counterparts. When Dell, Asus, Lenovo and the rest of the ecosystem integrated Intel Kaby Lake processors with improved performance and lower power consumption in November 2016, it took until June 2017 for Apple to use the same hardware. Apple’s inclusion of the Touch Bar is another example of the company’s inability to understand consumers and how they use hardware: It adds cost, lowers battery life and makes standard tasks like adjusting screen brightness overly complex. Mac mini I’m hesitant to even broach the subject of the Mac mini, Apple’s entry-level PC that last had a hardware refresh over 1,000 days ago. It is based on Intel dual-core Haswell architecture processors that were released in mid-2014, a slight regression from the previous hardware configuration in 2012 that included a true quad-core design. iPhone In the mobile space, Apple is the clear market leader, but slow adoption and evolution of technology is visible even there. The iPhone was slow to adapt to the market desire for larger screens, waiting years after the range of larger Android-based phones, such as the Galaxy Note series from Samsung

                                   were making waves. That trend extends into screen resolution (Apple lags behind, even today), screen technologies (competing phones integrated AMOLED as early as 2010), and screen bezel optimization (a flagship feature of the Samsung Galaxy series). Operating system Apple’s iOS operating system also trails Android in key areas of multi-tasking, support for consumer-friendly widgets and customization of the device. Its closed architecture makes third-party integration a hassle. Apple only added official water resistance support to the iPhone 7, while competitors like Samsung have integrated protection from elements to high-end smartphones for several generations. Another area that the iPhone market should be concerned about is the current legal battle between Apple and Qualcomm

                                   Despite the business-model debate that is playing out with lawyers and press releases, Qualcomm has the highest-performing and most advanced modem technology in the industry, offering features like Gigabit LTE well before competing solutions. Undervalued by consumers the majority of the time, connectivity effects the performance of nearly all aspects of a mobile device as well as power consumption and battery life. If Apple were to discontinue its use of Qualcomm modems, it would create another area in which competing mobile markets could extend its technological differentiation. As an added step of complexity, if this partnership would split, you can be assured of long-term litigation surrounding Apple’s development or use of competing modems. Siri Apple CEO Tim Cook stirred up controversy by extending the impact of Apple’s AI development past autonomous driving, but many consumers would ask the company to focus on perfecting its Siri personal assistant services first. Siri continues to be the least advanced of the major AI technologies that include Google

Product delays The continuing issues of availability on a product like Apple AirPods and rumors around the iPhone 8 delays point to other concerns the company may have in keeping up with competitors. No longer leading Apple is clearly one of the most important technology companies of our lifetime. But the past five-plus years have shown us that it cannot, or does not, want to remain on the bleeding edge of technological innovation or integration. There is risk to both paths. The early adopter of a new technology bears the cost of development and the gamble that it may not be a hit with consumers. On the other hand, constantly being behind the curve of technology risks alienating the influencers and early adopters that build brands.

Each of the five stocks is up sharply thus far this year, posting gains that range from about 20% to nearly 50%.

Related: Will tech rally continue? Hedge funds say yes, but mutual funds say no Earlier this year, the largest exchange-traded fund to track the tech sector hit an all-time high on a total-return basis, recovering the ground it lost in the wake of the dot-com era. On Thursday, an abrupt selloff in tech shares pressured the FAANG names (except for Facebook, which stayed higher in the wake of better-than-expected quarterly results), which in turn weighed on the overall market, pressuring the broader market and dragging the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to a close in negative territory.

Andy Pasztor,08032017,MarketWatch,07272017,"Published: July 27, 2017 8:05 p.m. ET By SpaceX has raised up to $350 million in a new round of financing that would value the company at around $21 billion, a vote of confidence for billionaire founder Elon Musk who is seeking to prove the rocket maker can use reusable engines to speed up launches and become a major satellite operator. The funding was revealed in a corporate filing, according to Equidate, a private-stock trading firm that estimated the new valuation of SpaceX based on an analysis of the document. Investors in the new round couldn’t be learned. SpaceX’s previous valuation was set in 2015 at $12 billion when Google parent Alphabet Inc. and mutual-fund company Fidelity Investments invested $1 billion.

Chief Financial Officer David Wehner sent the warning again Wednesday, after the company again beat Wall Street’s estimates for revenue and earnings. This time, Wehner was a bit more specific, noting the ad-load slowdown will show in the third quarter. “We continue to expect that ad load will be a significant factor in the remainder of 2017, and that starts in Q3,” Wehner said. These warnings could all be for naught, as Facebook seems to be pulling other levers to avoid negative financial effects from slowing its pattern of shoving more ads into the core News Feed product. Executives noted Wednesday that Facebook was getting higher prices for its ads, with a 24% increase in average unit pricing, due in part to slower supply of ads, though higher-cost video ads may be playing a part as well. Don’t miss: Facebook follows Google in recognizing earnings reality The company is also planning on spending less than it believed earlier in the year. Last quarter, Wehner said Facebook’s full year operating expenses would grow 40% to 50% in 2017; on Wednesday, he narrowed that spending growth to 40% to 45%.

Beyond cutting spending and selling more expensive ads, Facebook must start finding revenue from its younger properties to offset any slowing growth in the core social network, as it may be doing already with Instagram. Facebook’s earnings call was dominated by analyst questions about how and when the social media giant will see revenue from its other properties, especially its messaging apps, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg both pointed out that it will be a few years before the company starts to see real revenue from those properties. Zuckerberg noted early in the call that he wanted to see Facebook “move a little bit faster” in monetizing messaging, but Sandberg suggested it could take a while. “We have a lot of work to do to work on the format,” Sandberg said, adding that the company’s expertise in ads is in a news feed, which is quite different than a messaging product. Read also: Facebook needs Messenger to make money, and here is the plan Facebook is clearly trying to walk a fine line between trying not to annoy its users and making money from them, so it is currently beta testing ad products with a small number of users on Messenger. Even if Facebook struggles to find money from the two messaging apps, both of which have more than a billion users, it still has video ads, which could drive revenue higher just as mobile ads have done for Facebook in recent years. ““I actually think over the next couple of years or few years, the much bigger driver of the business and determinant of how we do is going to be video, not Messenger,” Zuckerberg said. Don’t miss: Elon Musk just burned Mark Zuckerberg in a tweet about AI But, just as with constant warnings about a slowdown paired with stunning growth rates, Facebook contradicts itself at times in video. It predicts that with video ads, pricing will improve with more engagement from consumers, but at the same time, those ads will take users away from the site for that time and could be a detriment to engagement. These mixed messages can be annoying, and investors would be wise to learn a lesson from them: What Facebook says about its business may be less important than the raw numbers that result. We will see if that holds up when Facebook reports earnings in three months, after yet another warning about slowing growth. Want this type of analysis sent to your inbox?

This marks the first major player in the virtual-reality space to officially reveal a standalone product intended for the broad consumer market. The benefits are that it’s more affordable and portable. Standalone VR headsets differ from current options in two distinct ways. First, they are disconnected from a PC and don’t require an attachment to a desktop for processing or display output.

Facebook-owned Oculus of Menlo Park, California, has not officially announced its intent, but rumors in July point us to another Qualcomm-powered headset that will sell for around $200. Facebook plans to reveal the hardware in October. HTC’s decision to target the China market first is driven by its ability to promote its custom Viveport software store in a region that does not offer Google services like the Android Play Store or Daydream. HTC will leverage a customer base that is larger than North America and Western Europe combined, and one that is expected to grow rapidly. IDC statistics show VR headset shipments reaching 10.1 million units this year and target 61 million units by 2020 worldwide. iResearch Consulting estimates Chinese VR market revenues will reach $8.1 billion in that time frame. Growth in VR and AR (augmented reality) is driven by consumer markets, but it is the enterprise implementations that provide the push for expanded usage models. Medical professionals already use VR technology to analyze data, and mechanical engineers can dissect and evaluate models of products in a virtual space to improve and speed up workflows. Target fields also include factory workers, emergency personnel, the military, delivery drivers and nearly all facets of business. As VR technology improves usability, comfort and general societal acceptance, the merger of virtual- and augmented-reality hardware will create a new age of connected consumers.

About 30,000 Americans have contributed a total $34 million to the program, called myRA, which launched in late 2014 as an option for households that didn’t have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, such as a 401k, the Treasury Department said. About 20,000 accounts have a median balance of $500, and the owners of 10,000 accounts made no contributions. RELATED: myRA retirement plan is dead. Here's some alternatives for your funds Ask a Fool: What's the difference between a 401(k) and a SIMPLE IRA? 8 ways to avoid early IRA withdrawal penalties Why smart people have retirement accounts  It has cost $70 million to manage the program — including server costs and promotion — which was likely to cost an additional $10 million annually going forward, the Treasury said. Seniors are working at the highest rates in 55 years, according to a recent U.S. jobs report. Sean Dowling (@seandowlingtv) has more.
    Buzz60 “Unfortunately, there has been very little demand for the program, and the cost to taxpayers cannot be justified by the assets in the program,” U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza said in a statement. “Fortunately, ample private-sector solutions exist, which resulted in less appeal for myRA.” Participants were notified by email this morning that the program will be phased out over the next few months, the Treasury said. They’ll receive information about moving their savings to a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA, unlike a traditional IRA, makes contributions with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free. Under the program, contributions were invested in U.S. Treasury savings bonds rather than a portfolio of stocks and bonds that typically yield higher returns over time. Workers could contribute up to $5,500 a year, or $6,500 for those 50 and older. A maximum of $15,000 could be contributed; at that point, the money would be rolled over to a private-sector retirement account. This month, Democratic senators sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin urging him to keep and promote the myRA program. It noted that this year, Congress rescinded two rules aimed at making it easier for states to create their own retirement savings programs for private-sector workers. “Given that this administration has worked to reduce access to retirement plans for millions of Americans, it is more critical than ever for the Treasury to strengthen one of their remaining options for retirement savings,” the senators wrote. They included Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., ranking member of the Senate HELP committee and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. The Trump administration has taken aim at other Obama-era consumer-friendly finance regulations as well. The Education Department rescinded a rule allowing student loan borrowers to apply for forgiveness if they were defrauded by for-profit schools. The Labor Department delayed implementation of key parts of the “fiduciary rule” that requires financial advisers to act in their clients’ best interest. Last month, the House voted for an administration-backed bill that would dismantle much of the Dodd-Frank financial changes aimed at preventing another financial crisis. Among other things, the legislation would weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by funding the agency from congressional appropriations.

Robert Powell,08032017,MarketWatch,07272017,"Published: July 29, 2017 11:01 a.m. ET The government spent $70 million and signed up only 20,000 people over 21 months By On paper, it was a great idea. On paper, it was designed to provide a way for the 30% of American workers who don’t have an employer-sponsored retirement plan to save for retirement. Read: Treasury to wind down the myRA retirement savings program In reality, after not quite two years of existence, it’s being tossed into the dustbin of history, right along side New Coke, the Edsel and other historic product failures. Launched by the Obama administration with much fanfare in November 2015, the myRA never quite took hold among employees and employers. In fact, the government spent some $70 million and signed up only 20,000 Americans to use the account over the course of 21 months. Read See: Treasury Announces Steps to Wind Down myRA Program When launched, myRA provided several ways for people to start saving. Workers could set up automatic direct deposit contributions to the myRA through their employer — through their paycheck; savers could fund a myRA account directly by setting up recurring or one-time contributions from their checking or savings account; or they could, at tax time, direct all or a portion of a federal tax refund to myRA. The problem, however, despite all the money spent getting people to save via a myRA, was that no one knew about the plan. “A good idea with terrible execution,” tweeted Blair duQuesnay, chief investment officer of ThirtyNorth Investments and co-portfolio manager of the Women Impact Strategy investing with a Gender Lens. Other advisers shared that point of view. “I never thought it had enough oomph to get off the ground,” said Joe Tomlinson, a certified financial planner. “I’m in the camp with people like Teresa Ghilarducci (a professor at the New School) who see the need for big changes to build a viable retirement system — with more federal government involvement — rather than programs that tinker around the edges.” At the time, the Treasury Department said the myRA was “designed as a starter retirement account to help bridge the savings gap for many of these workers.” Plus, it was supposed to appeal to “first-time savers, for whom a no-risk, principal-protected investment is more appealing than a higher-risk investment option,” the Treasury said in a release. Also see: People still aren’t saving for retirement — and that’s part of why myRA is shutting down Over time, as myRA account holders grew their savings, they had the option to transfer to a private-sector Roth IRA with diverse investment options at any time, or transfer to a private-sector Roth IRA once they reach the maximum myRA balance of $15,000, the Treasury said. “It never really did take off,” said Jack Towarnicky, the executive director of Plan Sponsor Council of America. “The MyRA was a limited IRA solution, offering a single investment option, and an arbitrary upper limit on asset accumulations. As mentioned in the Treasury press release, ‘Demand for and investment in the myRA program has been extremely low.’” The federal government launched the myRA in part because Americans tend to save through employer-sponsored or provided retirement plans rather than outside of work even though they can do so using Roth or traditional IRAs. The retail financial industry, however, never got behind the initiative, partly because it viewed the effort as competition. Plus, the Trump administration isn’t so fond of government-sponsored retirement plans. In fact, Ghilarducci suggested that shutting down the myRA was “yet another way Republicans seem to be siding with the retail financial management industry against people who want a secure and effective way to save.” Said Ghilarducci: “Winding down myRA really makes no sense. The program wasn’t a panacea to the retirement crisis; but it certainly helped people who used it.” Towarnicky agrees with that point of view. “MyRA was probably a success for the 20,000 individuals who signed up,” he said. “Many saved monies that they might otherwise have spent. And, hopefully, when MyRA closes down, they will not use the termination of the MyRA program as an excuse to withdraw monies — leakage. However, if success is defined as widespread use, MyRA was never likely to succeed. And, perhaps the only surprise is that we did not terminate the program once we knew of minimal enrollment — instead, investing $70 million and waiting three years.” Now what? So, what should workers who don’t have an employer-sponsored retirement do now? Experts say they should fund a traditional or Roth IRA account directly by setting up recurring or one-time contributions from their checking or savings account into a financial institution. “MyRA is an ‘access’ or ‘coverage’ solution — structured as a Roth IRA,” said Towarnicky. “However, every American wage earner has had access to a viable retirement savings solution for the last 35-plus years. It is called the Individual Retirement Account or IRA.” Almost all baby boomers who have consistently contributed the maximum to an IRA since 1982 — the past 35 years — and who continue IRA contributions up to or beyond their Social Security normal retirement age will generally succeed in financial preparation for retirement, said Towarnicky. “So, there hasn’t been a retirement savings ‘access’ or ‘coverage’ ‘crisis’ since at least 1982,” he said. “Similar to health care, America’s retirement ‘crisis’ is/was not one of ‘access’ or ‘coverage,’ but one of prioritization.” True enough. Unfortunately, people who don’t have a workplace plan weren’t prioritizing, they weren’t saving with the retirement accounts already available. So, government introduced a solution to address that problem. Alas, it was a great idea on paper, but not in reality. RIP myRA. We hardly knew you.

                                    a few years ago. Similar mini flash crashes involving substantial, instantaneous price moves take place about 12 times a day. Remember the flash crash back in 2010, when hundreds of stocks temporarily went bonkers and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dove 1,000 points in a few minutes? Mini flash crashes are the same thing yet on a smaller scale, with perhaps only one company’s shares going haywire for a fraction of a second. But they’re just as consequential, both for the individual stock and in the aggregate. Such bizarre events seem to contradict our basic beliefs about the fairness of values, the sophistication of modern markets and the oft-cited wisdom of the crowd. What’s going on? To find out, we developed a mathematical model to explore how all of these ideas fit together. We initially presumed that as long as there were lots of sharp investors with broad-ranging market views, mini flash crashes would be fairly uncommon. Surprisingly, we observed a “too many cooks spoil the broth”-type effect instead. Even the wisest crowd, if it’s large enough, can rapidly devolve into a mad herd and bring on these wild events. Over 20,000 mini flash crashes have been recorded since 2006, the year they really took off. Some were bigger than others, but many were pretty severe. They’re momentary, but if you get caught in one, you might incur substantial trading losses, reputational damage, fines and legal woes. More broadly, they may erode investors’ trust in markets, violate Nobel Prize-winning theories and even escalate into full-blown flash crashes like the big one from 2010. In fact, that infamous flash crash began as a disruption in a single instrument, the E-Mini S&P 500 futures contract. Sounds pretty serious, huh? Regulators agree and have installed measures in hopes of managing them. One rule wipes out trades that are obviously wrong (probably no one means to sell stock for hundredths of a penny). Another rule acts like a circuit breaker in your home, temporarily freezing markets when prices overheat. Traders pitch in as well. For example, have you ever heard of a fat-finger error? Maybe you wanted to sell one share at $100 but accidentally unloaded 100 shares at $1 because of a mistaken keystroke or two. Bang, the stock plunges 99% instantly. Financial firms maintain internal checks such as operational risk controls to avoid such havoc. Yet, despite all this, mini flash crashes keep happening, and some worry the problem is getting worse. To understand why the mini-flash-crash problem just won’t go away, we designed a model that takes all we know about investing and subjected it to mathematical analysis and computer simulations so we could observe whether a group of traders armed with various strategies could steer clear of mini flash crashes. For instance, in developing our model, we wanted to ensure that our “investors” devised their strategies as if they were actually human. In addition to classic questions like “Where are prices going?,” today’s traders ponder much more sophisticated issues before buying or selling. They might ask, “How confident am I in this answer? How often should I check back to make sure it’s still right? Am I worried about betting the bank? Could my trades themselves impact the future and change whether I’m ultimately right?” We plugged these considerations into mathematical formulas. Each of our investors was assigned specific parameters (like the models Wall Street traders use), which served as guides for how and when they would trade given various market conditions. In other words, we tried to make our simulated investors as complicated as real ones, with a healthy mix of characteristics. Here’s what we found. Our investors initially operated a calm and stable market, free of crashes. The supposed wisdom of the crowd prevailed, as long as certain conditions held true: 1. All investors were confident in their opinions about future markets. 2. All investors fully reworked their models often. That is, models (like the ones described above) can become corrupted over time and need to be readjusted. A failure of investors to readjust their models likely contributed to the dot-com bubble or the housing bubble, when we watched prices go up and up and figured that the good times would last forever. If only we’d taken a step back to check ourselves, right? 3. All investors were hesitant to take big risks. 4. There weren’t too many investors. It’s not that we found a specific number here; rather we discovered that the crowd sometimes got so large that the extra stability provided by their varied opinions got outweighed by their tendency to stampede toward a mini flash crash at the slightest tremor. But in a fast-moving market, these conditions didn’t always persevere. Even though investors were continually revising their views, they weren’t doing so fast enough to avoid being caught up in a herd mentality and selling off a stock along with everyone else in response to a lone investor’s opinion. Say some investor got spooked and started selling. This drove prices down a little, which may have worried a few others. They started selling too, causing prices to drop even further. Pretty soon, the whole market was unloading, and prices hit rock bottom. If our investors weren’t sure about their views, this all happened much faster. They’d change their beliefs on a dime. We saw the same thing when they weren’t afraid of taking risks or didn’t step back enough to reassess their strategies. What was most surprising for us, as previous believers in the strength of wise crowds, was that increased population size alone could be destabilizing. In fact, the number of investors active in our simulations was one of the greatest determinants of whether a mini flash crash would ensue. Our research suggests it may be impossible to completely stop mini flash crashes, as recent high-profile plunges in the prices of gold and silver demonstrate. Many market observers claim that such instantaneous tumbles are the “new normal.” Perhaps it’s not so startling. After all, back in 1841, Scottish journalist Charles Mackay had already brought the recurring nature of bubbles and crashes to the public’s attention in “Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds.” To some extent, it’s no wonder that they should be frequent and rapid these days, given the speed of today’s markets. That tulip trading persisted late into the night at Dutch taverns (after many rounds) has been cited as a potential cause of “Tulipmania,” an event in the 1600s where a single bulb is rumored to have cost as much as 50 live pigs. While we’re a long way from such things, the line between a wise crowd offering stability and a mad one creating chaos is clearly as thin as ever.

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"(Reuters) - Internet giant Google has fired the male engineer at the center of an uproar in Silicon Valley over the past week after he authored an internal memo asserting there are biological causes behind gender inequality in the tech industry. James Damore, the engineer who wrote the memo, confirmed his dismissal, saying in an email to Reuters on Monday that he had been fired for “perpetuating gender stereotypes”. Damore said he was exploring all possible legal remedies, and that before being fired, he had submitted a charge to the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) accusing Google upper management of trying to shame him into silence. “It’s illegal to retaliate against an NLRB charge,” he wrote in the email. Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc based in Mountain View, Calif., said it could not talk about individual employee cases. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told employees in a note on Monday that portions of the anti-diversity memo “violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace,” according to a copy of the note seen by Reuters. It was not immediately clear what legal authority Damore could try to invoke. Non-union or “at will” employees, such as most tech workers, can be fired in the United States for a wide array of reasons that have nothing to do with performance. The U.S. National Labor Relations Act guarantees workers, whether they are in a union or not, the right to engage in “concerted activities” for their “mutual aid or protection”. Damore, though, would likely face an uphill fight to seek that protection based on his memo, said Alison Morantz, a Stanford University law professor with expertise in labor law. “It’s going to be a hard sell that this activity was either concerted or for mutual aid or protection, rather than simply venting or pitting one group of workers against the others, which does not sound very mutual,” Morantz said. Debate over the treatment of women in the male-dominated tech industry has raged for months. Claims of persistent sexual harassment in the ranks of Uber Technologies Inc and of several venture capital firms led to management shakeups. Management at the largest tech firms, including Google, have publicly committed to diversifying their workforces, although the percentage of women in engineering and management roles remains low at many companies. The U.S. Department of Labor is investigating whether Google has unlawfully paid women less than men. The company has denied the charges. Damore asserted in his 3,000-word document that circulated inside the company last week that “Google’s left bias has created a politically correct monoculture” which prevented honest discussion of diversity. The engineer, who has a doctoral degree in systems biology from Harvard University, according to his LinkedIn page, attacked the idea that gender diversity should be a goal. “The distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and ... these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership,” Damore wrote in the memo. He quickly received support in conservative media outlets. On Breitbart News, once run by Steve Bannon, now chief strategist to President Donald Trump, commentators overnight discussed whether to boycott Google and switch to services such as Microsoft Corp’s Bing. Google’s vice president of diversity, Danielle Brown, sent a memo in response to the furor over the weekend, saying the engineer’s essay “advanced incorrect assumptions about gender”. ","

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"(Reuters) - Google executives over the weekend rushed to denounce an engineer’s memo that ascribed gender inequality in the  technology industry to biological differences, a view that sparked outrage at the internet giant and inflamed tensions over sexual harassment and discrimination in Silicon Valley. The unnamed engineer asserted in the 3,000-word document that circulated inside the company last week that “Google’s left bias has created a politically correct monoculture” which prevented honest discussion of the issue. “Distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership,” he wrote. The memo stoked the heated debate over treatment of women in the male-dominated Silicon Valley that has boiled for months following sexual harassment scandals at Uber Technologies Inc and several venture capital firms. Google’s recently hired vice president of diversity, integrity and governance, Danielle Brown, sent a memo in response to the furor, saying the engineer’s essay “advanced incorrect assumptions about gender.” “Part of building an open, inclusive environment means fostering a culture in which those with alternative views, including different political views, feel safe sharing their opinions,” Brown wrote. “But that discourse needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our Code of Conduct, policies, and anti-discrimination laws,” she added. Google engineering vice president Aristotle Balogh also wrote an internal post criticizing the employee’s memo, saying “stereotyping and harmful assumptions” could not be allowed to play any part in the company’s culture. A Google spokesperson told Reuters that the statements from Brown and Balogh were official responses from Google. The controversy erupted as the Department of Justice continues to press an investigation of alleged gender-based pay discrimination at Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc..  The company has denied the charges. The episode also sparked debate on the proper limits of free speech in corporate environments. Entrepreneur Elissa Shevinsky wrote on blogging website Medium that speech “questioning the technical qualifications of people based on race or gender” could fall under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. “Google is not a space where employees should be able to express and share whatever feelings they may have, regardless of how it affects others,” Shevinsky wrote. Former Google privacy engineer Yonatan Zunger wrote on Medium that the unnamed engineer “does not appear to understand the consequences of what he wrote, either for others or himself,” and said if the engineer reported to him he’d be fired. There were also expressions of support for the anonymous engineer. He said in a comment on his original posting that he had received “many personal messages from fellow Googlers expressing their gratitude for bringing up these very important issues,” according to a copy of the memo posted by technology news site Gizmodo. Motherboard, the online news outlet that first reported the employee’s memo, reported Sunday that many messages on the anonymous corporate messaging app Blind showed backing for the view that Google’s culture was too politically correct.

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google is developing technology that media companies could use to create stories similar to those found on Snapchat’s “Discover” platform, a person familiar with the plans said on Friday. Google’s project, dubbed “Stamp,” is in the early stages of testing with publishers, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Tech firms including Google, Snapchat’s owner Snap Inc and Facebook Inc are racing to develop publishing tools for media companies, hoping to fill their own apps with news, entertainment, sports and other content. The challenge for such tools is making them faster and easier to use than a web browser, while creating an interesting experience for users. Snapchat’s “Discover” tab is distinct in the way it integrates video clips with text and photos, allowing users to skip to a new story or advertisement with the touch of a finger. The Wall Street Journal first reported the development of Google Stamp earlier on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. Google has been in discussions with several publishers, including Vox Media, Time Warner Inc’s CNN, Mic, the Washington Post and Time Inc to participate in the project, the newspaper said. Google said in a statement: “We don’t have anything to announce at the moment but look forward to sharing more soon.” The name Stamp echoes an existing Google product, Accelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP, that allows for faster loading of online news stories. Facebook has a competing product, Instant Articles. ","

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google is working with Indonesia to tackle video content deemed to be offensive, including material that might incite violence or hate speech, a senior official of the search giant said on Friday. Google plans to implement its “Trusted Flagger” program in Indonesia over the next two to three months, Ann Lavin, Google’s director for public policy and government affairs in Southeast Asia and Greater China, told a news conference in Jakarta. The program, which is already running in countries such as the France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, allows selected users to flag questionable content on its video-sharing platform, YouTube, in bulk rather than one at a time. Content flagged by group members will be prioritized for review and may then be removed by Google.(bit.ly/2v4rqtB) A growing amount of content encouraging religious intolerance or radicalism is being shared in Indonesia, home to the world’s largest Muslim population and some of the most avid users of social media such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Indonesian Minister of Communication and Information Rudiantara separately discussed the issue of “negative” content with representatives from Google and Twitter Inc on Friday, two days after he met Facebook officials. At a joint news conference with Google’s Lavin after their meeting, Rudiantara said his ministry’s priority was to “protect” Indonesians from content that promotes radicalism, terrorism and drugs. But the Indonesian government was not trying to foster a “regime of censorship”, said Rudiantara, who uses one name. Apart from the communications ministry, Lavin said, Google would also work with civil society groups such as the Wahid Institute, led by prominent moderate Muslim figure Yenny Wahid, and anti-hoax community MAFINDO. While the move to curb content that incites hatred is positive, both the government and Google should be clear about the process, said Nawawi Bahrudin, executive director of the non-government body, Legal Aid Center for the Press. “They should not just use their own yardsticks,” Bahrudin said by telephone. “They have to be transparent and not just keep it among themselves.” In June, Rudiantara said Google’s Asia-Pacific headquarters had agreed on future tax payments after a months-long dispute with the government, paving the way for a shake up in the way similar companies operate in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy. Indonesia has been pushing multinational technology firms to incorporate domestically, arguing that by setting up small business entities to provide “auxiliary” services they get away with minimal taxation and book most of their revenue from the country elsewhere.

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"(Reuters) - El gigante de Internet Google ha despedido al ingeniero que ha estado en el ojo del huracán en Silicon Valley en la última semana tras escribir un memorando en el que atribuyó la desigualdad de género en la industria tecnológica a diferencias biológicas. James Damore, el ingeniero que escribió el memorando, confirmó el despido y dijo en un correo electrónico enviado el lunes a Reuters que había sido despedido por “perpetuar estereotipos de género”. Damore dijo que estaba estudiando todas las acciones legales posibles y que, antes de ser despedido, presentó una denuncia ante el consejo nacional de relaciones laborales de EEUU (NLRB, por sus siglas inglesas) acusando a la alta dirección de Google de avergonzarle para intentar mantenerle en silencio. “Es ilegal ir en contra de denunciante ante el NLRB”, señaló en el correo electrónico. Google, filial de Alphabet Inc con sede Mountain View, California, dijo que no podía hablar sobre casos individuales de empleados. El consejero delegado de Google, Sundar Pichai, dijo a los empleados en una nota el lunes que partes del memorando anti-diversidad “violan nuestro Código de Conducta y cruzan la línea al promover dañinos estereotipos de género en nuestro lugar de trabajo”, según una copia de la nota a la que tuvo acceso Reuters. No estaba claro de inmediato a que autoridad legal podría acudir Damore. Los empleados no sindicados como ocurre con la mayoría de los trabajadores del sector tecnológico pueden ser despedidos en Estados Unidos por una amplia variedad de razones que no tienen nada que ver con el rendimiento. La ley laboral estadounidense garantiza a los trabajadores, independientemente de que estén o no afiliados a un sindicado, el derecho a tomar “actividades concertadas” para ayudarse o protegerse mutuamente. En cualquier caso, Damore probablemente tendrá complicado lograr protección en base a su memorando, dijo Alison Morantz, una profesora de Derecho de la Universidad de Stanford con experiencia en derecho laboral. “Va a ser difícil vender que esta actividad era concertada o dirigida a ayuda o protección mutua ... enfrentar a un grupo de trabajadores contra otro no suena muy ‘mutuo’”, dijo Morantz. El debate sobre el trato a las mujeres en Silicon Valley, dominado por hombres, lleva meses sobre la mesa tras escándalos de acoso sexual en Uber Technologies Inc y en varias firmas de inversión que han terminado en reorganizaciones directivas. Los directivos de las mayores empresas tecnológicas, Google entre ellas, se han comprometido públicamente a una mayor diversidad en las plantillas, aunque el porcentaje de mujeres en puestos de ingeniería o gestión sigue siendo bajo en muchas compañías. El Departamento de Trabajo estadounidense está investigando si Google ha pagado de forma ilegal menos a las mujeres que a los hombres, extremo que el gigante tecnológico niega. Damore afirmó en el documento de 3.000 palabras que circuló dentro de la compañía la semana pasada que “el sesgo hacia la izquierda de Google ha creado una monocultura de lo políticamente correcto” que impide una debate honesto sobre la diversidad. El ingeniero, que según su perfil de LinkedIn es doctor en biología de sistemas por la Universidad de Harvard, atacó la idea de que la diversidad de género sea el objetivo. “La distribución de preferencias y habilidades de los hombres y las mujeres difieren en parte debido a causas biológicas y esas diferencias podrían explicar por qué no vemos la misma representación de mujeres en tecnología y liderazgo”, escribió. Rápidamente recibió el apoyo de los medios de comunicación online de corte conservador. En Breitbart News, medio que una vez estuvo dirigido por Steve Bannon, actual estratega jefe del presidente Donald Trump, los comentaristas discutían anoche sobre si boicotear a Google y cambiar a servicios de la competencia como el buscador Bing de Microsoft Corp. La recientemente contratada vicepresidenta de diversidad, integridad y gobernanza de Google, Danielle Brown, envió un memorando en respuesta al escándalo que se difundió este fin de semana y dijo que el ensayo del ingeniero “promovía conjeturas de género incorrectas”. “Una parte para construir un ambiente abierto, inclusivo, es impulsar una cultura en las que estas visiones alternativas, incluyendo diferentes visiones políticas, se sientan seguras compartiendo sus opiniones”, escribió Brown.

James Damore, l’ingénieur ayant rédigé ce memo d’une dizaine de pages, a confirmé son licenciement dans un courriel à Reuters, précisant avoir été remercié pour “perpétuation des stéréotypes de genre”. Il a dit envisager tous les recours légaux possibles. Dans sa note, James Damore estimait notamment que la “répartition des préférences et compétences des hommes et femmes diffère en partie pour des raisons biologiques et ces différences peuvent expliquer pourquoi on n’observe pas une répartition égale des femmes dans le secteur technologique et aux postes de direction”. Google, filiale d’Alphabet, a pour principe de ne pas s’exprimer sur les cas individuels. Mais dans un courriel interne à l’entreprise, le directeur exécutif du groupe, Sundar Pichai, a déclaré que certaines parties du mémo enfreignaient le code de conduite de l’entreprise. Le traitement des femmes dans le milieu très masculin de la Silicon Valley fait l’objet de vifs débats depuis plusieurs mois, à la suite notamment de plusieurs affaires de harcèlement sexuel chez Uber et dans d’autres start-up.

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"LONDON (Reuters) - Researchers in England are hoping to help root out modern day slavery in northern India by using detailed satellite imagery to locate brick kilns - sites that are notorious for using millions of slaves, including children. A team of geospatial experts at the University of Nottingham use Google Maps and dozens of volunteers to identify potential sites of exploitation and report them to authorities. “The key thing at the moment is to get those statistics right and to get the locations of the brick kilns sorted,” said Dr Doreen Boyd, a co-researcher on the ‘Slavery from Space’ project. “There are certainly activists on the ground that will help us in terms of getting the statistics and the locations of these brick kilns to (government) officials.” Anti-slavery activists said the project could be useful in identifying remote kilns or mines that would otherwise escape public or official scrutiny. “But there are other, more pressing challenges like tackling problematic practices including withheld wages, lack of transparent accounting,... no enforcement of existing labor laws,” said Jakub Sobik, spokesman at Anti-Slavery, a London-based NGO. Millions of people in India are believed to be living in slavery. Despite a 1976 ban on bonded labor, the practice remains widespread at brick kilns, rice mills, and brothels, among others. The majority of victims belong to low-income families or marginalized castes like the Dalits or ‘untouchables’. Nearly 70 percent of brick kiln workers in South Asia are estimated to be working in bonded and forced labor, according to a 2016 report by the International Labor Organization. About a fifth of those are under age. The project relies on ‘citizen science’ or ‘crowdsourcing’ - a process where volunteers sift through thousands of satellite images to identify possible locations of kilns. Each image is shown to multiple volunteers who mark kilns independently. The team is currently focused on an area of 2,600 square km in the desert state of Rajasthan - teeming with brick-making sites - and plans to scale up the project in the coming years. Researchers are now in talks with satellite companies to get access to more detailed images, rather than having to rely on publicly available Google Maps. The project is one of several anti-slavery initiatives run by the university, which include research on slave labour-free supply chains and human trafficking. ","

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"FRANKFURT/DETROIT (Reuters) - BMW and Daimler, the world’s top luxury carmakers, have announced alliances with suppliers, talking up the virtues of having a bigger pool of engineers to develop a self-driving car. But another motive behind these deals, executives and industry experts told Reuters, is a concern that robocars may not live up to the profit expectations that drove an initial investment rush. Carmakers are increasingly looking to forego outright ownership of future autonomous driving systems in favor of spreading the investment burden and risk. The trend represents a clear shift in strategy from little more than a year ago when most automakers were pursuing standalone strategies focused on tackling the engineering challenge of developing a self-driving car, rather than on the business case. “Although it is a substantial market, it may not be worth the scale of investments currently being sunk into it,” said a board member at one of the German carmakers, who declined to be identified because the matter is confidential. Dozens of companies - including carmakers and tech firms like Google and Uber - are vying for a market which, according to consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, will only make up about 10 to 15 percent of vehicles in Europe by 2030. There are sure to be losers. “It’s impossible for me to believe there will be 50 successful autonomous vehicle software producers,” said John Hoffecker, global vice chairman of Michigan-based consulting firm AlixPartners. In July last year, BMW became the first major carmaker to abandon its solo development of self-driving cars in favor of teaming up with chipmaker Intel and camera and software manufacturer Mobileye to build a platform for autonomous cars technology by 2021. The decision followed a trip by senior executives to visit startups and suppliers to gauge BMW’s competitive position. “Sitting at other companies, one rattles off the technological challenges and safety aspects, and you come to realize that many of us are swimming in the same sludge,” Klaus Buettner, BMW’s vice president autonomous driving projects, told Reuters. “Everybody is investing billions. Our view was that it makes sense to club together to develop some core systems as a platform.” Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz has since combined efforts with supplier Bosch, three months ago, while Japanese carmaker Honda has said it is open to alliances in the area of autonomous cars. Even deep-pocketed tech companies are teaming up. San Francisco-based transport app operator Lyft and Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit Waymo pooled their resources in May. Partial autonomy is already a reality in higher-end cars that keep in lane and adjust their speed in motorway driving. Each of the next stages - “eyes off”, “mind off” and ultimately driverless autonomy - will likely take years to become reality. Klaus Froehlich, BMW’s board member responsible for development, said the company was likely to lose money with its first fully autonomous vehicles, just like it did with its first-generation electric cars. But developing the technology remains a necessity in order to stay relevant as a carmaker. “It is an enabling technology, not a business case,” he said about BMW’s decision to develop autonomous vehicles. “But if the burden can be shared on a platform, I have nothing against that.” One of the most financially promising markets that autonomous technology will open up is driverless on-demand taxis, which may one day come to replace regular cabs and parts of public transport in large cities. “Robotaxis” are expected to drive the wider market for car sharing and ride-hailing, which was worth $53 billion last year and could be worth $2 trillion by 2030, according to a McKinsey study published earlier this year. Ford and General Motors are investing at least $2 billion each to develop self-driving vehicles for urban ride-sharing fleets beginning in 2021, competing with incumbents and start-ups. The emergence of alliances involving the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz comes at a time when regulators are pushing for a creation of standards for the new technology, which has the potential to improve vehicle reflexes and cut accidents by up to 90 percent, according to Boston Consulting Group. Industry experts say such standardization could make it much harder to develop a product which stands out, calling into question the wisdom of high-stakes, go-it-alone strategies. In September 2016, the U.S. Department of Transport and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration released guidance for heavily automated vehicles. The regulator urged carmakers to disclose how vehicle reflexes are programed, particularly when cars are faced with a dilemma, such as choosing between hitting a cyclist or accelerating beyond legal speeds to avoid an accident. “It is important to consider whether highly automated vehicles are required to apply particular decision rules in instances of conflicts between safety, mobility, and legality objectives,” the guidance said. “Algorithms for resolving these conflict situations should be developed transparently using input from federal and state regulators, drivers and passengers.” European regulators too are debating whether to standardize speeds and distances which autonomous cars need to adhere to while weaving in and out of traffic or joining lanes. Pressure not to waste development costs is laying the groundwork for alliances and even mergers between the various companies supplying technology for autonomous cars, including makers of vehicles, software, computer chips, radar, camera and laser sensors and high-definition maps. BMW, Mercedes and Audi put aside their rivalry and teamed up to buy mapping firm HERE, for example, in order to cut their dependence on Google. What starts out as arms-length agreements designed to capture market share, much like code-sharing deals between airlines, may evolve further into takeovers once the next investment round is due, executives and advisers said. “Will we see what is happening in aviation be adopted in automotive - where first we see alliances, collaborations and consortiums, and then we see full out market combinations?” asked Bill Curtin, head of mergers and acquisitions at global law firm Hogan Lovells.

 ,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"Supported by TOKYO — Toyota said on Friday that it was taking a 5 percent stake in Mazda, another Japanese automaker, and that the companies would jointly build an assembly plant in the United States and would pool resources on new technologies. The factory’s location has not been decided, but Toyota and Mazda said they hoped the first vehicles would roll off its production lines in 2021. The plant is expected to cost $1.6 billion and to employ about 4,000 workers, they said. Akio Toyoda, chief executive of Toyota, said in January that the carmaker would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years. Although plans for that spending predated the election of President Trump, the timing of the announcement was widely seen as a response to Mr. Trump’s vows to promote American manufacturing, pushing back against countries like Japan that have large trade surpluses with the United States. Mixing appeals, rebukes and state-sponsored enticements, Mr. Trump has pushed both American and foreign-owned companies to locate factories in the United States rather than in lower-wage countries. Even before Mr. Trump was sworn in, the heating and cooling giant Carrier agreed to cut the number of jobs it planned to move to Mexico from an Indiana plant after the state added $7 million in incentives. Last week, the Taiwanese electronics supplier Foxconn joined Mr. Trump at the White House to announce its plans to locate a new plant with 3,000 positions in Wisconsin, which lured the company with a staggering $3 billion in state tax credits. The announcement by Toyota and Mazda earned a congratulatory tweet from the president early Friday. “Toyota & Mazda to build a new $1.6B plant here in the U.S.A. and create 4K new American jobs. A great investment in American manufacturing!” he wrote. Seven months earlier he had warned Toyota in a tweet that moving operations to Mexico could result in a “big border tax.” The alliance between Toyota and Mazda represents a small but significant step in the consolidation of the Japanese car industry, where a half-dozen producers compete for customers and capital. Toyota and Mazda said they planned to pursue joint development of electric vehicles and safety technology. In an era of soaring development costs and unsettling technological shifts — especially the emergence of battery-powered and self-driving cars — many smaller producers fear they lack the resources required to keep up. Even Toyota, one of the world’s largest producers of vehicles, with an output of 10 million units a year, has been accused by some critics of falling behind in research and development. “In the future, mobility won’t belong only to carmakers,” Mr. Toyoda said at a news conference announcing the Mazda stake, noting that Silicon Valley was increasingly turning its gaze to the auto industry, looking to disrupt areas including design, manufacturing and retail distribution. “Totally new players like Google and Amazon are right before our eyes,” Mr. Toyoda said. “We need to cooperate and compete with them.” Japan’s smaller carmakers have sought partnerships with larger producers before. Ford Motor long had a minority stake in Mazda, as did General Motors in Suzuki, before the American partners withdrew. Mitsubishi joined the Renault-Nissan alliance last year, after the French-Japanese group extended Mitsubishi a $2.2 billion lifeline to help it recover from a scandal over falsified fuel-economy ratings. Toyota has been extending its reach, as well. Last year, it took over its longtime minicar affiliate, Daihatsu. It has also been strengthening its links with Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru cars, in which Toyota owns a 16.5 percent stake. And it has been discussing a new partnership with Suzuki. Toyota and Mazda have been cooperating since 2010, when Toyota agreed to license its gasoline-electric hybrid-drive system to Mazda. The companies said in 2015 that they were exploring ways to expand their partnership. With the Prius and other hybrids, Toyota has dominated the market for lower-emissions vehicles for years. But as fully battery-powered cars gain favor with regulators and consumers, the company faces new challenges — both from traditional competitors and new players like Tesla. Mazda is known for making powerful and fuel-efficient internal combustion engines, but it lacks its own electric alternatives. Its sporty image and widely praised designs could appeal to Toyota: Mr. Toyoda has repeatedly spoken of his desire to give his company’s products more flair. Mazda said it planned to issue new shares to Toyota worth 50 billion yen, or about $450 million, which would give Toyota a 5.05 percent ownership stake in Mazda. In return, Toyota plans to transfer some of its shares to Mazda. The stock would be worth an equivalent amount in cash, but because Toyota is much larger than Mazda, Mazda’s stake in Toyota would work out to 0.25 percent. According to a Toyota fact sheet, the company has directly invested $23.4 billion in the United States, has 10 plants, and employs 136,000 people. Some of the states where Toyota is currently located would love to be the home of this newest expansion. “As Toyota embarks on its joint venture with Mazda, we stand ready to grow our existing partnership and strengthen Mississippi’s standing as a global leader in automotive manufacturing,” said Phil Bryant, the governor of Mississippi, where the company employs more than 2,000 workers. Michigan, where Mazda produced cars before exiting in 2012, also boasted of what it could offer. “Any manufacturer looking to locate a plant in the United States will likely be taking a good look at Michigan,” Gov. Rick Snyder said. “We are a national leader for mobility and automotive R&D, as well as providing an exceptionally skilled manufacturing workforce and an outstanding business environment.” And a spokesman for Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said: “Toyota Motor Corporation has made significant investments in Texas — just recently opening their new North American headquarters — and we are very proud of the work they are doing in the Lone Star State. We will continue to work with Toyota to ensure Texas provides the business environment they need to succeed in the marketplace.” An earlier version of this article misstated the worth of shares Mazda plans to issue to Toyota. It is about $450 million, not $450 billion. Because of an editing error, an earlier verison of this article misstated the terms of two past partnerships between Japanese and American automakers. Ford owned a minority stake in Mazda, as did General Motors in Suzuki; neither American automaker fully owned its Japanese partner. Jonathan Soble reported from Tokyo, and Patricia Cohen from New York. Advertisement ",Toyota to Take 5 Percent Stake in Mazda and Build Joint U.S. Plant - The New York Times
 ,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it planned to take a 5 percent share of smaller Japanese rival Mazda Motor Corp, as part of an alliance that will see the two build a $1.6 billion U.S. assembly plant and work together on electric vehicles. The plant was a surprise for investors at a time of cooling U.S. sales, but marked good news for U.S. President Donald Trump who came to office on the back of promises to bring back manufacturing and jobs for U.S. workers. He commented on Twitter that it was a “great investment in American manufacturing”. The plant, whose location is not yet public, will be able to produce 300,000 vehicles a year, with production divided between the two automakers, and employ about 4,000 people. It will start operating in 2021. Analysts said the plan was more than a political ploy. The alliance is also an attempt to catch up with rivals in the race for electric car technology, as tighter global emissions rules loom, along with the entry of new players into the market. “There will be new rivals appearing - Apple, Google - these are IT companies, we also need to compete with them, too,” Toyota President Akio Toyoda, grandson of the company’s founder, told a news conference in Tokyo. He was appointed last year to lead Toyota’s newly formed electric car division, flagging the group’s commitment to a technology it has been slow to embrace. “What’s different from the past is that there are no nautical charts for us to follow. It’s without precedent,” he said of the push into alternatives to the internal combustion engine. Other traditional automakers such as Daimler and BMW are also weighing how best to work on new, disruptive technology, from electric vehicles to autonomous driving, that require hefty investment and have turned firms like Google and Tesla into rivals. Toyota has set a goal for all of its vehicles to be zero emission by 2050. But until recently, it has said it favoured EVs for short-distance commuting, given their limited driving range and lengthy charging time. It has been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), while rivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and Tesla have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles. As part of the agreement, as well as electric car technology, Toyota and Mazda will work together to develop in-car information technologies and automated driving functions. Toyota, Japan’s biggest auto company, has been forging alliances with smaller rivals for several years, effectively engineering a loose network at the heart of the Japanese auto sector. It already owns a 16.5 percent stake in sixth-ranked Subaru Corp with which it also has a development partnership. Toyota is also courting compact car maker Suzuki Motor Corp to cooperate on R&D and parts supply, as Toyota seeks to tap its smaller rival’s expertise in emerging Asian markets. As part of Friday’s plan, Toyota, the world’s second-largest automaker by vehicle sales last year, will take a 5 percent share of Mazda, and Mazda will take a 0.25 percent share of Toyota. Mazda said it could even expand the alliance, as long as it could stay in control of its own management. “We will study the possibility of expanding the capital alliance, but the basic premise is that autonomy is assured,” said Mazda Executive Vice President Akira Marumoto. A stake in Mazda may also prevent future incursions by tech companies, one analyst said. “For a technology company which lacks the expertise in making cars, Mazda could look like a very interesting acquisition. They’re very good, they’re not too expensive. Maybe Toyota realises this,” CLSA managing director Chris Richter said. “By buying a 5 percent stake, Toyota takes Mazda off the table rather than having it sit out there like a free agent which could someday be used against them.” Mazda, for its part, stands to gain from a deal that gives the small automaker a production foothold in the United States. At the moment, it ships all vehicles sold in the country, its biggest market, from its plants in Japan and Mexico. With an R&D budget of around 140 billion yen ($1.27 billion) this year, a fraction of Toyota’s 1 trillion yen, Mazda lacks the funds to develop electric cars on its own, a predicament shared by Subaru and Suzuki. “Mazda needs electrification technology. In the past, they’ve pooh-poohed EVs, they’ve felt they can make internal combustion engines more efficient, but the bottom line is that globally you need to have this technology,” said Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities. The automakers plan to produce Toyota Corollas and a new Mazda SUV crossover at the new plant, and the companies said they could eventually build other cars including electric vehicles. Toyota initially had been planning to produce Corollas at its new $1 billion plant being built in Mexico, prompting Trump to threaten punitive tariffs. The company has since said it will instead produce its Tacoma truck model in Mexico. ","

Social Security plays a critical role in providing a financial safety net for retired workers. An analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that without Social Security, poverty rates among the elderly would increase from 8.8% to 40.5%. Plus, roughly three out of five retired workers count on their Social Security check to provide at least half their income. Image source: Getty Images. But there are a number of issues with this critical social program, and they extend beyond just what you hear in the news. To begin with, yes, Social Security has a major cash shortfall headed its way. According to the latest report from the Board of Trustees, Social Security is projected to be $12.5 trillion short of cash, based on its current payout trajectory over the next 75 years. The Trustees have estimated that this could lead to an across-the-board cut in benefits of up to 23% beginning in 2034, assuming Congress does nothing. That's not good news for the aforementioned majority of seniors who rely on Social Security for at least half of their monthly income. However, another serious issue for Social Security has been its chronically underperforming cost-of-living adjustments, or COLA. Think of COLA as the annual raise that beneficiaries receive each year. In theory, recipients would like their raise to be equal to, or greater than, the actual inflation they encounter on an annual basis. In nearly all instances, though, COLAs have come up well short of expectations. Not counting 2017, medical care inflation has outpaced Social Security's COLA in 33 of the past 35 years. This essentially means that the purchasing power of Social Security benefits has been eroded by medical care inflation and housing costs, among other expenses, throughout the years. In fact, a recent report from The Senior Citizens League found that the programs' purchasing power has been eroded by 30% since the year 2000. In other words, what $100 in Social Security benefits bought in 2000 can only buy $70 worth of goods and services today. Image source: Getty Images. Social Security's COLAs are based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), a commonly referenced measure of price inflation. When the CPI-W rises, Social Security beneficiaries receive that percentage as a ""raise,"" rounded to the nearest 0.1%, in the upcoming year. Recently, the Social Security Administration (SSA) released its projections for 2018, which are subject to change, as an average CPI-W reading can't be ascertained until the third quarter ends. Per the SSA, projections call for a 2.2% COLA in 2018, which compares nicely to the minuscule 0.3% COLA seniors received this year and the 0% COLA they received in three of the past eight years. It'll also be the highest COLA since 2012. Higher energy prices (e.g., gasoline prices) are a prime reason why the CPI-W is expected to rise year over year. What does a 2.2% COLA look like for the average retired worker? Based on the June snapshot from the SSA, the average retiree was taking home $1,368.67 a month. A 2.2% COLA would boost this average monthly payout to $1,398.78, or an extra $30.11 a month. Unfortunately, however, the COLA that seniors are on track to receive in 2018 could cause them to lose purchasing power: As of June 30, the annual U.S. healthcare inflation rate was nearly 2.7%, and healthcare is one of the biggest expenses for retirees. Image source: Getty Images. You might be wondering if there's a fix to Social Security's recurring COLA underperformance -- and there potentially is. Democrats on Capitol Hill have regularly proposed altering the method for calculating Social Security's COLA by switching from the CPI-W to a measure known as the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly, or CPI-E. As the name rightly implies, the CPI-E only factors in spending for households with seniors aged 62 and up. The idea is that an index that measures the spending of seniors will more accurately reflect the inflation they face. For example, a December 2011 comparison of the CPI-W and CPI-E by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the CPI-E places more emphasis on medical care and housing costs, while placing less emphasis on food, entertainment, transportation, education, and apparel expenses, relative to the CPI-W. Tethering Social Security COLAs to the CPI-E would likely result in higher annual benefit increases for seniors. But it's not quite that simple. Switching to the CPI-E would come with two major drawbacks. Sure, it would give today's seniors a bigger annual raise, but it would also expedite the imminent cash shortfall of the program, causing Social Security to run out of cash reserves even sooner than 2034. The other issue is that the CPI-E doesn't account for Medicare Part A expenses (e.g., inpatient care, surgeries, and long-term skilled care), which can be substantial for retirees. In other words, the CPI-E will likely under-represent the medical care inflation that seniors are facing each year. Long story short, there's clearly a problem with the way COLAs are calculated, but unfortunately there's no way to correct the problem without first resolving the programs' long-term funding issues.

    Social Security Benefits Are Expected to Increase by This Much in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

""Hold up. Wasn't Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) going to split its stock?"" It's a fair question. And it deserves some fresh analysis. Facebook's stock split was approved a while ago. Indeed, it was the summer of 2016 when shareholders approved the board's proposal to split its stock and subsequently issue a new Class C stock in the form of a one-time stock dividend. The planned stock split was part of an effort to help CEO Mark Zuckerberg keep controlling voting rights as he and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, embark on a journey to give away 99% of their wealth. Here's everything you need to know about Facebook's stock split. Mark Zuckerberg hopes this stock split will help him maintain majority control as he gives away his wealth. Image source: Facebook. Facebook's proposed stock split isn't representative of the typical stock splits investors are used to. Normally, stock splits simply divide the total economic value of a share into multiple, lower-priced shares, which together total the same amount as the original share. But this is different. In order to preserve Zuckerberg's voting rights as he gives away wealth by selling Facebook stock, Facebook's board of directors approved a proposal to create a new class of stock. Zuckerberg explained the reasoning behind the split in an April 2016 blog post about the new share class: Today, Facebook's board of directors is announcing a proposal to create a new class of stock that will allow us to achieve both goals. I'll be able to keep founder control of Facebook so we can continue to build for the long term, and Priscilla and I will be able to give our money to fund important work sooner. Right now, there are amazing scientists, educators and doctors around the world doing incredible work. We want to help them make a bigger difference today, not 30 or 40 years down the road. The technicalities of the stock split include a one-time dividend of two new nonvoting Class C shares for each Facebook share currently held. Today, most Facebook shareholders own Class A shares; Facebook insiders own Class B shares, which have 10 times the voting rights that Class A shares have. Both Class A shareholders and Class B shareholders will each receive a one-time stock dividend of two Class C shares. At the time of the split, the new stock classes will have no impact on voting rights for outsiders or insiders. But as Zuckerberg and his wife give away 99% of their Facebook holdings during their lives, their donated Class B shares can be converted to Class A shares, protecting their founder control. As summed up by Facebook, the stock split ""will allow Facebook to maintain and improve upon the structure that has served shareholders well, while also enabling Mark to pursue his important goals through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative."" Investors can view more details about Facebook's stock split in Facebook's U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing regarding the split. Here are some of the most important things investors should understand about the split. 1. Investors will own three shares for every one previously owned. After two Class C shares are paid out as a stock dividend as part of the approved stock split, Facebook investors will own one Class A Facebook share and two Class C Facebook shares. The total value of these three shares will equal what a single class A share was worth before. The split, therefore, will look somewhat like a typical 3-to-1 stock split, except that two shares will be a new, non-voting class with a different ticker symbol. 2. The stock split will not be a taxable event. Although new Class C shares are called ""stock dividends,"" there will be no cash payments involved, and this is not a taxable event. But Facebook does advise shareholders to discuss the stock dividends with their accountants or financial advisors. 3. A lower stock price won't make Facebook a better investment. While the 3-to-1 stock split will value all new shares at a third of what Class A shares used to trade at, this doesn't mean the stocks will have more upside potential; a stock split does not change a company's market capitalization. The company will still be judged by the same metrics. When will Facebook split its stock? Image source: Facebook. 4. Facebook likely won't wait too long to split its stock. Without this stock split, Zuckerberg and his wife's donations of Facebook shares will put their controlling voting rights at greater risk. So, though Facebook has been mute about when the split will occur, it will likely happen in the near future. But as of yet, there's no set date. ","

Jeremy Bowman,08102017,Fool,08032017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Every investor wants market-crushing returns, but they're not always easy to find. Looking back at the stock market in recent past may offer some clues for the next ten-bagger stock. During that time, no group of stocks has captured the market's imagination and generated blockbuster returns like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA). Image source: Getty Images. The chart below shows how the three stocks have done since Tesla's IPO in 2010. AMZN data by YCharts As you can see, all three stocks have crushed the S&P 500 during that time. But the chart only tells half the story for Amazon and Netflix. Netflix has returned nearly 15,000% since its 2002 IPO, while Amazon has been the best stock to own over the last generation, growing more than 50,000% since its 1997 IPO. Above all, three factors have contributed to these stocks' success, and they are what separate them from the rest of the market. Jeff Bezos, Reed Hastings, and Elon Musk are all revered by investors, and deservedly so. The three, all of whom founded their companies, have reshaped their respective industries in a way that almost no other business leaders have during the last generation. At Amazon, Bezos continues to push the e-commerce giant into new industries and market sectors. It seems like every week there's news of Amazon's incursions shaking up potential competitors. From its start as an online bookseller, the company has broken into e-books and e-readers, tablets, cloud computing, video streaming, voice-activated technology, and, most importantly, pushed e-commerce relentlessly with ideas like Prime, which have given it a huge advantage in online retail. Amazon's success has made Bezos one of the richest people in the world, and even Warren Buffett hailed him as a ""genius."" Elon Musk made billions as co-founder of Paypal, and brought his reputation for tech disruption with him to Tesla. Investors haven't been disappointed. In addition to Tesla, Musk also started SpaceX and Solar City, and he regularly spouts out ideas like the HyperLoop or colonizing mars that would sound crazy if they were coming from anyone else. Musk has built Tesla into a coveted electric car brand, doing something no one else has in the century that idea's existed: executing nearly flawlessly on his strategy of moving closer to the mass market with each new model. In the meantime, he's also created a powerful battery business that could eventually be Tesla's real profit center. Hastings may not get as much fanfare as the other two on the list, but Netflix has disrupted the entertainment business several times over now. First, his idea to ship DVDs by mail eventually brought Blockbuster and the rest of the video-rental business to its knees. Netflix's transition to video streaming was rocky at times, but it has become the industry standard, spawning copycats like Amazon, Hulu, and others. Finally, the company's entry into original TV and movies was greeted with skepticism at first, but Netflix scored nearly 100 Emmy nominations this year, and its studio is churning out dozens of TV series in addition to movies and other types of programming, becoming a powerhouse in Hollywood. All three of these stocks have generated huge returns in part because the companies have broken into giant industries. Amazon has continuously expanded its addressable market by entering new businesses, but the potential of e-commerce alone is enormous. After all, e-commerce in the U.S. continues to grow by about 15% per year, and Wal-Mart, Amazon's chief rival, brings in more revenue than any other company in the world. Throw in Amazon's other businesses like cloud computing and video streaming and it's beginning to look like the company's ambition is to serve all needs for all people. Global auto sales are expected to reach nearly 100 million this year, and in the U.S. alone sales will top more than $1 trillion. Tesla has just begun to scrape that market, and, thanks to surging demand, investors have gone crazy for the stock. The company has taken more than 400,000 orders for its Model 3, and the opportunity in electric and autonomous vehicles is nearly endless. Similarly, the potential in batteries is sizable as well as much of the world converts to renewable energy. Like autos, the market for video entertainment is almost immeasurable. Netflix viewers already watch a billion hours of content a week, and Hastings has observed that viewers spend over a billion hours a day watching YouTube. Netflix already has more than 100 million subscribers around the globe, and that number should at least double over the next decade as technology improves, the company invests in more content, and its brand recognition grows abroad. All three of these companies consistently put up strong revenue growth, bucking the conventional wisdom about the law of large numbers. AMZN Revenue (Annual YoY Growth) data by YCharts Notice in the chart above that all three stocks saw revenue accelerate last year, a particularly impressive feat for Amazon and Netflix, which many thought would have begun maturing by now. Revenue growth at Tesla, meanwhile, can be erratic due to the company's production cycles, but its sales have surged every year since its IPO. That ability to put up consistently strong revenue growth shows the large and increasing demand for their products and services, and that these three companies are successfully penetrating the huge market opportunities described above. For all three, those factors ensure that revenue growth of 20% or better will almost definitely continue. You may notice that two key features that investors often look for in a growth stock aren't included here. The first is disruption. While market disruption is often discussed by investors as a crucial component in a winning growth stock, the potential for disruption is not enough. A lot of start-ups set out to be disruptive, but most are not successful. Recent IPO Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN), for example, was seen at one point as disruptive to the entire grocery industry. But the stock has flopped in its short time on the market as investors lose faith in the company. That's because a disruptive idea alone is not enough: It needs to be executed effectively, which is where visionary leadership comes into play. All of these companies have faced competition from start-ups and incumbents along the way, but have bested them. One-time Tesla rival Fisker, for example, blew through $1.4 billion and filed for bankruptcy in 2013. EBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) had the early lead in e-commerce on Amazon, but never really innovated from its start as an auction house. Now Amazon has the much bigger marketplace. Blockbuster, meanwhile, copied Netflix's DVD-by-mail model, but it wasn't enough to fend off the insurgent The other feature it's ok to ignore here is profits. None of these three companies is putting up consistent profits, but the market has essentially agreed that that doesn't matter. There are bigger things at stake here, like the taking over the retail, entertainment, and car industries. If that happens, profits will surely follow. The combination of the three factors above have given these companies so much market power that investors don't really care about the bottom line.  That may be the biggest lesson for investors hunting for the next Amazon, Tesla, or Netflix.

Looking ahead, Boingo's management continues to expect substantial net losses in fiscal year 2017 but raised their revenue guidance from $184 million to $195 million. Image source: Getty Images. So the stock rose on strong sales trends, and Boingo's favorite non-GAAP profit measure known as adjusted EBITDA also jumped 76% higher to $16.3 million. Boingo's business is humming along especially smoothly in the military and wholesale Wi-Fi markets. The company has found a comfortable market niche and is exploiting it like a champ. To keep the growth trend going, Boingo's order backlog of 11,000 distributed antenna systems will grow the installed base by 54% when completed. And, of course, nothing is stopping Boingo from signing additional contracts along the way. Share prices have more than doubled in 52 weeks, based more on Boingo's rapid growth performance than on rock-solid financial strength. The stock is expensive today, but arguably for good reason.

Throughout most of Social Security's history, full retirement age was 65. Then, legislation passed in the early 1980s gradually increased the age, which is why it currently sits at 66 for beneficiaries reaching retirement age. If you're born after 1954, your retirement age will be even later than that. Here's what you need to know about your full retirement age, and what it could mean for your Social Security retirement benefits. Because of legislation passed in 1983, the full retirement age is set to gradually increase to 67 for future retirees. Image Source: Getty Images. Specifically, if you were born after 1954, here's a guide to help you find your full retirement age: If You Were Born in... Your Full Retirement Age Is... 1955 66 years, 2 months 1956 66 years, 4 months 1957 66 years, 6 months 1958 66 years, 8 months 1959 66 years, 10 months 1960 or later 67 years Data source: Social Security Administration. Here's why knowing your full retirement age is important. You can claim Social Security at any time between age 62 and 70. However, if you choose to claim benefits before your full retirement age, your monthly benefit amount is permanently lowered. On the other hand, if you choose to wait until after your full retirement age, your benefit will be permanently increased. Depending on how early or late you choose to claim your retirement benefit, your base monthly benefit -- known as your primary insurance amount, or PIA -- will be adjusted by these rules. If you're curious, a good estimate of your Social Security benefit can be found on your latest Social Security statement, available by creating an account at www.ssa.gov if you haven't already done so. The point is that as the full retirement age increases, Americans can get penalized more for claiming Social Security at a certain age before reaching full retirement age. Conversely, with a higher full retirement age, you'll have to delay Social Security for a longer amount of time to get a benefit increase. For example, let's say you were born in 1956 and your spouse was born in 1960. That means your full retirement age is 66 years and four months, while your spouse's full retirement age is 67. So if you both decide to claim Social Security at age 65, so that your benefits will begin at the same time you're eligible for Medicare, you'll be affected differently. You'll only be one year and four months away from your full retirement age, which means your benefit will be reduced by about 8.9%. Your spouse, on the other hand, will be claiming his or her benefit two years early, resulting in a reduction of 13.33%. In other words, if you both are eligible for $1,500 monthly Social Security benefits at full retirement age, you and your spouse would get benefits of $1,367 and $1,300, respectively, even though you both claimed benefits at the exact same age. The bottom line is that your full retirement age determines how your claiming age affects your Social Security benefits. Therefore, it's important to know your full retirement age and what it means to your benefits, so you can incorporate it into your retirement planning strategy. ","

Shares of Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) stock closed down 10.7% on Thursday, after Avon reported its financial results for the second quarter of 2017. The earnings news was even worse than last quarter. Sales declined 3% to $1.4 billion. Operating profit margins plunged 430 basis points to 2.3%. By the time interest on the company's debt, taxes, and other expenses had been deducted, Avon ended up with a loss of $0.12 per share on its bottom line -- a huge reversal from last year's Q2 profit of $0.06 per share. It probably goes without saying that investors were not pleased with the result. After all, Wall Street had told investors to expect profits of $0.07 per share from Avon. The fact that the company failed to earn any profit at all, but lost money instead, naturally had people a bit upset. So upset, in fact, that it appears Avon has decided to fire its CEO. In an announcement separate from earnings, Avon revealed that after leading Avon for the past five years, CEO Sheri McCoy will be leaving the company on March 31, 2018. There's not enough lipstick in the world to make these numbers look pretty. Image source: Getty Images. Avon's board has hired executive recruitment firm Heidrick & Struggles to find a replacement for Ms. McCoy. No particular timeline for the search has been set, but obviously, a decision before March 31 would be ideal. In the meantime, Avon will struggle on through ""year two of its three-year transformation plan,"" aiming to ""reduce costs"" while simultaneously trying to find the cash to ""invest in growth."" So far, the company succeeded in cutting annual operating costs by $120 million last year and is targeting a reduction of $230 million this year. If all goes as planned (hint: so far, things aren't going as planned), management hopes to close out the year with ""low single-digits"" growth in sales, a percentage point or so in ""adjusted operating margin expansion,"" and at least a small surplus in free cash flow. Here's hoping. ","

On Wednesday night, Eastman Kodak (NYSE:KODK) revealed results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. The report was far from picture-perfect, and management had to reduce its full-year guidance targets. Share prices plunged as much as 15.8% on the news in Thursday's trading session. What went wrong? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. Metric Q2 2017 Q2 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $381 million $423 million (9.9%) Net income from continuing operations $7 million $9 million (22%) GAAP earnings per share (diluted, from continuing operations) $0.05 $0.18 (72%) Data source: Eastman Kodak. Based on the tough business trends seen in the second quarter, Kodak issued the following updates to last quarter's full-year guidance targets: Eastman Kodak CEO Jeff Clarke is not giving up on the consumer division. That segment also accounts for commercial film products, the celluloid some filmmakers still insist on using in this increasingly digital age: It's a relatively low-revenue business, dwarfed by approximately $200 million in annual sales of films for printed circuit board production. But filmmakers and TV content producers are giving Kodak a taste of growing sales while the industrial business is shrinking. Kodak is doing well in a handful of product lines, but the overall business is suffering. I think the company's management team is smart to slow down and eventually close underperforming operations, doubling down on the parts that actually work. That being said, Kodak's share prices have been cut in half since the start of 2017 and dropped 65% lower in three years. The company is barely profitable and the only clear path toward strong cash flows would involve shedding most of Kodak's remaining business operations. Kodak has come a long way since filing for bankruptcy in 2012, but the company also has a long way to go before I would call it a reasonable investment.

It's been over four years since CEO Shantanu Narayen stopped offering Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) flagship creative cloud suite of software for sale to designers. Instead, Adobe opted to offer its solutions solely on a subscription basis  for $20 to $50 a month, depending on the package. Customers were not amused, to put it mildly, with Narayen's initiative. Within days of announcing the transition to a subscription sales model literally thousands of creative types had signed an online petition ""demanding"" Adobe continue to sell its design software the traditional way. Narayen stuck to his guns however, and the result is the long-term trend that makes Adobe an awesome buy, even at its current elevated levels. Image source: Adobe. Adobe stock was already flying high when it announced record-breaking second quarter results June 20. Up 43% this year, Adobe shares tagged on about 5% of that stellar growth since its last quarterly release. That kind of performance may set off alarms for some investors, particularly value-oriented folks, but it shouldn't because of why Adobe stock has climbed to near record highs in 2017. The  $1.77 billion in revenue Adobe reported in June was the best second quarter in its history, and nearly all the credit for its jaw-dropping performance harkens back to Narayen's unpopular decision -- at the time -- of shifting to a subscription sales, annualized recurring revenue (ARR) emphasis. The 27% year-over-year jump in revenue was impressive in and of itself, yet pales in comparison to Adobe's subscription growth. Subscription revenue soared 37% last quarter to $1.48 billion, and when service and support sales of $117 million are added to the mix, an impressive 90% of total revenue -- a figure that continues to climb with each successive quarter -- was derived from ARR-related products and services. In fact, Adobe's shift to an ARR model has been such a success its engineering software design brethren Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) followed suit. One of the reasons Autodesk shareholders are enjoying a 49% jump in share value in 2017 is because it's delivering on its new-ish ARR initiative. References  to Autodesk's ARR results, including adding 233,000 new subscribers bringing its total to 1.32 million, are sprinkled throughout its earnings release, and for good reason. ""What's the big deal with ARR growth?"", some investors may ask. A primary reason Adobe was able to deliver such impressive revenue and subscription-related gains, while increasing operating expenses just 20% to $1 billion last quarter, is because it simply costs less to make a one-time sale that drives revenue for years rather than rely on software package sales. One of the largest increases in expenses in Adobe's most recent quarter was in research and development (R&D) which climbed 29%, and its development efforts and spending are beginning to bear fruit. Adobe has been working on integrating artificial  intelligence (AI) solutions across its multiple cloud platforms for a while and recently took a significant step forward with the release of a personalization algorithm for its marketing cloud customers. The upgraded feature allows customers to input their own data and utilize Adobe's AI capabilities to ""predict what customers want and deliver it before they ask,"" which is quickly becoming a consumer expectation rather than a nicety. Another high-growth initiative is Adobe's early stage voice recognition  solutions, the most recent upgrade is specific to its analytics cloud and combined with AI provides detailed analytics based on consumers voice-related data. The recent acquisition of privately held SkyBox and its 360 degree view and virtual reality (VR) technologies is yet another Adobe initiative to drive future growth. Adobe's ARR initiative may not have been a pleasant transition for users, but it's exactly the long-term trend that makes its stock such an awesome buy. ","

A dividend growth strategy has proven to be an effective approach to investing for those with a long-term time horizon. The strategy is attractive to both conservative and opportunistic investors as it achieves long-term growth but with less volatility than the overall market. Image source: Getty Images Investing in dividend growth stocks can be as simple as investing in an ETF such as the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, but with 187 holdings in the fund, investors shouldn't expect market-crushing returns. This is evident in the 10-year returns of the fund which is essentially in line with the returns of the S&P 500. However, if investors narrow their focus, they may be able to find some long-term market beaters while maintaining protection during tough times. One company that stands out is Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) Accenture, a provider of professional services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, and technology currently pays an annual dividend of $2.42 per share, or 1.9% annualized. This is in line with the yield of the S&P 500, but as the case has been for the past 11 years, investors should expect the company to increase its payout over the next year. Over that period, Accenture has increased its annual dividend at an annualized rate of 7.2% per share. As the company has grown, the rate of increase has increased at an even faster clip, rising at an impressive 12.4% annualized rate over the past five years. Understandably, safety and stability are important for dividend-seeking investors. Accenture delivers in this area too. Not only did the IT services consultant keep its dividend during the financial crisis, it increased it at a healthy clip, growing as much as 20% in the heart of the recession and 50% when coming out of it. Payout year Dividend paid per share Year over year change (%) FY07 $0.35 16.7% FY08 $0.42 20% FY09 $0.50 19% FY10* $0.75 50% *FY10 excludes $0.375 per share dividend to Class I shareholders. Data source: Company filings. The fact that Accenture has consistently increased its dividend over the past two decades is a good indication that it prioritizes sharing its wealth with shareholders. However, to continue dividend increases, Accenture must also grow earnings. Furthermore, the company must leave enough wiggle room after paying the dividend to reinvest in the business, whether internally or through acquisitions. Accenture looks to be in good shape in both regards. Accenture currently pays out approximately 44% of its earnings in dividends. The remainder is retained for a variety of reasons including shoring up the balance sheet and growing the business. A 44% payout ratio is closer to the top of the range Accenture has paid out over the last 10 years but still well below its peak. Additionally, the payout ratio is slightly inflated as the company incurred a non-recurring pension settlement charge of $509 million this past quarter. On a free cash flow basis, Accenture's payout is only 34%. Metric (Trailing twelve months) Amount Operating cash flow $5,086 Capital expenditures ($324) Free cash flow $4,602 Dividends paid $1,568 Divided-to-FCF- ratio 34% Data source: Company filings Accenture has been able to find a good balance between returning money back to shareholders and investing in the business. In addition to dividends paid, of the $4.6 billion generated in free cash flow, $2 billion were spent on net share repurchases while $1.3 billion were used on acquisitions, leaving $1 billion for other business needs. At a payout ratio of 34% of free cash flow, Accenture still has room to grow its dividend while growing its business at the same time. Dividends wouldn't be able to grow if revenue, earnings, and cash flow didn't also increase. With Wall Street analysts projecting 9.6% long-term earnings growth, Accenture shouldn't have any issue continuing its dividend growth streak. Accenture management has focused its growth on a business segment it labels the ""New"", which is digital, cloud, and security services. In just one year, the ""New"", has gone from accounting for about 40% of Accenture's revenues to approximately half its business. By transitioning its services aggressively to emerging technologies, Accenture should be able to grow its business which will allow it to concurrently grow its dividend. Like any common stock, dividend growth stocks are not immune to declines in a bear market. However, there is a good chance they will hold up better than the market. If that type of protection sounds appealing but you don't want to give up growth, Accenture may be the stock for you. ","

Image Source: Getty Images. Do you hate paying sales tax every time you buy something? Well, five U.S. states have no sales tax on purchases, as of 2017. The obvious benefit to living in a sales-tax-free state is that you'll pay less money out-of-pocket for each purchase. Plus, sales taxes are often a regressive form of taxation, disproportionately affecting lower-income households that tend to spend a greater percentage of their income than affluent households. As of 2017, here are the five U.S. states that don't have a state sales tax, and a closer look at just how tax-friendly these states are. Image Source: Getty Images. Oregon is an example of a state that isn't very tax-friendly at all, despite not having a sales tax. Specifically, Oregon's income tax rates are on the high end, ranging from 5% to 9.9%, and the top rate is assessed on taxable income greater than $125,000 for single filers or $250,000 for joint filers. In addition, Oregon is one of the few states that has an estate tax that uses a lower exemption amount than the federal government, taxing estates valued over $1 million at rates of up to 16%. Image Source: Getty Images. Like Oregon, Montana makes up for its lack of a sales tax with other sources of revenue. The state's 1%-6.9% range of income tax rates may sound modest, but the top rate is applied on income above a relatively low $17,400 threshold. Plus, Montana taxes Social Security benefits, making it an especially tax-unfriendly destination for retirees. Image Source: Getty Images. Alaska is an extremely tax-friendly state. In addition to the absence of a state sales tax, Alaska also doesn't have an income tax, and doesn't impose a property tax on motor vehicles. Even better, Alaska residents get a cut of the state's massive oil revenue, known as the Alaska Permanent Fund dividend. For 2016, the dividend was $1,022 per person -- substantially less than in recent years, but still a nice perk of living in a state that is already a tax haven. And given the state's oil wealth, it should come as no surprise that Alaska has the lowest gas tax rate in the nation. Image Source: Getty Images. In addition to having no sales tax, New Hampshire only assesses an income tax on dividend and interest income at a 5% rate, not on wage income. However, New Hampshire is far from being a tax shelter. The state assesses relatively high tax rates on gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol, and also has some of the highest property tax rates in the U.S. Recent data shows that the average real estate tax rate is 2.15% ($2,150 per $100,000 of home value), and the vehicle tax rate averages 1.8%. Image Source: Getty Images. When I was a child growing up in Southern New Jersey, I remember frequently taking day trips with my family to Delaware to take advantage of the tax-free shopping available in the state. In addition to having no sales tax, Delaware is a generally tax-friendly place, with relatively low income tax rates (2.2%-6.6%), no vehicle taxes, and one of the lowest real estate tax rates in the U.S. So where does Delaware's revenue come from? In addition to the modest income tax revenue, Delaware's other major revenue source is corporate franchise taxes. In fact, business-friendly Delaware is the legal home to the majority of Fortune 500 companies, which is a major revenue generator for the state. ","

What is to stop it from firing an employee for complaining about management malfeasance, or for donating to a political candidate management dislikes, or for any other reason?

Its email service Gmail has about a 25% market share, thanks to Android phones and its incursion into business software. (Our corporate emails at Dow Jones, the publisher of MarketWatch, are now handled by Gmail.) If this amount of power in the hands of one company doesn’t terrify you, you’re not paying attention. Google is too big. It should have been broken up long before this. That it hasn’t been tells you everything you need to know about modern government. I am disgusted and outraged that the company fired James Damore, the author of the memo that accused the company of being intolerant of conservative viewpoints, and claimed biological factors may be why women are underrepresented in tech and leadership. This is not because I happen to share his opinions on any given subject. That‘s irrelevant. But I believe passionately in freedom of thought and debate, and in the autonomy of the individual. And I am frightened we are sleepwalking into an Orwellian nightmare controlled not by government but by a small number of corporations or the fashions of the crowd. Americans have a massive cultural blind spot to this. We are sensitive to any challenge to personal freedom or autonomy, no matter how slight, that comes from government. Yet we are too often blind to threats, no matter how monstrous, that come from outside the government — including the “free” market, a baying mob or a massive organization. No sooner in our culture has someone been silenced by a nongovernment actor than smug, smirking apologists go online to say that of course this has nothing to do with freedom of speech because the First Amendment (notice the jump) only constrains government. Let the record show that I would be as outraged today if Google had just fired a woman for complaining about sexism, or for making an argument deemed “unacceptable” by the Google executives. It horrifies me how many feminists think the firing of Damore is a “win.” Their hypocrisy will be predictable, boring and contemptible when the shoe is on the other foot. I urge everyone this summer to re-read John Stuart Mill’s “On Liberty.” If people lose their jobs for speaking up, they will stop doing so. And if people are afraid to speak up, we are lost. Where does that leave us? Well, Google can fire its employees. But we can fire Google — just. And that’s what I’m doing. Starting now. Here’s how: 1. Gmail. This is easy to dump because there are plenty of decent alternatives: Not just Yahoo or MIcrosoft’s Outlook.com but plenty of others, including Swiss-based Protonmail.com, an independent, privacy-centered service started by scientists at CERN. Really, there is no good reason to stick with Google. So goodbye, Gmail. I’m sending out my change-of-address notices this evening. 2. Phones. Android is the gateway drug that Google is using to get control of everything else. And it’s terrifying.

YouTube. I am pretty much powerless to switch to a rival because YouTube is so dominant. That alone should make us all sit up and take notice. But here’s the thing: The companies that advertise on YouTube have no such power. So we are free to boycott them.

                                   approaches Thursday’s earnings report facing doubts that it will be able to withstand Instagram’s Stories clone and turn around huge losses — doubts that pushed the stock lower than its IPO price even before the lockups expire. Snap closed Tuesday at $13.02, nearly $4 down from the IPO price and more than 55% below the peak price paid for shares since Snap went public in March. Snap’s recovery plan includes acquisitions that have provided a fun way to share your location, paired with a fun way to use that location information to prove Snapchat’s worth to advertisers. Using location data to sell ads has been a favorite talking point of Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, over the years, as Facebook’s ad revenue has exploded. One of Snap’s few advantages on Facebook is that it is a video native, which excites the media more than additional content for Facebook.

A pricing war in that form factor would surely hurt Snap more than Alphabet. Chief Executive Evan Spiegel will likely try to focus on the location-based approach when Snap reports second-quarter earnings Thursday, but he will face questions about the more established bullies on Snap’s block. What to expect Earnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Snap to report a GAAP loss per share of 30 cents. Snap did not fully report a non-GAAP number last quarter, but analysts on average expect earnings, subtracting stock-based compensation, of 14 cents a share. The consensus on Estimize, a software platform that uses crowdsourcing from hedge-fund executives, brokerages, buy-side analysts and others, is for an adjusted loss per share of 14 cents. Snap has only had one quarter of publicly reported earnings, and it reported a loss per share of $2.31 in the previous quarter. Part of the reason for Snap’s big miss in the first quarter was because it recognized a large amount of stock-based compensation, including a close to $1 billion award for the company’s CEO Evan Spiegel. That amount will be paid quarterly over three years, but was entirely realized in the first quarter. Revenue: Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect revenue of $186 million, up from $149.6 million in the previous quarter. The Estimize consensus is for revenue of $188.5 million. In the previous quarter, Snap‘s revenue declined from its previous quarter tally of $165.7 million, recorded as a private company. Snap attributed that decline to seasonality.

                                   has gained 3%. However, the stock has bounced back somewhat from low of less than $12 last week. The average FactSet rating is hold with a price target of $19.62. What to look for: Investors will want to see signs of user growth. Facebook celebrated the first anniversary of Instagram Stories by revealing that it challenges Snapchat in one of Spiegel’s favorite metrics, time spent in the app. Snap has sold its smaller user base by praising its engagement, but Facebook’s Instagram Stories alone has already far surpassed that and reported 250 million daily active users as of June. Snap’s numbers last quarter showed that the company was having trouble growing overseas, as developing countries do not have the infrastructure to support Snapchat, according to Spiegel. The good news is that Snap brought in more Android users, who made up 30% of net additions last quarter, after the company worked to improve the Snap app on that operating system. To that end, James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt with a rare ‘buy’ rating on Snap, said he believes Snap’s struggles are more ‘self-inflicted,’ rather than affected by Facebook, as the company has not made meaningful progress with its premium video and has faced unreasonable seasonality in its average revenue per users. “In our view, the main thing standing in the way of Snap is Snap itself,” Cakmak wrote. Nomura analysts warned in June that user numbers may be slowing again this quarter, according to app download data. RBC Capital Markets analysts are predicting additions of 7 million daily active users, compared with Snap’s addition of 8 million in the first quarter. If Snap isn’t going to grow as fast, it has to make more money off the users it has. Snap’s average revenue per user fell 14% sequentially to less than a dollar last quarter, though that was still up 181% year-over-year. Improvement in that metric, especially for overseas users, would help to salve any pains from weak user growth.

See also:  AMC hits record low as unrelentingly poor box office continues to take a toll Investors were especially cheered by news of a planned $100 million stock buyback. AMC Chief Executive Adam Aron said he’s putting his money where his mouth is: “I also plan individually to buy AMC stock on the open market with personal monies within the next 60 days,” he said. Aron said he was “extremely disappointed” with AMC’s numbers, which were hurt by the weak box office trends that have weighed on the sector this year. The company lost $176.5 million in the quarter, or $1.35 per share, after net income of $24 million, or 24 cents per share during the same period a year ago. The FactSet consensus was for a loss of $1.34 per share. Revenue for the quarter was $1.20 billion, up from $764 million a year ago, but slightly below FactSet’s $1.22 billion consensus. The CEO said performance was further dampened by higher operating costs as the company absorbed savings in film exhibition costs. A strong performance for admissions at the company’s legacy AMC theaters was offset by weakness at former Carmike theaters, the chain it acquired last year for $1.2 billion. And the company took a $203 million pretax impairment charge related to its investment in National CineMedia, which while in theory is a non-cash charge, “ultimately will dampen AMC’s cash proceeds whenever those shares are sold.” See now: The summer movie box office is not living up to what the industry promised Related: Movie chain stocks hurt as results show poor summer slate, other woes The company is now planning to cut costs and boost revenue to add at least $30 million to EBITDA -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2017, reduce capital spending by $100 million in the second half and by another $100 million in 2018, find about $400 million of noncore assets to monetize in the next 24 months, and launch its buyback. Don’t miss: Disney and other studios could benefit from video on demand worth up to three times more than movie tickets “We continue to believe that our recliner seat theater renovations, food and beverage enhancements, and premium large format installations are smart investments to drive attendance, increase revenues and grow earnings for AMC both domestically and in Europe,” he said.

Eddie Baza Calvo on Wednesday reassured the U.S. territory’s residents and pushed back after North Korea’s latest saber-rattling. North Korea threatened a missile strike on a U.S. military base on Guam, with the bellicose message coming early Wednesday from that isolated Asian nation after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would respond with “fire and fury like the world has never seen” if North Korea doesn’t halt its threats. Trump’s comments came after a Washington Post report said North Korea has built a miniaturized nuclear warhead. Calvo aimed to soothe at the start of a video message. “I want to reassure the people of Guam that currently there is no threat to our island or the Marianas,” the governor said. “My Homeland Security adviser, who is in communications with Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, notes there is no change in the threat level resulting from North Korea events.” He then said he had spoken with White House officials, who promised to protect the largest of the Marianas Islands. Calvo also suggested reporters aren’t giving the full picture when it comes to the U.S. territory in the western Pacific Ocean. “I also want to remind the national media that Guam is American soil, and we have 200,000 Americans in Guam and the Marianas. We are not just a military installation,” he said. Here is his full video message: Want news about Asia delivered to your inbox? Subscribe to MarketWatch's free Asia Daily newsletter. Sign up here.

If confirmed, that’s good news for the chipmaker, which has ramped up efforts to get its components into more Apple devices. Apple already added Intel as a modem supplier for some iPhones last year. Expanding Apple Watch business with Intel is potentially bad news for its modem rival, Qualcomm Inc.

The bar was lowered after CEO Tim Cook in May conceded there’d been a “pause” in iPhone sales amid heavy promotion for a 10th-anniversary model scheduled for September. The earnings report overall was soothing enough to send shares to record highs this week, striking an intraday high of $159.75 the day after the earnings release and closing at an all-time best $157.14 that day. Analysts said guidance within the earnings release boosted market expectations that new iPhone hardware would emerge in September. That followed recent reports that a high-end iPhone rumored for release this year had hit production problems that would keep it from reaching prospective buyers before Apple’s fiscal year wraps at the end of September. AAPL closed Friday at $156.39.

Sara Sjolin,08102017,MarketWatch,08032017,"Published: Aug 4, 2017 7:56 a.m. ET Inflows into the much-loved sector have cooled in recent months By The love affair this year between investors and tech stocks has started to show the first signs of a relationship burnout. While the tech sector is on pace for a record 18% growth in assets under management in 2017, fund flows have cooled off in recent months, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s latest “Flow Show” report. And in the week ended Wednesday, the sector experienced a net outflow of $100 million , BAML notes. The cooling is illustrated in their chart below.

",How the passion for tech stocks is fading — in one chart - MarketWatch
Sue Chang,08102017,MarketWatch,08032017,"Published: Aug 7, 2017 4:43 a.m. ET Yardeni: ‘The path of least resistance is still higher for stocks’ By August and September have had dismal records for stock returns over the past 20 years and with strategists warning that the market is overdue for a major correction, the next two months could be rough. But there are reasons to believe that any impending selloff may not be as cataclysmic as some fear. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s technical research analyst Stephen Suttmeier pointed out that there are some very important factors that suggest that the market’s upward trajectory remains very much intact despite the track record working against it. “First half 2017 was above average and this bodes well for second half 2017 and the data for all periods, secular bull market years, and Presidential Cycle Year 1 suggest that the S&P 500 could end the year in the 2,550-2,640 range,” said Suttmeier in a report. In fact, during the early part of the presidential cycle, if stocks perform better than average in the first six months, the index rises 75% of the time in the second half with an average return of 5.38%, he said. The S&P 500 rose 8.2% from January to June and finished July 1.9% higher. Subdued volatility in the market is another reason to be optimistic. Suttmeier notes that the CBOE Volatility Index

                                   Wall Street’s so-called fear index, is trading at record lows. “The CBOE Volatility Index remains low and near 10 after hitting a record intra-day low of 8.84 on July 26. Data back to 1990 suggest that VIX is typically closer [to] 20 plus when the S&P 500 starts a correction of 5%, 10%, or 20%,” the analyst said. Things are looking fairly solid from a technical perspective as well. The NYSE advance/decline line — which tracks the number of advancing stocks minus the declining shares each day and adds that to the figure from the previous session — is at fresh highs, pointing to a limited downside even if the market turns south. But the best case for the S&P 500’s uptrend may be the following chart in which Suttmeier illustrates how the current bull market is tracing a similar path as the rallies of 1980 and 1950. “We believe that 2017 is the year of acceptance for the secular bull trend that began on the April 2013 upside breakout. The prior bull market breakouts from 1950 and 1980 lasted 15-20 years, which suggests that current secular bull market may have a decade or more to run,” he said. A soft U.S. dollar is also a boon for the market as a weak currency makes exports more price-competitive. Emmanuel Cau, an equity research analyst at J.P.

As of Friday, with 84% of S&P 500 companies having released second-quarter results, 72% have reported better than expected earnings and 70% have beat sales estimates, according to FactSet. “For now, the path of least resistance is still higher for stocks, especially since forward earnings continue to blaze that trail,” said Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, in a note to investors. “As strategists, we are aiming for 2,700 by the middle of next year, a four-fold increase since March 2009. Assuming a forward price-to-earnings of 18, we would need to see forward earnings climb to $150 per share by the middle of next year, up about 7.4% from the latest reading in late July.

A series of political scandals in recent months, including allegations that Abe provided favors for friends—charges he denies—have threatened the prime minister’s leadership. Recent polls have shown public support for Abe’s government below 30%, a record low. Voters have identified a lack of trust in Abe himself as a major reason for declining support, potentially making it more difficult for him to push through contentious objectives such as amending the nation’s pacifist constitution and exposing the economy to more foreign competition through free-trade deals. The cabinet overhaul appeared designed to restore support in the government, as well as indicate Abe is willing to embrace a wider range of views within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, analysts said.

Priceline late Tuesday reported EPS of $15.14, topping the FactSet consensus of $14.40. But bookings of $20.8 billion were below the consensus of $21.05 billion. Executives issued third-quarter adjusted earnings guidance of $32.40 per share to $34.10 per share, also below the consensus of $34.21. Read also:  When you should use travel booking sites like Expedia and Priceline — and when you shouldn’t “Priceline’s guidance will inevitably divide investors into two camps: those that view this as structural headwinds from market saturation/competition (bears) and those that view this as transitory headwind from tough comps (bulls),” Raymond James analysts wrote in a note. They are in the latter camp, recognizing that the tough comparisons will generate a midteens room night growth profile in the near term that is about 500 basis points below their prior expectations. But that will drive a roughly 1% hit to EPS as foreign exchange and the variable nature of advertising mute the impact. “As tough comps fade, we believe investors will resume focusing on the core elements of the story — a global supply leader that’s positioned for share gains and continued mid/high-teens EPS growth,” they wrote, reiterating an outperform rating on the stock. See also: Move over, London and Paris — these unlikely foreign cities have seen a spike in popularity this summer Related: Hotel-search site Trivago is bringing Silicon Valley to Germany Susquehanna analysts also struck a bullish tone on the results, and said the same midteens room nights growth, while lower than before, is still strong and suggests the stock can rise further. “We remain positive on PCLN’s secular opportunity to penetrate hotels and private accommodations room nights, which should continue to drive strong overall growth,” said analysts led by Shyam Patil. “While room night growth expectations are being readjusted downward, we believe room nights growth is likely to hold strong in the mid-to-high teens and would recommend buying on the pullback.” Piper Jaffray said guidance was typical of Priceline’s conservative management’s approach to forecasting, and noted that Priceline has beaten the midpoint of EPS guidance by an average 11% in the past 14 quarters. “We continue to believe that Priceline is well positioned to capture an increasing share of travel bookings in the company’s core international markets, which we expect will drive less deceleration in bookings growth than many expect over the coming quarters,” they wrote in a note. Don’t miss: Priceline investors are being fooled again. Piper Jaffray rates the stock overweight with a $2,150 price target, equal to 14% above current trading levels. TripAdvisor posted second-quarter earnings that beat expectations for profit and revenue. The company reported per-share earnings of 19 cents, down from 23 cents a year ago. Adjusted EPS came to 38 cents, ahead of the FactSet consensus of 30 cents. Revenue rose to $424 million from $391 million, to top the FactSet consensus of $421 million. The company said non-hotel revenue rose 31% to 498 million, while other hotel revenue fell 12% to $38 million. “We remain on the sidelines on TripAdvisor as the strength in non-hotel and less severe margin erosion are offset by a slow recovery in hotel monetization,” Raymond James analysts wrote in a note. “Mobile monetization and international competition are headwinds that we do not foresee abating in the near term,” they wrote, reiterating a market perform rating. Other online travel stocks were mixed, with hotel booking site Trivago N.V.

"Evan Niu, CFA",08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Services has emerged as a key business for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one that is becoming increasingly important to the bottom line -- not only because it's one of the fastest-growing segments, but also because it's much more profitable. Services revenue jumped 22% last quarter, and is now the size of a Fortune 100 company. Digital content subscriptions, Apple Music, and iCloud storage are all contributing to that growth. But there could be another important driver in the mix: Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google. The default search option on Apple's mobile Safari is an incredibly valuable spot to be in, not least of which because iOS users are unable to change the default web browser. Google has enjoyed its place as the default search engine in the default browser in iOS for a decade, and pays handsomely for that privilege. Confirming prior estimates, court documents from last year showed that Google paid Apple $1 billion in traffic acquisition costs (TAC) related to its place as the default search engine in iOS. Google would love it if more people just used its app instead of the Safari search bar. Image source: Pixabay. Bernstein has just put out a research note (via CNBC) estimating that Google will end up paying closer to $3 billion this year, and this money is included in Apple's services business. If that estimate is accurate, that could represent somewhere around 10% of services revenue. On a trailing-12-month basis through June, Apple has generated $27.8 billion in services revenue, but this segment should continue to post growth in the latter two quarters of 2017. It gets better. While services are generally a high-margin business for Apple, the licensing fees that Google pays are ""nearly all profit,"" according to Bernstein. Other parts of the services business come with greater costs. Apple must invest in developing its first-party services like Apple Music (which also includes substantial licensing fees and royalties to record labels), and cover infrastructure costs associated with things like iCloud storage. Apple enjoys a cut of third-party subscriptions (30% for the first year, and 15% after that) and app sales (30%), but has to cover operating expenses associated with running its digital storefronts. That's no easy task, as there are now over 2.2 million apps in the App Store. In contrast, selecting Google or any alternative search engine as the default is akin to flipping a switch with minimal costs, sending all that traffic to Google. iOS contributes roughly half of Google's mobile search revenue by Bernstein's estimates. That's why Bernstein thinks that those licensing fees could comprise a whopping 5% of Apple's total operating income in 2017. Furthermore, these payments could account for 25% of the Mac maker's operating income growth over the past two years. Apple is definitely making progress in growing its services business, and still hopes to double the segment by 2020. Google's payments are helping, too. ","
      
    What's Driving Apple's Services Profits? It May Be Google. -- The Motley Fool

  "
Chris Neiger,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There's a lot of potential for investors in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Myriad companies -- like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google -- are betting on a variety of AI segments, including data processing, deep learning, machine learning, driverless cars, etc. that all contribute to  AI's growing market potential -- which is estimated to be worth $46 billion in just two years. So, let's take a quick look at a few things investors should know about AI, including some key areas to invest, which companies are leading in the space, and why you should take the long view with any AI investment you make. Image source: Getty Images. Artificial intelligence can seem like a very abstract idea to a lot of people, so let's demystify it just a bit. If you've ever tagged a friend in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) photo or asked Siri or Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa a question, then you've interacted with a type of AI technology. Facebook uses its own AI to help recognize photos of your friends and to figure out the context of your text and even video posts. Facebook uses AI to both deliver the most relevant (or what it thinks are the most relevant) posts in your news feed and also police offensive content. Amazon not only uses AI for it Alexa-powered devices like the Echo, but also for its lucrative Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing unit. The company has added machine learning services -- a type of artificial intelligence that allows programs to learn based on past information -- to AWS, including natural language processing, speech generation, and image analysis. Those are a few examples of AI being used in software, but AI investments aren't just relegated to that segment. Investors can also bet on more tangible (literally) investments like graphics processors. NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering some of the most sophisticated AI tech for Google, Facebook, and Amazon, and are the brains behind transformative driverless car technologies. NVIDIA's Drive PX Pegasus is the company's latest AI supercomputer for self-driving vehicles. The GPU-maker already has 225 companies developing on the Drive PX platform and 25 of them are developing fully autonomous robo-taxis, according to NVIDIA. NVIDIA has quickly become a rising star in the AI space primarily because its graphics processors have the potential to tap so many AI markets. Here's a breakdown of what NVIDIA sees at its primary artificial intelligence markets, along with its total addressable market estimate in each: Data source: NVIDIA. The artificial intelligence market is expected to be worth $46 billion by 2020, but many investors will likely need to stay patient as their particular investing segment takes shape. For example, if you invest in NVIDIA because its graphics processors are likely to power many driverless cars, you should keep in mind that it's likely going to take another two decades before fully self-driving cars are ubiquitous. PricewaterhouseCooper says that AI will contribute up to $15.7 trillion to global GDP by 2030. If that proves true, then some AI investors could make some massive gains between now and then -- but they'll have to be patient and likely stomach a few market dips before we reach that point. Many tech investors are often looking for disruptors that can upend the status quo in a particular industry. But with AI, the market is still so young that it's best for investors to focus on which companies are leading in the space right now. I've already mentioned a handful of them above, but let's focus our attention on Google for just a minute. The company has already purchased at least 20 artificial intelligence companies over the past few years, more than any other company, including Microsoft, Apple, and Intel. Last year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the company is making, ""An important shift from a mobile first world to an AI first world."" Google's parent company, Alphabet, has nearly the entire gamut of the AI industry covered and has built its own AI servers, implemented AI software into its products and services, and uses it for its Google Assistant home speaker. The company is also on the second version of its own AI chip that it developed in-house. Google knows that AI hardware and software will be a big part of nearly every major computing system in the near future, and it's planning accordingly right now. As inevitable as AI's market growth seems, investors should remember that there's no guarantee that AI will take off for any of these companies. I certainly think there are plenty of indicators that AI will be huge, but that doesn't mean that NVIDIA or even Google might not stumble in a way that hurts their AI-earning potential. Additionally, investors should remember that artificial intelligence software can be applied to just about any sector, so it's best to narrow down AI investments to a handful of categories that you feel comfortable with, and in which you fully understand the business.

    How to Invest in Artificial Intelligence -- The Motley Fool

Danny Vena,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Though the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) has been around since the 1950s, it was the advent of big data and improvements in computing power that enabled practical applications of the science. But with all the press concerning AI and the myriad advancements, the concept remains elusive to many. Much of the progress made in the field has been the result of deep learning, a technique of AI. Investors may be hesitant to chase technology that is still in its infancy, and they may be wondering what's behind the headlines and if there's a way to profit from this emerging paradigm. Let's review the science behind the technology and look at three companies taking the lead in these exciting breakthroughs: Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU). AI has only been making headlines over the last few years, but the real story has been deep learning. Using the structure of the human brain as a guideline, scientists have succeeded in creating advanced computing models called neural networks that learn in stages, similar to their human counterparts. Using algorithms to direct the process, these computer systems have been taught to recognize patterns. This seemingly simple accomplishment has expanded like ripples in a pond and led to innovations that allow these systems to recognize images as well as written and spoken words. Deep learning represents a fundamental shift in AI. Image source: Getty Images. There are numerous examples of how you are already using these developments in your daily routine. The virtual assistants that come standard on smartphones are powered by the technology, which allows them to respond to your voice and follow instructions. Deep learning also forms the foundation for self-driving cars, which are already on the road. When social media suggests tagging a friend, an e-commerce site recommends a purchase, or a streaming service makes movie recommendations, each of these instances has deep learning at its core. Google has been at the forefront of AI research for years, but its first major breakthrough came in 2012. After feeding 10 million images from YouTube videos into its Google Brain, the deep learning system was able to pick out the images of cats. This seemingly innocuous accomplishment was the beginning of the modern AI era, led by Stanford University professor and acknowledged AI expert Andrew Ng, who founded the Google Brain project. The company has since used the technology to optimize its search results, power its virtual assistant, and improve its translation services. It also made the tech available to its cloud users. Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car unit, has produced what is likely the most advanced autonomous vehicle in the world, which is being tested with volunteer riders. The company plans to launch ""the world's first driverless ride-hailing service"" sometime in 2018. A partnership with Avis Budget Group takes the company one step closer to bringing the technology to the masses. Image source: Getty Images. Microsoft has used its deep learning for many of the same purposes: to improve the results of its Bing search, act as a translator for Skype, and power its Cortana virtual assistant. The company has also made key acquisitions in the area. In early 2017, the company acquired Canadian deep learning start-up Maluuba, which focused on improving AI's ability to communicate with humans more effectively and improving its decision-making skills. While it has been deploying deep learning across a broad swath of its products and services, much of Microsoft's focus has been around its Azure cloud. To that end, it also acquired cybersecurity start-up Hexadite, which uses deep learning to reduce the time required to respond to cyberincidents by as much as 95%. Microsoft's AI investment in its cloud computing business appears to be paying off. For FY 2018's second quarter, the company reported that revenue from its Azure cloud grew 98% year over year, and Microsoft was identified by Gartner's Magic Quadrant as one of the leaders in the cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS) category. Baidu, Inc. may not be a household name to U.S. investors, but it's the online search leader in its native China. The company used the talents of Ng, who founded the Google Brain, to jump-start its own deep learning aspirations and has the most advanced AI program in China. The resulting Baidu Brain hosts an ecosystem of 60 different AI services. Deep learning has been deployed to advance and expand its business, improve its search relevance, make recommendations for its streaming service, and bring greater accuracy to its maps service. It has been deployed to increase user engagement, and the company says it has achieved a 97% success rate in voice recognition, which is at the heart of its DuerOS virtual assistant. In its recent entry into the financial services market, it uses AI to determine the creditworthiness of its borrowers. Baidu also sports the most advanced autonomous driving program in China. In 2017 it decided to open source the project, called Apollo, and has announced partnerships with more than 85 companies to advance the technology. It is still early days for AI and deep learning, and it would be difficult to quantify each company's earning potential. Still, some estimates place the total value of the AI market at $36 billion by 2025. With that much at stake, these leaders in deep learning could be ""intelligent"" additions to your portfolio.

Adam Levy,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's no secret that people don't watch as much TV as they used to. Millennials, in particular, are leading the way when it comes to cord-cutting and watching less broadcast television in favor of streaming services like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Hulu. You might think the biggest beneficiary of the trend is Netflix. As more people eschew traditional television for streaming services, the leader in the category stands to gain. But there's an entirely different industry that stands to gain billions of dollars in revenue as a result of people watching less television: internet advertising. Two companies in particular -- Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- stand to benefit the most. Image source: Getty Images. Advertisers will spend $69.9 billion on television ads in the United States in 2018, according to eMarketer. But as people spend less time watching TV (and the commercials that are broadcast alongside programming), that number will start to fall. eMarketer expects U.S. TV ad spending to fall to $69.2 billion in 2019 before bouncing back slightly in 2020 due to the Olympics and presidential election coverage. That decline in ad spending is more than made up for by the increase in digital advertising, which eMarketer expects to climb 18.7% this year to $107.3 billion, and reach $142.2 billion by 2020. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is fond of saying that ad dollars will follow eyeballs. So, as eyeballs continue to shift to their owners' phones and computer screens, so will the ad budgets. The other options for advertising -- print media, radio, etc. -- couldn't possibly take on tens of billions in new ad dollars. But total users and time spent on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and other apps continues to climb. YouTube boasts more than 1.5 billion viewers watching over an hour per day on average. Instagram just announced that its youngest users spend over half an hour per day in the app on average. Meanwhile, television viewing among 12- to 24-year-olds was down nearly 50% from the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2017. Data source: MarketingCharts.com analysis of Nielsen data. Graph source: Author. To be sure, people still spend a ton of time watching television. Even young people spend over 13 hours per week in front of the TV. So, it's not like television advertising is just going to disappear. Likewise, print and radio advertising still bring in billions of ad dollars. Still, the only medium really growing is the internet. If you believe the cord-cutting trend will continue and ad budgets will shift to digital advertising, you ought to own shares of Alphabet or Facebook. The two combined to take nearly all of the growth in digital advertising during 2016. The two may see their share of digital ad spending growth fall over the next few years, but they'll still take the lion's share of the market. Google is benefiting from the growth of mobile, as its search engine is even more dominant on mobile than on desktop. It's also benefiting from the increasing popularity of YouTube, which provides an excellent replacement for television ads. In fact, Google is investing in more quality content to attract television advertisers. Facebook, likewise, is investing in its own video content in an effort to attract those TV ad dollars. It's also been able to grow engagement on Instagram with the introduction of Instagram Stories, and it's only just started showing ads on Messenger. But the biggest reason Google and Facebook win nearly every new ad dollar that flows to digital is because they offer unparalleled reach. Television advertisers are interested in reaching as many people as possible with their messages. Nobody else can offer the same reach as Facebook and Google. As Sandberg says, Facebook has ""a Super Bowl on mobile every day."" As more ad dollars follow the eyeballs from television to digital, Facebook and Google will surely see the vast majority of that revenue. Streaming services like Netflix will benefit from the desire for video entertainment, but they don't provide a home for those ad dollars, which present a much bigger revenue opportunity than $10-per-month subscriptions. Even if Netflix grew its global subscribers by 150 million, that represents just $18 billion in total revenue at $10 per month. The U.S. digital ad market alone could increase by twice as much over the next five years as ad budgets shift to digital. That's why Facebook and Google stand to benefit more than Netflix from the decline in TV viewership. ","
      
    Millennials Aren't Watching TV. Buy These Stocks (Not Netflix) to Profit. -- The Motley Fool

  "
John Rosevear,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For a while, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) was a popular stock among Foolish investors. Now-retired CEO Alan Mulally had restructured the storied automaker without government help, putting it on a path to steady, profitable growth. Ford stock wasn't always so popular: Way back in early 2009, when all of Detroit appeared doomed, I asked readers to talk me out of buying Ford shares. You didn't, and I'm glad. I was also glad that quite a few Fools jumped in around the same time. We had a very profitable ride. But since those highs, and despite good profits over the last couple of years, Ford has slowly fallen out of favor with investors. F data by YCharts. Now, with Ford shares trading at less than seven times the company's expected 2017 earnings, it seems like a good time to ask: Is Ford stock a buy, a sell, or a hold? Let's take a closer look. There are two common bearish narratives for Ford stock: that Ford is at risk of disruption from new high-tech market entrants and new business models, and that the all-important U.S. new-vehicle market appears to be past its cyclical peak, putting Ford's margins at risk. Investors' ongoing fascination with Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) dramatic growth story has seemingly cast a shadow over Ford (and other big automakers). At the extreme, the bullish investment case for Tesla stock assumes that it will become the largest and most profitable company in the history of humanity. How could Ford stock compete with that? There are genuine concerns beyond the Tesla hype. Quite a few analysts think the world is moving toward ""transportation as  a service,"" in which many of us will choose to give up car ownership in favor of mobility services using self-driving electric taxis. If so, given that the technology that will enable such services is probably only a few years away, where will Ford find profit growth -- if it even survives? A related concern that's less bearish but still bearish: Even assuming that Ford can retool its business and product line to thrive in such a world, how much will it have to spend over the next few years to get there? Ford has been feasting on the popularity of well-optioned versions of its huge-selling F-Series pickups. A recession will put a big damper on that feast. Image source: Ford Motor Company. There's no question that this one is for real. The U.S. new-car market is clearly softening. As it softens further, increasing pricing pressure and declining sales will eat into Ford's profit margins. Given that Ford generated 61% of its revenue in North America last year, with a 9.7% operating margin in the region, you can see the concern. As that gets squeezed, so will Ford's bottom line. Ford's electric-vehicle efforts aren't nearly as visible as Tesla's, but they do exist. Among other projects, Ford is working with Deutsche Post (DHL) on electric package delivery trucks for use in Germany. Image source: Ford Motor Company. Despite the bearish concerns, Ford stock has some big things going for it as an investment, even now. The market may be sluggish, and possibly even headed for a decline before too long. But there's good news, too, in that consumer trends in the U.S., Europe, and China all favor Ford's most profitable products: trucks, commercial vehicles, and SUVs. That means Ford's profits are still strong: Ford earned $10.4 billion before taxes in 2016, and expects to earn close to $9 billion on that basis in 2017, despite the slipping market, higher commodity costs, and increased investments in future technologies. Ford isn't flinching from the possibility of a slowdown in new-vehicle sales. Unlike some rivals, notably General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford's U.S. inventories are in great shape, meaning that it won't have to discount deeply to clear out unwanted vehicles. Ford has shown repeatedly that it can quickly adjust its production to meet demand as it falls (or rises, for that matter). It's also important to note that Ford has a hefty $28.4 billion cash reserve to sustain new-product development even if its profits disappear during a downturn. That was a key factor in Ford's success in the first couple of years after the last recession: It had fresh products available while its rivals were still scrambling to recover. Ford's autonomous-vehicle effort is thought to be among the industry's most advanced. Ford plans to roll out a fully self-driving vehicle in 2021. Image source: Ford Motor Company. While the disruption concerns are real at an industrywide level, Ford's doing just fine with the future tech: It has a strong self-driving research and development program, a big commitment to electric drivetrains, and a subsidiary that is putting together a series of compelling mobility-related offerings for cities. Ford also sees ways to leverage its decades of commercial-fleet expertise in the new mobility-enabled world, as a provider of fleet management services to operators of automated ride-haling and car-sharing fleets. (That has the potential to be a very lucrative business.) There's no doubt that some automakers will be left behind as technology changes the way we get around, but Ford is better prepared than most. Ford CEO Jim Hackett took the Blue Oval's reins in May. His mission: to make Ford more profitable, more nimble, and more tech-savvy. Image source: Ford Motor Company. Ford's board has shown that it isn't afraid to shake things up to keep the company on course. Ford has a new CEO, Jim Hackett, who has experience in tech-savvy corporate transformations (and who led Ford's mobility subsidiary before taking the top job.) Hackett has said that his mission is to sharpen Ford's execution, speed decision-making, and ensure that Ford can thrive in that future world of tech-enabled mobility. He has a good team behind him: Most of Ford's senior executives are veterans of the turnaround who have proven themselves in the years since. The low valuation of Ford stock means that its dividend is yielding a fat 5.5% at the moment. And that dividend is sustainable, thanks to that hefty cash reserve. Ford expects to keep paying the dividend to shareholders through a downturn, at least as long as its cash reserve holds out. (Ford has a substantial credit line to draw on if it runs out of cash, but that credit line won't be used to fund the dividend.) Chariot, a crowdsourced shuttle-bus service, and a Ford-branded bicycle-sharing service are two components of Ford's growing suite of urban ""mobility"" offerings. Image source: Ford Motor Company. To sum up, there are real, substantial arguments both for and against an investment in Ford's stock now. An investor who buys here can reinvest that hefty dividend to dollar-cost average through any downturn, getting paid to be patient while Hackett and his team, backed by a strong balance sheet, work to complete the transformation of Ford and its businesses. But as we've seen, an investment in Ford stock isn't without risk. The market for new cars (and trucks, a super-important Ford profit center today) could transform and even shrink substantially over the next 10 to 15 years. And Ford's profits aren't likely to be growing in the near term: They'll almost certainly be down year over year in 2017, and Ford's bottom line will shrink further if (or rather, when) the U.S., Europe, or China enters a recession. Long story short: If you're attracted to the dividend and think Ford will prosper as the world changes, Ford stock could be a buy. But investors should tread carefully, as the risks are real.

    Ford Motor Company Stock: Buy, Sell, or Hold? -- The Motley Fool

Chris Neiger,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Virtual Reality (VR) is one of those technologies that's been promised for years, but has -- until recently -- failed to live up to the hype. There's plenty of evidence pointing to a bright future for VR, but investors need to know a few things first -- like how big the market will be, what the risks are, who the key players are, and why they should to play this strategy out over the long term. So, let's take a look at six things you should know before investing in VR. Grand View Research estimates that that the global VR market will be worth $48.5 billion by 2025. That's the top-end of some estimates and others range from $7.5 billion and $22.5 billion. The VR market was worth just $1.8 billion last year, which means virtual reality is poised for huge growth no matter which estimate is more accurate. Image source: Getty Images. VR investors need to keep in mind that this technology will likely need more time to get off the ground, mainly because of virtual reality's expensive hardware costs. Consider that when Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus launched its high-end Rift headset. It priced the device at $599 and its Touch controllers at $199. That's a hefty price tag for most consumers and Oculus ended up dropping the price of its VR package twice to its current $399 price tag for both the headset and controllers. But most consumers still don't have an extra $400 to just spend on VR equipment, and these price points are going to keep mainstream consumers away from high-end VR tech for a while. Additionally, high-end VR equipment requires lots of processing power to deliver high-quality graphics with low latency (so that the virtual world moves smoothly as a user looks around). NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) noted last year that less than 1% of PCs were capable of running high-end VR, and while that percentage has likely gone up this year, investors need to remember that most consumers won't be using high-end virtual reality for many years. One of the great things about VR investing is that there are several avenues investors can take in order to benefit. If you're interested in chipmakers, then you can invest in NVIDIA, which makes graphics processing units (GPUs) that are the go-to high-end chips that PC makers choose for their graphics processing needs. NVIDIA makes about 53% of its total revenue from the gaming segment (chips for gaming processing), which makes the company a keyer in the VR space. Additionally, the company's Daydream platform -- where users can download more than 100 VR apps -- is one of the first, and only, of its kind. Google is quickly building its mobile VR dominance in the same way it did with Android and is already figuring out how to earn money from VR through advertising. I've already mentioned Facebook, NVIDIA, and Google, but plenty of other technology companies are looking to virtual reality for more growth. Sony (NYSE:SNE) has an advantage in the console market after the company released its PlayStation VR headset that works on current versions of its PlayStation 4. The company has already sold 60.4 million PS4s to date and has already sold more than 1 million VR headsets since its launch last October. The sheer number of PS4 consoles on the market make Sony an attractive VR hardware play, and considering that the company's Game and Network Services segment (which includes its console sales) accounts for the majority of its total revenue, then Sony could certainly benefit if headset sales continue to expand. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has also made several moves indicating that the company wants to be a serious virtual reality player. Most recently, the company has started hiring engineers that can build high-end graphics processors. The company may still be a few years away from fully realizing those ambitions, but in the meantime Intel is working on a VR headset, called Project Alloy, that can has all the internal processing power built into it. This means that the headset doesn't need to be tethered to a PC in order to deliver a high-end VR experience. One thing VR investors should remember is that many companies that are betting on VR are also making plays in the augmented reality (AR) space as well. Augmented reality is the digital overlay of information onto the real world and its so entwined with VR that investors may end up benefiting from both. For example, I mentioned earlier that Google is doing quite a lot in VR, it also just relaunched its Google Glass device, which is being tested out by healthcare professionals, factory workers for General Electric, and package distribution for DHL. Because VR and AR share similar tech (like headsets, displays, 3D digital information, and graphics), there's lots of overlap between the two that could end up being a hidden benefit for VR investors. IDC expects the combined total spending for AR/VR products and services to skyrocket from $11.4 billion this year to $215 billion by 2021. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that VR could take at least five to 10 years to truly take off. It's worth remembering that this timeframe is coming from one of the most forward-thinking tech billionaires of our time. So if Zuckerberg is playing the long game with his company's VR investments, then you can expect that you'll probably have to do the same. And as with any investment, picking a good VR stock starts with finding a solid business that you can stick with over the long-haul. All of the companies listed above have lots of potential in VR, but none of them are betting on it entirely or even earning significant profits from it right now. Rather, each company is creating a long-term strategy right now so that they can benefit from VR later -- and investors should take a similar approach. ","
      
    6-Point Checklist for Investing in Virtual Reality -- The Motley Fool

Daniel Miller,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers (NYSE:RBA) had a strong 2016, driven in large part by the surge in demand for equipment tied to the oil and gas markets. Its stock jumped 46% during the year. 2017, however, has been virtually the opposite for RBA investors: The stock has slumped 20% year to date despite the company reporting better-than-expected second-quarter results. Let's take a look at the highlights from the company's second quarter and try to find out where this roller-coaster ride could be headed next. Investors initially walked away pleased with RBA's second quarter; RBA's revenue checked in at $166.2 million, which was higher than analysts' estimates calling for $163.4 million, per Thomson Reuters. That better-than-expected top-line result filtered down to the bottom line as well, with RBA's adjusted earnings per share checking in at $0.33, a full two pennies above analysts' estimates. The raw numbers show that RBA had a solid quarter and the market's initial response Tuesday was to push the stock roughly 10% higher before giving those gains right back the following day -- but here are some important details beyond the headline figures to be aware of. Image source: Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers. First, it's critical that investors understand RBA's top-line growth isn't organic, as the market remains challenging currently -- rather, the growth is from the company's IronPlanet acquisition. As you can see in the chart below, organic growth is slower in the near term. Management noted that the pressure in the markets, due to constrained equipment supply, will likely remain throughout 2017. ""Our results in the second quarter of 2017 were unfavorably affected by a severe shortage in supply of used construction equipment especially in the U.S. as end users achieved high levels of equipment utilization in state and local infrastructure projects. We expect supply to remain constrained in the second half of 2017,"" said Ritchie Bros. CEO Ravi Saligram in a press release. Image source: Ritchie Bros. Aug. 8, 2017, second-quarter Earnings Review. Despite the top-line pressure, there was a bright spot: revenue run rate. During the second quarter, RBA's revenue run rate increased to 13.2%, a 70-basis-point improvement from the prior quarter's 12.5%. If RBA can generate better revenue run rates, essentially earning more incremental revenue from the equipment sold at its auctions, it will help offset the lower volume. Another important thing to note is that generating cost synergies from its IronPlanet acquisition is a critical task for the company, in order to achieve better margins and profits. So far, so good: Management appears to be starting off on the right foot with a smooth day-one strategy and significant progress during the first 60 days of implementation. Management expects to create run-rate synergies in excess of $10 million by the end of this year alone, and up to $20 million by the end of 2018. In addition, RBA has bulked up its sales force to proactively cross-sell its products, services, and financing through its expanding channels -- online, mobile, and live, among others -- which will help drive incremental revenue from its current customer base. At a time when the company faces tougher organic growth in the near term, integrating its acquisition smoothly and quickly will help fuel bottom-line growth, and that's a huge positive for those considering RBA as an investment. Investors should take the recent news and data with a healthy dose of patience. During the second half of 2017, RBA will not only have to deal with the aforementioned macroeconomic headwinds as equipment supply remains constrained, but will also face tough comparisons from the prior year's largest ever two-day auction, in Columbus, Ohio, in the third quarter and a private treaty that management mentioned in the fourth quarter, both of which are nonrecurring. Beyond those immediate headwinds, the road to full integration of IronPlanet will be a long one, and investors will need patience to see the benefits. More specifically, management is working on integrating the sales process, along with pricing and appraisal tools, and making services available across its platforms. But RBA needs to expand its IronPlanet assets internationally and enable customers to access all brands and services from one account. Then it has to integrate accounting systems and optimize workflow systems to continue creating cost synergies -- a long process that investors typically overlook, but will take some time to bear fruit between 2017 and 2019. Still, if RBA can continue to drive strong results while not losing sight of its most important asset -- its massive customer base -- the long-term investment thesis for the stock will remain as strong as ever. No competitor comes close to matching RBA's size, operating scale, and global reach. And the company is only strengthening that competitive advantage, which is great news for investors. ","
      
    3 Key Takeaways From Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers' Strong Second Quarter -- The Motley Fool

  "
Todd Campbell,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett's legendary for his ability to pick long-term stocks, so when he files his 13-F report with the SEC detailing his latest buys, investors are right to pay attention. His current 13-F report shows that the Oracle of Omaha continues to bet big on Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) success. It also shows that his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) took new positions in Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) and Store Capital Corp. (NYSE:STOR). Is now the right time to be following Buffett's footsteps and buy these stocks for your own portfolio? Warren Buffett was already one of Apple's biggest shareholders, yet he still increased his Apple stake in the second quarter, exiting June with a whopping 131 million shares worth about $20.8 billion (yes, billion). Image source: Motley Fool. Why's the Oracle of Omaha so enchanted with this consumer technology Goliath? Perhaps it's Apple's fast-approaching next-generation iPhone. Buffett first bought shares in Apple in early 2016 after shares dropped because of worry over slowing sales in China and fewer iPhone users upgrading their devices. He made those first buys when shares were trading below $100, so they've paid off handsomely. Apple's shares are trading at over $160 ahead of the company's iPhone release later this year. Investors might have good reason to be optimistic that the next iPhone will include enough features to entice consumers to ditch their aging smartphones. Rumors are that the next iPhone will include never-before offered features like 3D sensing and an OLED display. 3D sensing technology has been around since the Wii and Xbox Kinect, but it's only now that this technology can be made small enough and efficient enough to be included in handheld devices. Similarly, OLED displays have been wowing TV viewers for years, however, it's only recently that OLED technology has advanced to a point where it can be included in mobile devices cost effectively. Assuming rumors are correct and Apple unveils a feature-rich phone this fall, it could unlock a tidal wave of demand from consumers who have, until now, been satisfied owning devices that are one or two generations behind the times. In turn, those upgrades could drive sales higher across Apple's ecosystem by boosting demand for games, music, and videos. Apple's opportunity is even more compelling when we consider that the company, while not firing on every cylinder in the past year, is still performing quite well. Last quarter, revenue was $45.4 billion and earnings per share was $1.67. Those results compared favorably to revenue of $42.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.42 in the year-ago quarter. Apple shares could also benefit if sales of its other new products take-off. Earlier this year, it announced a premium product to compete against Google Home and Amazon Echo, and rumors are its next watch won't require tethering to an iPhone, something that could make it attractive to more people. Overall, it appears to be a good time to be an Apple investor. Perhaps one surprise in Warren Buffett's latest 13-F report is a new stake in Synchrony Financial, a consumer credit company. Berkshire Hathaway amassed a $518 million position in Synchrony during the second quarter. Unlike other consumer credit companies, Synchrony Financial, which was spun-off from GE in 2015, focuses on private label credit cards that bear the brand of businesses, such as retailers. Buffett -- or possibly his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who typically manage smaller positions in his portfolio -- might have gone bargain shopping when Synchrony Financial's shares tumbled in April following larger than expected write-offs. About 30% of Synchrony Financial cardholders have credit scores south of 660. or levels associated with subprime lending. Bad loans are concerning, but Synchrony's financials are on solid footing, and its valuation is attractive, suggesting that as long as the economy hangs in there, shares could head higher. Currently, Synchrony Financial trades at less than 10 times next year's earnings estimates and its price to book is 1.74. Its PEG ratio, a measure of P/E to future growth, is also attractive at just 1.27. To put those numbers in better perspective, consider that American Express is one of Buffett's biggest positions, and its forward P/E is 13.7, its price to book is 3.7, and its PEG ratio is 1.59. It probably doesn't hurt the case for buying Synchrony Financial either that its trailing 12-month operating margin is double that of American Express. Image source: Getty Images. Increasing interest rates have taken a little luster off REITs, yet as the industry has seen declines in share prices, Warren Buffett, or his team, have used the drop to gobble up nearly a 10% stake in Store Capital. Store Capital specializes in leasing free-standing buildings largely to service-oriented businesses. Tenants, such as movie theaters, health clubs, and restaurants, sign long-term leases with built in rent increases, and tenants accept the responsibility of variable costs, such as property taxes, insurance, and depending on the lease, some maintenance. Renting to service oriented businesses provides Store Capital with more insulation against the threat of e-commerce, which is drastically reshaping traditional brick-and-mortar real estate, including shopping malls. And lease terms that include rent escalators mean Store Capital receives a nice steady stream of ever-increasing cash flow that it can use to finance more projects and dividend payments. So far this year, the company's plowed $600 million into acquisitions and it remains on target to spend $900 million on acquisitions this year. As for its dividend, its current payout and share price works out to a very respectable 4.8% yield. Combine a predictable stream of shareholder friendly revenue growth with a Treasury-beating dividend payout and you could very well have an excellent recipe for success. ","

On Wednesday night, Eastman Kodak (NYSE:KODK) revealed results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. The report was far from picture-perfect, and management had to reduce its full-year guidance targets. Share prices plunged as much as 15.8% on the news in Thursday's trading session. What went wrong? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. Metric Q2 2017 Q2 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $381 million $423 million (9.9%) Net income from continuing operations $7 million $9 million (22%) GAAP earnings per share (diluted, from continuing operations) $0.05 $0.18 (72%) Data source: Eastman Kodak. Based on the tough business trends seen in the second quarter, Kodak issued the following updates to last quarter's full-year guidance targets: Eastman Kodak CEO Jeff Clarke is not giving up on the consumer division. That segment also accounts for commercial film products, the celluloid some filmmakers still insist on using in this increasingly digital age: It's a relatively low-revenue business, dwarfed by approximately $200 million in annual sales of films for printed circuit board production. But filmmakers and TV content producers are giving Kodak a taste of growing sales while the industrial business is shrinking. Kodak is doing well in a handful of product lines, but the overall business is suffering. I think the company's management team is smart to slow down and eventually close underperforming operations, doubling down on the parts that actually work. That being said, Kodak's share prices have been cut in half since the start of 2017 and dropped 65% lower in three years. The company is barely profitable and the only clear path toward strong cash flows would involve shedding most of Kodak's remaining business operations. Kodak has come a long way since filing for bankruptcy in 2012, but the company also has a long way to go before I would call it a reasonable investment.

Wendy Connick,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. One of the touchiest aspect of the House and Senate healthcare reform bills was the proposal to cut federal funding to Medicaid. To understand why this had so many people in both parties up in arms, you need to understand how the program itself works and what it does. Medicaid is a public health insurance program specifically for needy and low-income Americans. It's jointly funded by individual states and the federal government. Medicaid is an entitlement program; benefits are guaranteed by federal law to pregnant women, children, disabled people, and the elderly, if they meet certain income limits. States have the option of extending coverage to other residents, such as families with children whose household income was slightly above the federal income limit. About 74 million people are currently receiving Medicaid benefits. Image source: Getty Images. Most people think of Medicaid as a program for poor families, but in reality, the bulk of the program's money helps to cover the health costs of the elderly and the disabled. That's because long-term care is typically very expensive, especially if nursing homes are involved. A study by Lincoln Financial Group found that the average cost for a private room in a nursing home in 2016 was $102,900 per year. At that rate, retirees can exhaust even a well-funded retirement savings account within a few years, at which point Medicaid steps in and takes over the expense. The process of applying for Medicaid varies by state. Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah have the same requirements for both SSI and Medicaid, but they require a separate Medicaid application. Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Virginia have separate eligibility requirements for SSI and Medicaid. Currently, Medicaid is an entitlement program, meaning everyone who qualifies is guaranteed benefits. Further, federal Medicaid funding is based on the actual healthcare expenditures of a state's residents. However, both the House and Senate healthcare reform bills proposed changing Medicaid's funding method so that each state would receive a fixed amount of federal money -- and no more -- to cover its qualifying residents' healthcare expenses. Since the federal share of Medicaid expenses varies by state from about 50% to 75%, with poorer states receiving larger federal inputs, the proposed reduction of federal funding would have had a major impact in every state -- and a potentially devastating impact in the poorest states. As of this writing, healthcare reform has stalled due to a lack of consensus in Congress. However, President Trump is insistent that healthcare reform will continue to be a priority for his administration. Thus it seems likely that Medicaid will continue to be a target as Congress looks for funding to finance other initiatives, including tax reform. ","

,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"Phone-based augmented reality (AR), in which digital objects are superimposed onto the real world on screen, got a huge boost from the popularity of the Pokémon Go game. The game, launched in the United States in July last year, sent players into city streets, offices, parks and restaurants to search for colorful animated characters. Analysts expected the game to make $3 billion for Apple over two years as gamers buy “PokéCoins” from its app store. Google’s take on the technology will first be available on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google’s own Pixel phone. The company said in a blog post that it hoped to make the system, called ARCore, available to at least 100 million users, but did not set a date for a broad release. Apple in June announced a similar system called ARKit that it plans to release this fall on “hundreds of millions” of devices. Google and Apple will jockey for the attention of customers and software developers who will build the games, walking guides and other applications that would make AR a compelling feature. “AR is big and profound,” Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told investors earlier in August. “And this is one of those huge things that we’ll look back at and marvel on the start of it.” Apple and Google have had to make compromises to bring the technology to market. In Apple’s case, the Cupertino, California-based company decided to make its AR system work with devices capable of running iOS 11, its next-generation operating system due out this fall. This means it will work on phones going back to the iPhone 6s, which have a single camera at the back and standard motion sensors, rather than a dual camera system found on newer models such as the iPhone 7 Plus or special depth-sensing chips in competing phones. That limits the range of images that can be displayed. Google initially aimed to solve this problem with an AR system called Tango that uses a special depth-sensor, but only two phone makers so far support it. With ARCore, Google changed course to work on phones without depth sensors. But the fragmentation of the Android ecosystem presents challenges. To spread its AR system beyond the Galaxy S8 and Pixel phone, Google will have to figure out how account for the wide variety of Android phone cameras or require phone makers to use specific parts. Apple, however, is able to make its system work well because it knows exactly which hardware and software are on the iPhone and calibrates them tightly. Michael Valdsgaard, a developer with the furniture chain IKEA, called the system “rock solid,” noting that it could estimate the size of virtual furniture placed in a room with 98 percent accuracy, despite lacking special sensors. “This is a classic example of where Apple’s ownership of the whole widget including both hardware and software is a huge advantage over device vendors dependent on Android and the broader value chain of component vendors,” said Jan Dawson, founder and chief analyst of Jackdaw Research.

,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"The world’s most popular Internet search engine, a unit of Alphabet Inc, had earlier on Tuesday said it would meet the EU deadline to do so. Google was hit with a record 2.4 billion euro ($2.9 billion) fine from the EU over the practice in June and had until midnight on Tuesday to come up with proposals to end the anti-competitive behavior. The European Commission said on June 27 that Google had abused its dominance in Europe to give prominent placements in searches to its own comparison shopping service, demoting those of rivals. As well as ordering Google to come up with a solution, the Commission said the U.S. company must stop the practice by Sept. 28. Failure to do so could expose the company to penalty payments of as much as 5 percent of Alphabet’s average daily worldwide turnover — or around $12 million a day, based on the parent company’s 2016 turnover of $90.3 billion. “Google will continue to be under an obligation to keep the Commission informed of its actions by submitting periodic reports,” a spokesman for the EU executive said after saying the proposal had been received. Lobbying group ICOMP, whose members include Google rivals online mapping services Hot Map and Streetmap, as well as CEPIC (Centre of the Picture Industry) and TradeComet which owns a rival search engine, said regulators should publicize Google’s proposal. “These affect everyone in the online and mobile worlds, so they must be made public for evaluation,” ICOMP head Michael Weber said. Google is also under fire from the EU over practices related to its smartphone mobile operating system Android, where it may face a landmark fine by the end of the year, and regarding online search advertising.

,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"HANOI (Reuters) - “This isn’t like China,” says Vietnamese activist ‘Anh Chi’ at a noisy bar off one of the narrow streets of Hanoi’s Old Quarter. “They can’t shut Facebook down here.” His 40,000 Facebook followers make him one of Vietnam’s better-known critics, but by no means the biggest in a Communist state whose attempts to crack down on dissidents have collided with the rapidly expanding reach of foreign-owned social media. Vietnam’s President Tran Dai Quang this month called for unspecified tougher internet controls in the face of “hostile forces” that he said threatened not only cybersecurity but also “undermined the prestige of the leaders of the party and the state”. But taming the internet in a young, fast-growing country is not easy, especially when the companies providing the platform are global. China, in contrast, allows only local internet companies operating under strict rules. Vietnam is among Facebook’s top 10 countries, by number of members. It now reports more than 52 million active accounts to advertisers, according to research provided to Reuters by social media agencies We Are Social and Hootsuite. Google’s YouTube and Twitter are popular too. As elsewhere in Southeast Asia, social media underpins business and communications as well as government critics. Some dissidents posting on social media have been caught in a major crackdown that has followed changes in the ruling party hierarchy. At least 15 people have been arrested this year. High profile bloggers Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, known as “Mother Mushroom”, and Tran Thi Nga have been jailed for 10 and nine years respectively. Government critics also complain of beatings by unidentified assailants and intimidation. But dozens of activists still post critical comment every day. Several have more than 100,000 followers and at least one has over 400,000 - more than double that for the government’s own Facebook page and nearly a 10th the size of the Communist Party’s national membership. “We use any chance we have to raise our voice: environmental issues, territorial issues, land issues,” said ‘Anh Chi’, 43, a Vietnamese teacher, translator and publisher whose real name is Nguyen Chi Tuyen. One reason it is hard to take tougher action is business: From brewers to insurers to the makers of the motorbikes buzzing Vietnam’s streets, social media is a key marketing route to young and increasingly affluent consumers in an economy growing at more than 6 percent a year, one of the fastest rates in Asia. For small businesses it is crucial: One new silk flower shop in Hanoi told Reuters 95 percent of customers found it through Facebook or Instagram. “You’ve got kids that are building businesses on these platforms and generating significant success,” said Simon Kemp, founder of the Kepios marketing consultancy. While it accounts for only a tiny part of Facebook or Google parent Alphabet’s revenue, Vietnam is a hot target for global consumer brands. Asia-Pacific was Facebook’s fastest growing region by revenue last year, up nearly 60 percent. Tighter Internet controls could dampen innovation and impact the growth of Vietnam’s digital economy and its competitiveness, said Jeff Paine, managing director of the Asia Internet Coalition, whose members include Facebook, Google and Twitter. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. Google declined to comment. Vietnam’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told Reuters the government was an advocate of the internet but tried to minimize “behaviors that harm users and illegal acts such as inciting violence and a depraved lifestyle”. China blocked Facebook in 2009 and only local sites such as WeChat and Weibo are permitted, operating under laws that ban content that is obscene, violent or offends the Communist Party. “China has had remarkable success controlling discussion,” said David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project and a fellow of the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin. Tools include keyword filtering by the local internet companies and the close monitoring of big networks, he said. Even so, China has said it is investigating its top social media sites for failing to comply with its laws. Facebook has been blocked in Vietnam occasionally - sometimes at sensitive moments - but never for long. “Vietnamese authorities have tried for years and so far failed to stop independent journalists and bloggers from using the internet,” said Shawn Crispin, Southeast Asia representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists. “It’s a losing battle.” That does not stop activists being targeted for arrest. Activist Pham Doan Trang noted on Facebook that some campaigners appeared to have withdrawn from the scene in the face of the crackdown, but said she would not be discouraged. “Freedom has a very funny rule,” she told Reuters “Once people know the limit of freedom they will never go back.” ","

,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc will build a $1.375 billion data center in Waukee, Iowa, Apple and state officials said on Thursday, with $207.8 million in incentives approved by the Iowa Economic Development Authority and Waukee city council. Apple will purchase 2,000 acres (8.09 square km) of land in Waukee, about 20 miles (32 km) west of Des Moines, to build two data centers. The company will receive a $19.65 million investment tax credit for creating 50 jobs. Apple said the project will generate more than 550 jobs in construction and operations, but did not specify how many of those jobs would be long-term positions. Speaking alongside Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said the facility “will create hundreds of jobs for people in Iowa from construction to engineering.” Cook said Apple will contribute up to $100 million toward a “public improvement fund” for the city of Waukee, adding the first project supported by the fund will be a youth sports complex that “will be open to all.” The bulk of the subsidy is a planned $188.2 million property tax abatement of 71 percent over 20 years provided by the city of Waukee, according to economic development officials. State subsidies to technology employers have become a key issue in Midwestern states such as Wisconsin, where Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, is seeking $3 billion in subsidies for a $10 billion LCD panel plant. The incentive package passed Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled state Assembly last week by a 59-30 margin. [nL2N1L3137] [nL2N1L9121] Foxconn is a major Apple supplier, but is not expected to make any Apple products at its proposed U.S. plant. The Iowa data center will join Apple facilities in California, Nevada, Oregon and North Carolina, which also host services such as iCloud, Apple Music and the App Store. “This new data center will play a very important role in the App Store’s continued success,” Cook said. “As the App Store grows, we look forward to growing in Iowa.” Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Microsoft Corp also maintain data centers in Iowa. Apple will spend $110 million to acquire and prepare the land for its data centers in Iowa, according to economic development officials. The bulk of the costs, $620 million, will go toward construction. Apple will spend $600 million on computer equipment, with $45 million going toward other equipment. ","

So we think our revenues will rise as a consequence of this,” Vitai said, without giving an estimate revenue figure.

,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"LONDON (Reuters) - How much do you know about ferro-silicon? Unless you’re a specialist in the field of ferro-alloys, the answer to that question is probably “not very much”. Although it’s an essential input into many different types of steel product, ferro-silicon is one of those industrial materials that barely registers with the general public. Search for it on Google and you’ll get less than 400,000 “results”. Do the same for aluminum and you’ll get over 400 million. Try the search in Chinese, though, and you may get a different outcome because this esoteric part of the global manufacturing chain has experienced a mini mania over the last few weeks. Not that the thousands of Chinese punters who have bought into the Zhengzhou ferro-silicon market are experts in the world of ferro-alloys either. Rather, it is just the latest Chinese commodities market to experience the turbulent effects of an investment crowd surge. Such stampedes are becoming more frequent and are hitting ever more parts of the commodity trading spectrum with increasingly chaotic effects on pricing. Graphic on Zhengzhou ferro-silicon contract: tmsnrt.rs/2iIxJ3z FERRO-SILICON FRENZY The Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE) launched its ferro-silicon contract in August 2014. After an initial flurry of activity, both volumes and open interest flatlined over the course of 2015 and most of 2016. Volumes totaled 1.32 million lots last year with open interest just 2,700 lots at the end of December. Fast forward eight months and ferro-silicon trading has gone super nova. Volumes over the last five trading days have totaled an astonishing 2.82 million contracts, while open interest has exploded to 138,396 contracts from just 30,100 at the start of August. On one day alone - Tuesday, Aug. 23 - Zhengzhou traded the equivalent of 3.3 million tonnes of ferro-silicon, which is getting close to around half the size of the annual global market. Not entirely surprisingly, this trading surge caused prices to spike from 5,600 yuan per tonne at the start of the month to just over 7,800 yuan on Aug. 24. Profits presumably booked, the crowd is now leaving just as quickly as it appeared before the exchange implements higher trading fees on Friday. What has an obscure market like ferro-silicon done to warrant such attention? Analysts at Jefferies Equity Research, one of the very few mainstream houses to cover the market, argue that both silicon metal and its alloy derivatives are benefiting from a combination of rising input prices, improving demand and constrained supply. But that doesn’t explain the ferocity of this month’s price rise nor what is shaping up to be an equally violent counter-reaction. Rather, ferro-silicon appears to have been flavor of the month simply because it is used in steel and trading in China’s steel and iron ore contracts was getting too hot for many punters. You can track the movements of China’s commodities crowd by the measures taken against it by the authorities. The first clamp down against speculative excess came on Aug. 11, when the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) announced fee hikes and position limits on its steel rebar contract. One week later, on Aug. 18 the Dalian Commodities Exchange did the same with other components of the ferrous trading suite such as coke, coking coal and iron ore. Money then migrated to steel-related contracts such as zinc, used in galvanized steel, and ferro-silicon, leading to more counter-measures by both ShFE (Aug. 21) and Zhengzhou (Aug. 17 and again on Aug. 30). Note that the weapons of choice for exchanges in damping excess are margin hikes and intraday trading fees, attesting to both the high leverage and high speed of China’s crowd traders. This week it was ferro-silicon. Next week it could be something else. Maybe silico-manganese, the sister contract on the Zhengzhou exchange. It has seen some spill-over activity but nothing quite as dramatic as the ferro-silicon contract. But it could, equally, be aluminum or copper or lead. No-one, least of all the crowd itself, seems to know. There are only a few broad rules of this Chinese trading game. First, it helps to have a strong story line to catch everyone’s attention. The bull narrative in China’s steel sector is one of booming production and profits thanks to the government’s ongoing elimination of outdated capacity. Second, it helps if the crowd has some previous experience of trading the contract. This, for example, is the third time the Zhengzhou ferro-silicon contract has seen volume and open interest surges. The latest is, by some margin, the greatest. Third, the trading trigger seems to be market momentum, the crowd surging into a market that is already moving, a mass-human replica of how many algorithmic trading programs work in western markets. The fourth, perhaps most important, ingredient in this recipe for market mania is the ability of the crowd to communicate via mobile and internet chat rooms. This is a “flash” investment mob that can switch investment targets as quickly as it takes to tweet. This is all a very new phenomenon for industrial metal markets, which have by and large traded for many, many years with little or no interest from the man in the street. But it is the fourth time since the start of 2016 that Chinese exchanges have been forced to tweak the cost of trading to deter animal spirits. And these bouts of extreme activity are increasingly having real-world consequences. Most commentators in the iron ore market will concede that physical prices are now following futures market prices, however irrational the latter may at times be. In markets such as copper and aluminum, futures pricing in China has increasing influence on London Metal Exchange (LME) pricing, against which much of the world’s physical trading activity is settled. And only a very small part of what LME brokers call the “onshore casino” makes it through China’s great currency wall. There is a sense that the pricing impact could be much greater if China starts to connect to international markets. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) has already opened up such connector channels for stocks and bonds. So far at least the owner of the LME hasn’t been able to do the same for metals. That, many metal market participants might think, is just as well. Because although “industry” has always bemoaned the excesses of “speculation”, no-one has ever seen speculation on this scale before. (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) ","

,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"CYPRESS, Texas (Reuters) - The mayday call went out near midnight to all members of the Cy-Fair Volunteer Fire Department organizing rescue operations in the outskirts of Houston. There was a new emergency: Four of their own in peril. On a suburban street transformed into a rushing waterway by Tropical Storm Harvey, a firefighter heading out to save people stranded by the storm fell into floodwaters as he was boarding a boat. The firefighters turned all their attention to rescuing their fellow rescuer. Matt Perkins, a 21-year veteran of the fire department of Cy-Fair, short for Cypress-Fairbanks, listened intently to the progress from the mini-command post set up in his truck at a gas station. “Those are my guys out there. I want to make sure they are OK,” he said as he listened to his radio. “Command Boat 21, do you need a helicopter at your location?” a radio dispatcher said. A garbled response. “We can’t understand your response,” the dispatcher responded. “Your mic is wet.” Hearing no response, the call became more urgent: “Repeat. Do you need a helicopter at your location?” Finally the radio crackled back to life: “We are extracted. The boat is tied to a tree. We are walking out with the military.” The three on board were able to pull the fourth out of the water, but the fast current pinned the boat to a tree and left them stranded. It was just the first hair-raising moment in a long night of rescues by firefighters, police and the National Guard as rains from the devastating storm continued to hammer Houston and the surrounding area. More than 3,000 people had been rescued from their homes by late Monday and more rain was forecast for Tuesday. National Guard teams with Humvees and high-water vehicles coordinated with local emergency officials to respond to calls from people trapped in their homes. Residents of this city 30 miles (48 km) north of Houston are used to floods, having just weathered a major one last year. But many said they were caught by surprise by the extent of rising water levels, as the area was expected to get as much rain in a week as it normally sees in a year. In the dark hours of the night, the National Guard navigated their vehicles through neighborhoods transformed into inland lakes with water cresting to the tops of mail boxes and fire hydrants and garden shrubbery looking more like watery mangrove forests. With local firefighter Cassie Fritch guiding the troops with Google Maps on her cell phone, they searched for people who had called for help. When the water rose above the Humvee doors on the outside, it also seeped up through the floor on the inside and dripped in from the hatch. “Oh, that’s cold,” said Specialist Jaylan Dawson as the water rose over his pedals. At one home Fritch found a man who had changed his mind about evacuating and decided to stick it out. She warned him that rescuers would not be back if he called again. “He says he’s not coming because the water receded,” Fritch said. “That’s his choice, but the storm’s not over yet.” ","

As of Wednesday, Google also began offering free delivery on Google Express orders so long as the order is above each retailer's minimum threshold. Amazon said Thursday that its acquisition of Whole Foods will close Monday, promising ""more to come,"" as the internet giant begins to integrate its Prime membership offerings into the Whole Foods network. Prime members will eventually receive ""special savings and in-store benefits."" Shares of Amazon pared earlier losses Thursday afternoon and sat down 0.33 percent at 3:09 p.m. ET. Shares of Wal-Mart fell after the announcement of the Amazon-Whole Foods deal closure, now down 1.92 percent. While attention has largely been focused on Wal-Mart's new opportunities from the deal, Cowen research also noted that Google could see a meaningful uptick in its Express service. ""Of the United States households purchasing groceries online each month (about 12 percent of U.S. households on average), only about 4 percent bought groceries via Google Express in July '17,"" added Blackledge. That stands in stark comparison to the 46 percent of online grocery shoppers who said they bought goods on Amazon Prime, according to the Cowen report. Still, the analyst said he isn't persuaded that the Google-Wal-Mart agreement means much for Amazon. ""Amazon's end to end voice-enabled shopping solution is a significant advantage versus the Wal-Mart/Google pairing in our view. Overall, we do not see the partnership impacting Amazon's US retail biz and/or Prime Sub penetration."" ",Google-Wal-Mart deal won't stop Amazon's 'retail ascent:' Cowen
Arjun Kharpal,08312017,CNBC,08242017,"IFA is one of the largest consumer electronics shows in the world. The largest device makers in the world from Samsung to Lenovo tend to stage flashy launches at the event which takes place in Berlin, Germany. But quietly in the background, two players with barely any branding anywhere are making the most noise: Google and Amazon. Construction of booths was still ongoing on Thursday ahead of the opening day on Friday. Companies like Sony, Panasonic and Samsung were putting the final touches on their giant stands. But tucked in the tiny corner of the venue, in one of the smallest halls, was a stand for Amazon Alexa, the e-commerce giant's voice assistant. So far, no Google branding could be spotted. The low-key presence of these two from a brand perspective is deceiving because they were in fact all over the place. In many of the product launches, from many different companies, either Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant was mentioned as a partner. Chinese firm Qihan for example integrated Alexa into its humanoid robot called the Sanbot Nano. Sony released a 230 euro ($272) smart speaker, similar to the Amazon Echo, but with Google Assistant as the main voice feature. Meanwhile, LG announced that all of its smart home devices released in 2017 will be compatible with Google Assistant. That means users can ask the voice assistant things like how long is left on the cycle of their LG washing machine. It's an absolute land grab by Amazon and Google, two tech behemoths who are leading the way in artificial intelligence (AI). And there's a few reasons why. Firstly, the more devices that each voice assistant is on, the smarter it will become because it has large amounts of data available. But the most important strategic reason is that the so-called internet of things (IOT) is becoming reality. That is, an increasing number of devices are becoming connected and Amazon and Google both want to be major players, without actually making much hardware. Think what has happened in smartphones. There are two dominant operating systems: Google's Android and Apple's iOS. Owning these has allowed Apple and Google to become major mobile players and reap the revenues from their respective app stores and other services. As of yet, there is no unified ""smart things"" operating system. It's disjointed, expensive, and not seamless, like we have come to expect on mobile. But there's rising interest in voice assistants which could prove to become the operating system of the IOT. You can control devices without screens and those assistants can almost become your handy helper. Amazon missed the mobile wave in terms of hardware and software, but this could be its chance to become a major IOT platform. And the reward could be a significant new revenue stream. In a report earlier this year, RBC predicted that Alexa could bring Amazon $10 billion of revenues by 2020 and be a ""mega-hit."" Think about a world with Alexa all around you. Imagine now what Amazon could sell you. The vision is similar for Google. Ads and e-commerce could give the search giant some new revenues. There's potentially a lot at stake and it's risky if voice doesn't take off. But neither Amazon nor Google wants to miss out and that's why this epic landgrab to get on as many devices as possible is set to continue.

David Reid,08312017,CNBC,08242017,"Google has teamed up with a mental illness group to provide Americans with a test to check if you are depressed or mentally ill. People in the U.S. who type ""clinical depression"" in Google search via a mobile device will now be invited to check if they are clinically depressed via a screening questionnaire. The partnership, announced Wednesday, has been developed by Google and the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). In a blog post on Google, the CEO of NAMI Mary Giliberti, said she wanted to use Google to increase the proportion of U.S. citizens who actually seek help for depression. ""Clinical depression is a very common condition, in fact, approximately one in five Americans experience an episode in their lifetime. ""However, despite its prevalence, only about 50 percent of people who suffer from depression actually receive treatment,"" Gilberti said. Google said those who click through from the search suggestion will see a ""Knowledge Panel"" which will give you an option to ""check if you are clinically depressed"". The test, called a PHQ-9, is described by the search engine as a clinically validated screening questionnaire and is designed to test what level of depression a person may be suffering. Giliberti said the results can help people then have a more informed conversation with their doctor. ""Clinical depression is a treatable condition which can impact many aspects of a person's life. The PHQ-9 can be the first step to getting a proper diagnosis,"" Giliberti added. The NAMI CEO said people who have symptoms of depression experience an average of a 6 to 8-year delay in getting treatment following the onset of symptoms.

Amazon partnered with LG to bring its Alexa assistant to a new LG refrigerator earlier this year, for example. Alexa can already control other appliances, including robotic vacuums.

Todd Haselton,08312017,CNBC,08242017,"It's a complete redesign from the Nest thermostats you might be used to seeing. Nest said it did this to create a thermostat that blends in with its surroundings, instead of sticking out more as an ""art piece"" like the current Nest. Note the frosted, lower resolution display. Operation is still the same: twist the puck to change the temperature. The new ""Nest Thermostat E"" will retail for $169. A standard Nest thermostat will set you back about $250. You'll still get energy savings, thanks to the Nest's ability to learn when you cool or heat your house, and when nobody is home. It can also be controlled by voice if you have a Google Home or Amazon Alexa. It's not as pretty as the regular Nest. The text is kind of blurry because of the frosted display. You don't get the metal accents or crisp and colorful screen. Instead, everything is a bit more muted, though it's still easy to see the temperature from across the room. Also, you don't get fun additions like the weather on the home screen, or support for advanced HVAC systems that offer humidity controls. The Nest Thermostat E is made for everyone, including folks who might not yet have jumped aboard the smart thermostat train for one reason or another, like myself. At $169, it's much more appealing to me, even as someone who has radiator heat and no central AC (and therefore very little need for a smart thermostat). But, since I live in an old house, I'll appreciate the alerts it can send me if my heating system breaks down while I'm away. That's worth more than the price of entry. I dig it, though I only played with it briefly during a meeting. I'm hoping to have a review unit soon, but setup should be just as easy as a standard Nest (it's a cinch, in my experience installing one for a family member). Plus, if you live in certain cities with rebates for smart thermostats (Chicago is one that rewards consumers particularly well), you can get the new Nest Thermostat E almost for free. That's pretty darn tempting. The Nest Thermostat E goes on sale today direct from Nest and its retail partners. ",Google Nest Thermostat E first-look

Some of the refunds were as large as ""hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. The refunds are being made for ads bought with the company's automated technology, known as DoubleClick Bid Manager. The company says it's working on ways to give marketers more transparency into the automated ad technology, used by advertisers to place ads across the internet on websites of Google's ad partners. Google said last month that tests it had run ""confirmed how widespread of an issue this is for publishers."" The refunds also suggest there is a downside to a recent push by Google to make it easier for advertisers on its partner sites to reach a bigger audience.

Michelle Castillo,08312017,CNBC,08242017,"That cute cat wallpaper for your Android phone or free photo-editing software app you downloaded may be using your phone without your permission and running up fraudulent ad views, according to a recent report from online marketing firm eZanga. EZanga used its Anura ad fraud protection software to look at one module from a software development kit (otherwise known as an SDK) that hides in apps, then activates to run advertisements and play videos while the user is not on their phone. While the person may be sleeping, the malware chews up bandwidth and battery life. The report estimated the top apps using this SDK module, one of which could have been downloaded up to 1 million times in the Google Play store, could cost advertisers anywhere between $2,000,000 to $10,000,000 daily in fraudulent ad traffic. On June 7, they found 312 apps with the SDK module — 53 of which were in the Google Play store. A week after, the SDK module was in 750 apps, 300 of which were in the store. Two days after that, the number ballooned to 1,330 apps, and 317 were available for purchase in the store. The majority of the apps were live wallpapers, or free backgrounds for Android phones that featured cute cats, nature scenes or other cool effects. Others were free versions of popular apps like File Explorer or other photo-editing software. While Apple formally approves every app that goes into its store, Android developers can upload directly to the Google Play store and have people download their apps almost immediately, eZanga CEO Rich Kahn explained. A Google spokesperson said all apps submitted to Google Play are automatically scanned for potentially malicious code and spammy developer accounts before they are published. Google said it also recently introduced a proactive app review process, as well as Google Play Protect, which scans Android devices to let users know if they are downloading a malicious app. There is also Verify Apps, which warns about or blocks potentially harmful apps. Google Play did remove all the apps eZanga named in the study within a few weeks, Kahn said. However, when they looked after the study in early August for the same SDK module, they found 6,000 more apps online (not necessarily in the Google Play store) that contained a morphed version of the malware. Developers are constantly tweaking their malware, which can make it hard to detect right away, Kahn explained. On top of that, there's so much malware out there its hard to police, he said. To protect yourself and your phone, Kahn suggests keeping your Android phone always updated. Google often sends out a ""signal"" to knock out identified malicious SDK modules, and it can protect you if your phone already has the malware. Also, remember free apps don't necessarily mean you're not paying in some way, he said. ""If you like an app, pay for it,"" Kahn said. ""Don't go and try a free version.""

Christina Farr,08312017,CNBC,08242017,"Target is struggling mightily to compete with Amazon in retail, but it's finding other ways to fight back. The discount retailer is scaling back its use of Amazon Web Services, according to sources familiar with the matter, as the company aims to take greater control over its infrastructure and stop financing its chief rival. Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods is the latest sign of how deep the e-commerce giant is moving into all forms of retail. Microsoft Azure is among the rival cloud vendors vying to nab Target's cloud business, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the plans are confidential. Google and Oracle are also beefing up their cloud offerings. Like all big box stores, Target is being trounced by Amazon, which is selling more items for cheaper and delivering them faster. Target's annual revenue is lower than it was five years ago --though the company has sold off its credit card business and pharmacy division during that stretch -- and the stock has lost 23 percent of its market value in the past 12 months. On Monday, Amazon finalized its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods and instantly cut prices in stores by more than 30 percent on organic fruit and meat. From electronics and household goods to toiletries and groceries, Amazon is expanding its inventory. While there's little Target can do to impede Amazon's dominance in retail, the emergence of other cloud providers at least allows the company to spend its computing and storage dollars elsewhere. According to one source, Target is planning to aggressively move e-commerce activities, mobile development and operations away from AWS through the end of the year and probably into 2018. A Target spokesperson said the company doesn't discuss details of its vendor relationships, but added that ""we currently use multiple cloud service providers and will continue to do so."" An Amazon representative declined to comment. Target hinted at its plans in October, when the company said it adopted an open-source system called Spinnaker that Netflix built to enable developer teams to customize their clouds. One key component is that ""Spinnaker was built to work with multiple public clouds versus just one,"" Target said in a post on its website. Target isn't the only large retailer taking aim at AWS. The Wall Street Journal reported in June that Wal-Mart was telling its tech vendors not to run applications on Amazon's cloud and that for its own infrastructure the company uses a combination of on-premise servers and services provided by Microsoft and others. ""If I'm running Azure or Google, I'd go right after those guys,"" said John Vrionis, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners who backs infrastructure start-ups. ""I'm sure they could package a compelling migration plan and those are segments are probably most thirsty for that."" Still, AWS has yet to see any mass exodus. In the second quarter, AWS controlled 34 percent of the cloud infrastructure market, topping Microsoft, IBM and Google combined, according to Synergy Research Group. Brands and stores including Brooks Brothers, Nordstrom, Nike, Under Armour and Lululemon are all AWS customers, though sources say that many retailers are considering other cloud providers. Target isn't talking publicly about where it will host its data and apps, but the company isn't hiding its efforts to invest in software development. Since Mike McNamara, chief information and digital officer, joined in 2015, Target has hired more than 1,000 engineers and has prioritized bringing technical talent in-house, rather than outsourcing it. Of the 95 openings for technology positions on Target's website, about 80 percent were listed since the beginning of July. In the past week, jobs have opened up for senior database engineers and experts in open-source tools like Node.js and Cassandra. All of the seven positions that require experience in cloud infrastructure call for expertise in some combination of AWS, Azure, Google or other offerings. Digital commerce is one area where Target is seeing improved results. In 2013, the company introduced Cartwheel, a mobile discounts app that has become a popular way to shop and was just integrated with the core Target app. According to research advisory Gordon Haskett, the number of Cartwheel users increased 50 percent in 2016, and the firm predicted that the combination with the Target app will drive even more business. ""Once complete, the consumer will be able to make their lists, find items in stores, take advantage of great offers, and pay for their orders, all from within a single app,"" the firm wrote in a report on May 8.

Adam Levy,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When it comes to online search, there's Google and then there's everyone else. When it comes to online retail, there's Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and then there's everyone else. But when you put the two dominant companies head to head, it may be a tough call on which one makes a better buy for investors. Both Amazon and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stocks have meaningfully outperformed the S&P 500 year to date. But investors can't dwell on the past; they have to look to the future to determine where to invest. Let's look at how these two companies' prospects stack up, to determine which is a better buy. Image source: Google. The vast majority of Alphabet's revenue and practically all of its profits come from Google. And nearly all of Google's revenue comes from advertising. Google's ad revenue continues to climb at a steady pace, up 18% year over year, benefiting from the megatrend of the shift from television advertising to digital advertising. But Google isn't the only force in advertising. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is still growing rapidly, with ad revenue up 47% year over year last quarter. Combined, Facebook and Google account for nearly all the revenue growth in digital advertising. Facebook is investing heavily in video, and its new Watch tab could eventually have a negative impact on YouTube. Meanwhile, Amazon is taking away product search queries from its search engine, which are some of the most valuable searches for advertising. That said, Google is still very much a dominant force in advertising. It has seven products with over 1 billion users -- Search, Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Play, Chrome, and Android. Not even Facebook can make the same claim (yet). That kind of broad engagement gives Google an unparalleled data set to produce strong returns on investment for its ad buyers. That's a huge competitive advantage that's almost impossible for smaller competitors to overcome. It explains why Google and Facebook are capturing all of the growth in digital advertising. Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon's moat in online retail is even bigger than Google's moat in digital advertising. Amazon's Prime program makes customers extremely loyal, attracts tons of third-party merchants to its marketplace, and helps fund Amazon's investments in fulfillment capacity and technology. As a result, Amazon is the first place the majority of consumers go to when searching for a product online. While Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has taken steps to compete online and is starting to attract third-party merchants to its online marketplace as well, it was never able to make customers loyal through a membership program. Amazon Prime now has around 80 million members in the United States and a growing number of international subscribers as it expands to more countries. It rolled out Prime Video globally at the end of last year, establishing the Prime brand in more countries and setting itself up for full Prime benefits in more markets in the future. The acquisition of Whole Foods provides another way to convince customers to join Prime. It could also help upsell customers to its grocery delivery service AmazonFresh. And it also provides another avenue to sell its hardware like Echo and Kindle. No other retailer can compete with Prime and the loyalty it instills in Amazon's customers. That gives it a huge competitive advantage. To be sure, both Alphabet and Amazon present excellent investment opportunities and capitalize on several megatrends. But Amazon's competitive advantages appear stronger than Google's, which faces serious competition for ad dollars from Facebook and could see increased competition for attention (and ad display opportunities) in the future. Amazon has lots of competition as well, but it's created a virtuous cycle with Prime. It's hard to judge Amazon's valuation using metrics such as earnings or EBITDA because of the constant investments management makes to grow the business in various avenues. Nonetheless, I believe the growth of Amazon Web Services (its cloud computing division), Prime, AmazonFresh, and other subscription revenue, scale of its international operations, and further scale in its fulfillment center capacity ought to push operating margin higher. While Amazon might not produce a profit margin near the same level as Alphabet, it could produce operating margin on par with Wal-Mart (about 6%). For reference, last year Amazon's operating margin was 3.1%. But it was 5% in North America. As operating margin expands and revenue continues to grow, that money will eventually find its way to the bottom line and produce huge earnings-per-share growth for Amazon and its investors.

The past month hasn't been kind to either Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or IBM (NYSE:IBM) following their respective earnings reports. Alphabet once again showed remarkable growth, particularly considering its size, but concerns regarding a large fine imposed by European Union regulators, related to Google's search-result ranking practices, and the possibility of continued haggling with the folks across the pond have left some investors concerned. Another quarter of total revenue declines and slowing growth of IBM's all-important strategic-imperatives segments has put more pressure on its stock. But at current levels Big Blue is one of the best values in its sector and pays a handsome dividend. So which is the better buy: Alphabet -- more commonly known as Google -- or IBM? Both offer compelling arguments, but one has a distinct edge. Image source: Getty images. The 5% drop in total sales to $19.3 billion got most of the press, but the most concerning development was the slowing of IBM's critical strategic-imperatives units, which include the cloud, cognitive computing via its Watson supercomputer, data security, and mobile. That said, last quarter was a success in a number of areas. At an annual run rate of $15.1 billion, IBM is one of the leading cloud providers on the planet. In a market most analysts expect to grow nearly exponentially in the coming years, IBM is already leading the charge. Better still, on a trailing-12-month basis, software as a service (SaaS) delivered via the cloud climbed 30% year over year to $8.8 billion. Mobile revenue rose an impressive 27%, though the 4% increase in analytic sales and data security was a bit disheartening given IBM's past results. Last quarter IBM also took a step in the right direction in the area of improving efficiency, another on of its initiatives. Operating expenses dropped $302 million and are now down 11% year to date. Despite the negative market sentiment, or perhaps because of it, at a forward valuation of just 10 times earnings, IBM and its 4.2% dividend yield offer value investors in search of income an intriguing option. The downside of the EU's whopping $2.74 billion fine for the manner in which Alphabet ranks its search results caused some consternation. The result of the fine was a 40% drop in operating income excluding the EU's levy, to $4.13 billion, and an earnings-per-share (EPS) hit of 44%; EPS would have been $8.90 a share, but came in at $5.01 instead. Bad news, right? But aside from the one-time fine, Alphabet once again absolutely crushed the second quarter. Total revenue climbed 21% to $26 billion, which is jaw-dropping considering it generated $21.5 billion in sales a year ago. In other words, Alphabet continues growing like a hyper-growth upstart though it's one of the largest companies in the world. Operating income jumped 10% to $7.8 billion, and paid clicks climbed an astonishing 52% year over year, more than making up for the 23% drop in aggregate cost per click. As usual, Alphabet's staggering balance sheet grew again last quarter to $94.7 billion in cash and equivalents -- and those are just the ready funds here in the States. The EU ""situation"" aside, Alphabet continues to essentially print money at a remarkable rate. I'd still like to see Alphabet give some of its cash hoard back to shareholders in the form of a dividend, but that's just splitting hairs. As a fan of value investing, particularly when significant income is part of equation, I think IBM is a compelling choice. However, EU fine or no EU fine, Alphabet's continued growth is mind-boggling and it appears there is no end in sight. For that reason, Alphabet -- and its seemingly unlimited upside -- is the better buy. ","

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google famously failed with its initial vision for augmented reality (AR), Google Glass. You could argue that Glass was ahead of its time, but that failure left an opening for other companies to step up to the plate. We're now in the midst of a growing trend of using smartphones as a bridge to the future of AR, including social media companies like Snap and Facebook popularizing AR-based features like live photo/video filters. And then, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suddenly and unexpectedly unveiled ARKit at WWDC earlier this year, a powerful set of developer tools included in iOS 11 that has the potential to create the largest AR platform overnight once iOS 11 is released later this year. In one fell swoop, Apple commandeered the AR conversation. Augmented Reality Wars 2017. Part 1. pic.twitter.com/mX5ovJzq82  Well, Google has an answer to ARKit, and it's called ARCore. The search giant officially unveiled ARCore today, which is built on many of the same spatial awareness technologies that Google began developing for Project Tango. Tango was a prototype smartphone that used specialized sensors to allow the device to sense its environment and create 3D maps. We've taken what we've learned from Tango and are bringing AR to millions of Android phones, starting with Pixel and S8. Here's #ARCore. pic.twitter.com/1b5fteAzOH  ARCore will first focus on three areas to deliver AR experiences: motion tracking, environmental understanding, and light estimation. But these will be just a foundation, and more capabilities will inevitably follow as AR adoption grows among developers and consumers alike. Google also says it will create custom browsers that developers can use to make ""AR-enhanced websites"" that are compatible with both Android/ARCore and iOS/ARKit. Image source: Google. The preview of ARCore will work on millions of devices running Android 7.0 Nougat, and the search giant hopes to have 100 million devices using ARCore by the end of the preview. ARCore now works with Google's Pixel phones, as well as Samsung's Galaxy S8. Google bills ARCore as ""Augmented reality at Android scale,"" and that last bit underscores one of the biggest challenges that Glass faced: lack of scale. Glass hardware was never compelling enough to gain meaningful adoption (especially at a $1,500 price point), which limited developer interest. Android has far greater global scale than iOS, with over 2 billion active devices currently. Apple does not disclose iOS installed base metrics, but BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long estimates that it's around 715 million. ARCore is very much a response to ARKit, but the two dominant mobile platforms combined have transformative potential to bring AR technologies to masses. We're talking about a wide range of potential AR use cases, not just live photo/video filters. This is still very much the early innings in terms of third-party developer innovation, but even in the few months since ARKit was released, promising use cases are already emerging. ARCore will only accelerate that pace of innovation, which is great news for consumers. ","

Indeed, a recent report from ComScore found that 81% of users had the Facebook app installed on their smartphone and 71% installed YouTube. The two tech giants dominated the top-10 most popular apps. But when ComScore asked which apps smartphone owners ""can't go without,"" an interesting company shot to the top of the list, particularly in the 18- to 34-year-old demographic. More millennials named Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as one of the three apps they couldn't live without than any other app. The app also shot to No. 4 on the charts of apps on users' home screens (behind Facebook, Gmail, and Google Maps), further indicating strong engagement with the app for those that have installed it. Image source: Getty Images People can get lost for hours in YouTube and Facebook apps. ComScore found 20% of time on mobile is spent using social networking apps. Another 10% is spent consuming multimedia like streaming video. That's great for companies like Facebook and Google, which rely on ad sales for the bulk of their revenue. The more time users spend in their apps, the more ads they can show. While Amazon's app is indispensable for 35% of millennials, the average user spends just 3% of their time using retail apps. With an average user spending 2.3 hours per day using apps on their phone, that translates into less than 5 minutes per day across all retail apps, not just Amazon, for the average user. For reference, Facebook claims its users spend 50 minutes per day across Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. Young Instagram users -- the same ones that say Amazon is a must -- spend over 30 minutes per day in the app. YouTube users spend an average of 1 hour per day on mobile alone. But that's kind of the point of Amazon's app. While YouTube and Facebook want to suck you in and keep you watching videos or scrolling through your news feed, Amazon wants to help you quickly find the item you're looking for and take your money for it. The thing that makes Amazon indispensable is that it has no replacement. An app like Google Maps is extremely useful on a smartphone, but there's also Apple Maps, Waze (another Google product), MapQuest, and several other navigation apps. As a shopping experience, the Amazon app doesn't offer much over its own desktop site or other shopping apps. But people love shopping on Amazon. It's often used as a pricing benchmark for people that are shopping in brick-and-mortar stores. It already has shoppers payment information loaded in the app, and it makes checking out quick and painless. 55% of online product search queries begin on Amazon, and that number is getting bigger every year. That's to the detriment of Google, which can make a lot of money on product-related searches through advertising. Amazon's product search engine makes it as essential (if not moreso) as Google Search on a smartphone. The majority of e-commerce sales still come from desktop. During last year's Thanksgiving weekend shopping holiday 61% of sales came from desktops despite a majority of e-commerce visitors coming from mobile. But as more people shop from their mobile devices, Amazon is poised to dominate sales growth thanks to the popularity of its app. ","

The average person who signed up for Social Security in the past year was awarded $1,413.08 per month in benefits; however, benefits vary depending on a person's work history, so careful planning can allow you to receive a lot more than that amount. In the 12-month period ending June 2017, over 2.9 million Americans signed up for Social Security benefits. On average, these retired workers were awarded $1,413.08 in monthly benefits, however, the average benefits payable were quite different for men and women. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. In the period, 1.4 million women filed for Social Security benefits, and their average award was $1,231.50. Men, however, were awarded $1,583.77, on average. Wage inequality arguably plays a role in women's lower average payment, but so, too, does Social Security's formula, which penalizes individuals who take time off from their career to raise children. Social Security calculates benefits using the 35-highest income earning years, but if someone doesn't have 35 years of work history, it uses zeros in its calculation for any years without income. Undeniably, the single best way to boost your Social Security benefits is to ask for a raise at work. If you have fewer than 35 years of work history, more high-income-earning years will help offset any zeros in your history. Also, if you have more than 35 years of work history, you should know that high-income-earning years replace low-income years in the calculation, which also increases the amount you receive in benefits. If a raise isn't in the cards, then another way to boost your benefits is to plan on retiring later, so that you have fewer zeros in your calculation. Retiring later also provides the benefit of delayed retirement credits, which are awarded to individuals who hold off on claiming Social Security benefits until after they've reached full retirement age, or the age at which a person can receive 100% of their benefit amount. As a refresher, Social Security can be claimed as early as age 62. However, claiming before full retirement age results in a reduced payment. If you were born in 1960 or later, then your full retirement age is 67. Wait to claim your benefit, and you'll have more high-income-earning years used in your benefit calculation, and you'll receive an 8% increase in your benefit for every year you delay, up until age 70, because of delayed retirement credits. If you're divorced, you may also qualify for benefits based on your former spouse's work record. Depending on the circumstances, you could earn up to 50% of the amount that your spouse qualifies for at full retirement, and it won't affect your former spouse's payment, or the amount your spouse gets in lifetime Social Security benefits. Furthermore, if you have a spouse who didn't work, or who has a work history that results in a monthly benefit that's below average, it might pay off for your spouse to collect benefits based on your work record, rather than his or her own. Spouses can receive up to 50% of your full benefit at full retirement age, and Social Security will automatically pay the higher of the two benefits, so no need to do the number crunching yourself. If you do claim early, don't fall into the Social Security trap of earning too much money while collecting Social Security benefits. If you're receiving benefits and you haven't reached full retirement age, your monthly Social Security check will be reduced by $1 for every $2 you earn above $16,920. You won't lose this money, however. It will be added back into your benefit calculation, and it will increase your payment once you reach full retirement age. After reaching full retirement age, you can earn as much as you like without having it reduce your Social Security check. It also pays to avoid the Social Security tax trap. Up to 85% of your Social Security income can be subject to income tax if your income exceeds certain levels. In 2017, if you file a joint return and you and your spouse have combined income between $32,000 and $44,000, you may have to pay income tax on up to 50% of your benefits. If you earn over $44,000, then you'll be taxed on up to 85% of your Social Security. ","

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is the biggest retailer on the planet. A ruthless competitive strategy focused on offering the lowest possible prices has yielded a business that generates nearly $500 billion of annual revenue. Its long-term stock returns have been phenomenal, too, as its founding share owners are some of the richest people in the world. Let's take a look at the main sources of revenue and profits for one of capitalism's greatest success stories. Image source: Getty Images. Wal-Mart's business is split into three segments: U.S. retailing, international retailing, and the warehouse division that operates under the Sam's Club brand. The U.S. unit is by far the largest. It's comprised of 4,600 Wal-Mart stores that spread out 700 million square feet of selling space across the country. The segment generated $308 billion of revenue in the most recent fiscal year to account for 64% of the entire business. For context, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is the nation's second-largest retailer, with approximately $84 billion of annual sales. Next up is the international segment that's worth one-quarter of Wal-Mart's annual sales haul, or $116 billion. This segment has been shrinking as a percentage of total sales for several years, but that's only because of unfavorable foreign currency moves. When adjusted for that shift, the division would have ticked higher by 3% to $127 billion last year as opposed to the 6% decline that the company actually reported. Finally, Wal-Mart's membership club business accounts for $60 billion of annual sales, or about 12% of the revenue base. The segment is dwarfed by industry leader Costco, whose 512 U.S. locations generate over $80 billion of annual revenue. Wal-Mart is making less money today than in years past. In fact, operating income has decreased for two consecutive years and earnings last year were $13.6 billion, down from $16.2 billion in 2015. Return on investment, a key measure of operating efficiency, also slipped to 15.2% in fiscal 2017 from 15.5% the prior year. WMT Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts. Increased spending is the main driver behind that slump. Wal-Mart is directing more cash toward its employees through training, education, and increased wages in the core U.S. market. It has also been shelling out billions of dollars in building up its online infrastructure in response to the long-run shift toward digital shopping. The moves appear to be paying off for the business. E-commerce sales spiked 60% in the most recent quarter as the company's online inventory ballooned to almost 70 million items, many of which can be delivered to a customer's home in two business days or less. Wal-Mart's physical locations are also enjoying a healthy rebound. Increased customer traffic has helped comparable-store sales improve for 12 consecutive quarters. Wal-Mart's growth pace is still modest, and that's partly a consequence of its massive size. Costco is expanding at a 5% rate these days, after all, compared to the retailing king's 2% uptick. The online sales threat should continue pressuring profits in the coming years, and so shareholders can't count on anything like the booming earnings growth that characterized this business in the past. WMT Cash from Operations (Annual) data by YCharts. Yet Wal-Mart remains an attractive investment thanks to its dominant market position, stellar cash flow, and solid dividend yield. These metrics point to decent returns for shareholders of this industry leader despite the likelihood that its market share will shift toward online-focused rivals over time. ","

Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the world's largest ad group WPP, estimates Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) generated about $2.5 billion in ad revenue last year. To put that in perspective, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) -- still one of the world's largest digital ad companies -- generated just $2.25 billion in ad revenue last year. Amazon's advertising business is seen as a big growth driver for the company's bottom line. It's another high-margin product that's supported by Amazon's main retail operation, and it could have a similar impact as Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud-computing business. Meanwhile, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google can't be happy about Amazon's growing advertising business. Image source: Amazon. Amazon doesn't offer exact numbers for its advertising business. Instead, it lumps it in with a few other small revenue generators like its co-branded credit cards. Last year, this ""other"" category generated $3.4 billion of revenue between Amazon's North American and International segments. Without knowing exactly what goes into Amazon's Other line item, it's hard to say whether Sorrell's estimate is accurate. As the head of WPP, he certainly has a lot of insight into who's winning share of the digital ad market. And it's feasible Amazon did indeed sell $2.5 billion worth of ads last year based on its financial reports. That said, it's by far the biggest estimate for Amazon's ad business. eMarketer estimates Amazon's ad business will bring in about $1 billion in 2017. By comparison, Twitter's ad business started stalling last year, bringing in just $2.25 billion, up just 12.5% from the $2 billion it brought in in 2015. What's more, ad revenue ought to decline this year after the company pulled back on some of its direct-response ad products. That opens the door for those ad dollars to find a new home. And Amazon provides a great opportunity for lots of those direct-response ads. Amazon's ad products have so much potential for the same reason Google ads are so valuable. More and more people are searching Amazon for products every day, broadcasting their intent to buy a trinket or doodad. If a trinket maker can get his product to the top of Amazon's search results, he stands a better chance of making a sale. In fact, purchase intent is even stronger on Amazon than for the same searches on Google, since Amazon is a shopping platform. That means Amazon ads ought to be more appealing to marketers than Google ads. And as Amazon opens more ad inventory, it could be taking sales directly out of the hands of Google. The trend gets stronger considering more and more people are beginning their product searches on Amazon. 55% of online shoppers now began their product search on Amazon.com last year. That's up from 44% the year before. Meanwhile, traditional search engines took just 28% of product searches last year, down from 34%. Considering those trends, it's not too far-fetched for Amazon to catapult to one of the biggest digital advertising companies in just a few years. It has a growing trove of extremely valuable ad inventory, and it's only just started to capitalize on it. Amazon risks hurting smaller third-party retailers, who are already getting squeezed out of its increasingly crowded marketplace. Increased advertising could create a scenario where the rich get richer and a smaller business with little to no ad budget can't win any sales. Amazon's competitors are already capitalizing on that scenario, but its third-party merchant sales remain as strong as ever. Still, management needs to balance ad inventory with it marketplace business as it continues to ramp up ad sales. ","

Magna International (NYSE:MGA), the giant auto-industry supplier, said that is has developed a new technology platform that will allow automakers to build self-driving capabilities into their vehicles. Magna joins an already-long list of companies inside and outside of the traditional auto industry that have announced plans to supply parts or systems for self-driving vehicles. Does it stand a chance of getting traction in this increasingly crowded market? Magna said that the controls for its new system can be as simple and unobtrusive as a cruise control system's. Image source: Magna International. In a statement, Magna described its new MAX4 system as a ""a fully integrated, customizable and scalable autonomous driving sensing and compute platform that can enable up to Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities in both urban and highway environments."" (You can learn more about the ""levels"" of self-driving technology here.) Its sensor suite is similar to those under development by rivals, incorporating cameras, radar, lidar units, and ultrasonic sensors. Those sensors feed signals to a dedicated computing platform. The MAX4 platform is designed in such a way that it can be easily integrated into major automakers' own systems. Magna's chief technology officer, Swamy Kotagiri, emphasized that the system won't take up significant space in the vehicle's interior or cargo compartment and won't require automakers to compromise their designs: At the heart of this development is a desire to show the market Magna's breadth of capabilities and an autonomous driving enabling platform with subsystems that do not compromise the interior and exterior of a vehicle. Our focus is on developing production-ready solutions that offer flexibility to integrate and the framework to enable Level 4 technology for when the market is ready. Magna said the MAX4 system offers automakers the option of using a simple control interface, similar to that of a traditional cruise-control system. A lighted display indicates that the vehicle is in self-driving mode, and drivers can disengage it by pressing a button or touching the brake pedal. Magna plans to share more details and will demonstrate the MAX4 system at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt, Germany, next month. Magna rival Delphi has its own advanced self-driving effort, working in partnership with chip giant Intel. Image source: Delphi Automotive. A lot of companies are gearing up to sell full or partial self-driving systems to automakers. Magna's entry may have to compete with efforts from, among others: Of course, other big auto suppliers like Delphi and Continental have the same advantages. Whether Magna's entry will shine over theirs will depend on many factors, some of which we can't judge yet. (For starters, how does its software compare?) But while Magna is hardly a tech-investor darling, it's a serious, credible player in the auto industry -- and it's a sure bet that automakers will give its system a serious look. Stay tuned.

A full transcript follows the video. Alison Southwick: It's easy to feel like your opportunity has already passed you by with a big tech company, too, especially if you're not super tech savvy and you didn't get in on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) when it was $7. How nervous should I be about that? I bought Amazon maybe five years ago, when I felt like I was getting in too late. Dylan Lewis: You're sitting pretty. Southwick: Yeah, actually I'm sitting pretty. And then I bought like a million shares of Berkshire Hathaway, so whatever. I don't even know why I work here anymore. Lewis: I think one of the important things to realize with tech companies, and why they can command these really high valuations, is because a lot of them are so nimble, and so what they do now might not reflect what they are going to be doing in five years. Or the way that they're making most of their money now might not reflect what it's going to look like in the future. I think two high-profile examples of that are Netflix and what that business looks like now and what it looked like 10 years ago. I've heard David Gardner talk about how just the name Netflix kind of cues you up to the idea that they were not a DVD-by-mail company. Their name signaled that they were going to be fairly nimble and move as people consume content differently. So there's different iterations of a lot of these businesses. Then, Amazon's another great example. You brought them up. People have thought about them as an e-commerce company for a really long time, but they have the segment Amazon Web Services, which is infrastructure, hosting, and all of that stuff. That is a cash cow for them and has just been printing money. People didn't really know how big it was until they started breaking it out a couple of years ago. And since it's really proven to be a great opportunity for them, it will be something that will fuel a lot of growth and give them an opportunity to plow cash back into the business. So with a lot of these companies that have already seen a ton of success, you're seeing that they're not too content with that and they want to keep pushing the limits, and they're investing in all these nascent technologies. Southwick: Everyone's got a self-driving car that they're working on. Lewis: The self-driving car. AI. Machine learning. You name it. So they're always investing in new things and their businesses lend themselves very well to bringing those more nascent and emerging tech options into the fold. ","

Billy Duberstein,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Hadoop technology distributor Hortonworks (NASDAQ:HDP) had a positive earnings report this month, sending the stock up roughly 25% since its Aug. 3 release. The company operates as one of only a few Hadoop distributors, and is thus well-positioned in the fast-growing industries of big data processing and open-source software. Revenue came in at $61.8 million, up a strong 41.7% year over year and $4.2 million above analyst estimates, while non-GAAP net losses came in at $0.44, beating expectations by $0.05. While those losses may seem large, Hortonworks is investing heavily to embed its technology in large enterprises' data science architectures going forward. As the revenue number shows, that is a potentially exciting area. Here are some highlights from the recent earnings report and conference call with analysts that show what Hortonworks' management wants investors to know about the quarter and its future. Hortonworks signed a landmark deal with IBM (NYSE:IBM) in the quarter. As part of the deal, IBM will sell Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) and Hortonworks DataFlow (HDF) as the architecture underneath IBM's Data Science Experience and Big SQL applications, and Hortonworks' sales force will resell those IBM applications as its de facto data science platforms to its customers. During the conference call, CEO Robert Bearden said the IBM partnership ""exemplifies yet another proof point that HDP has become the leading big data platform."" This is a big deal, as it both narrows the competition (by eliminating IBM's efforts at its own Hadoop distribution) and gives Hortonworks a powerful new partner. Management was particularly excited about a new Apache application called Atlas that the two companies are working on around data governance. Given the increased focus on cybersecurity, that seems to be a promising new venture. Moreover, the financial effects from the collaboration will not even be seen until 2018. That means this quarter's 42% growth did not include any real effect from the new partnership. Management also had positive things to say about Hortonworks DataFlow, a 2-year-old application for ""data in motion,"" which is becoming especially relevant for the Internet of Things. HDF collects and processes purchase, sensor, and asset data in real time and feeds it into customers' ""data lakes"" or other streaming data applications. This quarter, eight of the 10 largest deals inked by Hortonworks included HDF, along with its core HDP product (for ""data at rest""). Management was optimistic on the prospects for new applications that could be driven by HDF capabilities, calling it a ""huge game-changer."" Bearden also claimed HDF is ""the only end-to-end platform that collects, curates, analyzes and can process data in real time from the point of origin through its entire life cycle."" Image source: Getty Images. Management pointed to several use cases for HDF, including retail, manufacturing, insurance underwriting, and utilities. Real-time processing capability is becoming more essential than ever in today's general business climate, where speed and real-time decision-making is essential. That's why the company is spending so heavily to establish leadership. One of the potential drawbacks to Hortonworks is that it is still earnings- and cash-flow-negative, and its mere $72 million in cash (with an extra $30 million revolving credit facility) is low enough that there's a chance the company may have to raise excess capital at some point. This quarter, the company's non-GAAP net loss was $28.6 million, and its operating cash flow was a better-but-still-negative $11.7 million. These numbers showed improvement over last year's $41.5 million net loss and negative $14.1 million operating cash flow, but are still well in the red. Management pointed out that even though sales grew over 40% and gross margins expanded, the company's operating expenses barely increased, from $68.6 million to $70.4 million, showing the operating leverage in the business model. Management also reiterated its guidance of being operating cash flow breakeven by the fourth quarter of 2017. However, investors should remember that operating cash flow backs out stock-based compensation, which continues to be fairly high, and is a real expense. So while the company may become ""cash flow breakeven"" soon and may not have to raise additional money, shareholders will still continue to be diluted due to employee stock compensation. Hortonworks delivered a strong quarter and seems to be carving out a good position as the Hadoop partner of choice for large enterprise companies such as IBM. As long as the company keeps its spending in check and continues to execute, the future seems bright. ","

Now, when users search for symptoms of depression, they will be directed to the PHQ-9 questionnaire, the standard tool doctors use to screen for depression. The clinically-validated survey quizzes respondents on a variety of trouble signs, such as feeling down and having trouble concentrating or poor appetite. The feature, which was developed in partnership with the National Alliance on Mental Illness, will be fully rolled out in the next couple of days. Initiatives like these will help people who would not otherwise realize they are struggling with a treatable illness, said Kenneth Duckworth, the medical director at the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Depression is hard to read in yourself, he said. “People accommodate to their experience. The hope is that this will give people information they can reflect on.” Depression costs the U.S. $5,524 per working person each year, or 0.5% of total gross domestic product in lost productivity, according to a 2016 study according to a study published in a journal of Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology in November 2016. More than 16 million adults in the U.S. — or 6.7% of the adult population — had at least one major depressive episode in the last year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, and only half of people diagnosed with major depression receive care. “Depression is common, and depression is treatable,” Duckworth said. “With those two facts in mind we decided to do this partnership to advance public health. We believe information is power.” The survey is not the first resource Google has provided regarding mental health. The search engine pulls up suicide prevention resources if a user searches for suicide-related terms and has offered medical fact cards for health conditions in general since 2015. Some experts have expressed concern about the rise of online resources for mental health, saying that it poses privacy concerns. But Vidushi Tekriwal, product manager at Google, said the tool is simply meant to screen for depression — not treat it. “Depression is a highly common condition, but about half of the people who suffer from it don’t get treated,” she said. “By making PHQ-9 easily accessible, we hope that will help provide useful and insightful information to spur deeper research on the web or to help you have more in-depth conversation with your doctor Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

                                   , which has logged modest losses this month, versus those gains for Apple and Microsoft. Lyons has been tracking so-called trendlines — lines on a chart that connect either a rising series of lows (trendline up) or declining series of highs (trendline down). What Alphabet’s chart below is now telling him is that the company is gearing up for another “successful test of its long-term up trendline.” That trendline started at the July 2015 low, and has connected the dots to around a dozen lows since then, including Wednesday’s bounce off $905 a share, Lyons says. The corresponding trendline in GOOGL is around $920, as of Thursday. Where now? “First off, as long as the trendline holds, expect GOOG to remain on the rise and a leader in this rally. Furthermore, as long as the rally leaders are still moving higher, a significant decline remains doubtful,” said Lyons. Read the full post here.

Opinion: Bulls and bears both can’t be right on stocks — so here’s who’s right (for now) Gold is set to finish the month 3% higher, having cruised to 11-month highs this week on North Korea and Texas-flood jitters. But maybe not everyone is convinced the only way is up from here. The chart above shows what’s look like a mini-flash crash in the early Asian hours, which had gold barely hanging onto $1,300 before it climbed back up. (H/T to ZeroHedge, which said a seller tried to dump $1.1 billion into the Asia open.) Note there has been some debate about whether gold can keep marking new highs.

Dan Eaton,08312017,MarketWatch,08242017,"Published: Aug 27, 2017 8:20 a.m. ET Ethics, protests and career-ending consequences By Water cooler talk has never been hotter. One day, an office colleague tells you software engineer James Damore didn’t deserve to be fired from Google
GOOGL, -2.57%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                   for circulating an internal memo protesting the company’s diversity efforts. The next day, the same colleague insists that quarterback Colin Kaepernick doesn’t deserve to be hired by any NFL team for taking a knee during the playing of the national anthem last season to protest perceived racial injustice. You ask yourself: “Can my colleague maintain both positions and still be an ethical person?” The answer is yes. But ask: “Isn’t the ethical (as distinct from legal) right to protest without career-ending consequences the same in both cases?” The answer also is yes — but only to a point. Take a lesson from pollsters: the answer you get may depend on the way the question is framed. An alternative way to ask: “Is a protester who advances his ideas of justice in a manner and by means that respect this nation’s traditions and values entitled to his job?” That yields a positive, internally consistent answer that reconciles both positions regardless of whether your colleague supports one man or the other. It depends on what is meant by respect for the nation’s traditions and values. By contrast, an affirmative answer to the question “Should workers keep their political views out of the workplace or suffer the consequences?” would, to be ethically coherent, result in supporting neither man. An affirmative answer to this question, if posed over the workplace water cooler in connection with these examples, also would be highly ironic. Challenging a co-worker’s views on the issues of the day because they are ethically irreconcilable from issue to issue may be a futile tack. The aspiration of an ethically coherent creed is internal harmony based on specific principles, not monotone based on broad, meaningless generalities. Better to challenge the principles of your opinionated colleague on its terms as to the issue at hand rather than pointing out a clash with his position on a different issue in a different context that, on closer inspection, is readily dissolved. In a recent New York Times essay, the historian and biographer Jon Meacham demonstrated how framing a question a certain way may reconcile positions that diverge at some level. In explaining how he could support the removal of monuments to Confederate leaders while supporting retention of monuments to America’s Founding Fathers even though both sets of men were slave owners, Meacham wrote that the right question to ask is “Was the person to whom a monument is erected on public property devoted to the American experiment in liberty and self-government?” Meacham contends the answer to that question leads to the inexorable conclusion that a statue of Jefferson Davis goes and a statue of Thomas Jefferson stays, even though the two men shared a fundamental sin. And yet, with all due respect to Meacham, that is not the only way to frame the question at the heart of that particular debate. One might equally ask simply whether the monument commemorates a slave owner. Some on the left suggest a positive answer is why even monuments to our founders should come down. President Trump and some of his followers suggest that framing the question this way demonstrates the folly of removing the Confederate statues. Framing the question in a way that would support disturbing neither set of statues would be to ask “Was the person to whom the monument is erected on public property an important figure in the history of the place where the monument stands?” This commentary takes no sides on any of these hot issues. The modest suggestion here is that castigating a co-worker with whom you disagree as ethically incoherent and therefore ethically wrong is almost always a futile exercise and never advances civil debate or deeper understanding in or out of the workplace. The most collegial and productive workplace will be one in which employees are focused on the meaningful work they are paid to do, but that also one that provides an environment in which sharply differing views on current events are exchanged respectfully. These discussions are going to happen. Definitive resolution of these questions is impossible; workplace peace in the face of vigorous disagreement is not. In reading an excellent biography of Richard Nixon — one of our most complicated presidents — by John Farrell, I came across the following passage from President Nixon’s first inaugural address: “We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another — until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices.” Both Nixon admirers and detractors would do well to heed his wise words from that fraught time in our nation’s history in this fraught time in our nation’s history.

Jacob Passy,08312017,MarketWatch,08242017,"Published: Aug 24, 2017 1:25 p.m. ET Companies cutting back on their remote workforce may be making the right move By A growing number of workers are performing their jobs remotely — and many face significant challenges doing so. In recent years, more workers have begun working remotely. Between 2012 and 2016, the share of employees who spend 80% or more of their time working remotely grew from 24% to 31%, according to a survey from Gallup. Some 59% of business executives said that more than half of their companies’ full-time workforce would be remote by 2020, per the results of a 2014 survey at London Business School’s Global Leadership Summit. But not all business leaders are in favor of this trend. In May, IBM

And in 2013, Yahoo ended its telecommuting program shortly after the beginning of former CEO Marissa Mayer’s tenure with the company. These companies could be making the right choice, based on the results of a survey released Wednesday by software design company CyberLink and polling firm YouGov. Remote workers need to shine on Slack and email and, despite having more practice than workers who enjoy more water-cooler moments, many lack those basic digital skills. Why? Some 41% of workers said misinterpreting the tone of emails and other written communication was a concern of working remotely. But people working in an office should also take this lesson to heart: 42% of those who do work on-site expressed the same misgivings. Workers who are not proactive about combatting these issues can kiss goodbye to their home comforts and get ready for a long commute, said Lynn Taylor, workplace expert and author of “Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant.” In particular, remote workers could find themselves lacking motivation and need-to-know office politics, she said. And if there are layoffs? The squeaky wheel who shows up to the office on a daily basis may have the best chance of keeping his or her job. “Intrinsically, we want to feel excited about what we’re doing, but it’s hard to feel excited about what you’re doing without face-to-face feedback and that visceral interaction you get with people,” she said. “That human connection is important for many people.” Don’t miss: Why your loudest, busiest co-worker is NOT the most talented or productive The most obvious and biggest concern (41%) is being noticed, the latest survey released Wednesday found. “Even though communication has largely shifted to digital mediums, face time is still a highly-valued part of business,” said CyberLink CEO Jau Huang. “Remote workers don’t have a physical presence in the office, so their colleagues may be under the impression that they bring less to the table or aren’t a member of the team, even though that’s often not true.” This leads to other problems: Having difficulty engaging with workplace culture is a common complaint among 38% of people who work remotely. Other concerns include not making work friends (33%) and building relationships with management (31%). Technical difficulties, the bane of most workers, don’t help: 40% of remote workers said an important call was dropped while 31% missed or were late to a video conference because of a tech failure. While remote work will come with its downsides, other research has indicated it could actually be a positive. In a March survey of more than 24,000 workers, 98% said that “anywhere working” positively affected productivity, according to a study from video and voice collaboration technology company Polycom, Inc. and Human Resources executive network and research firm Future Workplace. And other studies have shown that the open office environments many employers are adopting lead to increased distraction and distrust among employees.

                                   shares plummeted 8.1% in Wednesday trade and declined 0.7% in Thursday trade. “PetMed Express, Inc. categorically denies the allegations and its implications,” the company said. “While the Company dispenses Tramadol and Gabapentin, which represent less than 1% of annual revenue, it is done exclusively pursuant to valid prescriptions from veterinarians for the treatment of animals only,” referring to the opioid tramadol and the nerve pain drug gabapentin, which is touted as an opioid alternative for pain but can also be abused. The corporate skirmish comes at a time of renewed attention to the possibility of pet opioid abuse, with new state laws focusing on the issue. There have long been concerns that, amid efforts to crack down on opioid prescriptions, addicts could be turning to pet medications. Read:  Opioids are ravaging the U.S., but they’re still the best pain drug we’ve got The Aurelius Value report’s key claim is that PetMed’s online advertising allows people who are searching for opiates to find the company’s products. The report also claimed that pet opioid medications are the “secret sauce” behind PetMed’s improved financial results and recent stock gains. Since mid-March, PetMed shares have nearly doubled; the company reported first-quarter profit and revenue beats in late July. Aurelius Value said it has notified Google and that Google “could choose to ban PetMed as an advertiser.” There could be a more than 50% downside to PetMed stock, which could be worth less than $20 a share, the hedge fund’s report said. PetMed shares were valued at $37.50 as of midday Thursday. The report also referred to a recent earnings call in which Chief Executive Menderes Akdag declined to comment further on improved margins, simply saying that “there’s a shift to new generation medications and I’m going to leave it at that.” However, on Friday PetMed said that those “new generation medications” are new generation flea, tick and heartworm control products. The company also told the Wall Street Journal that it has asked Google to remove its ads. In addition, Aurelius Value declined to identify himself to the Wall Street Journal. See:  Opioid addiction diagnoses rose nearly 500% in the last seven years The Aurelius Value report suggested that, although PetMed verifies prescriptions with veterinarians, some may be writing bogus prescriptions, or addicts may be taking advantage of the system. PetMed Chief Financial Officer Bruce Rosenbloom told MarketWatch on Thursday that the company “categorically” denies all of the report’s allegations. Tramadol and gabapentin sales make up 0.4% of PetMed’s total sales for the six-month period ending in late June, and company sales of the two medications have declined over the last five years, the company said. Flea, tick and heartworm medications are the majority of the company’s prescription business, according to Rosenbloom, and pharmacy staffers only dispense a prescription after they’ve authorized it either with a veterinarian’s written prescription or letter of authorization or a verbal prescription from the veterinarian. “There are pets out there that need this medication. Whether the pet owner is doing the right thing by the pet, we have no control over that. It would be very unfortunate if that were to occur,” Rosenbloom said. Related:  These millennials are buying houses because they want their pets to have more space Rosenbloom also denied that PetMed specifically targets key words such as “opiate pills to get you high,” as the Aurelius Value report said. The Google screenshots in the hedge fund’s report have to do with Google’s algorithm, he said. “We do not target those key words at all,” he said. “We would never target those key words. It makes no business sense to do that.” See:  Opioid epidemic could derail Trump’s infrastructure plans The Aurelius Value report also refers to the fact that one of PetMed’s co-founders, Yali Golan, had a drug-conspiracy conviction that sent him to jail in the early 1990s. But PetMed’s Rosenbloom said that he and CEO Akdag took over the company in 2001. He isn’t “per se” familiar with the founders’ story, but said that he and Akdag cleared up prior transgressions from previous management, including pharmacy violations, when they took over.

It weakened further to tropical-storm status before 2 p.m. The storm was expected to settle in over South Texas for several days. Forecasters warned it could bring up to 40 inches of rain in some places and potentially cause devastating flooding in cities like Houston. On Saturday, emergency workers and police fanned out across the coastal communities of Corpus Christi and Rockport to assess the damage, but conditions were making such operations difficult. No fatalities were immediately reported from the storm, the first substantial hurricane to hit Texas since Hurricane Ike struck the Gulf Coast in 2008. The last Category 4 storm to hit Texas was Hurricane Carla in 1961, according to the National Weather Service.

Devon Delfino,08312017,MarketWatch,08242017,"Published: Aug 28, 2017 11:22 a.m. ET There’s several ways to generate cash flow By This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. For many people, YouTube is a site where they can spend endless hours watching cat videos, product reviews or other people playing videogames. For others, it’s a way to make money. Becoming a professional YouTuber might sound like fun, but you’ll have to hustle to get started, and there’s no guarantee it will pay off. If you’re looking to make a quick buck, you might consider other options. However, if you’re already an avid video creator and are willing to put in the extra effort, you might be able to make money on YouTube. Here’s what you need to know. To earn directly through YouTube, you must partner with the site. Once you do, there are several ways to cash in, but to become a partner you must meet the requirements: Your videos must abide by the site’s advertising guidelines, and you need at least 10,000 channel views. The more videos you have, the easier it is to reach that 10,000-view threshold. Someone with 200 videos needs only 50 views per video to get there, whereas a person with 10 videos needs 1,000 views per video. High-quality, entertaining videos are more likely to get views, so it pays to put effort into planning and production. Once you’re approved as a partner, you can connect your channel to Google AdSense, the company’s advertising system. Advertisers use AdSense to bid for space on videos based on factors such as your audience, video topic and relevant keywords. In general, you’ll be paid based on the number of “impressions” your videos get; that’s when someone clicks on or watches an ad. Ads don’t display every time someone watches a video, though, so views don’t translate directly to money in the bank. Also, YouTube takes a cut of the ad revenue; it wouldn’t disclose that rate. You’ll get payments once your balance reaches $100, so if you have a small channel, you might get paid only every few months. You may want to set aside some of that cash for taxes because Google

                                   which issues AdSense payments, might not deduct your full tax obligation. AdSense isn’t the only way partners can make money on YouTube. You can also make videos available on YouTube Red, which is the site’s ad-free subscription service. And if you have more than 1,000 active subscribers, you can put videos behind a paywall and enable Super Chat, which lets viewers pay to have their messages highlighted during a live stream. To use that feature, partners have to be older than 18. AdSense, YouTube Red and Super Chat aren’t the only ways you can cash in on a YouTube channel, but making money through these other methods still depends largely on having a loyal, engaged audience. Here are a few options to consider. Use product placement and video sponsorship: Companies interested in your channel’s audience might sponsor your videos or offer you product placement deals in exchange for a shout out. You’ll likely receive payments on a per-sale basis or in commission tiers. Search on sites such as ShareASale, Clickbank and CJ Affiliate by Conversant for possible corporate partners — and be sure you’re willing to vouch for the company and products you’re selling before signing up. If you do have an endorsement or product placement in a video, you must notify YouTube by ticking the “paid promotion” box in the advanced settings tab of your video manager. Sell products or services to viewers: If you have merchandise or offer a service that’s relevant to your audience, let them know about it and provide links in your videos. For example, comedian Jenna Mourey, more commonly known by her YouTube name Jenna Marbles, sells T-shirts and posters featuring one of her dogs. Selling a physical product might require you to buy materials or find a manufacturer, but you can also sell downloadables such as e-books or art prints. Have a secure payment system in place before you advertise your goods. Meet up with fans in the real world: Meetups and similar events let YouTubers connect with viewers and sell merchandise. They’re usually best suited to those with active and engaged subscribers. Those with smaller audiences might want to skip ticketed events and bank on merchandise sales instead. Or if, for example, your videos teach viewers how to draw, you could set up a free class at a local park and sell your book of drawing techniques afterward. Turn to crowdfunding: There are two primary types of crowdfunding: recurring and project-based. Recurring crowdfunding lets contributors pay an amount they specify on a regular schedule. You’d want to maximize this type of funding to turn a channel into a substantial income stream. Incentives such as one-on-one video chats, private classes or merchandise can entice viewers to sign up. If you have an idea for a project that requires financial support, a project-based crowdfunding campaign is the way to go. Get started with sites such as Indiegogo, Kickstarter, GoFundMe or Patreon.

With about a week left in the summer movie season — defined as the first Friday in May through Labor Day weekend — the box office has garnered $3.7 billion. The summer box office is down 14% compared with last year and down 13% compared with 2015, according to data from Box Office Mojo. Read: The summer movie box office is not living up to what the industry promised Also see: Cinema stocks still getting knocked around as summer box office slumps ComScore media analyst Paul Dergarabedian said he didn’t see a way the summer box office makes it to $4 billion. There’s nothing for the box office to really feast on until the Oct. 8 release of “Blade Runner 2049.” “The crazy thing is, there’s not even a single wide release scheduled for the Labor Day weekend,” Dergarabedian said. “To show you how dead the box office really is, ‘Wonder Woman’ is expanding and they’re rereleasing ‘Baby Driver.’ Two films from June are coming back to take advantage of the lull. If that’s not telling, then I don’t know what is.” Of the new releases and films in theaters this past weekend, analysts at Box Office said, “in an already slow box office market, things look to remain very quiet despite three new films opening.” The weekend was so quiet in fact that the boxing match between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor, which CBS Corp.-owned

Summer 2017 is projected to finish with between $3.75 billion and $3.8 billion, according to Dergarabedian. In 2016 and 2015 the summer box office pulled in a total $4.5 billion. “It really is a reflection of audiences rejection of a lower quality of blockbusters, and really a rejection of a lack of originality,” Dergarabedian said. “It’s really tough to get away with making an inferior product nowadays.” Check out: Hollywood is running out of hit ’80s movies to reboot As box office returns have slumped, stocks of cinema chains have been bludgeoned by investors.

(See also: Amazon's Alexa Will Approach 71% of Smart Speaker Market: eMarketer.) Barclays analyst Manav Patnaik highlights Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOG), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) as major players in the space attempting to build their own ecosystem of smart house products. Other companies that sell gadgets used across the different platforms developed by the major tech giants are also set to gain from rapid adoption of smart home tech. While smart homes were once limited to wealthier consumers, new products such as the Apple HomeKit have eliminated the need for expensive, highly specialized systems that are required to be installed in homes. Consumers now only need an affordable hub and smartphone to add voice controls to gadgets such as light bulbs, vacuums and garage door openers. “We estimate that the full opportunity of converting to a smart home with a fully electric vehicle replacing a conventional vehicle would save consumers 46.6% on their annual energy bills while also increasing overall household usage by 14% in our base case,” wrote the Barclays analyst, also suggesting that voice control will be the driving force behind growth in the smart home space. Barclays foresees the hardware segment of the market contributing $130 billion by 2020, while software and advertising are expected to reach $170 billion over the same period.

With the IPO, Best will have a valuation of as much as $5.7 billion, reported Reuters. This isn’t the first time the logistics company has talked about raising capital via an IPO in the U.S. In April, The Wall Street Journal reported the company, which was founded by a Google executive and also counts Foxconn as an investor, was readying an IPO with an eye toward raising around $1 billion. At the time the company was in the the process of hiring investment banks and was planning on launching the offering in September or October. In June, it said it was looking to raise $750 million. Either way, it could turn out to be one of the biggest public offerings of a Chinese company in the U.S. this year. Best makes money from fulfillment and transportation services and provides business-to-business delivery services. (See more: Alibaba Aims to Become World's Fifth Largest Economy by 2036.) Alibaba owns a 23.4% stake in Best, which is becoming increasingly important in its push to deliver products from its e-commerce websites around the globe.

Demand for express delivery, something that is expected in this e-commerce driven world, is expected to increase 17.9% annually in the next six years. Alibaba's market share in the express delivery market in China increased to 8.6% for the first six months of the year. Previously its market share stood at 2.7%.

Mark Kolakowski,09072017,Investopedia,08312017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The bull market in stocks is still alive and kicking and is likely to extend into 2018. But the bull's final charge won't be pretty, according to Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer at Minneapolis-based Leuthold Group, as reported by Barron's. Stocks are likely to face huge volatility as they stage one last rally before year-end and then stumble badly, falling at least 25% in 2018, he predicts. Investors should expect a correction in the next few months, a market drop of up to 10 percent, before the bull's last-gasp rally and final plunge. Leuthold publishes widely-read studies on the markets. ""If a number of different valuation metrics were to return to their 60-year median, since the S&Ps inception in 1957, that would imply a drop in the S&P 500 to 1750, or about 25%,"" Ramsey told Barron's. A market technician, he notes that years ending in ""7"" tend to have a ""strong downward bias"" in the August to November period. He believes that a pullback of 6% to 8% in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) is already underway, and that the Russell 2000 Index could drop by 13% to 14%. After rebounding to new highs later in the fall, he expects the S&P 500 to close 2017 in the range of 2550 to 2600. In recent weeks, Leuthold has reduced its maximum net equity exposure to 57%, Ramsey says in Barron's August 26 story. His company, he indicates, has its biggest bets in technology, particularly semiconductor equipment, data processors, IT consulting, and electronic manufacturing services. However, his firm does not own the FANG stocks, which are Facebook Inc. (FB), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NFLX), and Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL). They do not believe that tech sector valuations are out of hand, even including the FANGs, and see a positive in the fact that the price to cash flow ratio for the S&P tech sector has been virtually unchanged over the past four years, at a value of about 15. The great bull market will end sometime in 2018, Ramsey predicts, but he won't speculate on when the top will be reached. Current negative indicators that he cites include a slowdown in the auto market, a cyclical peak that's approaching in single-family housing, and a slowdown in annual nonfarm payroll employment growth, which normally precedes the onset of a recession within 12 months. After experiencing negative real, inflation-adjusted, interest rates for eight of the last nine years, he expects that ""the level at which rates begin to bite might be lower than commonly believed."" Thus, if yields on the 10-Year Treasury note rise to 3% or 3.5%, he believes that income-oriented investors might begin selling high-yielding stocks, whereas bond yields of 5.5% to 6% would have been necessary in the past to prompt a similar exit from equities. Based on market history going all the way back to 1880, a theoretic balanced portfolio that has been 60% in S&P 500 stocks and 40% in 10-Year U.S. Treasury Notes has produced an average annualized return of 8%, Ramsey says, noting that this is a common target for pension funds. In turn, that 8% breaks down into 4.1% from dividend and interest income, and 3.9% from capital appreciation, he adds. Today, however, ""a record combined overvaluation"" of both stocks and bonds mean that a 60/40 equity/debt portfolio is yielding only about 2.1% today. ""That is inescapable investment math that challenges the bulls,"" he asserts, forecasting that investors will struggle to generate an average annual return of 3% to 4% over the next ten years for such a balanced portfolio. Meanwhile, billionaire investor Warren Buffett remains positive on the equity markets. He believes that stock valuations, though high by historical standards, are far more reasonable than those on bonds right now. (For more, see also: Buffett Says Aging Bull Market Best Place to Be.)

Arjun Kharpal,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"IFA is one of the largest consumer electronics shows in the world. The largest device makers in the world from Samsung to Lenovo tend to stage flashy launches at the event which takes place in Berlin, Germany. But quietly in the background, two players with barely any branding anywhere are making the most noise: Google and Amazon. Construction of booths was still ongoing on Thursday ahead of the opening day on Friday. Companies like Sony, Panasonic and Samsung were putting the final touches on their giant stands. But tucked in the tiny corner of the venue, in one of the smallest halls, was a stand for Amazon Alexa, the e-commerce giant's voice assistant. So far, no Google branding could be spotted. The low-key presence of these two from a brand perspective is deceiving because they were in fact all over the place. In many of the product launches, from many different companies, either Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant was mentioned as a partner. Chinese firm Qihan for example integrated Alexa into its humanoid robot called the Sanbot Nano. Sony released a 230 euro ($272) smart speaker, similar to the Amazon Echo, but with Google Assistant as the main voice feature. Meanwhile, LG announced that all of its smart home devices released in 2017 will be compatible with Google Assistant. That means users can ask the voice assistant things like how long is left on the cycle of their LG washing machine. It's an absolute land grab by Amazon and Google, two tech behemoths who are leading the way in artificial intelligence (AI). And there's a few reasons why. Firstly, the more devices that each voice assistant is on, the smarter it will become because it has large amounts of data available. But the most important strategic reason is that the so-called internet of things (IOT) is becoming reality. That is, an increasing number of devices are becoming connected and Amazon and Google both want to be major players, without actually making much hardware. Think what has happened in smartphones. There are two dominant operating systems: Google's Android and Apple's iOS. Owning these has allowed Apple and Google to become major mobile players and reap the revenues from their respective app stores and other services. As of yet, there is no unified ""smart things"" operating system. It's disjointed, expensive, and not seamless, like we have come to expect on mobile. But there's rising interest in voice assistants which could prove to become the operating system of the IOT. You can control devices without screens and those assistants can almost become your handy helper. Amazon missed the mobile wave in terms of hardware and software, but this could be its chance to become a major IOT platform. And the reward could be a significant new revenue stream. In a report earlier this year, RBC predicted that Alexa could bring Amazon $10 billion of revenues by 2020 and be a ""mega-hit."" Think about a world with Alexa all around you. Imagine now what Amazon could sell you. The vision is similar for Google. Ads and e-commerce could give the search giant some new revenues. There's potentially a lot at stake and it's risky if voice doesn't take off. But neither Amazon nor Google wants to miss out and that's why this epic landgrab to get on as many devices as possible is set to continue.

Todd Haselton,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"The news follows a separate story from late August that suggested Taiwan-based HTC was interested in some sort of sale. HTC, once one of the more popular smartphone makers in the United States, has fallen off of most carrier store shelves after several consecutive unsuccessful smartphone launches. It recently launched a separate division that sells virtual reality headsets. The report seems fishy, since Google has already been down this road, but there's a reason why Google might be interested in HTC. The Taiwanese company builds the Google Pixel, which means it could be a good fit for Google as it continues to cater to consumers with its ""Pixel"" smartphone brand. Here's where it sounds off base: Google acquired Motorola Mobility and then sold it off just a couple of years later. Why repeat that move? Commercial Times said HTC's poor financial position and Google's desire to ""perfect [the] integration of software, content, hardware, network, cloud, [and] AI,"" is the driving force behind Google's interest. The news outlet said Google may make a ""strategic investment"" or ""buy HTC's smartphone R&D team"" which suggests that the VR team would exist as its own. UBS analyst Eric J. Sheridan explained in a note on Thursday why Google might want to push further into hardware: From a strategic standpoint, owning & operating its own mobile operating division would offset some of the key strategic challenges that Google's mobile computing business might face: a) a deeper integration of hardware/software would offset some of the Android fragmentation issues that do not plague Apple iOS; b) development cycles that maximize forward mobile computing trends (Google Lens, location, ARCore, Google Assistant) with possible greater user adoption; c) an offset to rising Distribution TAC expenses; & d) an offset to any negative industry dynamics (unbundling of apps) resulting from the European Commission's Android investigation. Sheridan said a Google acquisition of HTC would be ""immaterial to Alphabet"" given its $95 billion cash stash. Google and HTC declined to comment to CNBC. ","Google buying HTC, report says"
Silvia Amaro,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"Google is still very much a force for good and has many positive attributes, according to the EU's competition commissioner who slapped the tech giant with a $2.7 billion fine earlier this year. ""This is a decision about legal behavior that they (Google) should and can correct,"" Vestager said about June's fine for the U.S. firm.

The U.S. tech giant has been investigated by the European Commission on several fronts for concerns over competition. It inclusively received a 2.42 billion euro fine in June for giving illegal advantage to its own comparison shopping service. This week, Google reportedly submitted details of how it planned to stop favoring its shopping service and comply with the EU order.

Jordan Novet,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"Alphabet's Google has picked up more support for a key piece of its cloud strategy. On Wednesday the San Francisco start-up Mesosphere announced the upcoming availability of a beta version of Google-led open-source software called Kubernetes inside its flagship software. These tools handle the work of deploying containers, which package up application code just like the virtual machines that VMware popularized, on several physical servers. While virtual machines are arguably more widely used (and have been around longer), containers are thought to be more efficient and easier to move to other server infrastructure. Two years ago Mesosphere did incorporate a modified version of Kubernetes, an alternative to the Marathon system it primarily supports, into its DC/OS tool, which can operate databases and other software in addition to deploying containers. But now the start-up is dead-set on delivering the latest version of Kubernetes in DC/OS, starting with version 1.10. The Information originally reported the news and described it as an indication that the start-up was giving in to a Google-backed technology. But in a call with CNBC, Mesosphere executives suggested that wasn't right because its DC/OS offering does more than just run containers. Companies can run DC/OS atop public clouds or on their own data center infrastructure, and doing so can be more cost-effective than raw public cloud because of its typical pricing model, Mesosphere CEO Florian Leibert told CNBC in an interview. Uber, for example, uses Mesosphere's software to run a database called Cassandra. ""If you do some simple math and you put that into the AWS [Amazon Web Services] calculator, you come out with a yearly cost -- the lower end of that is $6-10 million that Uber would have to pay AWS for equivalent functionality,"" Leibert said. ""Even if you use the highest-end servers with our software, it would be half or a third of that."" If anything, the move further distinguishes Mesosphere from other companies that provide distributions of Kubernetes, the start-up's marketing chief, Peter Guagenti, told CNBC. ""We have the most enterprise customers, the most containers in production, and we're the one with the most revenue of all the startups in the space,"" Guagenti said. ""As far as we're concerned, we've been really successful to date. This adoption for us is a way to extend that success and cover more use cases."" Google made the Kubernetes source code available for free in 2014, and subsequently introduced a managed version of Kubernetes on its public cloud, so admins wouldn't have to worry about setting up and running it. Microsoft has built Kubernetes support into its Azure Container Service. AWS does have a service for launching code in containers on its servers, but it's not primarily based on Kubernetes. The fact that Kubernetes keeps code tucked inside computing units that can be switched to another cloud is key to Google, precisely because it's not the top cloud. Big companies can feel comfortable about not getting ""locked in"" to the Google cloud -- and adopting Kubernetes could make it easier to use multiple public clouds at once. Historically that's not something that Amazon has talked about a lot, presumably because it wants customers to stick with its market-leading cloud exclusively. Nevertheless, AWS was thinking about building a Kubernetes service, The Information reported earlier this year. Even if that were to happen, Mesosphere would continue to emphasize the advantages of paying for a Mesosphere subscription instead, as it enables a variety of computing capabilities for a single price, Leibert said. Mesosphere's investors include HPE, Microsoft, Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures. Microsoft did attempt to acquire Mesosphere but ultimately the deal didn't work out, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC. Leibert wouldn't comment on that.

Christina Farr,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"Alphabet's Verily wants to be at the center of the medical start-up ecosystem, both literally and figuratively. The company, formerly known as Google Life Sciences, is now offering entrepreneurs access to its South San Francisco-based lab space, office space, talent and other resources in exchange for equity or cash. ""We want to have cutting-edge tech companies working in health care proximate to us,"" said Verily's business development lead Andrew Harrison. CNBC first reported on a partner start-up moving onto the Verily campus in July, but the full details were not yet public. Alphabet has many vehicles for investing in start-ups, including GV, which invests in early-stage companies, and CapitalG, which is focused on later-stage companies. But lately, it has been specializing more. Most recently, it launched Gradient Ventures earlier this year to fund early-stage artificial intelligence companies and bolster access to Google's engineering talent. Verily's model is tailored to the medical sector, which represents about a fifth of the economy. Alphabet, alongside Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, are all looking to slice out a piece of this $3 trillion health care pie. In an interview, Harrison described the Verily model as a ""partner space."" It takes a page from existing models such as start-up accelerators and co-working lab spaces but with a few key differences. Unlike many of these programs, Verily might invest but it doesn't need to. It can rent out the space instead. In either case, according to Harrison, it will do a ""venture-like review"" on any medical start-ups that apply. Verily has space for about 5 to 10 start-ups at any given time, he said. Two of these spots have already been filled by Culture Robotics, a biotech tools start-up, and Freenome, a diagnostics company working on an early-stage cancer test. Verily made an equity investment in both companies. Culture Robotics' Will Patrick chose to join the partner space to work in close proximity to Verily's team of scientists and engineers. It also proved to be an affordable option for the start-up given the Bay Area's astronomical rent prices. ""As a small company, being part of the partner space helps us get off the ground more quickly,"" he said. Harrison is hoping to work with companies that are in a complementary space, which gives Verily a fairly wide remit to invest across the bio-tech and digital health ecosystem. The company's dozen or so projects include a glucose-tracking contact lens and assistive tools for people with impaired movement. Its current partners include some of the world's largest pharma and medical device companies, ranging from Dexcom to Sanofi. ",Alphabetm Verily sets up campus 'partner' space for start-ups
Ari Levy,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"Consumer devices have been a sinkhole for public investors of late. GoPro, the adventure camera company, has plunged 38 percent in the past year and is trading 63 percent below its IPO price from 2014. Fitbit has performed even worse, with shares of the fitness tracker down 61 percent in the past 12 months, and 71 percent below its 2015 debut price. Roku faces very similar challenges. The company, which makes devices for streaming TV shows and movies, is in direct competition with the biggest consumer device companies — which also happen to be the most valuable businesses in the world. Those brands have much greater brand recognition and marketing budgets that are many times bigger than Roku's. According to Roku's own admission in an IPO prospectus filed Friday afternoon, the company has to fight for shelf space in retail stores. ""Competition is intense for these resources, and a competitor with more extensive product lines and stronger brand identity, such as Apple or Google, possesses greater bargaining power with retailers,"" Roku said in the filing. ""In addition, one of our online retailers, Amazon.com, sells its own competitive TV streaming products and is able to market and promote these products more prominently on its website, and could refuse to offer our devices,"" the company added. Sales at Roku, which includes revenue from the device and from subscriptions on the platform, rose 16 percent in the latest quarter to $99.6 million. Its net loss increased by about 10 percent to $15.5 million. Investors are so bearish on the space that they're valuing GoPro and Fitbit at less than one times revenue. Meanwhile, Jawbone started shutting down in recent months, after demand dried up for its fitness trackers and bluetooth speakers. Even more ominously, juicing start-up Juicero completely closed up shop on Friday. While many other factors could play into Roku's eventual market cap, if the company can't command a higher multiple than GoPro or Fitbit, it will be valued at less than $500 million. However, Roku does have a story to tell that takes it out of just the hardware game. The company generated 46 percent of revenue in the period ended July from subscriptions and advertising on the platform. More importantly, sales in that segment surged 95 percent, turning Roku into more of a software and content company than a device maker. When viewers watch stations like CBS News and Vice, Roku gets to collect ad revenue. For subscription services like HBO Now and Hulu, the company earns a cut when people sign up from the device. Some TV manufacturers also pay a licensing fee to embed Roku's service in their devices. The company said this year there will be 150 models available in the U.S. up from 100 in 2016. In its upcoming roadshow, Roku will likely be trying to convince investors that its future is not in selling devices, but in powering them.

That time, he tells CNBC Make It, could be better spent advancing their career. ""Every minute you spend on social media is a minute lost on your career,"" says St. John. ""One will make you money, the other won't."" He says that young people aren't working that hard on their careers. ""It's become ridiculous the ratio of social media time to career time,"" says St. John. He points to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg as an example. He describes how the tech mogul had very few people he was close with growing up. ""He kept to himself and worked in a basement,"" says St. John. ""Now he has a lot of friends."" St. John says that today's version of being sociable and outgoing has shifted to the digital space via social media. However, he says that most successful people weren't doing the ""social thing"" when they were younger. Instead, they kept to themselves and focused on their end-goal. St. John advises millennials to look ahead in life. He points to Google co-founder Larry Page as someone who is shy and not very social. ""That's why he was able to create Google,"" says St. John. However, he notes that there is a difference between using social media as a business tool and using it for pleasure. St. John says that young people see the Zuckerbergs of the world making so much money and don't realize how much time they spend focusing solely on their career. In 2005, he gave a TED Talk on the eight traits successful people have in common. St. John says that out the eight traits mentioned in the speech, titled ""8 Secrets of Success,"" the number one trait that millennials must cultivate is focus. ""Focus is the big one,"" he says.

She calls them non-goals, or secondary goals employees should focus on only after the main goal has been met. In order to achieve these ""non-goals,"" Facebook's leaders ""talk a lot about ruthlessly prioritizing,"" Sandberg tells LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman  in an interview for his podcast,  Masters of Scale. Despite overseeing a 20,658-person company, Sandberg says doing this is vital because Facebook has only ""so many resources."" Sandberg has championed this rule of ""ruthless prioritization"" for years now, going back to a conference in 2011. She poses a common situation: Say you have three really great ideas, but you can only do two. Which one do you settle on not doing? ""You have your goals and non-goals,"" Sandberg says.""The non-goal is the next thing that you would do, because it's a really good idea."" Separating the good ideas from the bad ideas is easy, Sandberg says, and is commonly mistaken for how you can get your priorities straight. What's tougher is actually narrowing down the good ideas you plan to take action on, she adds. That's where non-goals can help, she says. A prime example: Facebook's advertising business. Sandberg had been at Google for seven years, developing its successful online advertising program, before she was brought on to Facebook to help it  scale globally and develop its  advertising network. Sandberg tells Hoffman that for a long time, Facebook's non-goal for advertising was that ad network, which most recently earned the company $9.16 billion in the second quarter of 2017.

Arjun Kharpal,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"Huawei unveiled its first artificial intelligence (AI) chip for mobile devices on Saturday, pitting it against major players like NVIDIA, Google and potentially Apple.  The Kirin 970 is the size of a thumbnail and will support many of the AI capabilities that devices need today, such as voice interaction and image recognition.  Huawei's chip supports on-device AI. That means the AI functions are processed on the smartphone rather than in the cloud, which could speed up processes.  Manufacturers are bringing increasingly complex features to devices such as augmented reality. These require new chipsets as they advance.  Huawei could see some advantages by making their own chips. Firstly, it allows the company to control the exact design of their smartphone which could help it differentiate in a very crowded market. The Chinese firm has been making a big push in the smartphone space and is now the third-largest player in the world by market share, just behind Apple, according to research group IDC. And secondly, Huawei could potentially license this chip to other manufacturers, opening a new revenue stream.  ""The ultimate goal is to provide a significantly better user experience. The Kirin 970 is the first in a series of new advances that will bring powerful AI features to our devices and take them beyond the competition,"" Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei's Consumer Business Group, said in a press release on Saturday.

Arjun Kharpal,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"Sony launched two new smartphones on Thursday that can capture 3-D images, potentially paving the way for augmented reality, gaming and 3-D printing applications. The 5.2-inch Xperia XZ1 and 4.6-inch XZ1 compact are the Japanese electronics giant's latest devices launched into the increasingly competitive market. They come days ahead of the expected release of Apple's latest iPhone models. Key specs include: The standout feature on the smartphone is the ability to capture images in 3-D. A user opens the camera and can walk around a subject, such as a person's head or a plate of food. The software is then able to render a 3-D image that can be edited. A user can then place that 3-D image into Sony's augmented reality app. Currently, the company is looking for developers to create new applications for this. One possibility could be the ability to send the image to be 3-D printed. Gaming is another key area. A spokesperson told CNBC that the company is ""discussing possibilities"" about how 3-D capture could be used in gaming. Sony of course owns PlayStation. It's easy to imagine that this could allow users to put their own heads on game characters, something Sony could potentially monetize. Augmented reality, where digital images can be imposed onto the real world, could be big business. Apple is one company that has made itself a big player in the space, recently releasing a developer toolbox called ARKit. This allows AR apps to be created for the iPhone. Google's Project Tango and its recently launched ARCore toolkit are also rivals in the AR space. Sony could take advantage of the AR buzz in the near term. ""I think this fall AR is going to be enormous because of what Apple is doing with ARKit on the iPhone,"" Ian Fogg, head of mobile at IHS, told CNBC by phone. ""Sony has an enormous opportunity to ride on the back of Apple with 3-D capture and AR capabilities on their new smartphones because like Apple, they are using regular smartphone camera technology to do 3-D capture and augmented reality, which could be mainstream, scalable and quick to bring this to market.""

Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google has been at the forefront of research into the nascent science of artificial intelligence (AI). The company first delved into AI more than six years ago and has become one of the foremost developers of the new technology. Innovations resulting from AI have come at a fast and furious pace in recent years. Virtual assistants are found on nearly every smartphone. The self-driving cars being developed by Google's Waymo unit have moved from the drawing board to the streets, and the company is currently testing its early rider program in the Phoenix, Arizona, metro area. This year, Google's DeepMind AlphaGo computer defeated the reigning world champion in the ancient strategy game of Go -- a feat some experts had not long ago viewed as a good seven years away. Now, Google wants to imbue its artificial intelligence agents with imagination. Google wants its AI to imagine. Image source: Getty Images. The uniquely human capacity to engage in deliberate reasoning -- considering the consequences of a particular action, and then acting to influence the outcome -- is a function of imagination and a sophisticated behavior that will be necessary for future iterations of AI. The ability to determine ""how actions lead to future outcomes in order to reason and plan"" is extremely difficult for AI systems to develop, according to a blog post by scientists at DeepMind. Previous incarnations of AI have become adept at problem-solving given very specific and clearly defined sets of rules. Using advanced processors and massive number-crunching ability, they essentially sift through every possible variation to arrive at the desired outcome at lightning speeds. The real world, however, is much more complex than its digital counterpart -- messy and littered with unpredictability and complexity, which computers find hard to parse. In order for AI agents to evolve, they must be capable of imagination and reason, and have the ability to construct plans. Researchers at DeepMind believe that the solution is to train their AI to deal with imperfect models. In order to achieve this, their computers run various internal simulations or scenarios, in order to test different strategies without a clearly defined set of rules. Scientists have constructed a series of methodologies that allow systems to extract useful information from the various scenarios they imagine in order to ""evaluate the consequences of their actions before they take them."" The systems were tested against the computer puzzle game Sokoban and a spacecraft navigation game. These simulations required the AI to display reasoning and forward planning to succeed, and the system was only allowed one try to get it right, eliminating the use of trial-and-error. The AI systems imbued with imagination were able to solve 85% of the levels attempted, compared to only 60% for their less imaginative AI competitors. Giving AI systems the power of imagination. Image source: Pixabay. While this research is still ongoing, the company hasn't developed any real world applications. It is important to remember that DeepMind is engaged in pure research; Google only tries to find practical applications later. The company has been deploying AI in a great many ways to improve the customer experience, increase efficiency, and develop and improve products. One example involves the energy savings at Google's data centers. Using previously developed AI, the company introduced over 120 condition-based variables regarding its energy usage, looking for a way to increase efficiency. By regulating the servers, cooling systems, windows, and other variables, the system was able to reduce the cooling required by 40% and total energy consumption by 15%, realizing hundreds of millions of dollars in savings. We don't yet know how Google will benefit from these imagination-augmented AI's, but if history is any indication, we can scarcely imagine. ","
      
    Google Is Imagining the Next Level of Artificial Intelligence -- The Motley Fool

Andrew Tonner,09072017,Fool,08312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands unequivocally as one of the most successful tech companies of all-time. The business formerly known as Google rose from a two-person start-up operating out of a friend's garage to become one of the largest companies in the world, and it has been one of the best growth stocks to own since its 2004 IPO. GOOGL data by YCharts Today though, a small subset of analysts and tech industry experts sees increased risks facing Alphabet shares. To be clear, this is a minority opinion: 38 of the 45 analysts  covering the company rate it a buy or a strong buy. Now, it does pay to understand all aspects of an investment thesis before buying. But while one can find some valid negatives about it, my advice it to ignore these two specific reasons to sell Alphabet stock. Stocks, particularly large cap stocks like Alphabet, are upgraded and downgraded frequently, and for a whole host of reasons. Let's take as an example the downgrade of Alphabet stock from earlier this summer by boutique bank Cannacord Genuity. In the downgrade note he released in mid-June, Cannacord analyst Michael Graham voiced concerns over Alphabet's ability to continue to grow its advertising revenues in line with their historic rates. By his reckoning, Alphabet cannot continue to increase its per-ad rates, so it will need to find new sources of ""ad inventory"" -- industry parlance for places to show ads. He also noted that some investors had shown concerns over the valuation of so-called FANG stocks , an acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet). This could be the case, but it also overlooks the broader fundamentals. Good things take time. In any given year, there have been plenty of reasons to avoid owning stock in companies like Amazon, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, and countless other examples. However, focusing on near-term headwinds obscures the broader narratives that have made these companies some of the best-performing stocks over the long term. And focusing on short-term analyst downgrades is a great way to miss the forest for the trees, much to your portfolio's detriment. Image Source: Alphabet Maintaining success is a challenge in any business, but it's especially difficult to stay at the top of the food chain in the tech industry, where the pace of innovation has only accelerated in recent years.  To hold onto its position, Alphabet will need to be both a powerful incumbent and an agile innovator, a difficult and sometimes contradictory pair of tasks. The company's co-founders reorganized Google into  Alphabet in 2015  to help manage those two inherently conflicting agendas. In effect, Alphabet's Google division -- run by Sundar Pinchai -- serves as the cash cow that supports and funds Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" segment, which consists of a series of ambitious start-ups management hopes will grow into game changers in their own right over time. Such generational changes can be a double-edged sword, and that's certainly the case when it comes to Alphabet's personality shift from quirky upstart to global power. However, the fact that Alphabet is being managed more professionally doesn't mean it has lost (or will lose) either its innovative spirit or its ability to attract top talent. The company remains a staple on annual ""best places to work"" lists.  It also offers its employees the opportunity to work on some of the most popular tech products in the world, as well as the chance to invent entirely new technologies. No company is perfect, but Alphabet's track record a publicly traded operation is darn close. So while minor reasons to sell will always exist for even the best companies, long-term tech investors will be better served by remaining on focused on the big-picture narrative for Alphabet.

    2 Terrible Reasons to Sell Alphabet Stock Now -- The Motley Fool

Sean Williams,09072017,Fool,08312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Marijuana stocks are blazing hot, and it's not hard to see why. According to ArcView, a leading cannabis research firm, the compound annual growth rate for legal North American weed sales is estimated to be 26% between 2016 and 2021. In terms of numerical value, we're talking about almost $15 billion in legal sales growth as a result of ongoing legalization efforts in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S., as well as organic growth opportunities in already legal nations and states. We've also witnessed a very discernible shift toward favorability among the American public. CBS News' latest poll from April 2017 found that an all-time record number of respondents (61%) wants to see pot legal across the country. A separate study from Quinnipiac University, also this past April, found almost universal support (94%) for medical cannabis when asking if it should be legal in the United States. Image source: Getty Images. Opinions are shifting toward cannabis, sales are growing rapidly, and marijuana stock investors are profiting. Of the one dozen largest marijuana stocks by market cap, the average of these weed stocks has more than doubled in value over the trailing-12-month period. But do these rising valuations make sense? That will depend on whether these publicly traded pot stocks have the sales growth to back up their budding valuations. Today, we're going to take a look at three pure-play marijuana stocks with the highest annual sales, based on their most recent full-year earnings report. You'll note the use of ""pure play,"" meaning we're excluding publicly traded marijuana companies that only derive a portion of their revenue from legal pot. This means Scotts Miracle-Gro, which generates near 10% of its annual sales from its focus on hydroponics (growth in a nutrient-rich water solution), soil, and lighting solutions, for the medical cannabis industry won't make the cut. Neither will Insys Therapeutics, which only recently launched its oral dronabinol solution Syndros as a treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, as well as anorexia associated with AIDS. Insys relies predominantly on sales of breakthrough cancer therapy Subsys for the time being. Instead, the following three pot stocks, which all share something in common, are your true ""green giants."" Image source: Getty Images. In terms of annual sales, no marijuana stock generates more than Canadian medical cannabis grower and retailer MedReleaf (NASDAQOTH:MEDFF), which only went public about three months ago. As you'll note below, all three of the top-selling pot stocks are Canadian producers and retailers for the country's medical weed industry. MedReleaf is in fine financial shape for a number of reasons. Rather than having to effect numerous bought-deal financings that could balloon its outstanding share count, its recent initial public offering raised bountiful capital that it can use to expand its Bradford facility in Ontario. This will lead to new capacity that can help MedReleaf meet rising demand from the medical side of the equation, as well as the growing possibility that Canada may legalize recreational marijuana by July 1, 2018. In particular, MedReleaf has two advantages that have allowed it to thus far stand out from a crowded field. First, it tends to focus on higher-quality strains of cannabis, which also cost more. MedReleaf has discovered that medical pot patients will pay more for a higher-quality product, which is one reason why the company's sales more than doubled from fiscal 2016. Second, MedReleaf has a keen focus on cannabis oils. According to a company investor presentation, it controlled 44.5% of the Canadian cannabis oils market as of the fourth quarter of 2016. Cannabis oils traditionally have a higher price point and margins than dried cannabis, which has set MedReleaf up for success. Image source: Getty Images. By a seemingly razor-thin margin, Canopy Growth Corp. (NYSE:CGC) has the second-highest annual sales total at $32 million.  However, it saw considerably quicker growth than MedReleaf in its most recent fiscal year as a result of its aggressive acquisition strategy. According to its full-year report, the company's sales grew by 214% from the previous year. Canopy Growth is attempting to become the kingpin of the Canadian market by gobbling up other companies and land. Earlier this year, it completed its acquisition of Mettrum Health, which wound up giving Canopy Growth access to about half of Canada's registered medical patients. That's a sizable patient pool considering that Health Canada in May noted a 10% monthly growth rate in registered medical weed patients. It also acquired 472,000 square feet of land surrounding its headquarters, which could serve to expand its grow capacity if Canada were to legalize recreational weed. Another interesting tidbit about Canopy Growth that's helped its sales soar is the fact that it's one of just a handful of producers that's been cleared to export its cannabis to countries where medical marijuana is legal. A good example is Germany. Medical cannabis recently became legal in Germany, but domestic production is minimal, which is where Canopy Growth's exports come into play. Finally, Canopy Growth relies on branding partnerships to attract new customers. Its Tweed branding is among the most recognized in Canada, and partnerships with well-known rap artist Snoop Dogg have only aided its efforts to improve brand awareness. Image source: Getty Images. In a distant third, but growing very rapidly, is Canada's Aphria (NASDAQOTH:APHQF), which produced $16.4 million in full-year sales for fiscal 2017. Every headline figure moved in the right direction for Aphria in its latest full-year report, including 142% sales growth, 962% EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth from the previous year, a 44% decline in cash costs to produce dried cannabis, and a 670-basis-point increase in adjusted gross margin. Like MedReleaf, Aphria is trying to grow its operations primarily through organic expansion. It's in the process of working on a multiphase expansion that'll boost its growing capacity to 1 million square feet. In fact, it recently upped its projected annual output to 100,000 kilograms once its $100 million phase 4 project is complete. As with the other producers above, this project couldn't come at a better time considering the rapid growth in registered medical patients and the possibility of legal recreational pot coming to Canada by next summer. Aphria is also among that aforementioned group of companies that have been given the OK to export cannabis to foreign countries. Between demand from Europe, Canada's medical pot industry, and the possibility of a recreational legalization, Aphria and its peers may struggle to meet demand, which would have been an almost laughable scenario just a few years before.

    These 3 Pure-Play Marijuana Stocks Are Generating the Highest Annual Sales -- The Motley Fool

"Timothy Green, George Budwell, and Rich Smith",09072017,Fool,08312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There are few stocks that have been more exciting over the past few years than Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Shares of the e-commerce and cloud computing giant have soared nearly 190% over the past three years, driven higher by unrelenting revenue growth and investor euphoria. The story that Amazon is disrupting a wide variety of industries, including grocery and logistics, has proven powerful enough to make investors forget about the company's perennially meager bottom line. While it's impossible to predict which stocks will produce Amazon-like returns in the future, a few have the potential. Here's why three of our Foolish investors think shares of Universal Display Corp. (NASDAQ:OLED), Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), and Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) could surge even more than Amazon. Image source: Amazon.com. Rich Smith (Universal Display Corporation): Amazon stock has gained roughly 280% in price over the past five years. Finding a stock that can match that growth rate over the next five years won't be easy -- but I know a good place to start. According to the venerable Warren Buffett, patron saint of value investors, ""In the short term, the market is a popularity contest. In the long term, the market is a weighing machine."" And what this tells me is that Amazon's strong price performance over the past five years is more likely than not a function of its strong business performance. How strong is Amazon, you ask? According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Amazon's stock performance has been matched by growth in both sales and profits over the past five years, up 22.5% and 38.5% compounded, respectively. So how can you find stocks with similar potential for their prices to soar? I'd start by screening for businesses that have grown their sales and earnings as fast as -- or faster than -- Amazon has. Stocks like Universal Display Corporation. Over the past five years, flat screen technology specialist Universal Display has grown sales faster than Amazon (nearly 26% compounded) and shown earnings growth nearly as good as Amazon's (roughly 31%). Like Amazon, Universal Display stock sells for a premium price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio -- 93 times earnings (albeit that's only half Amazon's own P/E ratio of 181). Like Amazon, Universal Display stock is also a strong cash producer, generating roughly $86 million in positive free cash flow over the past 12 months, despite reporting earnings of $82 million. Is Universal Display stock a bargain? At these prices, it sure doesn't look like one to me. Then again, five years ago, I probably wouldn't have called Amazon stock a bargain, either (and look how that turned out). As the tech industry evolves from plasma to LED to OLED and beyond, I wouldn't put it past Universal Display to amaze investors with Amazon-like growth. Tim Green (Fitbit): Fitness wearables company Fitbit has finally unveiled its first proper smartwatch, the Ionic. The watch will retail for $300 when it launches in October, going head-to-head with the more expensive Apple Watch. New products like Ionic and wireless headphones are the key to Fitbit's turnaround strategy. There is no guarantee that Ionic will be a success. Fitbit opted to build its own operating system, which means that third-party app support will be meager at launch. Apps from Pandora, Starbucks, and AccuWeather will be available, as well as Fitbit Pay, the company's mobile payment system. But getting developers on board will be a challenge. The Ionic does have one killer feature: A battery life of 4-plus days, or 10 hours of actively using GPS or playing music. That may be enough to sway some users to opt for Fitbit's device over the alternatives. Fitbit stock has tumbled 88% since peaking in 2015. The market values the company at just $1.4 billion, less than the low-end of Fitbit's 2017 revenue guidance. Back out the net cash on the balance sheet, and the market is valuing Fitbit at just about $725 million. Expectations, in other words, are rock-bottom. If the Ionic is anything close to a success, Fitbit stock could explode higher, potentially producing Amazon-like returns. George Budwell (Novavax): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common respiratory ailment that can, on occasion, pose a serious threat to both infants and elderly adults. Unfortunately, biopharma companies have so far been unable to produce an effective prophylactic treatment for RSV for either young children or older adults. And that's why the clinical-stage vaccine-maker Novavax may turn out to be a once-in-a-lifetime type of investing opportunity. Novavax is presently attempting to development an F-protein nanoparticle RSV vaccine that can be administered in conjunction with seasonal flu shots in elderly patients, as well as a vaccine for pregnant mothers that can confer immunity to newborns during the first few months of their lives. Like most experimental RSV treatments to date, though, things haven't exactly gone to according to plan. Last year, Novavax's late-stage trial for elderly adults went off the rails due to a mild RSV season -- at least according to the company. And the vaccine's midstage maternal data weren't overwhelmingly significant. Put simply, Novavax's high-value RSV vaccine -- that could be worth billions if approved -- appears to be a long shot at best at this stage. On the flip side, if Novavax can indeed pull a proverbial rabbit out of its hat and push this vaccine across the finish line, the company's stock would undoubtedly appreciate in Amazon-like fashion from current levels. Novavax, after all, presently sports a market cap of $307 million, which is only a tiny sliver of the massive commercial opportunity presented by this unmet medical need. ","
      
    3 Stocks That Could Soar More Than Amazon -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,09072017,Fool,08312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising business is one of the fastest-growing revenue sources for the company, and it's turning out to be its next big growth product. The company recently took a major step toward growing the business by opening its self-service platform and certain ad inventory to a wider group of brands and agencies. The company has been testing its self-service platform for over a year, according to Digiday, but it's now pushing into more automated ad bidding. Self-serve platforms are the key to scaling an ad business. There's a lot of focus on Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) self-serve platform, which many investors see as the most important catalyst for increasing ad revenue for the company. Amazon's self-serve platform could do the same for its burgeoning ad business, helping it compete with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google for ad dollars. Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon's self-serve platform makes it easier for brands and agencies to manage campaigns directly. That could allow for faster feedback on advertisements across Amazon.com, IMDB.com, other Amazon-owned properties, as well as the publishing partners that work with Amazon. In June, the company launched Advertiser Audiences, a self-serve platform that allows businesses to upload a list of customer's contact information and anonymously match them to Amazon shoppers. Facebook and Google each offer similar features, including the option to target lookalike audiences based on similar behavior across their various websites, just as Amazon does. Self-serve platforms allow for more advertisers to buy more ads without the need for a sales representative to place orders. It also opens the door for smaller businesses to buy ads, since the self-serve platform costs practically the same amount for Amazon to run for a business buying $100 in advertising or $1,000,000 in advertising. The same principle has allowed Google and Facebook to attract millions of advertisers, and it's the same kind of success Snap is hoping for from its own self-serve platform. Amazon's ad business is already bringing in as much as $2.5 billion, according to an estimate from WPP's Sir Martin Sorrell. Other estimates put it well within the 10-figure mark. But as Snap and Twitter have shown it takes a lot more than direct sales to get past that level. Another big change Amazon made to its ad business this summer is opening headline search ads to brand owners. The banner ads that appeared above search results were previously exclusive to vendors (i.e., brands that sell directly to Amazon). These ad units are some of the most effective on Amazon, and opening them up to more brands should enable Amazon to fetch a higher price for some and sell more units overall. It also provides another way for third-party merchants to stand out on Amazon's marketplace. That's a big problem Amazon has had recently, as third-party merchants have started splitting inventory between Amazon and other online marketplaces. Combined with the self-serve ad targeting platform, opening the new inventory to smaller merchants can help those willing to invest the time and money to create effective ads and target audiences stand out in the crowded marketplace. Amazon's overall operating profit margin is about 2%. Its retail operations in North America take about 5% of revenue in operating income, and that's about the ceiling for its retail business. But advertising carries a much higher operating margin. Facebook reported a 45% operating margin last year. Google's operating margin was 31%. If Amazon can manage just 30% operating margin on its advertising business, it could provide a serious boost to its bottom line. Considering Analyst Brian Nowak believes Amazon's ad business could reach $5 billion next year and $7 billion in 2020, that presents a $1.5 billion to $2 billion opportunity in operating income. For reference, Amazon's operating income in 2016 was $4.2 billion. As the self-serve platform comes online and Amazon attracts more ad buyers and opens more ad inventory, it could provide a significant boost to its bottom line. ","

Magna International (NYSE:MGA), the giant auto-industry supplier, said that is has developed a new technology platform that will allow automakers to build self-driving capabilities into their vehicles. Magna joins an already-long list of companies inside and outside of the traditional auto industry that have announced plans to supply parts or systems for self-driving vehicles. Does it stand a chance of getting traction in this increasingly crowded market? Magna said that the controls for its new system can be as simple and unobtrusive as a cruise control system's. Image source: Magna International. In a statement, Magna described its new MAX4 system as a ""a fully integrated, customizable and scalable autonomous driving sensing and compute platform that can enable up to Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities in both urban and highway environments."" (You can learn more about the ""levels"" of self-driving technology here.) Its sensor suite is similar to those under development by rivals, incorporating cameras, radar, lidar units, and ultrasonic sensors. Those sensors feed signals to a dedicated computing platform. The MAX4 platform is designed in such a way that it can be easily integrated into major automakers' own systems. Magna's chief technology officer, Swamy Kotagiri, emphasized that the system won't take up significant space in the vehicle's interior or cargo compartment and won't require automakers to compromise their designs: At the heart of this development is a desire to show the market Magna's breadth of capabilities and an autonomous driving enabling platform with subsystems that do not compromise the interior and exterior of a vehicle. Our focus is on developing production-ready solutions that offer flexibility to integrate and the framework to enable Level 4 technology for when the market is ready. Magna said the MAX4 system offers automakers the option of using a simple control interface, similar to that of a traditional cruise-control system. A lighted display indicates that the vehicle is in self-driving mode, and drivers can disengage it by pressing a button or touching the brake pedal. Magna plans to share more details and will demonstrate the MAX4 system at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt, Germany, next month. Magna rival Delphi has its own advanced self-driving effort, working in partnership with chip giant Intel. Image source: Delphi Automotive. A lot of companies are gearing up to sell full or partial self-driving systems to automakers. Magna's entry may have to compete with efforts from, among others: Of course, other big auto suppliers like Delphi and Continental have the same advantages. Whether Magna's entry will shine over theirs will depend on many factors, some of which we can't judge yet. (For starters, how does its software compare?) But while Magna is hardly a tech-investor darling, it's a serious, credible player in the auto industry -- and it's a sure bet that automakers will give its system a serious look. Stay tuned.

Anders Bylund,09072017,Fool,08312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Critics of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) often point out that the e-tailer's earnings are slim and unpredictable. Hence, Amazon's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios tend to sit in the nosebleed section and make it a no-go for value investors. But earnings can be deceptive. Have you seen the size of Amazon's cash flows lately? Let me show you how Amazon's free cash flows and EBITDA profits compare to a few more traditional retailers: Company Free Cash Flows (TTM) EBITDA Earnings (TTM) Revenue (TTM) Net Income (TTM) Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) $20.3 billion $32.9 billion $490 billion $14.2 billion Amazon.com $8.8 billion $12.3 billion $150 billion $1.9 billion Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) $6.6 billion $7.3 billion $117 billion $4.3 billion Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) $2.2 billion $5.2 billion $123 billion $2.6 billion Kroger (NYSE:KR) $1.1 billion $5.5 billion $117 billion $1.6 billion Data source: Morningstar. TTM = trailing twelve months. Over the last four quarters, Amazon generated just $1.9 billion on net income from a $150 billion top-line till. That works out to a net profit margin of just 1.3% -- below every other name on the list above. From this perspective, Walgreens rules the roost with a 3.7% net margin. But the picture changes when we move over to the more cash-intensive profit metrics. About 5.9% of Amazon's revenue trickles all the way down to the free cash flow line of its financial statements. That's ahead of Walgreens' 5.6% free cash flow margin, Wal-Mart's 4.1%, Costco at 1.8%, and Kroger's barely profitable 0.9% reading. If Amazon can maintain these top-notch cash flow margins while also matching Wal-Mart's industry-leading revenue volume, the company would generate something like $29 billion in annual free cash flows. The difference is even clearer in EBITDA terms. Amazon's EBITDA margin is a lofty 8.2%, far ahead of Wal-Mart's second-place 6.7% and Walgreens' 6.2% in third place. Matching Wal-Mart's revenue to Amazon's EBITDA margin, you'd get a hypothetical annual EBITDA profit of $40.2 billion. Image source: Amazon. You could see my hypothetical margin-plus-revenue combos as a measure of Amazon's mighty cash machine, or as an opportunity for other retailers to widen their margins. Either way, it's clear that Amazon is doing something very right here -- it just doesn't show up in ordinary headline fodder like bottom-line earnings and the related P/E ratio. I would argue that Amazon is doing an excellent job of limiting its tax bills while producing stupendous amounts of cash profits. Furthermore, Amazon is doing this while also producing some terrific top-line growth. And that's not a new phenomenon; Amazon's revenue growth has been outpacing the industry for years: AMZN Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. So what do you get when you pair industry-leading cash margins with equally fantastic sales growth? In my eyes, that combination builds a shareholder-friendly cash machine for the ages.

Warren Buffett recently told a group of investors that it was difficult to find bargain stocks at this point in the bull market. That's pretty easy to agree with. One, he's Warren Buffett. Two, the depth of the Great Recession was 101 months ago now, and the market seems to be touching new highs with regular frequency. However, although it may be more difficult to find cheap stocks trading at bargain prices, that doesn't mean the opportunities don't exist. Investors looking for cheap stocks to buy today should give a closer look to Pacific Ethanol (NASDAQ:PEIX), Venator Materials (NYSE:VNTR), and General Motors (NYSE:GM). Image source: Getty Images. The United States will produce about 16 billion gallons of ethanol this year. Pacific Ethanol will contribute about 605 million gallons of that, which ranks pretty highly among the top producers in the country. Only four companies boast capacities exceeding 1 billion gallons per year. That's important because scale is certainly needed to profitably compete in today's industry. Unfortunately, most producers struggled in the second quarter of 2017 due to excess production and high national inventories. Pacific Ethanol stock wasn't spared. PEIX data by YCharts. While there are some shorter-term obstacles to consider, the long-term future for ethanol looks pretty bright. The U.S. is the only country capable of feeding the world's growing appetite for renewable fuels. Indeed, exports are on pace to hit record levels in 2017, and that's before several terminals come on line in the next few quarters. In addition to strong macro drivers, Pacific Ethanol stock is supported by quite a few attractive tangible and intangible metrics. The company has been investing in cleaning up the balance sheet, lowering production costs, and diversifying into higher-margin revenue streams including beverage alcohol in recent years. The improvements were largely hidden in the second quarter of 2017, but investors shouldn't overlook the potential. Pacific Ethanol stock is trading at just 8.6 times forward earnings, 0.13 times sales, and 0.55 times book value. When all of its cost reduction measures are fully implemented -- expected to occur by the beginning of 2018 -- shareholders could be treated to $0.46 per share of additional income per year. It has reported earnings per share of negative $0.31 in the last 12 months. Several ethanol stocks look pretty cheap today, but Pacific Ethanol may have the most to gain in the next 24 months. Venator Materials is the newest titanium stock you can buy. That's because it was recently spun out from Huntsman Corporation ahead of the former parent's merger with Clariant. But timing is at once the biggest boon and biggest obstacle for this cheap stock. Why? Selling prices for titanium dioxide -- the company's main product -- have been booming in recent months. Peers Chemours Co. and Kronos Worldwide have seen their stocks soar in 2017 as a result. However, Venator Materials is still in the process of shedding some of the cost and operational inefficiencies from being part of a much larger company, which has kept it from enjoying titanium dioxide's recovery thus far. KRO data by YCharts. That could be about to change. Venator Materials quietly published its second-quarter 2017 financial results with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Aug. 28. Operating income swung from a loss of $22 million in the year-ago period to a profit of $59 million this year. That resulted in an operating margin of 10% for the quarter. While certainly a solid improvement, the performance of peers suggests there's plenty of room to run. Kronos Worldwide and Chemours Co. reported second-quarter 2017 operating margins of 15.8% and 16.2%, respectively. Wall Street seems to agree that better days are ahead. Analysts think Venator Materials stock is trading at just 8.3 times future earnings. Kronos Worldwide and Chemours Co. trade at 12.9 times and 10.4 times future earnings, respectively. That hints that this is the cheapest way to own a piece of the titanium bull market that has been years in the making. General Motors has announced consistent earnings growth in recent quarters, which has pushed the stock up from its early January 2016 lows. Although the price-to-earnings ratio has risen as a result, it's still at historically low levels. Today, the American auto leader trades at just 5.7 times earnings. Wall Street's earnings expectations for the next 12 months puts the stock at only 6.0 times future earnings. GM data by YCharts. Why is the stock so cheap? Good question. It likely has to do with questions about whether the current cycle for the auto industry has peaked. There's a strong argument that that is indeed the case. However, General Motors (and other American automakers) has been preparing its balance sheet and operations for the next downturn. Management thinks it can weather a 25% drop in new-car sales while maintaining profitable operations and the current dividend, which yields a gaudy 4.2%. If you're looking for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to buy a leading American business, then this may be your chance. ","

Stocks tumbled Tuesday on concerns over tensions with North Korea and fears that Hurricane Irma could hit Florida and the U.S. Southeast. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) fell more than 230 points and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) was down over 1% at one point, though it recovered somewhat during the afternoon. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Gold rose sharply as investors fled to safety. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSEMKT:GLD) gained 1.1%. Among the significant news items for individual stocks, United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) announced it is buying Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL), and H.B. Fuller Company (NYSE:FUL) added another adhesive company to its portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. United Technologies announced on Monday an agreement to purchase Rockwell Collins in a $30 billion deal that will create a giant supplier to the aerospace industry. The buyer will pay $23 billion in cash and United Technologies stock, and assume $7 billion in Rockwell Collins debt in order to create an aerospace systems business that the company expects to generate $8.4 billion in revenue in 2017. United Technologies stock fell 5.7% on the news, while Rockwell Collins rose 0.2%. The combination will create a business unit that will extend United Technologies' offerings from its Pratt and Whitney jet engine unit and UTC Aerospace Systems division with complementary products in avionics, navigation, integrated flight decks, and aircraft interior offerings from Rockwell Collins. The company expects the acquisition to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share in the first full year after the deal closes, but maintained previous guidance for 2017 EPS. Annual cost savings of $500 million are expected to materialize within four years after the merger. ""This acquisition adds tremendous capabilities to our aerospace businesses and strengthens our complementary offerings of technologically advanced aerospace systems,"" said UTC Chairman and CEO Greg Hayes in the press release. The market appeared unimpressed by the deal, which gives the company increased scale but potentially raises issues with its aircraft customers, who could become concerned about consolidation among suppliers. Further, the high price of the purchase will put some financial strains on United Technologies, which announced it will suspend previously announced share buybacks for three to four years and issue $14 billion of new debt. Rockwell Collins stock closed 6.5% below the deal price of $140 per share, perhaps indicating that investors were unsure whether the deal will pass regulatory hurdles. Shares of adhesives maker H.B. Fuller jumped 2.4% on the news it is acquiring privately held Royal Adhesives & Sealants in a $1.575 billion cash deal. Royal is a top-10, pure-play adhesives and sealant company that specializes in adhesives for durable assembly, construction products, and engineering applications that Fuller expects will produce $650 million in revenue and $120 million in free cash flow in 2017. The addition of Royal to Fuller's $2.2 billion product portfolio will create a shift toward higher-value, higher-margin products, and improve the company's cash flow generation, according to management. ""This accretive acquisition accelerates realization of our 2020 strategic objective to focus and grow in engineering adhesives and other highly specified market segments, while exceeding our targeted cash flow, EPS and EBITDA margin targets,"" said CEO Jim Owens in the press release. The move was well received by the market. Management projects the combined company to produce $1 billion in free cash flow in the first three years which is a considerable improvement on the $196 million Fuller generated in 2016. This deal follows the smaller acquisitions of Brazilian adhesives company Adecol in July and Wisdom Worldwide Adhesives in January . ","

Shares of home technology company Alarm.com (NASDAQ:ALRM) increased nicely in August, gaining 18.1% during the month, according to data by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The stock's gain helped extend the stock's great year so far. Shares are up more than 60% year to date. Investor optimism toward Alarm.com in August was likely primarily spurred by the company's second-quarter results, which included better-than-expected revenue and adjusted EPS. In addition, investors were likely pleased with Alarm.com's move to raise its outlook for the year. Image source: Getty Images. In Alarm.com's second quarter, which the company reported on Aug. 8, the connected home security and automation company saw its revenue increase 33% year over year to $86 million. In addition, Alarm.com's non-GAAP EPS was $0.33, up significantly from $0.15 in the year-ago quarter. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) and license revenue was a key catalyst during the quarter, soaring 40% year over year to $58.9 million. This revenue, however, included the first full quarter of revenue from Alarm.com's recently acquired business unit, Connect. Thanks to strong growth trends in its SaaS and license segment, Alarm.com said in its second-quarter report that it now expects full-year revenue between $326.3 million and $327.8 million, up from a previous guidance range of 322.7 million and $225.7 million. Increased profitability has also led Alarm.com to increase its guidance for non-GAAP net income. Management now expects full-year non-GAAP net income between $47.5 million and $48.3 million, up significantly from a previous guidance range of $36.5 million and $37.5 million. ","

Don’t let the door hit you on the way out. “The summer break sees investors returning to markets not looking much different from when they left,” Mark Tinker, head of AXA IM Framlington Equities Asia, has been telling clients. Look to the numbers for rationale behind a lack of cheering for this month. The S&P 500 is set to snap a four-month winning streak, with a 0.5% drop for August in what would be the biggest monthly loss of the year. The Dow industrials, meanwhile, has been spinning its wheels. That’s as some say September can be lousy for stocks. Check out: 5 charts show there was no summer lull on Wall Street in August The best August may have to offer is the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which is set to gain an equally unimpressive 0.3%, after a 3.4% rally in July. But while some shine has come off the sector this month, it seems a spark may have been ignited in the waning days of summer.

Lyons has been tracking so-called trendlines — lines on a chart that connect either a rising series of lows (trendline up) or declining series of highs (trendline down). What Alphabet’s chart below is now telling him is that the company is gearing up for another “successful test of its long-term up trendline.” That trendline started at the July 2015 low, and has connected the dots to around a dozen lows since then, including Wednesday’s bounce off $905 a share, Lyons says. The corresponding trendline in GOOGL is around $920, as of Thursday. Where now? “First off, as long as the trendline holds, expect GOOG to remain on the rise and a leader in this rally. Furthermore, as long as the rally leaders are still moving higher, a significant decline remains doubtful,” said Lyons. Read the full post here.

Both sides are said to be eager to come to an agreement — Facebook, so it doesn’t have to bother taking down videos that infringe on copyrights and deal with the legal issues, and the music industry so that it gets some form of payment. Facebook is said to be working on software that will flag music that violates copyrights, but Bloomberg reported such a system may be two years from launch. Until that time, music executives are said to grudgingly accept the fact that infringing content will be posted regardless of their efforts, so are looking to get compensated rather than spending their resources tracking down offenders. An agreement would also boost Facebook’s efforts to rival YouTube, a unit of Alphabet Inc.’s

Video shows the South Lyon mother, 51, pulling a gun on the two Farmington Hills women after they began grabbing her daughter’s hair over the item. Police said the South Lyon woman had a valid concealed pistol license and that the gun was loaded, but there was no round in the chamber.

Max A. Cherney,09072017,MarketWatch,08312017,"Published: Sept 5, 2017 6:58 a.m. ET Exclusive investor documents show complicated business of Eaze, the dominant weed-delivery offering in California By Cannabis delivery startup Eaze Solutions Inc. has a lofty goal: By fiscal year 2020, it expects to ship the rough equivalent of a 33-foot-cube of marijuana — nearly three joints for every registered voter in the U. S. — to weed fans in America’s legal markets. The goal of moving the equivalent of $1 billion in cannabis and related products in a year has led the company to burn about $1 million a month as it aggressively expands into markets that have, in some cases, proved costly, according to information provided to potential investors and exclusively obtained by MarketWatch. The documents render a snapshot of a company wrestling with complex, often difficult regulations, that’s pushing the boundaries of what’s legal in a market where the laws are changing rapidly and causing uncertainty about the potential for investments. When contacted about this story, Eaze Chief Marketing Officer Stephen Matt wrote in an emailed statement, “While we don’t disclose revenue or discuss future plans, the marijuana industry is incredibly promising, and presents an opportunity that innovators, investors and policy makers alike are excited about.” Born in 2014, Eaze’s origin sounds similar to startup success stories such as Airbnb and Uber, and like those two it also claims to only produce tech that connects people, rather than selling pot itself. Founder and former chief executive Keith McCarty used his own money to launch the company from his San Francisco apartment with four employees and the idea of promising delivery of medical marijuana within minutes.

Since its humble beginnings, Eaze has developed an expansive delivery footprint in California that has given it a dominant position and attracted outside investment. It has banked $24.5 million in venture funding from investors including rapper and entrepreneur Snoop Dogg’s Casa Verde Capital LLC, as well as a number of well-known Silicon Valley venture-capital firms. It now seeks an additional $25 million in funding, according to the investor deck. Heralded by the tech trade press as the Uber of pot, Eaze has expanded alongside the legal market, which has reached $6 billion in annual sales across the country, according to a report from Cowen and Co. Marijuana continues to be classified by the federal government as a Schedule I drug, along with heroin, LSD and ecstasy. As a result, federal law requires banks to report any marijuana-related transactions as suspicious activity, which could open them up to seizure by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. . Despite federal prohibitions, Eaze now operates in more than 100 cities as executives leverage generous promotions, fierce expansion and, per several sources, hardhearted negotiation tactics. It also launched a line of vaporizers, is planning to create private-label cannabis brands, and offers low-cost marijuana recommendations under EazeMD. Don’t miss: Marijuana experts question how industry will mature as full legalization lags Yet on-demand pot delivery has not blossomed to the same extent as the total marijuana market. The practice is banned outright in some states where recreational pot sales are legal, such as Colorado and Washington. Where it is legal, such as in Eaze’s home state of California, delivery is something of a work in progress, with regulations resembling a motley patchwork ranging from pot-friendly to effective prohibition. Eaze claims in its pitch deck to potential investors that it will expand to one of the markets on the more negative side of that scale this year: Los Angeles, a city that has banned delivery outright. Los Angeles officials did not sit idly by as other delivery companies attempted to make bank on clandestine sales, squashing or muscling out several upstarts, and the pitch to investors did not give insight into how Eaze will avoid the same treatment. But Eaze’s forays into other areas in Southern California show that regulatory roadblocks may not be the only issue that keeps Eaze from succeeding. The massive costs of 20-minute delivery The promise of marijuana delivered within 20 minutes, while attractive to customers, has pushed per-delivery costs in Orange County to top out at $27, MarketWatch has learned. Delivery costs matter to Eaze. It does not charge for delivery but rather takes a cut from each sale that it looks to recognize in its financials as a technology fee, so large delivery fees on small purchases of pot can add up to big losses. “In some of these markets, it can be prohibitively expensive to be sending drivers out to only be doing one or two transactions in an hour,” said Morgan Pahxia, managing director at Poseidon Asset Management LLC, an asset-management company that focuses exclusively on the marijuana industry. “That’s just crazy. You have to be at such high velocity.” Orange County is something of an outlier, as per-market delivery costs can drop to as low as $6 in tightly-packed urban areas such as San Francisco — the second densest city in the U. S. — and the midrange for many markets Eaze operates sits between $8 and $12 per delivery, averaging about $9 to $10 across all its markets in the Golden State. Opinion: How investors can separate the winners from the losers in the marijuana industry Khaled Naim, CEO of Onfleet, a company that makes delivery-logistics software, says costs in the $6 to $12 range are not outrageous, likening pot to the economics of alcohol and pharmaceuticals delivery, both of which can be profitable with those delivery costs. “With a 30% margin, you can easily do a couple of deliveries in an hour in a big enough market with a good enough product.” Yet Eaze’s cost of revenue and operations dig deeply into its bottom line. According to the pitch deck, the company expects a $12 million loss before interest and taxes in fiscal year 2017, widening from $8 million in 2016. The costs, broadly, are broken into two segments: cost of revenue, which will grow to $16.8 million this fiscal year compared with $7.1 million in 2016, and operating expenses, which it expects to widen to $14 million from $9.5 million in 2016. While not as unmanageable as the Orange County costs, the money Eaze must spend to deliver marijuana in other cities will still make turning a profit difficult without immense expansion. “Delivery is a tough business, ask anyone even in mainstream industries. You have to be a large company, which can only be done at scale — which Eaze is trying to do,” said Ben Larson, co-founder of Gateway Incubator, a marijuana startup accelerator. “But this isn’t pizza delivery…[regulations] are going to drive up the cost of delivery. It’s going to be very slim margins, and so what I think it’s going to do is to drive the company to add other revenue models.” ‘It still kind of feels like a drug deal’ To some extent, Eaze looks to be moving toward alternative revenue streams. Its vaporizer cartridge line is one example, reaching $1 million in sales within four months of launch, according to the investor deck. It’s less clear what the potential returns for its coming private-label brand will be, but the deck says that it can “fill gaps in the market” and that because there are no marketing or distribution costs, Eaze will receive a higher retail margin and can scale quickly. What’s clear from the investor materials is that Eaze’s revenue has been climbing steadily: Executives forecast a 112% rise to $18 million in fiscal year 2017, from $8.5 million in 2016. Between 2015 and 2016, revenue rose 118%. See also: Marijuana industry could be worth $50 billion annually by 2026 Eaze’s expanding losses despite the revenue gains may be one of the reasons the company’s founding CEO, McCarty, ceded the top boss job to another ex-Yammer employee, Jim Patterson, in 2016. It also may be why the company is seeking new funding, as well as its expansion plans for Los Angeles and the rest of the state as California prepares for recreational legalization to take effect in 2018. But for pot businesses, regardless of the fact that Eaze says it’s a tech company, raising more cash is not a by-the-numbers operation as with other entirely legal startups. “One thing different for this industry, is that it’s very undercapitalized,” said Pahxia. “There’s no guarantee the next round of funding is there.” Even if it can get enough funding and avoid regulatory challenges to keep growing, Eaze will still have to overcome the economics of the industry to become profitable, investors say. As the industry matures and products and services become more alike, says Larson, the economics around marijuana farmers and retail operations, including Eaze, will tighten. “As the industry grows and becomes more efficient and things become commoditized, [pot growers and retail] will be the two endpoints that get pinched the most,” said Larson. “Dispensaries and grows are historically not just very scalable businesses, and if they are it’s at very low margins. And I think that’s where Eaze will find themselves, especially if they haven’t built a strong brand.” Read also: Pot paradise planned as cannabis company buys California town If Eaze is able to build a profitable business out of delivering marijuana, it could be in danger of larger, more established businesses butting in to the industry. At least in the near term, Eaze likely will not have to fight with existing delivery businesses such as GrubHub Inc.

I’ve done Eaze orders here and there, and it still kind of feels like a drug deal.” ",The startup burning $1 million a month in hopes of selling $1 billion of pot a year - MarketWatch

The moves in the latter have been so dramatic that it seems reasonable to ask: what will come first, Dow 30,000 or bitcoin at $30,000? What will happen first? Those targets would represent vastly different growth stories. The Dow Jones Industrial Average

                                   is currently trading around 22,000, meaning it would need to rise about 36.5% to hit that milestone. Bitcoin

Is that an insurmountable hurdle? With bitcoin it can be hard to tell. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has been on a blinding rally lately: over the past 12 months it has soared more than 700%—a repeat of that over the next 12 would be enough to cross the finish line. In 2017 so far it has gained more than 400%, and it nearly doubled in the month of August alone. Those sharp gains, however, have come with some equally sharp pullbacks, and because bitcoin lacks the traditional valuation metrics of stocks, a target of $300 is arguably just as plausible as $30,000.

This metric suggests there’s more room to grow Don’t miss: Bitcoin rises, so people Google ‘bitcoin,’ so then bitcoin rises, so then people Google… Such gains are rare in any kind of investment vehicle, and charges that bitcoin is in a bubble have dogged the $80.6 billion digital currency for ages. Aaron Lasher, co-founder of Breadwallet, recently said that “this bull market will likely be followed by a pretty brutal bear market,” though he added that the currency’s market cap could reach $5 trillion over the next 10 years. That is trillion with a T—meaning it would boast a market capitalization bigger than any company in history, ever, one several times the current size of Apple Inc.

Read: Here’s how bitcoin is dwarfing housing and dot-com bubbles On the stocks side, the Dow has gained 11.3% thus far this year, a solid pace, and like bitcoin it has hit its own notable milestones, having first topped 20,000 in January. While the gap the blue-chip average to close to hit 30,000 is smaller, its outlook is no less uncertain. Read: What Dow 20,000 means for stock-market investors Like bitcoin, the Dow’s gains have been accompanied by concerns that prices have gotten too elevated. The U.S. market is the world’s most expensive, by one calculation, and few expect that the coming years will see Wall Street deliver the kind of returns it did in the wake of the financial crisis recovery. That said, the Dow’s 30 components mean it is a comparably more diversified average than bitcoin, which could protect it from downside, and it has historically done better than the stock market overall, as measured against the S&P 500

There was no settlement for oil and gasoline Monday because of the Labor Day holiday. “What happens next in the energy markets will be all about how quickly the refineries come back online, and when downstream operations are restored to normal,” Tyler Richey, co-editor of the Sevens Report. “If the damage keeps refineries shut, expect further volatility and notable strength in the refined products, while a return to normal operations would be demand-side bullish for oil, and would see the products’ bid unwind.” As of late Sunday, about 17% of total U.S. refinery capacity remained shut, according to S&P Global Platts. Motiva Enterprises’s Port Arthur, Texas refinery, the nation’s largest, is in the initial phases of a refinery start up, according to a company statement Tuesday. Motiva expects the refinery to initially return to approximately 40% production by the end of this weekend. Demand for crude is set to rise as refinery capacity recovers, while the shortage that has buoyed gasoline prices is likely to ease. Analysts at Commerzbank pointed out that Labor Day marked the end of the summer driving season in the U.S., “so the market focus is likely to move away from gasoline again.” “Generally speaking, little attention should be paid in the next few weeks to reports of crude and oil product stocks and trade given the numerous short-term disruptions,” they said. Inventory data for last week will be published by the American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday, delayed a day due to the holiday. Official supply figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are slated for Thursday. Meanwhile, Hurricane Irma in the Atlantic is bearing down, “and if the expected track begins to favor a Gulf landfall, expect speculation bids to come flowing into the energy space again, including natural gas, which traded well last week on the weather-related drama and a less-reported bullish development in supply,” said Richey. For now, forecasters expect the storm to affect Florida.

Robert Powell,09072017,MarketWatch,08312017,"Published: Sept 1, 2017 4:32 p.m. ET By Question: I am 60 and my husband is 56. Does it make more sense for me to begin collecting at 62 instead of waiting until I am 66? I figured I could be collecting for eight years because when I turn 70, he will be 66 and at that time I can collect 1/2 of his which is much more than mine would be at my full retirement age. My math shows it is beneficial but I would like your advice. Also, if I did collect at 62, what is the maximum I can make at my job to continue working? Answer: So, here’s what David Cechanowicz, a senior financial planner with REDW Stanley Financial Advisors, had to say: The question of when and how to file for Social Security benefits is linked to a host of issues that are unique to each claimant. In your question you gave me a slight glimpse of some of the data, but not enough to give you a definitive answer. To set the stage, all of the following can have a significant impact on the retirement claiming question. Health — The issue of health and longevity is foundational to answering the question of when should I claim my Social Security retirement benefits. Closely linked are questions that focus on the state of your personal finances, your willingness and or ability to work, and the amount of other assets or sources of income that you might have to supplement your income in retirement. Also, the amount of your own retirement benefit, and the amount of possible spousal and or retirement benefits that you may be entitled to factor into the equation. Assuming that you were born in 1957, your full retirement age is 66 and 6 months, and your husband’s full retirement age is 67. For both of you, claiming early will represent a significant reduction in benefits from those available at full retirement age, or afterword, for those who can wait for delayed retirement credits. From what you have told us, you will reach your own full retirement age during the year that your husband turns 62. At that time, if he has filed for benefits, you will be eligible for 50% of his primary insurance amount, or the benefit that he will collect when he turns age 67. It is important to note that you will be eligible for half of his full retirement benefit, even if he claims his benefits at age 62. That is because you will have reached your own full retirement benefit at that time. However, if he waits to claim his benefits at his full retirement age, you will not be able to claim a spousal benefit on his work record. A financial planner that I reached out to suggests that your instinct about claiming early is probably going to be your best choice. Since your husband’s earliest retirement age coincides with your own full retirement age, and if you don’t run into the earnings test, then you will probably be best off claiming early, especially if he claims early as well. The earnings test that you asked about is indexed for inflation and will be higher than the number for 2017. For this year, for every two dollars that you earn over $16,920 would require you to give back one dollar of Social Security benefits. Sometimes it will still make sense to be subject to the earnings test for individuals who end up giving back only a small part of their Social Security benefit. For example, assume a retirement benefit in 2017 of $600 a month and a worker who is between the ages of age 62 and 65. (In other words, working in other than the year that he or she reaches full retirement age. In that year the exempt amount rises to $44,880. Additionally, a worker gives up one dollar of Social Security for every three dollars of income above the exempt amount.) In that case, you could work for the entire year and earn $23,000, and end up still getting Social Security checks for the last six months of the year of approximately $600 a month.

Read now: Germany’s Lidl could shake up crowded U.S. grocery sector “Several variables are at play including value players expanding their presence in the U.S., the growth of store brands and the explosion of e-commerce and meal delivery services disrupting the market,” she told analysts, according to a FactSet transcript. “We expect conditions to remain hyper competitive for the foreseeable future.” U.S. soup sales fell 1% in fiscal 2017, but the outlook is less promising. Morrison said the company has been unable to reach agreement with a large customer on a promotional program for soup and as a result, it expects soup sales to decline in fiscal 2018. “Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect the operating environment to remain difficult,” she said. “We will continue to position Campbell for long-term growth by managing costs aggressively and re-investing a portion of those savings back in the business with a focus on our strategic imperatives of real food, digital and e-commerce, health and well-being, and snacking.” Read:  Amazon is actually the weakest of the big U.S. retailers, Moody’s says Also:  Buy Amazon because it isn’t pulling an Apple, analyst says The Camden, N.J. -based company said it had net income of $318 million, or $1.04 a share, in the quarter, after a loss of $81 million, or 26 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 52 cents, below the FactSet consensus of 55 cents. Sales edged down to $1.664 billion from $1.687 billion, also below the FactSet consensus of $1.690 billion. The company is now expecting fiscal 2018 sales to range from down 2% to flat. Adjusted EPS is expected to be flat to up 2%, or range from $3.04 to $3.11. The FactSet consensus for sales indicates growth of about 7%, while the EPS consensus is $3.05. Morrison said sales of global biscuits and snacks were soft in the quarter, but generated a double-digit earnings increase. Americas Simple Meals and Beverages were “in line with the categories in which we compete”, while Campbell Fresh sales rose slightly. Campbell Fresh, which includes Bolthouse Farms beverages, salad dressings and carrots, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and dips and fresh soup, had a disappointing quarter, said Morrison, but she is encouraged by progress made in addressing execution issues. The division has been hurt in recent quarters by weak carrot growing seasons, a recall of protein drinks and capacity constraints. Morrison said the company is still expecting the division to return to profitable growth in fiscal 2018. The company is working to collaborate with key customers on merchandising and improving data-driven shopper insights. It has also set up a distinct digital e-commerce business to address pure play and omni-channel opportunities. “Make no mistakes. These shifts are accelerating and converging, and they’re having a dramatic impact on Campbell and across the industry,” she said.
