Shares of the company, which was targeted by activist fund Elliott Management, rose 6.2 percent to $52.95 in morning trading on Tuesday. The company, which provides research and software tools as well as consulting services to healthcare and education firms, said it would sell its education business for $1.55 billion and its healthcare business for $1.3 billion, including debt. The sale of the education business is expected to close by the end of this year or in early 2018, after which Advisory Board will merge its healthcare unit with Optum, the company said. Insurer UnitedHealth’s Optum business, which manages drug benefits and offers healthcare data analytics services, will also acquire Advisory Board’s equity interest in healthcare technology provider Evolent Health Inc. “It’s a smart, congruent and synergistic acquisition (for UnitedHealth),” Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick wrote in a note. The combined deal would give Advisory Board’s shareholders about $54.29 per share in cash, including a fixed amount of $52.65 per share and the after-tax value of its 7.6 percent stake in Evolent, at closing. Advisory Board said in February it would explore options, including a sale of part or the entire company, after activist fund Elliott Management said the company’s stock was “significantly undervalued”. Elliott had a nearly 5 percent stake in the company as of June 30, according to Thomson Reuters data. On Tuesday, Advisory Board said Elliott agreed to vote in favor of the deals. “Given that the company went through a detailed - and fairly lengthy - sales process, we do not believe that other bidders will emerge for the asset,” William Blair analyst Ryan Daniels said in a client note. Goldman Sachs & Co and Allen & Co were financial advisers to Advisory Board, while Skadden served as legal adviser. Evercore and Macquarie Capital were the financial advisers to Vista Equity Partners, while Kirkland & Ellis LLP was its legal adviser. ","

 ,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ohio’s Department of Insurance said on Thursday that non-profit managed care company CareSource will sell health plans in Paulding County next year - the last county in the United States that would have been without Obamacare individual coverage in 2018. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said on Wednesday that only Paulding County in northwestern Ohio was projected to be a “bare county” with no insurers in 2018, while 1,478 counties could have only one issuer next year. Just a month ago, CMS said there were 40 counties projected to have no insurers next year. Health insurers are facing an upheaval in their businesses amid growing uncertainty about healthcare legislation under President Donald Trump, who seeks to follow through on his promise to dismantle former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. Insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc have exited most of the states where they sold Obamacare plans, leaving hundreds of U.S. counties at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018. But other insurers, like Centene Corp, have filled those gaps, expanding into new counties that had lost their coverage options. In June, Centene said it would enter into three new states and would expand operations in six existing markets in 2018. ","

 ,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis’s new gene-modifying cancer therapy’s $475,000-per-patient sticker price has drawn fire from advocate groups calling for cheaper drugs, but analysts said the Swiss drugmaker could initially struggle to break even. In a first for gene therapy in the United States, regulators approved Kymriah on Wednesday for patients up to 25 years of age who have relapsed or not been helped by previous treatment for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). While patient groups hailed the potent immunotherapy as a potential cancer game-changer, the Swiss drugmaker was also criticized for setting a price that places Kymriah among the most-expensive drugs ever. It trails only a couple of gene therapies for ulta-rare diseases. Since taxpayers have chipped in more than $200 million over the years for related research — much early work on the drug was done at the University of Pennsylvania — Novartis should have used more restraint, the Patients for Affordable Drugs lobby group said. “We believe it is excessive,” said David Mitchell, a cancer patient who founded the group. “Novartis should not get credit for bringing a $475,000 drug to market and claiming they could have charged people a lot more.” Novartis estimates that only 600 ALL patients a year would be eligible for Kymriah, making the initial pool for the treatment relatively scarce and worth less than $300 million. The company is also targeting the several thousand people a year who have relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) diagnosed, but it will not file Kymriah for that group until later this year. BREAK-EVEN POINT? Success with those patients is key to Novartis turning Kymriah into the $1 billion-a-year blockbuster drug the Swiss company predicts it will eventually become, but analysts say it is anyone’s guess when it will start covering its costs. “It is not clear what the break-even point for profitability is, as this is a very capital intensive endeavor,” said Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson, adding that Novartis is likely to cut the price of Kymriah for DLBCL patients. On Thursday Novartis said that its cost of goods per Kymriah treatment is confidential commercial information, but analysts estimate it could be as high as $200,000. The process is complex. Doctors remove T cells from each cancer victim and ship the material to its factory in Morris Plains, New Jersey. After re-engineering them to attack cancer, frozen cells are returned a couple weeks later for reinfusion into patients. Additionally, Novartis partner Oxford BioMedica, which supplies a key ingredient, may be due $100 million over the next three years, plus royalties on sales. Furthermore, competition is on the horizon. Gilead Sciences this week announced an $11.9 billion deal to buy Kite Pharma to gain access to a similar drug, while Bluebird Bio and Juno Therapeutics are all working on their own CAR-T therapies. While Kymriah’s price tag will grab headlines, it pales in comparison with some other gene therapy treatments. For instance, UniQure’s Glybera, for a very rare blood disorder, runs at about $1 million per patient. Meanwhile, GlaxoSmithKline’s Strimvelis, for so-called “bubble boy” disease, comes in at about $700,000 per patient. Novartis points out that some groups think the company could actually have charged more for Kymriah. British health authorities, for instance, had said that up to $650,000 might have been justified if the treatment added years to children’s lives. Novartis plans to charge insurers and payers only when the drug proves to be effective one month into treatment, a so-called “outcome-based” pricing scheme that puts some of the risk of the drug on its manufacturer. Even so, analysts hardly expect that to shield Novartis from criticism. “Expect turbulent public discussions on drug pricing, demonstrating that the road to hell is paved with good intentions,” said Bruno Bulic of equity research firm Baader Helvea. Bulic forecasts that Kymriah will start adding to Novartis’s bottom line only after 2019, when it is expected to be given to more patient groups. ","

 ,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has been investigating how Bloomberg Philanthropies, founded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, funds local non-profit groups for anti-tobacco lobbying, government documents show, making it the latest foreign non-government organization to come under scrutiny. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has since 2014 tightened surveillance of non-profit groups, saying they were acting against India’s national interests. Thousands of foreign-funded charities’ licenses have been canceled for misreporting donations. Critics, however, say the government has used the foreign funding law as a tool to silence non-profit groups which have raised concerns about the social costs of India’s rapid economic development. The intelligence wing of India’s home ministry last year drafted a note on Bloomberg Philanthropies, raising concerns that the foundation was running a campaign to “target” Indian tobacco businesses and “aggressively” lobby against the sector. Though the three-page note, reviewed by Reuters, said the Bloomberg initiative’s “claimed intention to free India of tobacco cannot be faulted” given the known risks from tobacco, it highlighted the sector’s importance, noting it brings in nearly $5 billion in annual revenue for governments, and provides a livelihood for millions of people. “Foreign interests making foreign contributions ... for purposes of lobbying against an established economic activity raises multiple concerns,” the note said, including, it said, an “adverse economic impact” on 35 million people. The June 3, 2016 note, marked “SECRET” and circulated to top government officials, including in Modi’s office, has not previously been reported. The probe continued until at least April this year, another government document showed. Rebecca Carriero, a spokeswoman for Michael Bloomberg and New York-based Bloomberg Philanthropies, declined to comment as they were unaware of any investigation. A home ministry spokesman said “queries which relate to security agencies cannot be answered.” Modi’s office did not respond to an email seeking comment. The ministry’s note was one of the factors behind the rejection of a foreign funding license renewal of at least one Bloomberg-funded India charity last October, said a senior government official aware of the investigation. Michael Bloomberg, one of the world’s richest people and a former New York City Mayor, has committed nearly $1 billion to support global tobacco control efforts. One of his focus countries is India, where tobacco kills 900,000 people a year. Other than funding Indian NGOs, Bloomberg’s charity has in the past worked on improving road safety and supported federal tobacco-control efforts. In 2015, Modi called Michael Bloomberg a “friend”, and the two agreed on working together on India’s ambitious plan to build so-called smart cities. The home ministry note said the Bloomberg charity successfully lobbied for the introduction of bigger health warnings on cigarette packs, “contrary” to the recommendations of a parliamentary panel. While the panel called for the size of warnings to be more than doubled to 50 percent of a pack’s surface area, the health ministry sought a higher figure of 85 percent. Despite protests from India’s $10 billion cigarette industry, the Supreme Court last year ordered manufacturers to follow the more stringent health ministry rules. That, the note said, was the first of the three-phase Bloomberg campaign targeting India’s tobacco industry. It did not explain how exactly the Bloomberg charity lobbied. While the note mirrored some of India’s tobacco lobby’s positions - such as how anti-smoking policies could adversely impact farmers - the government official said the investigation was not done at the behest of the industry. “Anti-tobacco lobby wants to kill revenue generating activities,” the official said. A health ministry official, however, said: “We don’t see tobacco as an economic activity.” He added that the health ministry was unaware of the home ministry’s note on Bloomberg Philanthropies. India has stepped up scrutiny of NGOs registered under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). In 2015, the home ministry put the Ford Foundation on a watch list and suspended Greenpeace India’s FCRA license, drawing criticism from the United States. Earlier this year, the government banned foreign funding for the Public Health Foundation of India, a group backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, saying it used foreign donations to “lobby” for tobacco-control policy issues, “which is prohibited under FCRA.” In the Bloomberg case, the home ministry note included a chart showing how funds flowed from Bloomberg Philanthropies to its partner, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which was then funding five local FCRA-registered NGOs. These NGOs, the note said, were being used by the Bloomberg charity for “anti-tobacco lobbying activities.” The FCRA license of at least one of them - the Institute of Public Health (IPH) Bengaluru - was not renewed in October, in part due to the home ministry’s note, the government official said. The IPH said it was told by the home ministry that its license was not being renewed on the basis of a “field agency report”, but no details were given. It was unaware of the investigation on Bloomberg Philanthropies. In April, the home ministry wrote to the federal health ministry, citing an “inquiry into foreign funding” for lobbying to change laws in India. The letter, seen by Reuters, mentioned the Bloomberg initiative and directed the health ministry to report on anti-tobacco lobbying by foreign donors in other countries where tobacco is widely used. The health ministry has not yet sent that report, another government official said. The health ministry did not respond to questions.

 ,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"TORONTO (Reuters) - As an influx of asylum seekers crossing from the United States strains Canada’s immigration system, the country is ramping up its deportation of migrants, government data shows. Deportations of Mexicans, who have flocked to Canada in growing numbers after a visa requirement was lifted in December, was already 66 percent higher in the first eight months of 2017 than the total from the previous year. Deportations of Haitians, thousands of whom have crossed into Canada illegally in the hopes of avoiding deportation from the United States, have also soared. Canada has deported 474 so far this year, compared to 100 for all of 2016 when the government lifted its own ban on deportations to Haiti, in place since a devastating 2010 earthquake. Overall, 5,529 people have been deported as of Tuesday, compared to 7,357 for all of 2016, the data shows. Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board has called a rise in asylum-seekers through the U.S. border “unsustainable,” and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, fretting about another big surge in asylum claims, has been trying to warn people away. At the same time, Canada said this week it will be granting border-crossing asylum seekers swifter access to healthcare. They will also be eligible for work permits sooner. Refugee claimants are eligible for health coverage and work permits once their claims are processed, but that can take weeks or months. More than 10,000 asylum seekers have walked across the U.S. border into Canada to file refugee claims so far this year, including 3,800 into Quebec in the first two weeks of August alone, authorities have said. Canada is on track to record the most refugee claims in a decade. ","

 ,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - United Nations peacekeepers in South Sudan are moving more aggressively to protect civilians caught in the country’s four-year civil war, after years of criticism for failures that led to the sacking of the mission’s military chief last year. This year, the U.N. Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) has rescued aid workers and U.N. staff during attacks, saved civilians from abduction by armed groups, and pushed past roadblocks to a massacre site. “A lot has been done ... to improve UNMISS’ ability to deliver on its protection of civilians mandate,” said Lauren Spink, a South Sudan specialist for the independent U.S.-based advocacy group Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC). South Sudan was the world’s youngest country when it became independent from neighbouring Sudan in 2011 following decades of conflict. But the new nation dissolved into civil war less than two years later, after President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, fired his deputy, Riek Machar, a Nuer. Since then tens of thousands have died, and 3.5 million of the country’s 12 million citizens have fled their homes, creating Africa’s largest refugee crisis since Rwanda’s 1994 genocide. As the war spread, families flooded into U.N. bases seeking protection. More than 210,000 people now stay in six such bases, too fearful to go home. Between December 2013 and July 2016, more than 100 civilians and four U.N. peacekeepers were killed in attacks on U.N. bases when peacekeepers didn’t shoot back, fled, or delayed responding, according to data from the U.N. and CIVIC. But a chastened UNMISS has gradually taken a tougher stance, boosted by the January arrival of new chief David Shearer, a former New Zealand labour party leader. “We are trying to make our peacekeeping more robust,” Shearer told Reuters. “Our peacekeepers are going to stand up to situations and challenge them.” Several incidents demonstrate the change. In April, peacekeepers deployed to Aburoc, a village on the Nile. After the U.N. arrived, rebels withdrew, and a government offensive that had displaced 20,000 civilians paused. Aid workers then intervened to stop a cholera outbreak. The same month, peacekeepers went to Torit in the southeast to protect an orphanage housing 250 children caught between the front lines. Mongolian peacekeepers in northern Bentiu town have repeatedly rescued civilians from abduction by armed groups this year, including one incident where they fired their weapons. Reuters was unable to find records of such interventions for previous years. “There is improvement,” said Peter Ruach, who lives in the camp outside the U.N. base in Juba. A year ago government troops raped dozens of women who ventured outside the fence to search for food. “The Ethiopian battalion have cleared a buffer zone and they make sure that when women are going out for collection of firewood they are protected,” he said. Since the buffer zone opened at the end of November, serious crimes like rape and murder reported near the camp had dropped from around 48 per month to between 1 and 5, the U.N. said. U.N. peacekeepers have been in South Sudan since before independence, but found themselves frequently criticised after war broke out by aid groups like Doctors Without Borders, who said they were not doing enough to protect civilians. A year ago, peacekeepers at the U.N.’s main Juba base ignored desperate pleas for help when government troops attacked a hotel a mile away, killing one aid worker and gang-raping others. In following days, government troops raped dozens of Nuer women outside the same base. Ten aid agencies released a joint statement accusing peacekeepers of failing to adequately patrol the area. “The inability of UNMISS to protect civilians threatens to undermine any attempts at safety and security in the country and makes it impossible for humanitarian agencies to provide the help that is so urgently needed,” Frederick McCray, South Sudan Country Director at charity CARE, said at the time. The U.N. eventually launched an investigation that led to the firing of UNMISS’ top general, Kenya’s Johnson Ondieki, in November. In response, Kenya pulled its troops from the peacekeeping mission. Despite more robust peacekeeping, the violence continues. The mission has 12,000 armed peacekeepers and a budget of over a billion dollars. But that’s not enough to patrol a nation the size of France with under 300 km (185 miles) of paved roads. Peacekeepers were too stretched to deploy to Pagak, a rebel stronghold in the northeast, where a government offensive has displaced thousands and forced dozens of aid workers to evacuate since July, Shearer said. U.N. patrols did not intervene in the northwestern town of Wau in April when a government-aligned Dinka militia went door-to-door, executing at least 16 people of other ethnicities. Part of the problem is that the U.N. needs permission from South Sudan’s government for its presence. That can interfere with investigations or interventions aimed at government forces. Last week, the government grounded U.N. flights after a dispute about the deployment of an additional 4,000 troops to beef up the peacekeeping mission. The government is reluctant to accept the new force. “The U.N. cannot be totally independent in a country that is sovereign. They need to be working in cooperation with the government ... They cannot run a parallel government,” said presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny. He denied that government forces had killed or abused civilians. “Government ... cannot do anything harmful to civilians that requires someone to come and protect them,” Ateny said. Shearer has responded to some roadblocks with public pressure. He took to U.N. radio to demand access to the Torit orphanage, and has ordered peacekeepers to hold their ground when their patrols are blocked by troops. “We’ve had several instances of platoons sleeping at checkpoints for up to three days until they were finally persistent enough to be allowed to go,” he said. But for some, U.N. intervention came too late. The U.N. did not arrive in Aburoc until April, well after the government offensive began in January. In the meantime, government forces killed civilians, bombing and shelling the area, and burning people alive in their homes, rights body Amnesty International said. ","

 ,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"The move, announced on Thursday, follows the company’s $49 billion takeover of U.S. peer Reynolds American, which added Camel cigarettes and Vuse e-cigarettes to a BAT portfolio that includes Lucky Strike cigarettes, Vype e-cigarettes and the glo tobacco-heating device. “Now that we have built a successful NGP (next generation products) business which is poised for substantial growth, we will be fully integrating NGP to leverage the scale and expertise of the whole group to drive growth in an area that is fast becoming a key part of our mainstream business,” BAT said in a statement. BAT and Philip Morris were the first of the big tobacco firms to invest in cigarette alternatives a few year back, as growing health consciousness reduces traditional smoking. Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, is ahead of BAT in the market for tobacco-based vaping devices, which some analysts believe will be more popular than traditional e-cigarettes with regular smokers, and its shares have been at a bigger premium to its peers. (bit.ly/2xOLU9R) Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed cutting nicotine in cigarettes to “non-addictive” levels in a push to move smokers toward potentially less harmful e-cigarettes. Under the management reorganization announced on Thursday BAT appointed Asia-Pacific Director Jack Bowles to the newly created role of chief operating officer for the international business, excluding the United States. Shares were up around 1.5 percent at 1322 GMT on Thursday. Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett said the changes could add some uncertainty for BAT in the near term, but in the longer term it reinforced the importance of cigarette alternatives to tobacco companies, which face slowing sales globally. “Whereas those companies that were better positioned for emerging market growth in the past were favoured, the key differentiator now is likely to be who is positioned best in emerging products, given the recent slowdown in emerging market cigarettes,” the analyst said. Japan Tobacco said last week it would buy the Philippines’ No. 2 cigarette maker Mighty Corp for about $936 million, its second large deal in Southeast Asia this month, as it deepens its push into emerging markets.

The outbreak in the city of Maiduguri, the epicenter of the fight against the Islamist insurgents, confirms aid groups’ fears that Nigeria’s rainy season could spread disease in camps for the internally displaced that are often already unsanitary. About 1.8 million have abandoned their homes because of violence or food shortages, U.N. agencies say, and many of them live in camps for the displaced throughout northeast Nigeria, particularly in Maiduguri and the surrounding state of Borno. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, is increasing its “efforts to prevent further deaths and the spread of cholera in Maiduguri”, the group said. MSF said it had set up a 40-bed cholera treatment unit, which has admitted 70 patients, mostly from the Muna Garage camp. “Following heavy rains, the camp is partly flooded, making the already poor sanitary conditions at the camp even worse, which is an additional risk factor during a cholera outbreak,” MSF said, adding that a potential case has been reported from another part of Maiduguri. “Since last weekend, we have witnessed a steady increase in the number of patients at our treatment center and at the rehydration point in Muna camp,” said Anne-Cecile Niard, MSF project coordinator in the statement. “We are worried that the number of beds that are currently planned will not be enough to cope at the peak of the outbreak.” More than 20,000 people have been killed in the conflict with Boko Haram, and 5.2 million people in the northeast do not have secure access to food, with tens of thousands already in famine-like conditions, according to the United Nations.

Demand for electric cars depends on a network of charging points, which utilities, engineering groups, automakers and start-ups are vying to provide and control before the sector takes off. Founded in 2007, Silicon Valley-based ChargePoint operates about 40,000 charging spots in the United States and Mexico. It sells the stations to service providers and hooks them up to its network that can be accessed via a smartphone app. It has so far raised nearly $300 million in funds, with Daimler and Siemens becoming investors this year. BMW first supplied funds in 2012, according to Crunchbase data. “We will probably look to be public within the next five years,” Pasquale Romano said in an interview, adding the group was preparing to implement a reporting structure to comply with stock market requirements. “We’ll be ready. But the conditions have to be right.” ChargePoint does not disclose its ownership structure, but Romano said that Daimler, BMW and Siemens together hold a significant stake. Its owners also include venture capital firms Linse Capital, Rho Capital Partners and Braemar Energy Ventures. “Europe is starting with a stronger political mandate,” Romano said, adding ChargePoint was hiring “furiously” in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Britain, where it struck a deal to sell fast chargers in May, its first in Europe. Europe, however, is also a highly fragmented market, with differing e-mobility legislation and support schemes across various countries, requiring a specific strategy and business model for almost every market. “The market will consolidate around three to four players and we hope to be one of them. That’s how we look at it,” Romano said, adding it was important to expand aggressively, possibly at the expense of immediate profitability. One potential business target could be a car consortium - which includes Daimler and BMW - aiming to install 400 super-fast charging stations across Europe. “Of course, we can help that consortium with our technology,” Romano said.

The strict, suit-and-tie, 14-hour and high-stress corporate culture popularized in movies and television reflects investment banking culture. Private equity firms are usually smaller and more selective about their employees. But once a hire is made, they care less about how performance is maintained. There are exceptions and overlaps in every industry but, in general, the average day is a bit less stressful for private equity associates. ",Investment Banking vs Private Equity | Investopedia
Angelica LaVito,08312017,CNBC,08242017,"Hurricane Harvey has ravaged southeastern Texas and is now hitting southwestern Louisiana as a tropical storm.

Christina Farr,08312017,CNBC,08242017,"Health insurer Aetna has hired Ben Wanamaker from Wal-Mart's health division to lead its joint venture with Apple, according to sources familiar with the matter. At Wal-Mart, Wanamaker's role involved leading business development and strategy for the company's health, wellness and e-commerce businesses, with a focus on partnerships. Wanamaker's LinkedIn page still lists Wanamaker as a current employee of Wal-Mart. As CNBC reported last month, the Apple/Aetna venture is picking up steam. Representatives from both companies met earlier this month to discuss plans to provide free or discounted Apple smartwatches to Aetna's multimillion-strong member base. That presents a big sales opportunity for Apple's smartwatch, especially if other major health insurers follow suit. That partnership was  first announced in the fall of 2016. At that time, Aetna said it would be the first health care company to subsidize the cost of Apple Watch via monthly payroll deductions. Apple and Aetna's joint venture focuses on Apple Watch, which includes health and fitness as a primary use case. Apple Watch lets its users set workout goals, track steps and other metrics, as well as monitor their heart rate. There's a big opportunity for Apple and other makers of fitness trackers to provide them to enterprises, not just consumers. HR departments across the country see opportunities to leverage activity trackers and smartwatches to improve their members' overall health. Payers, including self-insured employers and insurers, are looking for ways to boost wellness to prevent their members from getting costly conditions, like heart disease and diabetes. Wal-Mart's health care offerings include online tools for anyone to search for a health insurance plan or buy supplies for a medical cabinet. It also has a pharmacy business. Wal-Mart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",Aetna hires Ben Wanamaker to lead its joint venture with Apple
Barbara Booth,08312017,CNBC,08242017,"For the first time, a study on internet addiction is being funded by The National Institutes of Health, a signal that the problems stemming from excessive internet use may finally be getting the serious attention it deserves from the U.S. mental health community. The two-year study kicks off this week and is being conducted at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. It may ultimately help to determine whether internet addiction, specifically online gaming, should be listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders — widely known as the DSM-5 — as a true mental health disorder. The lead investigator of the study, Dr. Nancy Petry, also happens to be part of the American Psychiatric Association Workgroup on Substance Use and Related Disorders for the DSM-5 and chaired the subcommittee on non-substance-use addictive disorders. According to her, in 2013, when the DSM-5 was last published, there ""wasn't sufficient evidence to conclude that internet gaming addiction is a condition that can be reliably or accurately ascertained in people."" There still isn't, she says, but this new study may provide the data necessary to move internet gaming addiction, currently listed in the appendix of the DSM as a ""condition that needs further research,"" into the main manual as an official disorder — providing sufferers the possibility of one day being insured for treatment. ""Having something listed as a disorder affects reimbursement in this country. That's a huge thing,"" Dr. Petry told CNBC. ""A lot of people have developed such severe problems with gaming,"" she said. ""They stay up all day and game for 24 hours, and there is evidence that they are dropping out of school; they are losing their jobs; they are losing their families."" She adds that those with gaming addictions are primarily male and have co-morbidities, such as ADHD. Many other countries — including Australia, China, Japan, India, Italy, Japan, Korea and Taiwan—  already officially recognize tech addiction as a disorder, some even going so far as to declare the issue a public health crisis, leading governments and health-care providers to develop a series of major initiatives to curb the problem. But the discrepancies in the numbers of gamers diagnosed with addiction across the countries have spurred much debate over the accuracy of the criteria being used. According to Dr. Petry, the grant from the NIH — $416,694 — was ""a major coup,"" because other institutes refuse to recognize gaming addiction as a condition and therefore decline to fund it. But this isn't the first time Dr. Petry has fought for funding and won: She also headed the first-ever NIH study for gambling addiction. The study for internet gaming disorder focuses on cognitive behavioral treatments and will examine adolescents ages 13 to 18 who have a significant problem with gaming and are still living at home. This is the age most known to show signs of problematic gaming, Dr. Petry says. Official enrollment is now under way. The randomized controlled study will refer half the group to widely available treatments in their community for a co-occurring disorder; the other group will receive a six-session intervention from the APA as well as the treatment for the co-occurring disorder. Afterward the results will be compared. Dr. Petry claims that the debate surrounding whether or not gaming addiction should be classified as a disorder lies in the fact that this is ""a new phenomenon and everybody is measuring it in different ways."" She says people aren't quite clear on what the constricts are. ""We need to be consistent in defining these criteria and determine if they lead to significant harms before we blanketly label something as a disorder,"" she says. Dr. Petry believes the diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5 for internet gaming disorder is ""reliable and accurate."" These include preoccupation with internet gaming, withdrawal symptoms, unsuccessful attempts to quit playing, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, continuing to play despite problems, deceiving others about the amount of time spent on gaming, using gaming to relieve negative moods and jeopardizing or losing a job due to gaming. If a person exhibits five or more of the symptoms, they could potentially be diagnosed as having internet gaming disorder. Many mental health experts argue, however, that excessive use of the internet extends to more than just gaming; sexting and porn addiction, online infidelity, online gambling, social media addiction, information overload and screen addiction are destroying millions of lives as well —and costing corporate America billions. According to a recent study by Vault.com, surfing costs $54 billion annually in lost productivity. As there is no standard criteria for diagnosis, especially between countries, it is impossible to put a number on the actual number of people who suffer from digital overuse, but surveys in the United States and Europe have indicated that it ranges between 1.5 and 8.2 percent of the population. Yet not everyone is buying into it. ""Tech addiction is a hot topic and one that people talk about a lot, but we need to clearly define and differentiate what constitutes a mental disorder that is causing major adverse consequences and distinguish it from just a bad habit that people just wish they weren't doing,"" Dr. Petry says. Disorder or not, scientists have determined that excessive internet use adversely affects the brain's frontal lobe and brainstem functions, resulting in delayed cognitive development—the ability to focus, speak, reason and comprehend social cues. Ultimately, internet addiction can cause anxiety and depression, ADHD, stress, obesity and the inability to interact in the real world, leading to personal, family, academic, financial and occupational problems. And medical experts say it's steadily going to get worse as technology gets faster and smarter, fueling the need for this ""digital heroine."" Like alcohol and drugs, the internet provides a high, and addicts become dependent on it for pleasure, claims Dr. David Greenfield, founder of the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction in West Hartford, Connecticut, one of the first tech addiction centers to open in the United States. More from Modern Medicine: Doctors on cusp of launching male contraceptive need to seduce Big Pharma
FDA testing groundbreaking science: Human organs-on-a-chipHuge ER bills leave patients in shock An assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Dr. Greenfield is considered a pioneer in treating digital media overuse. His book, Virtual Addiction, rang an early warning bell when it came out in 1999, when the internet was still being accessed only through dial-up. ""There was no high-speed internet, no Wi-Fi, no laptops or tablets, no smartphones, and it was already an issue,"" he said. ""But now, because we have greater ease of access and it's easier to pick and click and have that automatic intoxication of response, it's more addictive."" Dr. Greenfield claims that this has led to an explosion of internet and tech abuse and addiction. ""The numbers of referral and patients that we get calls from has probably gone up 10-fold in the last 20 years. We have had a 1,000 percent increase in the numbers of cases, and we treat hundreds of cases a year at this point."" To meet the demand, hundreds of outpatient treatment centers are popping up all over the country, offering weekly intensives, digital-detox retreats and wilderness therapy. Dr. Greenfield's center will soon be adding a 30- to 60-day residential recovery program—the fourth in the United States to offer residential treatment. The others are reSTART, in Seattle; the Internet Addiction Treatment and Recovery Program at the Bradford Regional Medical Center in Pennsylvania; and the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery in Peoria, Illinois. The cost of these programs: anywhere from $3,000 to $45,000, depending on length of stay and whether the recovery program involves residential or outpatient treatment. 5 tips to keep your child from becoming addicted to tech 1. Let your actions speak louder than your words. Lead by example and make face-to-face interaction more important than being on your smartphone. 2. Explain how biomechanics affect your brain and your body. Have an open and honest conversation with your kids about how these devices can affect them physically and mentally may put the brakes on. 3. Set limits on screen time. This is the most obvious step but perhaps the most difficult to enforce, says Bark. ""You can't just give your child a device and think they will turn it off when it's reasonable. We have to be parents. Take away the chargers. Use screen-time management apps."" Bark recommends Circle, Luma or Unglue. 4. Have screen-free zones in your house. Don't let your kids take their devices into their bedroom. Limit it to common areas. 5. Indulge in the real world. As a family, embrace art and music and cooking. Get outside, put your feet in the grass and experience the world."" While it may appear that the United States is gearing up to provide some much-needed intervention for this growing issue, their efforts pale in comparison to other countries. Globally, internet addiction has been receiving widespread attention, as are resources for people seeking treatment. In South Korea, China and Japan, where internet gaming is a major industry, tech addiction is considered a public health crisis. The South Korean government sponsors about 200 counseling centers and hospitals with programs on internet addiction and has trained more than 1,000 counselors. In 2013 the Ministry of Education in Japan introduced internet ""fasting camps"" for young addicts to receive counseling in a tech-free environment. China has more than 300 treatment centers (China officials there estimate 10 million teenagers are addicted). Insurance, says Dr. Petry, is largely to blame. In the United States, almost all clients have to pay out of pocket, as the centers can't bill health insurance companies for internet addiction treatment, since it hasn't been recognized in the DSM as a mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association. And all three of the treatment centers are expensive; reSTART, for example, costs around $25,000 for the first month and $8,500 for a month of outpatient treatment. Yet Dr. Petry is optimistic things will shift. ""There's so much work going on with this right now—not in the U.S. but in Southeast Asia and Europe. By the time the next DSM is published, the data will be available."" And should online gaming addiction be designated as a mental health disorder, she says, other tech addictions may follow suit.

Elizabeth Gurdus,08312017,CNBC,08242017,"CNBC's Jim Cramer has been known to take fantasy football way too seriously, and on Thursday, he took it to the next level. ""It's time for me to show my reality, not fantasy, but reality stock team, the one I drafted in my head last night while I was busily putting together what could be a championship Skidaddy Ski team, which, of course, competes in the Mad Money Schlumpadicka league,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Even though Cramer wouldn't dare draft a quarterback first unless he was picking Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, he began with his stock market equivalent: Apple. ""If there's a rap against Brady, it's that he's an immobile passer. The rap against Apple is that it's just mobile. I look at Apple as the greatest consumer products company of all time, just as I look at Brady as the greatest quarterback of all time,"" Cramer said. Then, Cramer went for fleet-footed players, the market equivalents of six-foot-five wide receivers who aren't afraid of some traffic. He chose the stocks of Amazon, Netflix and Nvidia. Cramer said that Amazon is a winner in a number of ways — a flex play — with Amazon Web Services consistently delivering points and the retail business bringing the heat. ""I keep waiting for another player to have an answer to Amazon. There isn't one,"" he said. The ""Mad Money"" host pegged Netflix as the ""Odell Beckham Jr. of companies"" because it easily makes one-handed catches and each production ends up as a touchdown. ""Classic, value-oriented investors don't like the style of Netflix; too unorthodox, too showboat. But I don't care how a player acts off the field. Netflix is on a whole 'nother plane, a winner which consistently breaks out when you least expect it to,"" Cramer said. His last wide receiver would be Nvidia, a red-hot semiconductor stock with ties to the video game industry, autonomous cars, artificial intelligence and voice technology. ""It's tough to keep Nvidia down,"" Cramer said, pointing to the stock's bounce after what Wall Street saw as a weaker-than-expected quarter. ""Like all great receivers, Nvidia's shaken off the drop and is headed back toward an all-time high."" Alphabet and Facebook were Cramer's choices for running backs because even though their stocks seem overvalued, investors won't regret paying those prices later, he said. Despite Alphabet's recent struggles, Cramer said there was still hope for its stock to break out and urged investors not to give up on the opportunity to buy shares of the Google parent. ""Facebook's a stud. I don't even know if there's an analogue in the NFL as I've never seen anything like this company,"" Cramer said. ""Facebook's one of those backs that gets all-purpose yards for doing nothing but being a platform for two billion people. No NFL player has ever had that kind of pull."" Cramer chose Boeing, the strongest stock in the Dow Jones Industrial average, as his defense play because the aerospace giant simply won't quit. For a tight end, the ""Mad Money"" host went with UnitedHealth. ""Why UNH? Because great tight ends not only catch, they block,"" he said. ""I think that Optum, its amazing data business, is the authority on catching — what's flawed in the system, that is — and nobody blocks wasteful costs like UnitedHealth. They should call UNH 'Gronk.' Got me?"" Cramer's kicker draft was the stock of Visa, a financial technology company that he said is the most consistent of any of its competitors. And for his bench, he'd have Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba as a back-up quarterback, and stocks like Celgene, Autodesk, 3M or Honeywell as additional flex players. ""As you can see, this is a team that's built for the ages, not just built for the season. Yes, it's a bullish team, I acknowledge that. It's not as defensive as some would like. You can keep some cash on the sidelines for a decline,"" Cramer said. ""But if you wanted a playoff-ready team of stocks, it is this one, and it's seasoned, it's ready, it's stacked, it's loaded and it's in total beast mode."" Questions for Cramer?

Elizabeth Schulze,08312017,CNBC,08242017,"Europeans have a reputation for taking extra long holidays during summer. In Norway, the term ""fellesferie"" refers to two or three weeks of vacation time workers collectively take in July — leaving businesses closed or operating on summer hours. In the Netherlands, employees in the building industry take construction holidays called ""bouwvak"" for several weeks. And until two years ago in France, a law required Parisian bakers to stagger their summer vacation time so enough bakeries stayed open for customers during the holidays. It's an envious concept to many Americans — the United States is the only counry in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development that does not mandate paid vacation. Research shows many Americans who receive paid time off are afraid to take it because of workplace pressures. But it turns out the European vacation mindset could actually help boost productivity. The European Union's Working Time Directive guarantees EU workers at least 20 paid vacation days per year, contrary to the United States, which does not have a statutory minimum annual leave requirement. Some European countries mandate additional time off: The U.K., France, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden all require 25 or more paid annual leave days, according to the OECD. Data show more time off doesn't have to translate into lower productivity. Nine of the top 10 most productive countries in the OECD in 2015, measured by GDP per hour worked, were in Europe. The United States ranked sixth. Katie Denis, VP and lead researcher at Project: Time Off, a research group funded by the U.S. Travel Association, has studied the effects of vacation on the workplace for several years. ""The idea that we're sacrificing this time off to get ahead, we're not actually finding that's true,"" Denis said. A 2016 report from the project found workers who took 11 or more vacation days were more likely to have received a raise or a bonus in the previous three years than workers who took 10 or fewer days. Time away from the office can also spark creativity. The ideas for major businesses, like Instagram, or the musical ""Hamilton,"" were inspired on vacation. ""The productivity, creativity, bringing new ideas forward isn't the person who's working crazy hours,"" Denis said. ""It's someone who's getting outside of their day-to-day."" Studies also find health benefits from taking vacation time, like lower stress, better mental health and even less likelihood of a heart attack. ""Vacations are important because they not only replenish the mind, they also reduce the physical effects of stress on the body,"" said Kathleen Potempa, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Nursing. Workload stress is a top barrier to taking vacation, according to Project: Time Off's 2017 State of American Vacation report. The survey of more than 7,000 Americans found 43 percent of workers did not take time off because they feared returning to a mountain of work. Cost was also a factor, with 32 percent saying they cannot financially afford a vacation. But experts say short and frequent breaks away from the office can still have a big impact on productivity. Many studies recommend taking vacation twice a year to improve health benefits, Potempa said. Potempa added that it's important for workers to unplug from work when they're on vacation. A June survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs research found one-third of Americans work or check in with work on vacation. ""The most important thing is that it becomes regular and you don't start skipping,"" she said. ""The major negative effects have been shown for people who don't take vacation for several years.""

"Leslie Kramer, special to CNBC.com",08312017,CNBC,08242017,"One third of Americans may be on their way to developing full-blown type 2 diabetes, and most of them don't even know it. A recent report from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that more than 84 million Americans, or roughly one-third of the population, have prediabetes, a condition marked by higher-than-normal blood sugar. Of that group, 90 percent aren't aware they have the condition. The primary risk factors for type 2 diabetes are genetics and lifestyle — excess weight, obesity and lack of exercise contribute to this alarming medical trend. ""People with prediabetes who don't change their lifestyle are at a much higher risk of developing heart disease and stroke and can develop type 2 diabetes within five years if left untreated,"" said William T. Cefalu, MD, chief scientific, medical & mission officer of the American Diabetes Association. The health risks go beyond heart disease and stroke. As diabetes worsens over time, blindness, kidney disease and lower-limb amputation are also major health risks. Diabetes was the seventh-leading cause of death in the United States in 2015, according to the CDC. This population of diabetes ""ticking time bombs"" is particularly alarming, because in many cases type 2 diabetes can be avoided, simply by leading a healthy lifestyle. Type 2 diabetes is often progressive, and within 10 years of diagnosis, 50 percent of individuals need to use insulin to control their blood glucose levels, according to the ADA. More than 30 million Americans — 9.4 percent of the U.S. population — are already battling diabetes, according to the CDC's National Diabetes Statistics Report, which used data through 2015. The CDC found that of those cases, 7.2 million were undiagnosed. ""The country needs to take this seriously, ratchet it up and make it a priority,"" said Ann Albright, PhD, RD, director of CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation. ""Far too few people know about it or know they have it, and that is why we launched the prevention program and joined forces with other organizations,"" she said. ""It requires us all to take this condition seriously."" Prediabetes is a condition in which a person's blood glucose (sugar) levels are higher than normal, but not yet high enough for a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Doctors often refer to prediabetes as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), depending on which test they used to detect the condition. The A1C test is the most commonly used to detect the condition, because it is a blood test that provides information about a person's average blood glucose levels over the past 90 days. To be prediabetic, an individual would have to have an A1C result of 5.7 percent — 6.4 percent.  The results of a fasting glucose test that are 100-125mg/dl indicate IFG. If an oral glucose tolerance test is performed and the result is 140-199, it indicates IGT. All are considered prediabetes. More from Modern Medicine:FDA testing groundbreaking tech: Human organs on a chip Venture capitalist wages war against Parkinson's ER costs are skyrocketing, leaving patients in shock The cost to the American health-care system and economy from diabetes is steep. The American Diabetes Association estimates at least $245 billion a year. Medicare, Medicaid and the military foot a large portion of that bill, paying for 62.4 percent of the cost of care, while 34.4 percent is paid for by private insurers and 3.2 percent by the uninsured, according to the ADA. The medical community has so far failed to contain prediabetes. A big part of the problem: People simply avoid going to the doctor. William Argenta was 48 when he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, a couple of years ago. He had not been to a doctor in more than five years and only received the diagnosis when he finally decided to go in for a physical. He had experienced a feeling of being overly thirsty — often a sign of diabetes — but other than that, he didn't see any reason to get checked out. Once a patient is diagnosed with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, they are advised to change their eating and exercise habits. Many are prescribed metformin — it is the most widely prescribed drug for diabetes under many brand names, including Glucophage — and helps control blood sugar levels. Metformin lowers blood glucose by reducing the amount of glucose produced by the liver and by helping the body respond better to the insulin made in the pancreas. The FDA has approved metformin for treatment of type 2 diabetes, but not for prediabetes, which is a serious health condition but does not reach the blood sugar level to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. The FDA has been conservative about approving drugs for use beyond specific disease states. However, the FDA is now considering approval of metformin for use in prediabetes. While physicians can already administer it at their own discretion, the ADA says the drug is currently underused as part of treatment options. Ongoing follow-up to the federally funded Diabetes Prevention Program research study has shown that metformin has long-term cost-saving value in delaying type 2 diabetes, with great safety and low cost to the consumer, which may persuade the FDA to approve an indication for prediabetes. According to the ADA, metformin therapy for prevention of type 2 diabetes should be considered for people who have a high body mass index BMI, are aged 60 years or older, have rising A1C test results, despite lifestyle intervention, and for women with prior pregnancy-related glucose intolerance. There are several other drugs prescribed for prediabetes, including a weight loss drug,  but many have significant side effects. The ADA states that metformin has the best track record and safety profile. The ADA also notes that even metformin has been shown to be less effective than lifestyle modification — lifestyle changes can slow or prevent type 2 diabetes in some individuals with a genetic predisposition. Now a type 2 diabetic, Argenta has changed his lifestyle. He cut down on sugary food and has increased his protein intake. He is also exercising and taking metformin and a couple of other medications. Argenta says he now feels much better than he did before he was diagnosed. ""I guess I had just gotten used to feeling bad. Your body adjusts to it in some ways,"" he says. The CDC, ADA and the American Medical Association have launched a new prediabetes awareness campaign, DoIHavePrediabetes.org. The campaign encourages people to take an online test of seven simple questions that can assess a person's prediabetes risk. The organizations are also beseeching those at risk to change their eating and exercise habits before their condition worsens. Dr. Rhonda Todd, MD, internal medicine, is doing her part to raise prediabetes awareness. Based near Ann Arbor, Michigan, she tries to test as many of her patients as she can for prediabetes if they fit a risk profile, using the A1C test. Most private insurers cover the expense of an A1C test, as do Medicaid and Medicare when the patient present risk factors. Todd said she has never had a problem getting a test approved. The cost of the test is roughly $50 dollars, but Todd has seen some hospitals offer the test for $10, as a part of wellness programs. ""I will try to test every patient I see who is over 35, has a family history of the disease or who is obese or overweight, which is almost everybody,"" she says. Todd blames the sedentary lifestyle of Americans for the explosion of diabetes and prediabetes cases. ""We are not a healthy people anymore, technology is killing us,"" she said. Todd said the majority of doctors, many of whom are affiliated with hospitals, test for prediabetes often. She thinks the bigger problem is people not going to the doctor rather than doctor's not offering the tests. The ADA recommends testing for prediabetes in adults of any age who are overweight or obese and who have one or more additional risk factors. For all people, testing should begin at age 45 years and be carried out at a minimum of three-year intervals. Every 21 seconds another person in the United States is diagnosed with diabetes, according to the ADA. That's 4,110 people in America diagnosed with the disease every 24 hours. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all those cases. The risk for developing the disease also increases drastically in people age 45 and older, and after age 65 it increases exponentially. There has also been a troubling rise in the number of adolescents developing both prediabetes and diabetes. Weight has a lot to do with it. Among adolescents, ages 12 to 19, about 1 in 5 are considered to have obesity, and about 1 in 11 (9.1 percent) are considered to have extreme obesity, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. ""Nutrition for adolescents is the cornerstone of treatment,"" Cefalu said. ""People need access to adequate nutrition, and you have to get that information in their hands."" Testing for prediabetes in children and adolescents should be considered for those who are overweight or obese, and who have two or more additional risk factors for diabetes, including having a family history of type 2 diabetes, or who are African American, Native American, Latino, or Asian Pacific Islanders. More than half of Asian-Americans and nearly half of Hispanic Americans with diabetes are undiagnosed. Health-care specialists say getting people to change their behavior isn't easy. ""Telling people to lose weight does not give them enough information. It is not a message that helps and supports them,"" Albright said. To teach people how to change and maintain a new set of lifestyle habits, the CDC is also promoting its National Diabetes Prevention Program, which was initiated in 2010. Just by participating and staying in the program, prediabetics can lower their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 58 percent over three years, and by 71 percent for people over age 60. ""We want to help them determine what is realistic and doable so they can make real life changes that are sustainable,"" Albright said. A DDP program can cost as much as $500 a year. (The CDC-recognized organizations delivering these programs determine the cost, which can vary depending on factors such as the size and experience of the organization offering it.)  Diabetes prevention programs are growing in number and participation, but are still underutilized, according to the ADA. The CDC is working with commercial health plans and employers, including state employers, asking them to consider offering the program as part of their health-care benefit packages or wellness programs. To date, 11 states are providing coverage for more than 3 million public employees, over 65 commercial payers are providing coverage in some markets, and four states are providing Medicaid coverage. The Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services is in the final stage of approving this service for eligible Medicare beneficiaries. The YMCA in many states also offers access to the program on a sliding-scale fee basis. Prevention does work. By losing just 5 percent to 7 percent of one's  body weight (10-15 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds) and practicing a basic exercise regime — such as taking a brisk walk, 30 minutes a day, five days a week — many people are able to return their blood glucose levels to the normal range, according to the CDC. But for lasting and widespread change to take place, more health-care professionals will need to get on board and proactively talk to people about the risk of diabetes and prediabetes, Cefalu said. ""We need to educate and train primary care providers, nurse educators and nutritionists, so they can better inform their patients about the condition and how to treat it."" While a physician referral is not required for an eligible participant to enroll in a National DPP lifestyle change program, the CDC has partnered with the American Medical Association on the Prevent Diabetes STAT (Screen, Test, Act Today). ""All sectors, including health care, business, nonprofit community organizations and faith-based organizations, need to be talking about prediabetes and encouraging those with prediabetes to enroll in a National DPP lifestyle-change program,"" Albright said.

Catherine Clifford,08312017,CNBC,08242017,"Amazon paying $13.7 billion for Whole Foods Market may be a savvy business decision for both parties — Amazon has been dabbling in groceries and Whole Foods needs to better compete with the burgeoning natural foods market it helped launch. But the founding ethos of the companies are as different as a chocolate pop tart and organic oatmeal. Amazon is the result of Jeff Bezos' obsession with the efficiency and scalability of the Internet. The Seattle-based tech giant's vision is ""to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online"" according to its mission statement, and to get it to you overnight. The company has grown to have a market capitalization of $457 billion because Americans will pay for convenience. Whole Foods, meanwhile, is the result of an idealistic attempt to change the way people eat, making them healthier, while promoting sustainable, fairly harvested foods and ethically sourced meats. Amazon is making changes to Whole Foods immediately. The acquisition deal officially closed Monday and already the new ownership started cutting prices, working to combat the perception that shopping at Whole Foods required spending your ""whole paycheck."" After hitting a peak stock price of over $60 in 2013, Whole Foods started to get beaten by the very same competition that it inspired into existence. A leader in bringing natural foods into the mainstream, soon food retail giants like Wal-Mart and Kroger started selling in the category, Trader Joe's launched, and meal-at-home kits like Blue Apron changed the way healthy eaters started shopping. With all the competition, Whole Foods suffered. Its stock price fell by more than half and activist investors like Jana Partners began to assert ownership rights, much to the dismay of co-founder and co-CEO John Mackey, the only original founder still with the company. Though he admitted the company had changes to make, Mackey was against selling Whole Foods. Mackey, whose salary as CEO has only been $1 a year since 2006, is making $8 million from the sale of Whole Foods to Amazon, surprisingly little for a company sale of this size. He owns 980,000 shares of Whole Foods stock and the sale is based on a share price of $42. Jana Partners' profit is reportedly $300 million. It all started on a vegetarian co-op in Austin Mackey, now 63, grew up eating cocoa puffs for breakfast, a hamburger for lunch and boxed macaroni and cheese for dinner, he tells host Guy Raz on a recent episode of the NPR show, ""How I Built This."" He didn't start to understand that there was a value in eating a vegetable-based, healthy diet until he moved into a vegetarian co-op, when he was 23, which, at the time, he thought of as an adventure. At the vegetarian co-op, Mackey, who had dropped out of college because he found the required classes boring, became the buyer for the group. He was fascinated with the potential of healthy eating. Without a diploma but newly inspired by the power of organic eating, Mackey and his then girlfriend, Renee Lawson Hardy, decided to go out on their own and open a natural grocery store. They set out to raise $50,000, but could only muster $45,000. In 1978, they opened shop on the first floor of an old house in Austin with a cafe on the second floor. The couple lived on the third floor. It was called SaferWay, it didn't sell meat or anything with sugar and it primarily served Austin hippies. Two years later, Mackey and Hardy approached another local natural grocery store, Clarksville Natural Grocery, owned by Craig Weller and Mark Skiles, about joining forces. The four went into business together to open the first Whole Foods Market in 1980. In an effort to expand the clientele, the four started selling meat, beer and wine. From the first day they opened, Whole Foods Market was a success. ""People were so excited about this first store. It was amazing, and we didn't do any advertising. We just opened the doors,"" says Mackey on ""How I Built This."" ""The word of mouth was incredible. The whole Austin counter culture hippie community knew about it immediately."" Near-death experience When Mackey looked to rent the space that would become the first Whole Foods Market, the landlord mentioned it was in a 100-year-flood zone, meaning that once every hundred years the area would flood. Mackey, enthusiastic, young and eager to grow, didn't flinch. He was willing to take the risk. It turned out to be a losing bet. In the Spring of 1981, that 100-year flood landed. The store was drowned, sewage forced out of pipes, inventory ruined and looters came and trashed the store. Mackey remembers wading through the dark waters to get whatever cash they had left in the store safe. They didn't have flood insurance. ""We thought we were pretty much out of business,"" says Mackey. ""By all rights, Whole Foods should have died through that flood. We had to rebuild the store and it was going to cost a lot of money to do that and we just didn't have the money, so I thought, we all thought, we were finished."" The Austin community stepped up to save the business. Customers pitched in to help with the cleanup effort, investors put in more money, banks extended credit lines and team members (employees) worked for free to get the store back open. ""We were really united around that near death experience,"" Mackey says. When they got the store re-opened, Mackey was determined to expand. ""I wanted to open a second store after the flood. It was like, we can't put all of our eggs in a basket that might float down the river."" In 1988, when Mackey approached venture capitalists for the money to expand in a significant way, he was repeatedly rejected. He remembers one VC telling him the market was too niche: ""You know, John, I see you have got a pretty good business here, but it looks to me — I looked at all the stores — like you are a just a bunch of hippies and you are just selling food to other hippies and I don't think that is a very big market,"" he told Mackey. A decade later, that same venture capitalist told Mackey not investing in Whole Foods was the worst decision he'd ever made. Mackey did raise venture money though: Whole Foods sold 34 percent of the business for an $8.5 million valuation, which at the time was about 15 to 20 percent of sales, says Mackey on ""How I Built This."" Hungry for cash to grow further but uninterested in handing over more of his company to venture capitalists, Mackey took Whole Foods public in 1992 and raised $28 million valuing the company at $100 million. With the cash, Whole Foods scooped up a slew of other natural food markets around the country. Whole Foods' growth continued as eating healthy became increasingly mainstream. In 2016, there were more than 460 stores in the United States, the company did $16 billion in sales and had 87,000 employees,  according to a recent financial disclosure. Of course, that growth didn't come without controversy. In 2015, the store was taken to task for systematically over-weighing and overcharging certain food items. Whole Foods  denied that these errors were anything other than inadvertent. ""There will be no one that ever loves Whole Foods Market as much as I love it"" Unable to thwart the pressure from investors to sell the struggling chain, Mackey is caught between his ideals and a need to keep afloat the business that he created. ""There is no point in business where you can say, 'At last, I have arrived.' What makes business so amazing is, what makes capitalism so dynamic is that in fact, if you are successful, people copy you. And that's what has happened with Whole Foods. A lot of people have copied us. That helps keep your edge,"" says Mackey. Today, Mackey still lives in Austin and purposefully drives by the location of the first store, which is now a school. He thinks of the past, but he also understands that to stay in business means evolution. ""There will be no one that ever loves Whole Foods Market as much as I love it,"" says Mackey. ""But building a business is a little bit like having children and watching the children grow up ... you hope your child is healthy, you hope your child is happy and you hope your child has integrity and does the right thing. And I think it is important to have a good founder and entrepreneur but the great businesses continue to live on after the founder moves. I certainly hope Whole Foods is in that space.""

Zameena Mejia,08312017,CNBC,08242017,"Face it, we can't all be Elon Musk and work nearly 90 hours a week. Nor are we all fortunate enough to make a living working under 40 hours a week. No matter where you fall, half of all Americans feel  overworked and burned out. Amber Discko, a former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer who worked on her social media team, is out to change that. Discko, 27, created the beginnings of self-care app Aloe while experiencing a difficult time working the final four months of Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. ""It was an incredible experience to work on it, but it was hard to balance my mental health with the stress of the campaign and dealing with the toxic news cycle,"" Discko tells CNBC Make It. She created a personal checklist, which assessed wellness items like if she was hydrated, had taken a break from the computer screen in the last hour and if she had been going to sleep on time. Despite working with a ""diverse, smart group of people,"" she noticed that others working on the campaign were also suffering from exhaustion. ""It's very common, especially with millennials, to overwork yourself when you're super passionate about a cause,"" Discko says. ""We are so driven to do our best that we let other things slide by."" Discko surpassed her  Kickstarter $40,000 goal, raising $50,528 for Aloe, primarily through Twitter followers, and continues receiving support through creative funding platform Patreon. The app is expected to be released for iOS devices first in January with Android to come later. With help from the Femsplain community, an online publication Discko ran the past three years, Aloe already exists in the form of her now-public, online self-care checklist, a printable checklist for your desk and as interactive Twitter bot ""@aloebud."" garden tweet Once completed, Aloe will have three main sections: a check-in area to mark your accomplishments, a reminders section to motivate you throughout the day and a mad-lib style reflections section that gives a glance at how you feel and what your next goal will be. There will also be also a community support feature to connect with others using the app. Discko says Aloe will provide a simpler path to wellness for even the hardest workers out there. She hopes teams in offices will put the app to use. ""Because people are chained to their desks, they are working long hours,"" Discko says. ""I'm hoping if workplaces can encourage their teams to take moments for themselves throughout the day, it will create a better environment to work in."" For those who are unsure if they feel worker burnout, Stanford psychologist and research scientist Emma Seppälä notes it's when you are lacking energy, feeling down and feel generally unmotivated to do work. ""It seems ridiculous to need an app to remind you to sleep, breathe, eat,"" Seppälä tells CNBC Make It, ""but we've gotten to the point where people do need reminders."" She says this is because people are caught up in an ""overwhelming"" amount of responsibilities. ""Plunged into our virtual worlds and crunched for time, we tune out completely from our own needs for sleep, exercise, even food,"" Seppala says. In researching her book, ""The Happiness Track,"" Seppälä found that half of American workers, regardless of profession or position in corporate hierarchies,  are burned out. ""We've gotten so addicted to working, we're so overwhelmed with notifications from our devices, and we're generally so overwhelmed trying to balance home life and work,"" Seppälä says, ""that it's no surprise we're seeing 50 percent burnout across industries right now."" work tweet Apps like Aloe can provide reminders and a  supportive community to help keep us on track, Seppälä says. ""We are profoundly social people for whom connection and a sense of belonging is crucial for health and happiness,"" Seppälä says. Since we are no longer always living in tight-knit communities with family and friends reminding us to take care of ourselves or pitching in to help cook a meal, Seppälä says ""online communities are sometimes a great way to make sure you have people to connect with, be motivated by and look out for."" Without self-care, notes Seppälä, comes more burnout. ""When complete burnout happens, then you can have health consequences,"" she notes, including stress-induced health problems like inflammation and diabetes. Discko says she has received online criticism and constant questions about the usefulness or necessity for the app, which will be free when launched and have in-app upgrades for personalization. A post shared by Aloe (@aloebud) on Mar 10, 2017 at 10:18am PST But Seppälä wants people to consider this: health care expenditures at high-pressure companies are nearly 50% greater than at other organizations. She cites an  American Psychological Association estimate which finds that the U.S. economy loses more than $500 billion due to workplace stress as well as 550 million workdays lost yearly to stress on the job. Seppälä says wellness apps like Aloe can promote a more inclusive workplace culture if the entire work culture buys into the idea that self-care is important, adding they should ""for the sake of the bottom line if anything."" ""You need an entire workforce, and especially its leaders, to support the idea,"" Seppälä says. Discko says Aloe can help bosses and managers lead the conversation on mental health at work. ""Being able to say you need to take a moment to manage your own health and talk with your colleagues who know you've been working hard is important,"" Discko says. ""If people in the workplace were kinder to one another, making sure they feel good about their work and their day,"" she adds, ""I think more people would be inclined to work harder and work together.""

In a previous article, I laid out the bear case against Altria Group (NYSE:MO). Today, let's take a look at some ways the tobacco titan's stock could trend higher in the coming years. As the number of people who smoke continues to decline, the tobacco industry has turned its focus toward new products that are believed to have fewer health risks. One such product that shows particular promise is Philip Morris International's (NYSE:PM) iQOS system. The iQOS is an electric device that heats -- but does not burn -- a new type of cigarette called a Marlboro HeatStick. Instead of smoke, it produces a nicotine-containing vapor. Philip Morris says that this vapor is less dangerous than traditional cigarette smoke, and that the iQOS creates a more enjoyable experience for smokers than existing e-cigarettes. Image source: Philip Morris International. Altria already has a deal in place with Philip Morris that gives it exclusive distribution rights to the iQOS in the U.S. Altria hopes Philip Morris can get approval for iQOS from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration sometime in the next year or so, at which time Altria will begin marketing the product in the United States. I should note, though, that if reduced-risk products like iQOS catch on in the U.S., shipments of traditional smokable cigarettes are likely to drop precipitously. In fact, when Philip Morris launched iQOS in Japan last April, the product quickly cannibalized about a third of its own cigarette portfolio in the country. Fortunately for Philip Morris, many of the smokers who switched to iQOS came from its cheaper brands, thereby boosting the company's overall revenue. Moreover, if iQOS earns a modified risk tobacco product designation from the FDA, it could rapidly take market share from rival products that cannot make such a claim. Philip Morris plans to make iQOS available in more than 30 countries by the end of 2017. The U.S. could follow soon after -- if iQOS receives FDA approval -- thereby providing Altria with an important new product line and a potentially significant revenue growth driver. Recent consolidation in the U.S. tobacco industry may make Altria's days as an independent entity numbered. While Altria remains the market share leader, its No. 2 and No. 3 rivals combined when Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI) acquired Lorillard in 2015. Reynolds American then agreed to be acquired by international giant British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) earlier this year in a deal that will form the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company. Ever since British American and Reynolds American agreed to merge, rumors have swirled that Philip Morris and Altria would recombine in order to match their rival's newfound global scale. In fact, Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog places the odds of a deal at 70%. For this to occur, Philip Morris, as the larger company, would likely acquire Altria. The buyout price would need to include a significant premium to Altria's current stock price in order to entice investors to approve the deal. An offer in the $77 to $80 range could be well received by shareholders and would give investors who buy Altria's shares today gains of roughly 20% to 25%. Of course, a deal might not take place, and speculating on acquisitions can be a dangerous investment strategy. So, Fools who decide to invest in Altria should do so only if they're comfortable owning the company in its current form. ","

Todd Campbell,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A full transcript follows the video. Todd Campbell: My fingers are tired from writing ""I'm sorry, mea culpa!"" in preparation for today's episode. [laughs] Campbell: No. I think any investor that's been investing for a while recognizes that mistakes are common, and they can be wonderful teaching moments, so let's keep that in mind as we go through. Harjes: Exactly. So, we'll have a clip where I said something that was wrong, and then for the second half of the show, we'll go over to one that Todd picked out for a prediction of his that was not quite on the target. To kick things off, here's a clip from our Oct. 28, 2015, show. This show was called ""Walgreens Shows Its Hand, Scoops Up Rite Aid."" So that was my speculation. For some context, the original deal that we were talking about was for $9.7 billion. It was announced in October of 2015 that Walgreens would acquire Rite Aid for $9 a share. That was later revised down to about $6.50-$7. It all depended on how many stores were divested. For some additional context here, these are the two major retail pharmacy players in the United States, and therefore the FTC did not want the type of power consolidation that could be involved with this deal. That's why there was the first revision of the plan. And eventually, we found out in June 29 of this year that the entire deal had fallen through, and the original FTC decision had been scheduled for July 7, but Walgreens ended up saying, ""You know, they're just not going to approve this, so we're going to offer up a new deal to acquire just about half of Rite Aid's stores,"" which is a heck of a lot smaller than the original deal. And that's where we stand now. We had more details about this new version of the deal on the episode that we did on July 5, but there's no getting around the fact that back in October of 2015, I was just totally off the mark saying the FTC would let this deal go through. Campbell: You were just hopeful! You were hopeful! There's nothing wrong with hopeful. Yes, you were optimistic. As investors, we sometimes get optimistic, and we connected some dots, and the dots were, with the push to try and drive down prices, maybe they would let this go through. The reality is, however, there's no denying that the pharmacy marketplace has gotten very consolidated since 2000. You've got a handful of players who dominate that market. You have Walgreens, you've got CVS, and you've got Rite Aid. So, combining Walgreens and Rite Aid together, OK, yeah, that would have created a behemoth in the space, and theoretically, that could have eliminated competition in certain local markets to the point where they weren't going to get this deal approved. Shares of Rite Aid, Kristine, have been absolutely pummeled on the news of the new revised deal. Harjes: Yeah, they fell 26%. Campbell: I'm curious to put you on the spot again for next year's episode -- Harjes: Oh, great! [laughs] Campbell: -- and see if you have any thoughts for Rite Aid from here. Will this deal get through? Harjes: Yeah, I'm really hesitant to speculate again on it. But it's really hard not to do, because watching what has happened to Rite Aid's shares over the past 22 months -- I think that's the right number -- since Walgreens started talking to the FTC about potentially scooping up some or all of Rite Aid, it is fascinating. Rite Aid's shares are down to about one-third of the level they were before this deal was ever announced. They're down 73% just since the beginning of this year. Right now, they're hovering around $2.25 a share. If you recall, the original deal was for $9 per Rite Aid share, so the market has just completely crippled Rite Aid. Campbell: Kristine, just to jump in for one quick second because I don't want to forget this point, what's interesting to think about, in that original deal, if you include debt, that deal was worth over $17 billion. So Walgreens was willing to pay, including debts, $17 billion to get its hands on Rite Aid. Now, what's Rite Aid's market cap today? Harjes: $2.34 billion. Campbell: $2.34 billion, and they still have half their stores, and they still have their pharmacy benefit manager. So I wonder if there's a little bit of a disconnect. Maybe that's the uncertainty. The uncertainty is, we don't know whether or not the deal will close, and if it doesn't close, you still have Rite Aid as a relatively troubled and highly indebted company. Harjes: Yeah, they have $7.2 billion in debt. I think, actually, I have learned from being wrong the first time about this, because I'm so intrigued by Rite Aid as a value play right now, but I haven't bought any shares, and I think that actually is the hesitation of, I was wrong about whether or not the FTC would let this go through once. I could be wrong again, even though right now, sitting here looking at it, I'm going to say, I do think this will go through. And even if not, I think Rite Aid is grossly undervalued. But that being said, I still haven't put my money behind it, because I'm looking at this like, well, I understood the situation incorrectly the first time around, so I'm going to try to learn from that and say deals are not done deals until they go through. It's dangerous to try to grab an arbitrage opportunity, especially because if you look at what happens when these deals fall through, the stocks are absolutely crushed. And while it doesn't look like to me that Rite Aid has farther that it could really fall based on the value of the business alone, it could. And who am I to say that won't? Campbell: Right. Is this a falling knife or a value trap? Or is this truly a bargain-bin buy? That's the big question. I had a mentor back in the '90s, Kristine, and one of the things that I learned from that mentor was, don't worry too much about the bottom 10% of a move or the top 10% of a move. Focus your attention on that 80% in the middle. So I think investors should basically take a step back and say, ""I don't need to be perfect in timing my entry and trying to get to the bottom. Why don't I let this play out a little bit, because it's likely that if it does close, there will be opportunities for me to benefit and make that 80% of the move after, rather than trying to be a hero and stepping up into the uncertainty?"" Harjes: Yeah, I think that's great advice. For investors looking to do that here, take a look at the value of the stores. Consider that Walgreens will be able to cherry-pick the ones that it wants. Also consider that the way in which it will cherry-pick them will have a lot to do with what the FTC says it's allowed to choose as far as the geographical footprint goes. Also, look at its PBM. Rite Aid has EnvisionRx, its pharmacy benefits manager. That's a whole other part of this business that doesn't really get talked about a lot, and I suspect the value of that isn't really being considered in the full market cap of this company. Campbell: Yeah, Kristine, just to jump in again on that point, because it's a good one, I crunched some numbers on that not that long ago in an article I posted on The Motley Fool, and one of the conclusions I came to is, as a standalone company, that EnvisionRx could be worth anywhere between $2.4 and $4 billion on its own, which is intriguing. Harjes: Interesting. Yeah, I don't think I read that one yet, so I will definitely go ahead to the site and look for it. If anyone listening wants to read it, shoot us an email at industryfocus@fool.com, and I will dig it up and send it along for you. Todd, I'm going to take myself out of the mistakes spotlight and pivot over to you. In our July 27, 2016, show, we talked about CEOs that were enormously successful in one business venture who were back at it trying to catch lightning in a bottle again. We featured Tesaro, NantKwest, Puma Biotech, and OPKO Health (NASDAQ:OPK). And in an effort to put you on the spot, or give our readers a tidy conclusion, I asked you to pick your favorite. Here's a refresher of what you said: Harjes: Any thoughts on that? Campbell: I could have picked Tesaro's Lonnie Moulder. Tesaro got an approval for their PARP inhibitor, and sure enough, its shares have gone from $95 to a high of $180 and still trading around $120. That would have worked. I could have picked Puma. It got its approval of Nerlynx recently, and its shares have gone from $49 to $80. But no, [laughs] I settled with the safe play, going with Phillip Frost, OPKO Health. And sure enough, its shares have been flushed down the toilet bowl, falling from $10 to about $6, which is even more painful when you think about the fact that this has been one of the strongest periods for market returns in recent memory. Harjes: So. [laughs] What did you learn from this? Campbell: There were reasons that I sided with and picked Phillip Frost. Phillip Frost is a proven leader. And I love investing in companies with proven leaders. Rome wasn't built in a day. Phillip Frost has been starting, successfully, running companies, and then selling them since the 1970s, and he's one of the wealthiest healthcare entrepreneurs in America. So I think sidling up next to him was not necessarily a mistake long-term, but certainly a mistake short-term. And I think the short-term mistake I made was to fail to understand how much shares could fall if a couple of key catalysts were either slow to develop or outright disappointed. Do you me want to walk through those catalysts, Kristine? Harjes: Yeah, there's been a handful of them over the last year or so since we talked about this. Do you want to start with maybe the slow launch of Rayaldee? Campbell: Yeah. Rayaldee is a very intriguing drug, because it's a prohormone for vitamin D that works better than existing vitamin D supplements that are given to patients with chronic kidney disease, that suffer from vitamin D insufficiency. Vitamin D insufficiency can cause calcium loss in bones, bone weakness, and all sorts of other problems. So it's an important indication; it's important to have treatment options available for it. The problem is, after Rayaldee launched, it did not have widespread early-on inclusion in drug formularies at insurers. So the patient population that was covered by insurers that would pay for these drugs was pretty small, and sales, frankly, have been a rounding error and aren't even broken out in OPKO Health's quarterly results yet. Perhaps, according to Phillip Frost in the second-quarter conference call, they'll start to break those numbers out for us in the fourth quarter of this year. And there's opportunities there theoretically for Rayaldee to finally deliver on its promise. But Rayaldee wasn't the only disappointment. You also had Varubi, which is a drug that's approved for use in patients who are suffering from vomiting and nausea after receiving chemotherapy. That's a very important market. It's worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and Varubi is licensed by Tesaro, which is Lonnie Moulder's company. So far, sales have been slow to grow. Sales in the second quarter were only about $2.9 million, and with OPKO collecting double-digit royalties, again, a rounding error considering that the company is doing $300 million roughly in quarterly revenue because of its diagnostics business. Harjes: And that wasn't even the only disappointment. Campbell: Yeah. They also came up shy in a very important trial that was evaluating the long-lasting human growth hormone treatment in adults. They have a drug that's partnered up with Pfizer. A lot of people thought that if this drug reached the market and eventually got approved for use in kids, pediatric use, then this could be a big moneymaker for OPKO Health. Unfortunately, in December, they announced that the trial missed its mark. They haven't given up on the drug, but that trial was a failure. So overall, you have this confluence of disappointments over the course of the last 12 months that has really taken a toll on the company's stock price. You add that together with the fact that sales in the diagnostic business, which is basically the specialty lab that they run, have pretty much flatlined at around $300 million, a little over $300 million, there hasn't been a lot of excitement or enthusiasm to drive up the market cap of this company. Harjes: So, clearly, it's been a disappointing year for OPKO shareholders. Where do you stand now going forward on it, Todd? Do you think it's, ""Looking back on it, I was wrong, this is a terrible company, investors should stay far away from it,"" or do you think that now, at the lower share price, there might be an even better opportunity for investors to scoop up some shares at a discounted price, because now, going forward, is where the real promise is? Or something in between the two? Campbell: There's a couple different takeaways I guess I have on this whole thing. I think, yes, you stick with proven leaders, and yes, there's a lot of opportunity still ahead for OPKO. I don't like buying drug-development stocks on sale as using the value argument only because, as we saw last year, a lot can happen with clinical trials. You can say, ""There's all sorts of opportunities still in the pipeline,"" which there is, drugs that could rack up lots of sales for this company over time. But those trials could fail. You have to take a look at it and say, ""I'm not going to buy it solely because it's cheap relative to where it was last year. Things happened that the outlook now has changed."" But I think you can look at it and say, Rayaldee could still deliver on the goods. We'll know better early next year what the sales trend, the prescription trend is for that. Varubi, which again is marketed by Tesaro, there's a PDUFA date at the FDA that could approve an IV formulation. If that formulation gets approved, that opens up the vast majority of the marketplace for this type or this class of drugs. That, theoretically, could start meaningfully generating revenue in 2018. And there's a pediatric study ongoing in human growth hormone still that reads out in 2019. If that trial is good, then Pfizer and OPKO will split the profits on both OPKO's drug and Pfizer's existing drug in that indication, Genotropin, which is selling at a clip of over $100 million per quarter. So there's still reasons besides value that you'd want to own OPKO Health. And certainly, Phillip Frost remains incredibly committed as a shareholder in this company. He continues and has continued to increase the number of shares he owns over the past year, even in the face of all these disappointments. Harjes: Some of the dates that you mentioned when you were running down your list of catalysts going forward are pretty far in the future. That speaks to me about a bigger problem with investing in biotech, which is opportunity cost. Many of the stocks that look interesting today are likely to take a long time before they prove out. Something that regular listeners of the show have heard us talk about before is keeping an investing journal. That's so important, so I'm going to say it again -- keep an investing journal, specifically to combat this type of mistake, or looking at the mistake incorrectly when maybe it wasn't quite a mistake yet, is to write down exactly the dates that you're looking for. So the PDUFA dates, when the FDA might approve a drug, or a forecast for when you think a company is finally going to turn profitable, things like that where, if it's a date that's relevant to your investment thesis, you want to have it written down in front of you, so that when that date comes and goes you can reevaluate your thinking and figure out if, indeed, you were right. If, for example, your investing thesis for OPKO had something to do with a PDUFA date that's years and years out, you want to know that and you want to be very aware of it for several reasons, one of which is that, maybe it's not really the time to invest just yet. Maybe there are better places for your money now where you can get more validation sooner that you actually are placing your money in the proper place. Of course, we are long-term investors here at The Fool, but in the short term, if you're going to look at a company that is declining over the course of one year and think, ""Oh my gosh, I was wrong, I need to exit,"" but you're still waiting for a catalyst that's years in the future, then you're going to end up cutting yourself short, and you'll never even see the potential gains that you were hoping to get in the very beginning. Campbell: That's a great point, Kristine. I'm going to throw another point out there, too. We've talked about on the show previously, especially in biotech, diversify, diversify, diversify. I selected one stock out of these four -- Harjes: To be fair, I made you do that. Campbell: Yeah. Well, that exposed us to a lot more risk. If we had just invested across all four of them, you would have done very well, because of the success that we saw with Puma and Tesaro. So, I think diversification is always something that's very important across this space. Never put all your eggs in one basket hoping that you're going to hit a home run. Harjes: Yeah. And it's important not to beat yourself up too much about single mistakes, because overall, if you're right 50% of the time, you're a really, really good stock picker. Campbell: Very good stock picker, and you'd be a great baseball player. Harjes: Yeah, exactly! So, Todd, I'm not going to beat you up too much about the OPKO mistake, and I'll try not to beat myself up too much about getting the Rite Aid-Walgreens merger information predicted incorrectly. And that'll do it. Hopefully we can learn from these mistakes and move forward and be right at least 50% of the time, hopefully more! As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. This show is produced by Austin Morgan. For Todd Campbell, I'm Kristine Harjes. Thanks for listening and Fool on! ","
      
    Boy, Were We Wrong About Rite Aid and Opko Health -- The Motley Fool

Brian Stoffel,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There's no question they're bad for your health. But given their addictive nature, both beer and cigarettes have proven to be investments with enviable returns. That's why so many investors flock to Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD). But which of these dividend-paying stalwarts is a better bet for your portfolio today? While that's not a question that can be answered with 100% certainty, there are ways to getting some more clarity on the decision. If we break it down to three simple categories, the picture gets clearer. Image source: Getty Images This is by far the most important thing to keep an eye on for long-term investors. A sustainable competitive advantage -- otherwise referred to as a ""moat"" -- is what differentiates one company from the next. Because there's nothing prohibiting start-ups from making their own beer or cigarettes, the key moat for both of these companies is the strength of their brands. Given both companies' ubiquity globally, and the apparent pricing power that comes with those brands, I'm calling this one a tie. Winner: Tie The main draw for investors in these companies is the dividend that they pay out. With recognizable brands and comparatively low input costs, they both spit out lots of cash. But while we'll get to those payments in a minute, it's worth considering how much cash the company keeps on hand for a rainy day as well. While such an allocation might be boring, it is also crucial. That's because every company, at one point or another, is bound to experience difficult economic times. Those that have cash on hand have options: buy back shares on the cheap, acquire weaker rivals at a discount, or outspend the competition into bankruptcy. Debt-heavy companies are in the opposite boat, forced to narrow their focus just to make ends meet. Here's how these two stack up, keeping in mind that Anheuser is valued at a 25% premium -- via market capitalization -- to Philip Morris. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Philip Morris $7.3 billion $26.6 billion $7 billion $8.1 billion Anheuser-Busch InBev $30 billion $108 billion $4 billion $6.5 billion Data sources: SEC filings and Yahoo! Finance. Net income and free cash flow presented on trailing-12-month basis. Figures rounded to nearest billion. To be honest, I'm not terribly impressed with either company's balance sheet. While reliable free cash flow means that neither has much to worry about when it comes to meeting their debt obligations, both companies have a fair amount of leverage. Both companies have identical cash-to-debt ratios, but the differentiator is Philip Morris' free cash flow, which is far superior to Anheuser-Busch, even though the latter is a bigger company. Winner: Philip Morris And then we have valuation. There's no one metric that can tell you just how expensive a stock is. Instead, I like to use a number of data points to get a more holistic picture. Company P/E Ratio P/FCF Ratio PEG Ratio Philip Morris 26 23 2.3 Anheuser-Busch InBev 39 35 1.3 Data sources: SEC filings, Yahoo! Finance, and E*Trade. P/E represents non-GAAP earnings. On the surface it might seem that Philip Morris is cheaper than Anheuser -- on both an earnings and free cash flow basis. But it's important to remember that the latter's numbers are slightly skewed given the acquisition of SAB Miller. That's where the PEG ratio -- which factors normalized growth into the equation -- comes in. On that metric, Anheuser appears to be trading at a 40% discount to Philip Morris. With both companies having relatively similar and strong yields, the scale tips ever-so-slightly in favor of Anheuser-Busch. Winner: Anheuser-Busch InBev So there you have it: We have a draw. Both companies have strong moats provided by their ubiquitous brands. Philip Morris has the stronger cash flows for now, while investors appear to be getting a better bargain on Anheuser-Busch InBev at current price levels. ","

Sean Williams,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When it comes to growth industries, essentially nothing tops legal marijuana. According to cannabis research firm ArcView, the legal cannabis market in North America is slated to grow from $6.9 billion in 2016 to an estimated $21.6 billion by 2021 -- a 26% compound annual growth rate. This growth is possible because the American public's aggregate opinion on pot has rapidly shifted over the past two decades. Back in 1995, national pollster Gallup found that only 25% of respondents wanted to see marijuana legal across the United States. However, by 2016, this had increased to an all-time record high of 60%. What's more, a separate study released by Quinnipiac University in April 2017 found that an overwhelming 94% of respondents favored the national legalization of medical cannabis. Given this latter support figure, it's probably not as shocking that 29 of 50 states have legalized medical marijuana since 1996. But what if medical cannabis isn't all it's been touted to be? Image source: Getty Images. According to two similar, but separate, publications in the Annals of Internal Medicine this August, medical cannabis has had few, if any, concretely positive impacts in treating chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One study, involving nearly a dozen authors, examined the impact that medical cannabis had on treating chronic pain, which is one of the most commonly prescribed indications. After analyzing data from 27 chronic-pain trials, researchers found only minimal evidence that medical weed was effective in alleviating neuropathic pain, and insufficient evidence that it relieved or alleviated pain in other patient populations. And that's not all. After completing 11 systematic reviews and 32 primary studies, the nearly one-dozen researchers found that using medical cannabis led to an increased risk of motor vehicle accidents, psychotic symptoms, and short-term cognitive impairment. In other words, this group found that medical marijuana appears to be doing more harm than good. A second study, published the same day by the same group of authors, examined the effectiveness of medical cannabis in treating PTSD. In a nutshell, the researchers found that the study evidence examined was insufficient to draw any benefit or risk conclusions given that no randomized trials were found. Further, the studies were deemed to have a medium-to-high risk of bias, and observational studies found no benefit of cannabis use for PTSD patients. Image source: GW Pharmaceuticals. While the usual rules for published studies apply (i.e., that no concrete conclusions can be reached one way or another without additional research), there's also real-world evidence that cannabis or cannabinoids derived from the cannabis plant may not effectively treat pain. GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:GWPH), the largest marijuana stock by market cap, and a company that's really excelled in recent years on the heels of clinical results from experimental cannabidiol-based drug Epidiolex for two rare types of childhood-onset epilepsy, has tasted failure in treating cancer pain before. Sativex, the company's only approved drug in more than a dozen markets outside the U.S. (Sativex isn't approved in the U.S.), failed miserably in a late-stage study in the U.S. examining its use in treating cancer pain back in 2015. Put plainly, cannabinoids and cannabis don't appear to be a guaranteed cure for pain. What's stopping drugmakers and researchers from running studies that lawmakers could use to make real-world decisions on the benefit-versus-risk profile of cannabis? Look no further than the drug's current scheduling. Image source: Getty Images. At the federal level, marijuana remains a schedule I substance, which means it has no medical benefits and is entirely illegal, like LSD and heroin. Because it's a schedule I drug, getting permission to run clinical studies is exceptionally difficult. In fact, there's currently just one federally permitted cannabis grow farm for medical research in Mississippi. And according to scientists via PBS, that grow farm has been producing moldy samples amid a lack of federal testing standards at the site.  In other words, red tape is holding back any opportunity for scientists to see if medical cannabis has the benefits that have been suggested in treating chronic pain, PTSD, and other diseases. How does this red tape get lifted? That's really anyone's guess at this point. President Donald Trump has previously aligned himself with the public in that he supports medical cannabis. However, his Attorney General Jeff Sessions is a huge opponent of marijuana and would likely fight tooth and nail against easing testing restrictions. It's possible lawmakers could be coerced into action by voters who could push dissenters out of office come election time, but it remains to be seen if a single issue like marijuana could hold enough weight to push politicians out of office. For the time being, there's a case that can be made from both sides of the aisle, and that's not good for the U.S. medical marijuana industry, nor is it good news for investors. Until we see meaningful change in Washington, there's little for the industry, or marijuana stock investors, to buzz about. ","

"August 29, 2017, 9:34 AM",08312017,MarketWatch,08242017,"In the wake of North Korea's latest missile launch, an official said the country was justified to exercise its right to ""self defense,"" the Reuters news agency reports. On Tuesday, North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Han Tae Song, accused the U.S. of driving the Korean peninsula toward an ""extreme level of explosion,"" claiming the United States has ""openly declared its hostile intentions"" toward the country. Han said in response to the U.S. and South Korea holding ""aggressive"" joint military exercises in the region, ""despite repeated warnings,"" his country has ""every reason to respond with tough counter-measures."" While the ambassador did not explicitly refer to Monday's latest ballistic missile launched over Japan, Han warned the U.S. that it would be ""wholly responsible for the catastrophic consequences it will entail."" Following the missile launch, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Trump discussed over the phone the U.N. ramping up further pressure on North Korea and calling for an international response to the growing tensions in the region. The two called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to address these concerns. Mr. Trump, who earlier this month warned of ""fire and fury"" for the regime in response to its earlier missile launches, issued a new charge to the North, saying that ""all options are on the table"" to respond to the increasing threat posed by the country.

U.S. equity futures sold off late Monday, after North Korea launched a ballistic missile over Japan, seen as another direct provocation that could destabilize the region, but staged a turnaround in late-afternoon trade. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the missile test an “unprecedented, grave and serious threat that seriously damages peace and security in the region.” President Donald Trump has previously said the U.S. would react with “fire and fury” if Pyongyang stepped up threats against the U.S. and its allies. On Tuesday morning, he said that “all options are on the table” following the North Korean missile launch. Some traders told MarketWatch that the “measured” statement by Trump and the rest of the global community so far has provided a modicum of comfort to investors. “The response around the world, it was measured as of now, and I think it was probably helpful to the market,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading. Kepner said the market wasn’t being dismissive of the latest military threat out of Pyongyang but said seasonally low volumes for the summer also make equity benchmarks more prone to swings. “North Korea is drawing another line in the sand, a little further out than the last line. This has real psychological ramifications for the markets; this might not end in a pretty fashion,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group. Kristina Hooper, global market strategist at Invesco, said: “There’s some level of optimism in the market.” Hooper said there is hope that the tragedy playing out in the Houston area in the fallout of Hurricane Harvey will be used to establish common ground amid the tense relationship between Trump and congressional leaders on budget negotiations and the debt ceiling. A lot will depend on the “ability of Congress and the president to find some common ground borne of their concern for victims of Hurricane Harvey,” Hooper said. The up-and-down trading action comes at a time when major U.S. stock-market indexes are solidly higher for the year, and trading near record levels. The S&P is up more than 9% in 2017, and is less than 2 percentage points off all-time highs. Beyond geopolitical concerns, investors have also been worried about Wall Street valuations. Read: Overseas stocks are still where the bargains are for U.S. investors “Valuation is rarely the only factor behind a market selloff, but it can exacerbate a market downturn when other factors are present,” Ghriskey said. “We’re not concerned about the market at these levels, but the Korea situation could get out of hand, which is the last thing anyone wants from a human or a market perspective.” Gold futures

The S&P has climbed 10.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has surged 19% since the start of the year. “Biotech rally, which created an upside momentum in the market amid very low volumes, has been driving the market over the past two days,” said Sahak Manuelian, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities. Some analysts said the market has been supported by earnings and a positive economic environment over the past several months. Thursday’s economic releases came in mostly in line with expectations, confirming a positive trend in growth. Low levels of first-time jobless claims  suggest the labor market remains robust, while consumer spending — the biggest driver of the economy — picked up in July, thanks to higher income for consumers and low inflation. “In an environment where the economy and earnings continue to grow, markets will also climb. Geopolitics shake up markets from time to time, but usually do not have long-lasting impact,” said Arian Vojdani, investment strategist at MV Financial. Equities and other assets viewed as relatively risky have stabilized after a late-August slump thanks in part to that better-than-expected U.S. data and a stronger-than-anticipated reading on Chinese manufacturing out Thursday, according to Richard Perry, a Hantec Markets analyst. Data deluge: Consumer spending rose 0.3% last month, helped by higher incomes and low inflation. The pace of inflation, meanwhile, was little changed in July, up 0.1%. Initial jobless claims in the period running from Aug. 20 to Aug. 26 rose by 1,000 to 236,000, which is still close to a postrecession low, pointing to another solid monthly employment report near the end of summer. The official jobs report will be released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern on Friday. Separately, the Chicago PMI held steady at 58.9 in August.

Martin Feldstein,08312017,MarketWatch,08242017,"Published: Aug 30, 2017 2:28 p.m. ET Impact on budget deficit should be temporary, writes Martin Feldstein By CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Project Syndicate) — The Republican Party’s leaders in the United States House of Representatives have been hard at work for more than a year designing a major reform of personal and corporate taxes. With an election looming in 2018, the House Republicans are determined to deliver a reform package and send it to the Senate for enactment. This reform will be very different from the last major tax overhaul enacted back in 1986. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 focused on the personal income tax, lowering the top rate from 50% to 28% and cutting rates for lower-income taxpayers. The revenue loss was offset by changes in tax deductions and other accounting rules, producing a reform that was revenue neutral at each income level, even without taking into account the effects of lower tax rates on increasing economic growth and taxable incomes. Also read: Live blog of President Trump’s speech on tax cuts In the 30 years since 1986, the tax rates for high-income taxpayers rose significantly, from 28% to 39.6%, with an extra 3.8% tax on these taxpayers’ investment income. A detailed study by the Congressional Budget Office of taxes between 1979 and 2013 concluded that while the effective tax rate fell in every quintile of the income distribution, it rose well above that 35-year average for taxpayers in the top 1% of the income distribution. The House Republican plan would cut the top tax rate back to 30% or lower, with comparable reductions for those now facing lower tax rates. The new tax law might also follow the Canadian example and eliminate the estate tax, while imposing a tax on capital gains accrued before the taxpayer’s death. To offset some of the resulting revenue loss, the new law might eliminate tax deductions for state and local taxes, and tax some of the fringe benefits that are currently excluded from taxable income. The big difference between the House Republicans’ plan and the 1986 tax reform is that the current proposal would also address the tax treatment of corporate profits and other business income. The statutory tax rate on corporate profits is now 35%, the highest in the OECD. The new legislation would reduce that rate to 25% or less, spurring a shift in capital flows away from investments in housing and agriculture, and toward domestic corporate investment. Also read: Henry Aaron on why tax reform is doomed to fail this year The new tax law is also likely to boost domestic corporate investment by changing the tax treatment of the profits of U.S. corporations’ foreign subsidiaries. Under current law, a subsidiary pays tax on profits to the government of the country where those profits are earned. It can then invest the after-tax profits anywhere in the world outside the U.S. But if it brings those funds back to the U.S. to invest or pay dividends to shareholders, it must pay the full U.S. corporate tax rate, with a credit for the tax already paid to the foreign government. This penalty on repatriating funds causes U.S. firms to leave those after-tax profits abroad. The U.S. Treasury estimates that American subsidiaries’ offshore investments stand at more than $2.5 trillion. This method of taxing the profits of foreign subsidiaries is unique to the U.S. Every other industrial country uses what is known as the territorial method, in which profits of foreign subsidiaries can be brought home with little or no extra tax. By shifting the U.S. toward such a system, the Republican proposal would stimulate repatriation of some of the funds that have been accumulated abroad, as well as increased inflows of future foreign profits. What does all this mean for the budget deficit? The CBO estimates that the deficit will rise from 3.4% of gross domestic product to more than 4% over the next 10 years, even with no change in tax rules. The direct impact of lowering tax rates on personal income and corporate profits will be to reduce tax revenue and increase the budget deficit. But this will be offset by limits on personal tax deductions and exclusions, and the lower tax rates on personal income will boost taxable incomes as individuals increase earnings and compensation shifts from fringe benefits to taxable cash. Likewise, the move to a territorial tax system will raise taxable profits, especially in the short term, as companies repatriate some of the existing stock of overseas funds. Although the net tax changes may widen the budget deficit in the short term, the incentive effects of lower tax rates and the increased accumulation of capital will mean faster economic growth and higher real incomes, both of which will cause rising taxable incomes and lower long-term deficits. There is an important legislative reason why the projected budget will return to surplus in the future. The Republicans have only a very small majority in the Senate, where the filibuster rule requires a three-fifths majority to pass most legislation, giving the Democrats the ability to block the Republican tax agenda. But an exception allows tax and spending bills to be passed with a simple majority if the resulting budget returns to surplus after 10 years. By designing the tax and spending rules accordingly and phasing in future revenue increases, the Republicans can achieve the needed long-term surpluses. As a result, I am optimistic that a tax reform serving to increase capital formation and growth will be enacted, and that any resulting increase in the budget deficit will be only temporary.

Myra P. Saefong,08312017,MarketWatch,08242017,"Published: Aug 31, 2017 7:49 p.m. ET 1 million barrels of oil can produce half a million barrels of gasoline By U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry authorized an emergency release of oil from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve on Thursday in an effort to ease shortages of gasoline in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, but analysts doubt it will have much impact. I authorized the SPR to execute an emergency exchange agreement authorizing crude oil to be drawn down from @ENERGY site. #Harvey Statement: pic.twitter.com/9TQXwiQfmd Perry first authorized a release of 500,000 barrels of crude oil from the emergency oil reserve early Thursday. A spokeswoman said it would be delivered directly by pipeline directly to the Phillips 66 refinery in Lake Charles, La. “This is a drop in the bucket,” said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy. It “won’t do much” and while it will be enough oil for two days of operations, “we need the Port of Houston to open to make a notable difference.” On Thursday afternoon, the Energy Department announced the release of another 500,000 barrels of oil from the reserve, taking the total release to 1 million barrels. “Hurricane Harvey has been far more devastating for U.S. energy infrastructure than anyone could have imagined even a week ago,” said Dave Ernsberger, global head of energy at S&P Global Platts. He said the SPR is “often criticized in the industry because it usually ends up offering to provide more crude, on an emergency basis, when what the market really needs is refined products like gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.” But “the scale of the storm is so massive that this could be the first time in a long time when crude supplies might be increasingly tapped in to,” said Ernsberger. “No crude vessels have called into Houston [ports] for five days, and it might be quite some time before they do again.” So let’s do the math: U.S. refineries produced an average of about 20 gallons of motor gasoline and about of 11 gallons of ultralow sulfur distillate fuel oil from one 42-gallon barrel of crude oil, according to the Energy Information Administration. Many other petroleum products are refined from crude oil. But if you look at just gasoline, that 1 million barrels of oil would produce about half a million barrels of gasoline, according to James Williams, energy economist at WTRG Economics. The amount of oil could feed refinery operations for around 4 days and “make enough gasoline to fuel U.S. autos for an hour and 15 minutes,” he said. In 2016, U.S. drivers consumed about 143.37 billion gallons, or about 3.41 billion barrels, of finished motor gasoline, according to the EIA, a daily average of about 391.73 million gallons, or 9.33 million barrels. At the retail level, the average price per gallon for regular unleaded gasoline stood at $2.482 late Thursday afternoon, according to GasBuddy. That’s up 13 cents from last week’s average. Read: Why September’s gasoline futures contract has left October’s in the dust The SPR release shows that refineries still in operation are having a hard time finding crude, or at least the grade of crude they need, said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group. “With refining margins soaring, refiners are going to be paying up to get their hands on crude,” he said. Many domestic and international refiners will be putting off maintenance, helping drive demand for crude. If gasoline prices continue to soar, “crude prices will be dragged higher.” On Thursday, October West Texas Intermediate crude

Chris Edelson,08312017,MarketWatch,08242017,"Published: Aug 24, 2017 11:58 a.m. ET U.S. business leaders should call for the president to resign By In ordinary times, it would be a mistake to expect CEOs to take a national leadership role during political crisis. CEOs are risk-averse and rarely see any upside to weighing in publicly on political debate. But these are not ordinary times. CEOs already see that the biggest risk for them when it comes to President Donald Trump is failing to act. The blowback from the Charlottesville, Va. violence and the resultant implosion of Trump’s business councils shows that CEOs can play a pivotal role by taking a stand against the president. With the United States facing what Republican Senator Ben Sasse described — back in March —  as a “civilization-warping crisis of public trust,” business titans have already displayed backbone by rebuking the president in the days since Charlottesville. They can do more. CEOs have had to act because of public demand and because the Republican-controlled Congress has not. Having taken the important first step of disbanding the White House business councils, the CEOs who have left these councils (and their peers) should now go further and call for Trump's resignation. These former council members are the most important CEOs in the nation — leaders of General Electric

                                   , and more. CEOs need to act in unison, coalescing behind a common statement —  a CEO manifesto — that we provide below. This need not be a pipe dream; After all, the CEOs in the president’s councils not only agreed to disband and resign, but some were also discussing  condemning Trump. GM CEO Mary Barra’s involvement, ironically, harkens back to that classic dictum, uttered in 1953 by then GM CEO Charles Erwin Wilson when GM was the most powerful corporation in America: ""What was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa."" What Barra and other prominent CEOs seem to be saying now is that Trump is not good for the country, and the corollary: that his leadership not good for General Motors or other big U.S. companies. Yet if CEOs instead sit on the sidelines, will future generations see them as complicit in lending support to a president who threatens core American values of morality, democracy, society, and capitalism? American business, however economically motivated, has more of a moral compass than Trump, and in this moment, morality and business considerations overlap. To be sure, some  CEOs opposed Trump early on,   during the presidential campaign. After the inauguration, some CEOs (especially from technology) countered the president  on immigration, signing on to an amicus brief and making public statements.  Other CEOs spoke up  after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement. What is needed now is dramatic, decisive, and collective action to save the country from an out-of-control president.  Let’s consider how CEOs might support a manifesto calling for the president’s resignation. Step 1 —  A trigger:  One trigger for action just happened with Trump’s response to Charlottesville; but other triggers are likely in the coming weeks and months. A trigger may also result from the legal inquiries against the president.  And there may be foreign events (the standoff with North Korea); or a stock market downturn. Step 2 — Coalesce and confer:  We know that such gatherings, via conference calls, took place  soon after Charlottesville. The largest density of CEOs is in the Business Roundtable, which is aligned with Trump’s deregulation and tax reduction agenda.The Roundtable is led by JPMorgan Chase CEO

Bearish near-term price action. To reiterate, an eventual close atop the breakdown point would place the S&P on firmer technical ground. Conversely, first support (2,437) is followed by a firmer floor matching the August low (2,417). Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is traversing a near-term range. In its case, first support (21,770) is followed by a firmer floor matching the breakout point (21,682) better illustrated on the daily chart. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite’s price action remains technical. Consider that the prevailing range top closely matches the late-June peak (6,303) also illustrated below. Slightly more broadly, the Nasdaq continues to range around the 50-day moving average, currently 6,281. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq’s August price action remains jagged, capped by the 6,342 breakdown point. An eventual close higher would neutralize the early-month downdraft. Separately, the Nasdaq has staged an extended late-August retest of the 50-day moving average. Combined, the bearish late-July reversal, subsequent failed retest of the 6,342 resistance, and more recent sluggishness at the 50-day moving average, constitute a bearish-leaning near- to intermediate-term backdrop. Looking elsewhere, the Dow industrials’ backdrop remains stronger. The blue-chip benchmark has thus far maintained the breakout point (21,682) a level matching the 50-day moving average, currently 21,684. This area has drawn buyers early Tuesday. Conversely, last week’s high (21,912) closely matched the 20-day moving average, a level that has capped the Dow since Aug. 17. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has failed a headline technical test — at least so far. Specifically, the S&P has registered five straight session highs closely matching the 2,453 resistance, without closing higher. Recall that the flatlining 50-day moving average, currently 2,451, effectively matches resistance. Broadly speaking, the August consolidation phase remains underway against a persistently uneven technical backdrop.

As always, the 200-day is a widely-tracked longer-term trending indicator, and a posture lower raises the flag to a potential primary trend shift. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 is vacillating at the 200-day moving average, currently 311.35. More broadly, the small- and mid-cap benchmarks are rising from three-month lows — following a tandem violation of the 200-day moving average — and the rally attempt has thus far been flat. Bearish price action. An eventual rally atop the trending indicators would mark technical progress. All told, the U.S. benchmarks continue to digest the year’s most technically damaging downdraft. (To be sure, the 2017 uptrend has been so strong that it presents a low bar for a downturn to register as the year’s most damaging.) The downturn has been relatively broadly-based, and fueled by increased volume, contributing to the violation of several key technical levels. Recall that the small- and mid-cap benchmarks have ventured under the 200-day moving average, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have violated major support, and failed the initial retest from underneath. By comparison, the August rally attempts have registered as flat. At least so far. Tactically, the S&P 500’s headline 2,453 resistance closely matches the 50-day moving average, and a close higher would mark technical progress. The recent extended retest, from underneath, has thus far drawn selling pressure. Conversely, S&P 2,405 matches important support, as initially detailed Aug. 18. An eventual violation would mark an intermediate-term “lower low” raising the flag to more serious technical concerns. Beyond the prevailing intermediate-term consolidation phase, the S&P 500’s more important primary uptrend is intact.

Consider that major support spans from 2.10 to 2.12, levels matching the June low and the bottom of the November gap. This area is under siege early Tuesday, and the retest remains a “watch out.” To reiterate, a sustained break lower places the yield in less-charted territory, leaving it vulnerable to potentially material downside follow-through.

                                   companies are up 11% from a year earlier, per S&P Global Market Intelligence. That performance has been led by a three-fold increase in earnings by energy companies benefiting from higher oil prices. The technology sector has also been a big driver, rising 21%. Any company’s earnings results can be skewed by accounting adjustments and one-time items. So we thought it would provide food for thought for stock pickers to look at companies that had significantly increased their sales per share, while also being rated highly by analysts. We focused on sales per share, rather than raw revenue numbers, because the per-share numbers account for any dilution from the issuance of shares for any reason (including stock-based compensation packages for executives), while also reflecting any declines in share counts from stock buybacks. Also see: This could be the perfect time to buy shares of Exxon Mobil and Chevron First, we identified the 169 companies in the S&P 500 that had increased sales per share by at least 10% in the past year from the prior 12-month period.

          Updated Aug 29, 2017 11:06 AM EDT As Hurricane Harvey continues to pound the Gulf Coast as a tropical storm, drivers across the U.S. are bracing for the impact on their wallets. Gasoline costs already edging up following the most destructive storm since Hurricane Sandy in 2012 -- and analysts said prices at the pump are likely to rise between 5 cents and 15 cents nationwide in the weeks ahead. The national average price for a gallon of gas rose to $2.37 on Tuesday, according to AAA. That's a 4-cent increase from the previous week, and the most gas has cost since June 2. Indiana, Ohio, Florida and Michigan saw the largest week-over-week price jumps. One reason for that increase is that Harvey is disrupting fuel supplies. Many oil refineries in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Galveston, Texas, closed Friday ahead of the storm and remained shut through Monday. That has lowered the country's refining capacity by 3 million gallons a day, or about one-sixth of the total, said Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service. ""It's still really early to tell what this is going to mean for long-term supply,"" he said. ""If some of these refineries are flooded, it's going to take weeks to get the water out of there and then get into damage assessment."" Even though the high winds and seawater surge from the storm have abated, the rain is expected to keep falling in the Houston area until at least Thursday, with some areas getting up to 50 inches of rain. That also puts refineries at risk. ""As the amount of rain continues to add up, there's more and more risk that there could be water damage, especially to storage facilities and underground pipelines,"" said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy. DeHaan predicted that the storm would add about 15 cents per gallon to the cost of oil; Cinquegrana put the increase at 5 to 10 cents. By comparison, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which struck Louisiana and Texas in 2005, caused a 40 cent jump in gas prices. Another factor cushioning the blow somewhat is that the country's production of gas is near a 10-year peak, with oil stocks last week reaching 463 million barrels. If the crunch continues, consumers can expect to see unbranded gas stations -- those that don't carry the name of a petroleum company, like Exxon or Shell -- to run out first, Cinquegrana said. Those distribution channels are cut off first if there is a gas shortage; because of that, they also tend to be the first to increase their prices slightly. But not all areas of the country will feel the costs equally. The Midwest, in particular, is likely to see prices jump by about 25 cents a gallon later in the week, DeHaan said. In Missouri and Illinois, average gas prices from Monday to Tuesday rose by 7 and 9 cents, respectively. That stems from what is known as price cycling, where competing gas stations gradually lower their prices and then reset them mid-week. ""Harvey has pushed that price cycling to occur sooner than it usually does,"" he said. Spots in the Northeast are also seeing trouble, OPIS said. Valero, a major oil refiner based in San Antonio, Texas, shut off shipments of unbranded petroleum to about 20 terminals in the northeast, OPIS reported, causing prices at some stations to jump 7 or 8 cents. (Valero did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) The Houston area itself might not see a long-term increase in gas prices, putting aside examples of isolated stations hiking prices in the storm's aftermath. That's because the extreme flooding is expected to deter driving over the coming weeks. Once the water recedes, the municipal repair and reconstruction necessary for residents to start driving again can take months -- far longer that it will likely take for the oil refineries to come back online. ""Storms like this tend to have much longer implications for [gasoline] demand than supply,"" Cinquegrana said. A decade after the Great Recession, the U.S. economy still hasn't made up the ground it lost The top-paying jobs tend to cluster in two industries -- and may prove less vulnerable automation Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

It is unclear if a jump in gasoline prices is long-lasting because we don’t know how soon refineries will be up and running,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading.

At the close, 2.61 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1.54 billion trading on the Nasdaq. Trading volumes were especially light last week, coming in below already seasonally low August averages. Daily average trading volume in August for the NYSE stands at 3.09 billion shares and 1.79 billion shares for the Nasdaq, according to Dow Jones data. “Unless we hit some macro[economic] issues, we’re in a little bit of a lull,” said Diane Jaffee, senior portfolio manager at TCW, in an interview. “Earnings are still lending strength to the overall tone of the market, and people were thinking something would come out of Jackson Hole but nothing happened, so it’s business as usual.” Jaffee said attention is more focused on company specifics, such as Gilead Sciences Inc.

Now a tropical storm, Harvey devastated Houston, the fourth-largest city in the U.S., leaving its citizens grappling with unprecedented flooding. The National Weather Service warned that rainfall may exceed a record-breaking 50 inches in areas around Houston. The storm, which was moving toward Louisiana on Monday, knocked out almost 15% of the nation’s fuel-making capacity and further disruptions were anticipated. The coast of Texas hosts nearly 30% of U.S. refining capacity, and Houston-area plants account for roughly half of that.

                                   cancer vaccine platform “could overcome issues that have plagued the field of therapeutic cancer vaccines in the past,” Chang said, because its approach “mimics the natural generation of protective immunity.” One of the company’s vaccine platforms, ZVex, “‘primes’ the immune system by in vivo targeting of dendritic cells that leads to optimal antigen presentation and production of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs),” while the other platform, GLAAS, “can further ‘boost’ the immune response by expanding and enhancing the function of CTLs,” Chang said. CMB305, which was developed using ZVex, targets an antigen that’s expressed in many kinds of tumors, according to Immune Design. It’s being studied as a combination in a mid-stage trial for soft tissue sarcoma and on its own in an early-stage trial for solid tumors, Chang said. Related:  Lifestyle gets blame for 70% to 90% of all cancers and 4 lifestyle changes to reduce your cancer risk Another vaccine, G100, was developed using GLAAS and is being studied in an early/midstage trial on its own and in combination for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, according to Chang. Immune Design is also studying the ZVex and GLAAS platforms in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, he said, referring to a class of cancer drugs that work on the immune system. New research results expected in the second half of this year and in 2018, including mid-stage trial results expected by a Sept. 11 cancer conference, could lift the company’s stock, Chang said. He rates the company outperform with a $18 price target. The first vaccine to treat cancer, Provenge, was approved for some men with metastatic prostate cancer in 2010. At the time, it was considered a major advance in cancer research. But the expensive product — which cost $93,000 for a course of treatment that improves patient survival by more than four months — didn’t sell as well as its then-owner, Dendreon, expected.

,09072017,Reuters,08312017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc said on Wednesday that it will offer Obamacare plans in only about half of the counties in Kentucky next year, after covering the whole state in 2017. The insurer said it will offer the healthcare plans in 59 counties in the state in 2018. It said all 120 counties in Kentucky will still have a carrier offering plans next year. Health insurers are facing an upheaval in their businesses amid growing uncertainty about healthcare legislation under President Donald Trump, who seeks to follow through on his promise to dismantle former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. Insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc have exited most of the states where they sold Obamacare plans, leaving hundreds of U.S. counties at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018. But other insurers, including Centene Corp, have filled those gaps, expanding into counties that had lost their coverage options. Every U.S. county is currently projected to have at least one insurer offering Obamacare individual coverage next year. Still, 1,487 counties could have only one insurer in 2018. ","

,09072017,Reuters,08312017,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis’s new gene-modifying cancer therapy’s $475,000-per-patient sticker price has drawn fire from advocate groups calling for cheaper drugs, but analysts said the Swiss drugmaker could initially struggle to break even. In a first for gene therapy in the United States, regulators approved Kymriah on Wednesday for patients up to 25 years of age who have relapsed or not been helped by previous treatment for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). While patient groups hailed the potent immunotherapy as a potential cancer game-changer, the Swiss drugmaker was also criticized for setting a price that places Kymriah among the most-expensive drugs ever. It trails only a couple of gene therapies for ulta-rare diseases. Since taxpayers have chipped in more than $200 million over the years for related research — much early work on the drug was done at the University of Pennsylvania — Novartis should have used more restraint, the Patients for Affordable Drugs lobby group said. “We believe it is excessive,” said David Mitchell, a cancer patient who founded the group. “Novartis should not get credit for bringing a $475,000 drug to market and claiming they could have charged people a lot more.” Novartis estimates that only 600 ALL patients a year would be eligible for Kymriah, making the initial pool for the treatment relatively scarce and worth less than $300 million. The company is also targeting the several thousand people a year who have relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) diagnosed, but it will not file Kymriah for that group until later this year. BREAK-EVEN POINT? Success with those patients is key to Novartis turning Kymriah into the $1 billion-a-year blockbuster drug the Swiss company predicts it will eventually become, but analysts say it is anyone’s guess when it will start covering its costs. “It is not clear what the break-even point for profitability is, as this is a very capital intensive endeavor,” said Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson, adding that Novartis is likely to cut the price of Kymriah for DLBCL patients. On Thursday Novartis said that its cost of goods per Kymriah treatment is confidential commercial information, but analysts estimate it could be as high as $200,000. The process is complex. Doctors remove T cells from each cancer victim and ship the material to its factory in Morris Plains, New Jersey. After re-engineering them to attack cancer, frozen cells are returned a couple weeks later for reinfusion into patients. Additionally, Novartis partner Oxford BioMedica, which supplies a key ingredient, may be due $100 million over the next three years, plus royalties on sales. Furthermore, competition is on the horizon. Gilead Sciences this week announced an $11.9 billion deal to buy Kite Pharma to gain access to a similar drug, while Bluebird Bio and Juno Therapeutics are all working on their own CAR-T therapies. While Kymriah’s price tag will grab headlines, it pales in comparison with some other gene therapy treatments. For instance, UniQure’s Glybera, for a very rare blood disorder, runs at about $1 million per patient. Meanwhile, GlaxoSmithKline’s Strimvelis, for so-called “bubble boy” disease, comes in at about $700,000 per patient. Novartis points out that some groups think the company could actually have charged more for Kymriah. British health authorities, for instance, had said that up to $650,000 might have been justified if the treatment added years to children’s lives. Novartis plans to charge insurers and payers only when the drug proves to be effective one month into treatment, a so-called “outcome-based” pricing scheme that puts some of the risk of the drug on its manufacturer. Even so, analysts hardly expect that to shield Novartis from criticism. “Expect turbulent public discussions on drug pricing, demonstrating that the road to hell is paved with good intentions,” said Bruno Bulic of equity research firm Baader Helvea. Bulic forecasts that Kymriah will start adding to Novartis’s bottom line only after 2019, when it is expected to be given to more patient groups. ","

,09072017,Reuters,08312017,"Reuters Health - The percentage of U.S. adults under age 65 who skip essential prescription drugs because of price has declined, a five-year study found. But consistently, problems with financial access to medication were more common in cancer survivors. “Spending on prescription drugs to treat cancer has been increasing in the United States, and many newer cancer drugs have annual price tags of $100,000 or more,” study co-author K. Robin Yabroff told Reuters Health in an email. Patient cost-sharing has also been increasing in recent years, she noted. And there have been significant changes in financial hardship due to costs of prescription drugs between 2011 and 2015, said Yabroff, who is a researcher with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, DC. Multiple studies have shown that cancer survivors are more likely to have high out-of-pocket spending for health care and be worried about their medical bills than those without a cancer history, said Yabroff. “In this study, we wanted to examine changes in financial access to prescription drugs over time and whether any changes differed for cancer survivors,” she said. As reported in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, online August 24, Yabroff’s team analyzed data on nearly 200,000 adults who participated in the National Health Interview Survey. In 2010, almost 14% of cancer survivors ages 18 to 64 said they had forgone needed prescription drugs because of cost during the previous 12 months, compared to 11% of their peers without a history of cancer. By 2015, those rates were down for both groups but were still higher for cancer survivors, at roughly 9%, than for those without a cancer history, at just under 7%. In each of the six years studied, cancer survivors were more likely to report forgoing prescription drugs in the past year because of cost, Yabroff said. Cancer survivors were also more likely to be older and have more chronic conditions than those without a cancer history, and both of these characteristics may be associated with greater need for prescription drugs, said Yabroff. But even after the researchers took age and chronic medical problems into account, cancer survivors were still more likely to report limited financial access to prescription medications, she said. For adults 65 or older, a cancer history did not seem to affect financial access to medications. The vast majority of U.S. adults in that age group, however, are insured with Medicare, which may minimize barriers to financial access to prescription drugs, Yabroff added. Going forward, Yabroff said, it will be important to study why cancer survivors are more likely to forgo prescription drugs because of cost and whether skipping those drugs is associated with more emergency room visits or potentially avoidable hospitalizations. “A number of factors will likely play a role in financial access to prescription drugs in the future, including economic trends, the price of prescription drugs, level of patient cost-sharing, and type of health insurance coverage. It will be important to continue to evaluate trends in financial access to prescription drugs,” she said. SOURCE: bit.ly/2vxEPy6 J Natl Cancer Inst 2017. ","

,09072017,Reuters,08312017,"LONDON (Reuters) - Wayne Rooney’s international days are now behind him but Marcus Rashford offered ample evidence that he could follow in the footsteps of England’s record goalscorer with a match-winning display against Slovakia on Monday. Almost 14 years to the day since a 17-year-old Rooney scored the first of his 53 England goals in a European Championship qualifier against Macedonia, 19-year-old Rashford bagged his first competitive strike for his country in stunning fashion. Receiving the ball from England skipper Jordan Henderson 25 metres out there was only one thought in the Manchester United striker’s head as he looked up and lashed an unstoppable low shot past Slovakia keeper Martin Dubravka in the 59th minute. It earned England a 2-1 victory that had looked unlikely when Rashford’s mistake allowed Slovakia to take a shock third-minute lead at Wembley in the Group F World Cup qualifier. England now look set to qualify for next year’s finals in Russia and Rashford, who is also hoping to fill Rooney’s boots at Old Trafford after his return to boyhood club Everton, will surely be a major part of manager Gareth Southgate’s plans. “He is so mature,” Southgate, whose decision to start Rashford rather than Raheem Sterling was vindicated, told reporters. “The start surprised me. But he is never in awe of the occasion. He doesn’t fear anything. “He is still a work in progress as we saw at the beginning of the game. He is still getting stronger and his impact taking people on and getting us up the pitch is huge. “It’s early for Marcus so we have to keep things in perspective. He is exciting.” Livewire Rashford combined well with Harry Kane and Dele Alli on occasions and his pace and skill continually stretched Slovakia’s defence and allowed England to regain some control after a dreadful opening 35 minutes. The striker, who marked his club debut in 2016 with two goals in a Europa League tie to become United’s youngest scorer in European competition and then scored two on his Premier League debut against Arsenal days later, was named man of the match on Monday and was cheered as he was replaced late on. Apart from his winner he also set up Eric Dier’s 37th minute equaliser with a corner and forced Dubravka to make a great save before halftime. “Marcus Rashford’s night? It wasn’t so good to begin with but it got better.” Dier said. “A fantastic show of character, after making a mistake, to score the winner which got us closer to the World Cup where hopefully he will shine.” Rashford’s contribution glossed over another patchy England display that would have been punished by teams with more quality than Slovakia who now face a battle with Scotland and Slovenia to finish as runners-up and qualify for a playoff spot. Southgate, however, preferred to focus on the way his side recovered their composure. “We showed resilience and the tactical reaction on the pitch was good to see,” he said. “They are incredibly young and it’s a good experience to go through as long as you win because it starts to build some inner belief. “I’m pleased we controlled the game in the second half. They showed maturity. We didn’t start well, they pressed us well and we weren’t able to cope with that. But we got that right and once we went 2-1 up we were difficult to play through.” ","

,09072017,Reuters,08312017,"SITTWE, Myanmar (Reuters) - Around 120,000 displaced people - mostly Rohingya Muslims - in camps in Myanmar’s Rakhine state are not receiving food supplies or healthcare after the U.N. and aid groups suspended operations following government accusations of supporting insurgents. Nearly 400 people have died in fighting in the far north of the state after Rohingya militants attacked police posts and an army base a week ago, provoking a major army counteroffensive. The impact from the conflict has now spread, including to the state capital Sittwe further south, where some 90,000 Rohingya have lived in camps since an outbreak of communal violence rocked the city in 2012, killing nearly 200 people. A further 30,000 Rohingya are housed in camps elsewhere in the state, while a small number of ethnic Rakhine Buddhists displaced in the 2012 violence also live in separate camps. “As a result of the disruption of activities in central Rakhine state, many people are currently not receiving their normal food assistance and primary healthcare services have been severely disrupted,” said Pierre Peron, a spokesman for the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The U.N. and international aid groups had already evacuated all “non-critical” staff from the north of the state amid intensifying fighting and after the office of national leader Aung San Suu Kyi repeatedly published pictures of World Food Programme (WFP) energy biscuits allegedly found at an insurgent camp. Suu Kyi’s office also said it was investigating aid groups’ support for the insurgents in one incident. Now contractors working for the WFP, a U.N. agency, have refused to carry food to the camps in Sittwe and elsewhere. Staff with international aid groups who run clinics inside the large, densely populated camps have also been afraid to show up for work, leading to the closure of facilities, U.N. sources and aid workers told Reuters. Local staff were afraid of being intimidated by Rakhine Buddhist hardliners, and some worried about being attacked by Muslims, the sources said. Sanitation is also a major problem - contractors cleaning latrines in the camps have also refused to work and the latrines are overflowing in the monsoon rains, increasing the risk of cholera and other waterborne diseases, they said. The treatment of Myanmar’s roughly 1.1 million Rohingya, who have long complained of persecution in Buddhist majority Myanmar, is the biggest challenge facing Suu Kyi. The top U.N. human rights official, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, has criticized Suu Kyi’s office for “irresponsible” suggestions that aid agencies may have assisted Rohingya militants calling themselves the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). “#WFP Aid & #ARSA terrorists : #Myanmar Govt asking #WFP, Aid for civilian or terrorists? #Rakhine #Myanmar,” said Suu Kyi’s spokesman, Zaw Htay, in a tweet on Thursday. Tin Maung Swe, secretary of the Rakhine state government, confirmed that workers have refused to work for the WFP. “Laborers who carry the WFP food bags don’t want to contract with them any more. People who have made contract with WFP refused to work for them,” he said. He added that residents were “disgusted” with the organization following the government’s accusations. Tin Maung Swe also said that the government was trying to find “a different way to support the organization”. Rakhine Buddhist leaders have long bemoaned the presence of international agencies, who they accuse of favoring the Rohingya. Aid offices in Sittwe were sacked during 2014 riots. The discovery at a suspected militant camp on July 30 of WFP-branded biscuits intended for malnourished children had further stoked tensions even before last week’s attacks. Accusations against the U.N. have been spread on social media by nationalist hardliners, stoking fears of another outbreak of communal violence in a state that has long been divided along religious and ethnic lines. International aid agencies operating in Myanmar issued a statement on Thursday condemning the insurgent attacks and subsequent violence, and urging “all stakeholders to cease the spread of misinformation”. The OCHA’s Peron said the disruption was already being felt. “Humanitarian aid normally goes to these vulnerable people for a very good reason, because they depend on it,” he said. In addition to the closure of camp clinics, Rohingya who have been referred to the main hospital in Sittwe for more serious complaints were finding it hard to travel there, said the hospital’s chief doctor Kyaw Naing Win. “There have been some constraints for them to come to the hospital because of the tighter security control after recent clashes,” he said, but added the hospital did not discriminate against them. Kyaw Naing Win said he arranged for the state government to provide security for 17 Muslim patients who were discharged from the hospital on Thursday. Even before the recent violence Rohingya camp residents faced severe restrictions on their movements around Sittwe. Talks between government and relief agencies are scheduled for next week, aid group sources told Reuters. Possible solutions might include the government providing security escorts for food convoys, they added. (This story has been refiled to remove extraneous words in paragraph 6) ","

,09072017,Reuters,08312017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Advanced hackers have targeted United States and European energy companies in a cyber espionage campaign that has in some cases successfully broken into the core systems that control the companies’ operations, according to researchers at the security firm Symantec. Malicious email campaigns have been used to gain entry into organizations in the United States, Turkey and Switzerland, and likely other countries well, Symantec said in a report published on Wednesday. The cyber attacks, which began in late 2015 but increased in frequency in April of this year, are probably the work of a foreign government and bear the hallmarks of a hacking group known as Dragonfly, Eric Chien, a cyber security researcher at Symantec, said in an interview. The research adds to concerns that industrial firms, including power providers and other utilities, are susceptible to cyber attacks that could be leveraged for destructive purposes in the event of a major geopolitical conflict. In June the U.S. government warned industrial firms about a hacking campaign targeting the nuclear and energy sectors, saying in an alert seen by Reuters that hackers sent phishing emails to harvest credentials in order to gain access to targeted networks. Chien said he believed that alert likely referenced the same campaign Symantec has been tracking. He said dozens of companies had been targeted and that a handful of them, including in the United States, had been compromised on the operational level. That level of access meant that motivation was “the only step left” preventing “sabotage of the power grid,” Chien said. However, other researchers cast some doubt on the findings. While concerning, the attacks were “far from the level of being able to turn off the lights, so there’s no alarmism needed,” said Robert M. Lee, founder of U.S. critical infrastructure security firm Dragos Inc, who read the report. Lee called the connection to Dragonfly “loose.” Dragonfly was previously active from around to 2011 to 2014, when it appeared to go dormant after several cyber firms published research exposing its attacks. The group, also known as Energetic Bear or Koala, was widely believed by security experts to be tied to the Russian government. Symantec did not name Russia in its report but noted that the attackers used code strings that were in Russian.

 ,09072017,Reuters,08312017,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Cholera has broken out in northeast Nigeria at a camp for people displaced by the eight year conflict with Boko Haram, aid group Médecins Sans Frontières said on Thursday, bringing disease to communities already underfed and living in squalor. The outbreak in the city of Maiduguri, the epicenter of the fight against the Islamist insurgents, confirms aid groups’ fears that Nigeria’s rainy season could spread disease in camps for the internally displaced that are often already unsanitary. About 1.8 million have abandoned their homes because of violence or food shortages, U.N. agencies say, and many of them live in camps for the displaced throughout northeast Nigeria, particularly in Maiduguri and the surrounding state of Borno. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, is increasing its “efforts to prevent further deaths and the spread of cholera in Maiduguri”, the group said. MSF said it had set up a 40-bed cholera treatment unit, which has admitted 70 patients, mostly from the Muna Garage camp. “Following heavy rains, the camp is partly flooded, making the already poor sanitary conditions at the camp even worse, which is an additional risk factor during a cholera outbreak,” MSF said, adding that a potential case has been reported from another part of Maiduguri. “Since last weekend, we have witnessed a steady increase in the number of patients at our treatment center and at the rehydration point in Muna camp,” said Anne-Cecile Niard, MSF project coordinator in the statement. “We are worried that the number of beds that are currently planned will not be enough to cope at the peak of the outbreak.” More than 20,000 people have been killed in the conflict with Boko Haram, and 5.2 million people in the northeast do not have secure access to food, with tens of thousands already in famine-like conditions, according to the United Nations.

 ,09072017,Reuters,08312017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Yolanda Varona is encouraging her children and thousands of other young Mexicans who may lose their right to live in the United States to stay and fight to achieve their American Dream. Varona is the mother of two of the 800,000 people, most of them Mexicans, who could face deportation after U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday eliminated the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programme (DACA). DACA gave work permits to people known as “Dreamers” who were brought to the United States illegally as children by immigrants like Varona. Trump scrapped the Obama-era programme, but delayed implementation until March to give Congress a chance to draft an alternative. After Varona was deported in 2010 and separated from her two children in the United States, she set up a chapter of Dreamers’ Moms in the border city of Tijuana. The group, founded in the United States by parents of Dreamers and other activists, has organised legal education workshops for immigrants across the United States. The Tijuana chapter has 80 mothers whose children in the United States could lose the legal protection that originally convinced them to risk registering with the U.S. government to join DACA. “We want them to keep fighting, they can achieve better things there,” Varona said by telephone. “In the unfortunate case that the police arrive to deport them, we will be there to help them.” Varona said Trump’s decision would drive young people to “live in the shadows” again. She stressed how difficult it was for these youths to return to Mexico, where they have lost family ties and sometimes do not speak the language. Some 625,000 young Mexicans are enrolled under DACA. The Mexican government has offered them legal support and help finding work should they be deported from the United States. But many Dreamers fear returning to an unfamiliar, violence-plagued country offering salaries that are a fraction of what they can earn in the United States. Iliana Flores, a 28-year-old Dreamer in San Diego, across the border from Tijuana, said she was afraid of taking her two young, American-born children back to Mexico, where she said they would not receive a good education and would be surrounded by poverty and violence. “I fear for the future of my children there,” she said. Like millions of Mexicans living in the United States, Flores sends part of the U.S. dollars she earns back to her family, who live in Durango, to help them make ends meet. “The situation in Mexico is unfortunately very difficult,” she said. The U.S.-Mexico border is home to the largest per capita wage differential of any land border on the planet, with average U.S. wages about five times higher than those in Mexico. Carlos Martinez, a young man who came with his parents to California at the age of 11, said he feared he would expose his two children to rising violence and extortion if he was to return to Mexico. The murder rate in Mexico hit a record high this year, reaching levels not seen in homicide data going back two decades. “To be honest, I’m afraid to live in what was once my country,” Martinez said.

 ,09072017,Reuters,08312017,"New York (Reuters) - Sports e-commerce firm Fanatics has closed a $1 billion funding round led by SoftBank Group Corp’s Vision fund, which will give it the firepower to expand internationally, Chief Executive Doug Mack told Reuters. The new funding will value the Jacksonville, Florida-based company that runs online sales for the National Basketball Association and the National Football League at $4.5 billion - more than twice the $2 billion in revenue expected this year, the company said. The majority of Fanatics’ business is in the United States where it licenses merchandise and handles e-commerce sales for items such as sports jerseys for teams. It is hoping to expand its revenue in international markets by leveraging SoftBank’s expertise in Asia, Mack said in an interview on Tuesday. Fanatics, which handles online sales for football clubs Manchester United and Real Madrid, currently gains about 10 percent of its sales internationally. “It will definitely grow many-fold from there,” Mack said, referring to international sales. “We’ve only scratched the surface of the global opportunity. Soccer is the world’s No. 1 sport, and then there’s cricket. You’ll see us extend our rights to international leagues.” SoftBank, run by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, is making the bulk of its investment in Fanatics out of its $93 billion Vision Fund, the world’s biggest private equity fund, SoftBank confirmed the funding. While the majority of the $1 billion in funding comes from SoftBank, the National Football League and Major League Baseball also participated. SoftBank was introduced to Fanatics by Michael Rubin, the company’s executive chairman who previously founded GSI Commerce, a company that attracted an $100 million investment from SoftBank before it was sold to eBay for $2.4 billion. Fanatics is also looking to hire more engineers, data scientists and designers with the cash. Mack said one of the firm’s strengths lay with its technology that allows it to manufacture clothing very quickly. When Fanatics wanted to raise money for victims of the  devastating Hurricane Harvey, it created a “Houston Strong” line of clothing featuring all of the city’s local sports teams. It took less than three days to design the shirts, get permission from the sports teams and start shipping, Mack said. An initial public offering or sale isn’t on the horizon, Mack said, although the company has been spending on deals. In April, it acquired VF Corporation’s sports licensing group, which owns the Majestic sportswear brand, for $225 million. ","

 ,09072017,Reuters,08312017,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Yemen’s cholera outbreak has infected 612,703 people and killed 2,048 since it began in April, and some districts are still reporting sharp rises in new cases, data from the World Health Organization and Yemen’s health ministry showed on Tuesday. The overall spread of the epidemic has slowed in the past two months, with the daily number of new suspected cases cut to around 3,000 in recent days. However the epidemic, the most explosive on record in terms of its rapid spread, has continually confounded expectations. Soon after it began, WHO saw a worst-case scenario of 300,000 cases within six months. But by the end of June, WHO was hoping 218,000 cases might be the halfway mark. In late July it said the spread had peaked after infecting 400,000. Epidemics normally decline as quickly as they arise, so the peak of the disease - which is spread by contaminated food and water - should be roughly half the eventual total caseload. But the decline in the epidemic has been bumpy, and the number of new cases rose in two of the past four weeks. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said some of the most affected areas, such as Sanaa City and the governorates of Hajjah and Amran, had seen falls in the numbers of new cases. But there had been a “sudden and significant increase” in the number of suspected cases reported from 12 districts, in the governorates of Hodeidah, Al Jawf, Al Mahwit, Ibb, Dhamar, Al Bayda and Aden. “WHO is currently investigating the reason for this increase. A key aim of the investigation will be to determine whether the numbers are accurate and whether the spike in suspected cases is, in fact, caused by cholera or another diarrhoeal disease like rotavirus,” Jasarevic said. Save the Children, a charity running cholera treatment centres, said last Friday that suspected cases in Hodeidah governorate had jumped by 40 percent in three weeks amid heavy rains and a heatwave, and in some districts weekly caseloads were double their previous peaks. The United Nations has said the epidemic is man-made, driven by a civil war that has left 15.7 million people without clean water or sanitation. ","

,09072017,Investopedia,08312017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A subsidy is a benefit given to an individual, business or institution, usually by the government. It is usually in the form of a cash payment or a tax reduction. The subsidy is typically given to remove some type of burden, and it is often considered to be in the overall interest of the public, given to promote a social good or an economic policy. A subsidy takes the form of a payment, provided directly or indirectly, which provides a concession to the receiving individual or business entity. Subsidies are generally seen as a privileged type of financial aid, as they lessen an associated burden that was previously levied against the receiver, or promote a particular action by providing financial support. A subsidy typically supports particular sectors of a nation’s economy. It can assist struggling industries by lowering the burdens placed on them, or encourage new developments by providing financial support for the endeavors. Often, these areas are not being effectively supported through the actions of the general economy, or may be undercut by activities in rival economies. Direct subsidies are those that involve an actual payment of funds toward a particular individual, group or industry. Indirect subsidies are those that do not hold a predetermined monetary value or involve actual cash outlays. They can include activities such as price reductions for required goods or services that can be government-supported. This allows the needed items to be purchased below the current market rate, resulting in a savings for those the subsidy is designed to help. There are many forms of subsidies given out by the government. Two of the most common types of individual subsidies are welfare payments and unemployment benefits.  The objective of these types of subsidies is to help people who are temporarily suffering economically.  Other subsidies, such as student loans, are given to encourage people to further their education. With the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, a number of U.S. families became eligible for health-care subsidies, based on household income and size. These subsidies are designed to lower the out-of-pocket costs for health insurance premiums. In these instances, the funds associated with the subsidies are sent directly to the insurance company to which premiums are due, lowering the payment amount required from the household. Subsidies to businesses are given to support an industry that is struggling against international competition that has lowered prices, such that the domestic business is not profitable without the subsidy.  Historically, the vast majority of subsidies in the United States have gone towards four industries: agriculture, financial institutions, oil companies and utilities companies. Different rationales exist for the provision of public subsidies; some are economic, some are political and some come from socio-economic development theory. Development theory suggests that some industries need protection from external competition to maximize domestic benefit. Technically speaking, a free market economy is free of subsidies; introducing one transforms it into a mixed economy. Economists and policy makers often debate the merits of subsidies, and by extension, the degree to which an economy should be a mixed one. Pro-subsidy economists argue that subsidies to particular industries are vital to help support businesses and the jobs they create.  Other economists feel free market forces should determine if a business survives or fails; if it fails, those resources are allocated to a more efficient and profitable use. They argue that subsidies to these businesses simply sustain an inefficient allocation of resources. Subsidies: The Pros Economists who promote a mixed economy often argue that subsidies are justifiable to provide the ""socially optimal"" level of goods and services. In contemporary neoclassical economic models, there are circumstances where the actual supply of a good or service falls below the theoretical equilibrium level – an unwanted shortage, which creates what economists call a ""market failure."" One form of correcting this imbalance is to subsidize the good or service being under supplied. The subsidy lowers the cost for the producers to bring the good or service to market. If the right level of subsidization is provided, all other things being equal, the market failure should be corrected. In other words, according to general equilibrium theory, subsidies are necessary when a market failure causes too little production in a specific area: They would theoretically push production back up to optimal levels. There are many goods or services that allegedly provide what economists call ""positive externalities."" A positive externality is achieved whenever a transaction between two parties provides an indirect benefit to a third party. Many subsidies are implemented to promote positive externalities that might not otherwise be provided at the socially optimal threshold. Some theories of development argue that the governments of less-developed countries should subsidize domestic industries in their infancy to protect them from international competition. This is a popular technique seen in China and various South American nations currently. Subsidies: The Cons Free market economists are wary of subsidies for a variety of reasons. Some argue that subsidies unnecessarily distort markets, preventing efficient outcomes and diverting resources from more productive uses to less productive ones. Similar concerns come from those who suggest economic calculation is too inexact and microeconomic models are too unrealistic to ever correctly calculate the impact of market failure. Others suggest that government spending on subsidies is never as effective as government projections claim they will be. The costs and unintended consequences of applying subsidies are rarely worth it, they claim. Another problem, antagonists say: The act of subsidizing helps corrupt the political process. According to political theories of regulatory capture and rent-seeking, subsidies exist as part of an unholy alliance between big business and the state. Companies often turn to government to shield themselves from competition. In turn, businesses donate to politicians or promise them benefits after their political careers. Even if a subsidy is created with good intentions, without any conspiracy or self-seeking, it raises the profits of those receiving beneficial treatment, and so creates an incentive to lobby for its continuance, even after the need or its usefulness runs out. This potentially allows political and business interests to create a mutual benefit at the expense of taxpayers and/or competitive firms or industries. There are a few different ways to evaluate the success of government subsidies. Most economists consider a subsidy a failure if it fails to improve the overall economy. Policymakers, however, might still consider it a success if it helps achieve a different objective. Most subsidies are long-term failures in the economic sense, but still achieve cultural or political goals. An example of these competing evaluations could be seen in the Great Depression. Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt both set price floors on agricultural products and paid farmers to not produce. Their policy goal was to stop food prices from falling and to protect small farmers. To this extent, the subsidy was a success. But the economic effect was quite different. Artificially high food prices lowered the standard of living for consumers and forced people to spend more on food than they otherwise would have. Those outside of the farm industry were worse off in absolute economic terms. Sometimes both the economic and political results of a subsidy appears to indicate failure. In 2012 and 2013, the Department of Energy (DOE) gave out more than $60 billion in subsidies to renewable (non-oil-based) forms of energy. The DOE anticipated that oil prices would keep increasing, and jump-starting renewable sources could slow dependence on oil. However, the receiving companies failed to turn a profit and oil prices dropped in 2014. Henry Hazlitt, a mid-20th century American business and financial journalist often remarked that bad economics was concerned with only the visible effects, while good economics looked at both the seen and unseen. Subsidies are a classic example of seen versus unseen. Subsidies have an opportunity cost. Take again that Depression Era agricultural subsidy. It had very visible effects; farmers saw profits rise and hired more workers. The invisible costs included what would have happened with all of those dollars without the subsidy. Money from the subsidies had to be taxed from individual income, and consumers were hit again when they faced higher food prices at the grocery store. ",Subsidy Definition | Investopedia

Elizabeth Gurdus,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"CNBC's Jim Cramer has been known to take fantasy football way too seriously, and on Thursday, he took it to the next level. ""It's time for me to show my reality, not fantasy, but reality stock team, the one I drafted in my head last night while I was busily putting together what could be a championship Skidaddy Ski team, which, of course, competes in the Mad Money Schlumpadicka league,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Even though Cramer wouldn't dare draft a quarterback first unless he was picking Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, he began with his stock market equivalent: Apple. ""If there's a rap against Brady, it's that he's an immobile passer. The rap against Apple is that it's just mobile. I look at Apple as the greatest consumer products company of all time, just as I look at Brady as the greatest quarterback of all time,"" Cramer said. Then, Cramer went for fleet-footed players, the market equivalents of six-foot-five wide receivers who aren't afraid of some traffic. He chose the stocks of Amazon, Netflix and Nvidia. Cramer said that Amazon is a winner in a number of ways — a flex play — with Amazon Web Services consistently delivering points and the retail business bringing the heat. ""I keep waiting for another player to have an answer to Amazon. There isn't one,"" he said. The ""Mad Money"" host pegged Netflix as the ""Odell Beckham Jr. of companies"" because it easily makes one-handed catches and each production ends up as a touchdown. ""Classic, value-oriented investors don't like the style of Netflix; too unorthodox, too showboat. But I don't care how a player acts off the field. Netflix is on a whole 'nother plane, a winner which consistently breaks out when you least expect it to,"" Cramer said. His last wide receiver would be Nvidia, a red-hot semiconductor stock with ties to the video game industry, autonomous cars, artificial intelligence and voice technology. ""It's tough to keep Nvidia down,"" Cramer said, pointing to the stock's bounce after what Wall Street saw as a weaker-than-expected quarter. ""Like all great receivers, Nvidia's shaken off the drop and is headed back toward an all-time high."" Alphabet and Facebook were Cramer's choices for running backs because even though their stocks seem overvalued, investors won't regret paying those prices later, he said. Despite Alphabet's recent struggles, Cramer said there was still hope for its stock to break out and urged investors not to give up on the opportunity to buy shares of the Google parent. ""Facebook's a stud. I don't even know if there's an analogue in the NFL as I've never seen anything like this company,"" Cramer said. ""Facebook's one of those backs that gets all-purpose yards for doing nothing but being a platform for two billion people. No NFL player has ever had that kind of pull."" Cramer chose Boeing, the strongest stock in the Dow Jones Industrial average, as his defense play because the aerospace giant simply won't quit. For a tight end, the ""Mad Money"" host went with UnitedHealth. ""Why UNH? Because great tight ends not only catch, they block,"" he said. ""I think that Optum, its amazing data business, is the authority on catching — what's flawed in the system, that is — and nobody blocks wasteful costs like UnitedHealth. They should call UNH 'Gronk.' Got me?"" Cramer's kicker draft was the stock of Visa, a financial technology company that he said is the most consistent of any of its competitors. And for his bench, he'd have Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba as a back-up quarterback, and stocks like Celgene, Autodesk, 3M or Honeywell as additional flex players. ""As you can see, this is a team that's built for the ages, not just built for the season. Yes, it's a bullish team, I acknowledge that. It's not as defensive as some would like. You can keep some cash on the sidelines for a decline,"" Cramer said. ""But if you wanted a playoff-ready team of stocks, it is this one, and it's seasoned, it's ready, it's stacked, it's loaded and it's in total beast mode."" Questions for Cramer?

Dan Mangan,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"The CEO of a herpes vaccine company at the center of a controversy over an offshore clinical trial on Friday said that future testing of the drug will follow U.S. Food and Drug Administration oversight rules, as demanded by a new group of financial backers that includes venture capitalist Peter Thiel. In an impassioned interview, Rational Vaccines Chief Agustin Fernandez said he feared the great promise of the vaccine developed by the late university professor William Halford was being overshadowed by criticism over Halford's decision to test the drug using American patients on the West Indian nation of St. Kitts and Nevis without monitoring by the FDA or an institutional review board (IRB), as is traditional. ""I just need to defend my friend, who is dead,"" Fernandez told CNBC. ""Your kids will not know herpes, your grandkids will not know herpes because of Bill."" ""People are missing the story here. They're defaming a dead scientist, [who] is really a hero,"" said Fernandez, a Hollywood movie producer who co-founded Rational Vaccines with Halford in 2015 out of a shared desire to help herpes sufferers. As many as 1 in every 6 people between the ages of 14 and 49 has genital herpes, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""This guy is eradicating herpes: Let's talk about that,"" he said of Halford, a Southern Illinois University professor who died in June of brain cancer. ""Nobody's saying that we've lost one of the greatest scientific minds in America."" Fernandez spoke two days after health regulators in St. Kitts said they were investigating the 2016 vaccine trial after learning it was conducted in that nation without prior approval. ""The Ministry of Health will always ensure that all research involving human participants follow international standards, which protect the safety and security of persons involved,"" regulators said. Rational Vaccines last October announced that its ""potentially revolutionary Theravax vaccine"" had achieved groundbreaking results in its Phase 1 clinical trial. Fernandez said the trial had shown the drug's promise both as a vaccine that would prevent herpes infections and as a therapeutic treatment to alleviate the often painful outbreak of sores that people with herpes can suffer. Fernandez also said that he now understands it is necessary from now on to conduct further trials following FDA oversight standards if Rational Vaccines hopes to market the vaccine in the United States. ""As a businessman, and as my investors [require] ... we need the FDA,"" Fernandez said. Fernandez, who is not a scientist or an expert on pharmaceuticals, said he did not know at the time that Halford's decision to conduct that trial of the vaccine in St. Kitts in 2016 with 20 American patients would end up drawing the ire of medical ethicists. Nor did Fernandez know, he said, that it was traditional for such drug trials to be monitored either by the FDA or by an institutional review board. ""I didn't know what an IRB was,"" Fernandez said. But he said that this past spring — about six months after the first trial was concluded — when Halford and he met with Thiel's representative to discuss Thiel investing in the vaccine's development, the representative ""yelled"" at Halford for arguing that his decision to do the testing without FDA monitoring was motivated by a desire to help herpes sufferers without unnecessary delay. Thiel's rep ""said, 'We want to help people too, but we want to help a billion people, and we need to go through the FDA,' "" Fernandez recalled. The PayPal co-founder Thiel and a group of other investors committed $7 million to Rational Vaccines on Aug. 23, with the condition that future testing of the vaccine comply with FDA standards, Fernandez said. Thiel, who did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC, himself invested $4 million, according to Fernandez. Last Sunday, a story by Kaiser Health News focused on Thiel's investment and highlighted the fact that the 2016 trial ""did not rely on traditional U.S. safety oversight."" The article noted that ""Thiel has been a vocal critic of the FDA, claiming in an interview that its approval process was so unwieldy 'you would not be able to invent the polio vaccine today.'"" Jonathan Zenilman, chief of the infectious disease division of Johns Hopkins Medical Center, told Kaiser Health News, referring to the vaccine trial, ""What they're doing is patently unethical."" ""There's a reason why researchers rely on these protections,"" Zenilman said. ""People can die."" An FDA spokeswoman told CNBC, ""The FDA does not comment on individual cases or speculate on hypothetical situations."" ""However, generally speaking, the FDA believes that the oversight of clinical investigations, including review by an IRB, is critically important and notes it is a regulatory requirement for clinical investigations subject to FDA regulations,"" the spokeswoman said. But Fernandez told CNBC, ""I wasn't aware of an ethical problem then, and I'm not aware of an ethical problem now."" Asked why Halford decided to do the clinical tests without traditional monitoring, Fernandez said, ""The truth is, only Dr. Halford can answer that."" Fernandez speculated that Halford, who was terminally ill for years, was trying to help a number of herpes sufferers, particularly after being asked for help from two such people who ended up committing suicide. ""I'm suggesting that he, in his conscience, felt that he would move as quickly as possible and not have another death on his head,"" Fernandez said. ""He was fighting cancer the entire time,"" Fernandez said. ""He knew he was never going to make a dime from this."" ""Whatever Bill did, he did for the greater good."" Fernandez said Halford told participants in the trial that the trial was not approved by the FDA and required them to each sign an informed consent form to participate. ""The narrative that is out there is that this guy duped some people into getting injections and they are victims,"" Fernandez said. ""And that is not the case."" Fernandez said that all of the participants in the trial were suffering from chronic herpes outbreaks, and a number of them were suffering outbreaks even while taking the herpes treatment drug Valtrex. One of those participants, a 48-year-old truck driver from New Jersey named Richard Mancuso, told CNBC that he had sought to participate in the trial after suffering from two to three herpes outbreaks every month for the prior 20 years. Mancuso said he was interviewed by Halford for three hours before Halford agreed to admit him to the trial, and that the professor told him that ""you really have to think about this seriously, because there are risks involved, this is an experimental vaccine, and I cannot make any promise."" ""He was really clear what the situation was,"" Mancuso said of Halford. Mancuso told CNBC on Friday that he did not recall Halford informing him that FDA or IRB monitoring was traditional for a clinical trial. However, after this article first appeared, he said he had confirmed that disclosure was on the consent form that Halford had him sign before admitting him to the trial. Mancuso received three injections during separate visits to St. Kitts. He said his outbreaks began tapering off, and that he last had an outbreak on March 27. ""Oh, my God, he gave me my life back,"" said Mancuso when asked what he thought of Halford. ""It doesn't get much better than that."" Mancuso said he gets ""a little upset over"" criticism of Halford's decision to conduct the trial without FDA monitoring. He has posted a video response to the Kaiser Health News story on his Facebook page. ""He knew he had very little time to help people,"" Mancuso told CNBC. ""Nobody has $5 billion and 15 years to get a vaccine approved. ... He's a professor; he's on a professor's salary."" The Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, where Halford worked, when asked for comment by CNBC, referred to a statement the school issued earlier this week. ""Rational Vaccines licensed the patent rights from SIU School of Medicine to advance the clinical application of the vaccine and is required to abide by all applicable laws and regulations in pursuit of those development objectives,"" the school said in that statement. ""The 2016 clinical trial was conducted solely by Rational Vaccines. Dr. Halford's involvement was as the Chief Scientific Officer of Rational Vaccines, not as a faculty member of SIU School of Medicine. The company ran the clinical trial independently of SIU involvement."" ",Herpes vaccine firm backed by Peter Thiel promises FDA oversight
"Leslie Kramer, special to CNBC.com",09072017,CNBC,08312017,"One third of Americans may be on their way to developing full-blown type 2 diabetes, and most of them don't even know it. A recent report from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that more than 84 million Americans, or roughly one-third of the population, have prediabetes, a condition marked by higher-than-normal blood sugar. Of that group, 90 percent aren't aware they have the condition. The primary risk factors for type 2 diabetes are genetics and lifestyle — excess weight, obesity and lack of exercise contribute to this alarming medical trend. ""People with prediabetes who don't change their lifestyle are at a much higher risk of developing heart disease and stroke and can develop type 2 diabetes within five years if left untreated,"" said William T. Cefalu, MD, chief scientific, medical & mission officer of the American Diabetes Association. The health risks go beyond heart disease and stroke. As diabetes worsens over time, blindness, kidney disease and lower-limb amputation are also major health risks. Diabetes was the seventh-leading cause of death in the United States in 2015, according to the CDC. This population of diabetes ""ticking time bombs"" is particularly alarming, because in many cases type 2 diabetes can be avoided, simply by leading a healthy lifestyle. Type 2 diabetes is often progressive, and within 10 years of diagnosis, 50 percent of individuals need to use insulin to control their blood glucose levels, according to the ADA. More than 30 million Americans — 9.4 percent of the U.S. population — are already battling diabetes, according to the CDC's National Diabetes Statistics Report, which used data through 2015. The CDC found that of those cases, 7.2 million were undiagnosed. ""The country needs to take this seriously, ratchet it up and make it a priority,"" said Ann Albright, PhD, RD, director of CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation. ""Far too few people know about it or know they have it, and that is why we launched the prevention program and joined forces with other organizations,"" she said. ""It requires us all to take this condition seriously."" Prediabetes is a condition in which a person's blood glucose (sugar) levels are higher than normal, but not yet high enough for a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Doctors often refer to prediabetes as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), depending on which test they used to detect the condition. The A1C test is the most commonly used to detect the condition, because it is a blood test that provides information about a person's average blood glucose levels over the past 90 days. To be prediabetic, an individual would have to have an A1C result of 5.7 percent — 6.4 percent.  The results of a fasting glucose test that are 100-125mg/dl indicate IFG. If an oral glucose tolerance test is performed and the result is 140-199, it indicates IGT. All are considered prediabetes. More from Modern Medicine:FDA testing groundbreaking tech: Human organs on a chip Venture capitalist wages war against Parkinson's ER costs are skyrocketing, leaving patients in shock The cost to the American health-care system and economy from diabetes is steep. The American Diabetes Association estimates at least $245 billion a year. Medicare, Medicaid and the military foot a large portion of that bill, paying for 62.4 percent of the cost of care, while 34.4 percent is paid for by private insurers and 3.2 percent by the uninsured, according to the ADA. The medical community has so far failed to contain prediabetes. A big part of the problem: People simply avoid going to the doctor. William Argenta was 48 when he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, a couple of years ago. He had not been to a doctor in more than five years and only received the diagnosis when he finally decided to go in for a physical. He had experienced a feeling of being overly thirsty — often a sign of diabetes — but other than that, he didn't see any reason to get checked out. Once a patient is diagnosed with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, they are advised to change their eating and exercise habits. Many are prescribed metformin — it is the most widely prescribed drug for diabetes under many brand names, including Glucophage — and helps control blood sugar levels. Metformin lowers blood glucose by reducing the amount of glucose produced by the liver and by helping the body respond better to the insulin made in the pancreas. The FDA has approved metformin for treatment of type 2 diabetes, but not for prediabetes, which is a serious health condition but does not reach the blood sugar level to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. The FDA has been conservative about approving drugs for use beyond specific disease states. However, the FDA is now considering approval of metformin for use in prediabetes. While physicians can already administer it at their own discretion, the ADA says the drug is currently underused as part of treatment options. Ongoing follow-up to the federally funded Diabetes Prevention Program research study has shown that metformin has long-term cost-saving value in delaying type 2 diabetes, with great safety and low cost to the consumer, which may persuade the FDA to approve an indication for prediabetes. According to the ADA, metformin therapy for prevention of type 2 diabetes should be considered for people who have a high body mass index BMI, are aged 60 years or older, have rising A1C test results, despite lifestyle intervention, and for women with prior pregnancy-related glucose intolerance. There are several other drugs prescribed for prediabetes, including a weight loss drug,  but many have significant side effects. The ADA states that metformin has the best track record and safety profile. The ADA also notes that even metformin has been shown to be less effective than lifestyle modification — lifestyle changes can slow or prevent type 2 diabetes in some individuals with a genetic predisposition. Now a type 2 diabetic, Argenta has changed his lifestyle. He cut down on sugary food and has increased his protein intake. He is also exercising and taking metformin and a couple of other medications. Argenta says he now feels much better than he did before he was diagnosed. ""I guess I had just gotten used to feeling bad. Your body adjusts to it in some ways,"" he says. The CDC, ADA and the American Medical Association have launched a new prediabetes awareness campaign, DoIHavePrediabetes.org. The campaign encourages people to take an online test of seven simple questions that can assess a person's prediabetes risk. The organizations are also beseeching those at risk to change their eating and exercise habits before their condition worsens. Dr. Rhonda Todd, MD, internal medicine, is doing her part to raise prediabetes awareness. Based near Ann Arbor, Michigan, she tries to test as many of her patients as she can for prediabetes if they fit a risk profile, using the A1C test. Most private insurers cover the expense of an A1C test, as do Medicaid and Medicare when the patient present risk factors. Todd said she has never had a problem getting a test approved. The cost of the test is roughly $50 dollars, but Todd has seen some hospitals offer the test for $10, as a part of wellness programs. ""I will try to test every patient I see who is over 35, has a family history of the disease or who is obese or overweight, which is almost everybody,"" she says. Todd blames the sedentary lifestyle of Americans for the explosion of diabetes and prediabetes cases. ""We are not a healthy people anymore, technology is killing us,"" she said. Todd said the majority of doctors, many of whom are affiliated with hospitals, test for prediabetes often. She thinks the bigger problem is people not going to the doctor rather than doctor's not offering the tests. The ADA recommends testing for prediabetes in adults of any age who are overweight or obese and who have one or more additional risk factors. For all people, testing should begin at age 45 years and be carried out at a minimum of three-year intervals. Every 21 seconds another person in the United States is diagnosed with diabetes, according to the ADA. That's 4,110 people in America diagnosed with the disease every 24 hours. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all those cases. The risk for developing the disease also increases drastically in people age 45 and older, and after age 65 it increases exponentially. There has also been a troubling rise in the number of adolescents developing both prediabetes and diabetes. Weight has a lot to do with it. Among adolescents, ages 12 to 19, about 1 in 5 are considered to have obesity, and about 1 in 11 (9.1 percent) are considered to have extreme obesity, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. ""Nutrition for adolescents is the cornerstone of treatment,"" Cefalu said. ""People need access to adequate nutrition, and you have to get that information in their hands."" Testing for prediabetes in children and adolescents should be considered for those who are overweight or obese, and who have two or more additional risk factors for diabetes, including having a family history of type 2 diabetes, or who are African American, Native American, Latino, or Asian Pacific Islanders. More than half of Asian-Americans and nearly half of Hispanic Americans with diabetes are undiagnosed. Health-care specialists say getting people to change their behavior isn't easy. ""Telling people to lose weight does not give them enough information. It is not a message that helps and supports them,"" Albright said. To teach people how to change and maintain a new set of lifestyle habits, the CDC is also promoting its National Diabetes Prevention Program, which was initiated in 2010. Just by participating and staying in the program, prediabetics can lower their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 58 percent over three years, and by 71 percent for people over age 60. ""We want to help them determine what is realistic and doable so they can make real life changes that are sustainable,"" Albright said. A DDP program can cost as much as $500 a year. (The CDC-recognized organizations delivering these programs determine the cost, which can vary depending on factors such as the size and experience of the organization offering it.)  Diabetes prevention programs are growing in number and participation, but are still underutilized, according to the ADA. The CDC is working with commercial health plans and employers, including state employers, asking them to consider offering the program as part of their health-care benefit packages or wellness programs. To date, 11 states are providing coverage for more than 3 million public employees, over 65 commercial payers are providing coverage in some markets, and four states are providing Medicaid coverage. The Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services is in the final stage of approving this service for eligible Medicare beneficiaries. The YMCA in many states also offers access to the program on a sliding-scale fee basis. Prevention does work. By losing just 5 percent to 7 percent of one's  body weight (10-15 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds) and practicing a basic exercise regime — such as taking a brisk walk, 30 minutes a day, five days a week — many people are able to return their blood glucose levels to the normal range, according to the CDC. But for lasting and widespread change to take place, more health-care professionals will need to get on board and proactively talk to people about the risk of diabetes and prediabetes, Cefalu said. ""We need to educate and train primary care providers, nurse educators and nutritionists, so they can better inform their patients about the condition and how to treat it."" While a physician referral is not required for an eligible participant to enroll in a National DPP lifestyle change program, the CDC has partnered with the American Medical Association on the Prevent Diabetes STAT (Screen, Test, Act Today). ""All sectors, including health care, business, nonprofit community organizations and faith-based organizations, need to be talking about prediabetes and encouraging those with prediabetes to enroll in a National DPP lifestyle-change program,"" Albright said.

Catherine Clifford,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"It's the anxiety, uncertainty and exhaustion that come through in Juan Escalante's first-person account of trying to live life as a ""dreamer"" under the Trump administration. ""WHAT IF: ... Trump deports my parents,"" tweets Escalante. ""What will happen to: our car leases, mortgages, student loans, relationships, degrees,"" he worries. So-called dreamers such as Escalante are undocumented immigrants who grew up in the U.S. and who were granted temporary protection from deportation and allowed to work through President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals administrative program. DACA was available to those under the age of 31 by June 15, 2012. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump dealt a blow to ""dreamers"" by ending DACA. Trump says he is upholding his ""highest duty"" — ""to defend the American people and the Constitution of the United States of America."" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that DACA was an executive overreach on the part of Obama and was thereby unlawful. Tuesday night President Trump tweeted that if Congress can't come up with a new immigration policy in six months, he will ""revisit"" the issue. For Escalante, 28, and others like him, each rule change, each day and month that there is another delay in coming up with a permanent solution, is a painful extension of an already emotional process. Escalante and his parents immigrated from Venezuela with a visa but, due to an error with the immigration paperwork, his entire family lost their legal status, his communications representative tells CNBC Make It. Because he was undocumented, he grew up without much hope of being able to make anything of himself. ""Imagine being 11 years old, and after living in the United States for over 10 years, you are consistently reminded that you would not be able to accomplish much due to your immigration status. That you wouldn't get a job, go to college or be accepted in the country that you grew up in due to your immigration status,"" Escalante says, in a Medium post. ""That is, of course, after graduating from high school, trying to navigate the country's broken immigration system, and paying taxes. ""Thanks to DACA, Dreamers have been able to build their lives, go to school and invest in the economy by buying a home or a car,"" says Escalante, who lives and works in Tallahassee, Fla. His two brothers also have DACA status. ""The thought that you would be STRIPPED off your DACA status is not just traumatizing, it's dehumanizing and exhausting,"" says Escalante via Twitter. Escalante is the digital campaigns manager for America's Voice, an immigration advocacy group. Read, below, what he calls a ""101 guide"" for what it feels like for DACA recipients in the current political climate. He emphasizes the ""psychological trauma"" of living under such uncertainty. What it feels like to be a Dreamer at this particular point in time.A 101 guide The sense that #DACA could come to an end is terrifying. Outside of just that, there several aspect to consider that drain Dreamers daily 1. The thought that you would be STRIPPED off your DACA status is not just traumatizing, it's dehumanizing and exhausting. 1a. DREAMers have been dealing with fear and anxiety since Trump came into office, and not just because the possible termination of DACA 1b. Many of us have witnessed Dreamers being arrested/deported, while simoultaneously FEARING for the safety of our undocumented parents 1c. Mental gymnastics occur while you're at work/home. You find youself asking:WHAT IF:DACA ends tomorrowTrump deports my parents 1d. And the issue lies that you don't want to open up to others who may not relate OR appear that youre complaining way too much 1e. This is where most of us find ourselves, at the corner of mental exhaustion, where fear/anxiety/doubt meet + but we refuse to give up 1f. So we keep going and going and going until we can't no more. Exhaustion, anxiety, or depression eventually get us. Burnout is real. 1g. Yet we can't stop. The fight for DACA and DREAM is a fight for OUR LIVES. 2. We keep wondering about our futures.What will happen to:- our car leases- mortgages- student loans- relationships- degreesEtc 2a. For the past 5 years Dreamers have relied on DACA to live with a sense of normalcy - build a life. 2b. Now all that time and investment into ""normalcy"" may be crushed. Which means:THINKING ABOUT BEING UNDOCUMENTED ONCE AGAIN 2c. Dreamers will tell you that we were all undocumented before, that we survived without DACA... but can we truly go back to that reality? 2d. If we were stressed and scared back then without DACA under Obama, can anyone imagine life w/o DACA under Trump? 2e. No amount of preparation to return to undocumented status can be done. Imagine having to prepare to face your worst nightmare (AGAIN) 2f. Are folks understanding the mental exhaustion? 3. What will happen to us if Trump tries to deport us?Weve seen Trumps unshackled Deportation Force attempt to deport DREAMers, who is nxt 3a. Families are being torn aparente left and right under Trump. Meanwhile, DACA beneficiaries have give the Gov significant private info 3b. Will this info be used to retaliate against us? Will frontline advocates like men be first? What can we expect/trust from trump? 3c. Being deported means going back to Venezuela - country under significant economic and political turmoil. What does it mean for others? These are just SOME of the numerous complexities and dimensions Dreamers navigate DAILY - while working/studying/etc The psychological trauma is real. Extremely really. Which is why inurge EVEYONE to circulate mental health resources from @UNITEDWEDREAM The fight is certainly NOT over after Trump announces the fate of #DACA. But we must consider what the road to THIS or means to all of us. If you need to reach out to friends, do it.If you need counseling, seek it.If you need meds, consider it. PLEASE take care of yourselves. And if youre an ally, please take care of Dreamers now more than ever...Everything helps. We need it. Good night.

Christina Farr,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"Drug companies need better ways to recruit patients for their clinical trials, an undertaking that costs millions of dollars today. Dozens of technology start-ups have popped up to solve this problem. One start-up in this group is Antidote.me, which today raised $11 million in a round led by Merck's strategic digital health fund. Existing investors Smedvig Capital and Octopus Ventures also participated in the round. Antidote is run by a group of European tech executives, including Pablo Graiver, a former vice president of Kayak, and Eze Vidra, a general partner for Google's venture arm in Europe. The company is now based in New York City to help it expand more deeply into the United States. It's a crowded market, but Antidote says it has a unique approach. ""Everyone is looking at a particular clinical trial and then trying to find the right patients,"" said Graiver, who had the idea of applying engagement models that work in other sectors, like e-commerce, to health care to bring a ""matching tool to patients, rather than expecting them to come to us."" Antidote serves people who are already searching for information about a health condition with potentially relevant clinical trials. It works with groups such as JDRF, a research organization for Type 1 diabetes, and Lung Cancer Alliance, to add an Antidote-branded tool to their websites (here's an example). Patients who are interested in participating in a clinical trial will be prompted to answer some questions, such as their location and how far they're willing to travel, their age, gender, and health condition(s). With each response, Antidote narrows down the list of trials they can apply for. This approach is appealing to pharma companies, as the responses provide them with more information than they could glean from a patients' medical record. For instance, they might learn whether a potential recruit is looking to get pregnant in the coming months, which might disqualify them from participating in the trial. Antidote says its tool has been used to match patients for 14,000 clinical trials to date. It gets paid through referral fees from pharmaceutical companies, as well as licensing fees for the health organizations it works with. Graiver said the company generated low-digit millions in revenues last year alone. ","Merck leads $11m round in Antidote.me, drug trial recruiting start-up"
"Leslie Kramer, special to CNBC.com",09072017,CNBC,08312017,"After four decades of progress preventing strokes that affect 800,000 Americans and kill up to 140,000 annually, progress has stalled, and in some states strokes are again increasing, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study, released Wednesday, shows that stroke death rates failed to continue to decline in 38 states during the 2013–2015 period, resulting in an estimated 32,593 excess stroke deaths that may not have occurred based on previous rates of decline. The data was compiled by the U.S. National Vital Statistics System from the National Center for Health Statistics at the CDC. The increase came after successive declines in stroke deaths for every three-year period studied by the CDC between 2000 and 2013. Today strokes are the fifth-leading cause of death in the country, but 80 percent of strokes are preventable, according to the World Health Organization. A stroke occurs when blood flow to an area of brain is cut off and brain cells are deprived of oxygen and begin to die, resulting in the loss of abilities, such as memory and muscle function, controlled by that area of the brain. Strokes can often be prevented by two methods. Dr. Quanhe Yang, senior scientist, Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention at the CDC, said one is by adopting a healthy lifestyle, such as not smoking, eating a healthy diet that is low in salt and sugar and high in fruits and vegetables, being physically active and maintaining healthy weight. The second is by better managing the risk factors. ""If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes, you need to keep them under control by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and taking the proper medications,"" Yang said. Obesity is another cause for concern, because it is a major cause of hypertension, which is the single most important modifiable risk factor for stroke, according to the CDC report. Despite recent improvements, nearly half of the 75 million U.S. adults with hypertension do not have their blood pressure under control. More from Modern Medicine: America's No. 1 killer taking center stage in fight over drug prices One third of Americans on way to diabetes, and most don't know it Efforts to prevent heart disease run into a brick wall The current stall in progress preventing strokes is taking place in 3 out of 4 states across the United States and, surprisingly, not just in the 11 states in the Southeast known as the Stroke Belt, because those states have had higher stroke death rates historically than the U.S. average. Those states are Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. The CDC study could not conclude that any single factor or group of factors is directly responsible. However, poor diet, physical inactivity and lower-than-average social economic status — which often results in a lack of access to health insurance coverage and access to medical care — all contribute to the higher rates of strokes in these states and around the country, Yang said. Recognizing the signs and symptoms of a stroke and understanding the importance of calling 911 is critical to ensuring that stroke patients receive the best care as quickly as possible. Stroke symptoms tend to occur suddenly. Signs to look out for include weakness or numbness on one side of the body, confusion, trouble speaking or understanding, trouble seeing in one or both eyes, trouble walking, dizziness or loss of balance or severe headache. The American Stroke Association tells people to remember the acronym FAST, which can be used as a mnemonic to help detect and respond quickly to stroke victims. The acronym stands for ""Facial drooping,""Arm weakness,"" ""Speech difficulties"" and ""Time to call 911."" Yang said if you think someone is having a stroke, you should first ask the person if they are able to smile, to see if one side of the face is drooping. Next, ask the person to raise both arms up to check for arm weakness. Then ask the person to repeat a sentence to see if they can speak clearly, and then call 911 immediately. Time is of the essence because while a person is having a stroke, their brain cells are dying, so it's imperative that they get the care they need immediately. ""Get the person an ambulance and get them to the hospital so that they can get the proper treatment,"" Yang said. ""This will increase the chance of survival. Every minute counts,"" he added. Yang does not recommend driving yourself or someone having a stroke to the hospital. An ambulance can alert the hospital to the person's arrival and get the necessary equipment ready. A person having a stroke is typically experiencing a blood clot, so ""clot busting medication"" will be necessary, he said. ""It's a very time-sensitive procedure, and after three to five hours the effectiveness of procedure is greatly reduced."" Emergency medical services and hospitals also need to provide better care. To confront this issue, the CDC established the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program, named after the late Republican Senator from Georgia, who died in 2000, at age 61, from a massive stroke. ""This program was designed to help the states to improve the quality of care and treatment of stroke patients, from symptoms, to getting to the hospital, to in-care hospital care and out patient care,"" Yang said. The Coverdell program is working with hospitals in nine states to develop coordinated systems of care to reduce stroke-related death and disability. It is also working closely with partners in healthcare to enhance the quality of stroke care through data-driven quality improvement in approxi­mately 570 hospitals, which have treated more than 620,000 acute stroke patients in the United States since 2005. The Million Hearts initiative, co-led by the CDC and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — and supported by many public and private partners — is also working on initiatives that they believe could help to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2022. They include getting the word out about intervention methods and convincing people to reduce their sodium (salt) intake, cut out tobacco use, and start exercising. They are also telling people to improve implementation of the ""ABCS"" method of prevention, which include taking aspirin when appropriate, keeping one's blood pressure under control, managing one's cholesterol, and quitting smoking. Health-care providers should also be looking out for patients who may need to begin cardiac rehabilitation, and should be focused in particular on priority populations at high risk for heart disease and stroke. The data also showed a statistically significant increase among the subset of Hispanic-Americans, with a 5.8 percent annual increase, and among the population of the South Census Region, at an increase of 4.2 percent. In Florida alone, there was a 10.8 percent increase. ""This is a wake-up call,"" Yang said. ""We have to remember that 80 percent of strokes are preventable. Every one of us can do something to regain the momentum in the decline of the number of strokes."" Yang added that one-third of stroke cases take place in people who are 35 to 64 years-old. But the study also found that more young people are being hospitalized with the increased risk factors for stroke. ""In the U.S. we do have an epidemic of obesity and diabetes. One in three adults in the U.S. is obese, and that's a problem, because obesity can cause high blood pressure, which is the primary risk factor for a stroke,"" he said. Recent studies reported that in the past 15 years, younger adults have experienced a significant increase in both stroke hospitaliza­tions and in associated stroke risk factors, such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, and tobacco use. Changes in modifiable stroke risk fac­tors might present new challenges for stroke prevention and a sustained decline in stroke mortality in U.S., according to the CDC report. A report published in June by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that stroke hospitalization rates for younger adults significantly increased from 2003 to 2012; among men (41.5 percent) and women (30 percent) aged 35 to 44 years. It also found a near doubling of the prevalence of three or more of the common stroke risk factors among both men and women aged 18 to 64 years who were hospitalized due to strokes. Diabetes is another risk factor. Currently, there are 30 million people in the U.S. with diabetes, 85 million with prediabetes, and 75 million adults with high blood pressure, and only half of those are under control. ""If you put this all together, we have a very significant situation here, and a change in the risk profile in the population. That is why it is of great concern,"" he said. ""This short term trend may become a larger one. Healthy lifestyle plays a big role in the reduction of stroke risk and death.""

Yen Nee Lee,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"As the U.S. mulls its next move against North Korea, some have suggested that sanctioning the major Chinese banks could be the most effective way to pressure the rogue nation into halting its nuclear program. Targeting the big lenders from the world's second-largest economy is not a new idea. And it would not necessarily just be a way to lash out at Beijing for not controlling Pyongyang sufficiently: Some Chinese banks, like the Bank of China, are said to have helped North Korea evade sanctions. But the big Chinese banks have so far avoided any punishments by the U.S., which has instead blacklisted smaller players such as Bank of Dandong for financing North Korea. That could change after the hermit nation claimed over the weekend that it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb — a much more powerful weapon compared to those it previously tested. In response, President Donald Trump tweeted that the U.S. is considering ""stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea"" and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is reportedly drafting a harsher sanctions package. Donald Trump tweet: The United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea. China is North Korea's largest trading partner, accounting for 85 percent of the latter's trade and has a ""fair amount of leverage"" over the hermit nation, Bejoy Das Gupta, Asia Pacific chief economist at the Institute of International Finance told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" In an August announcement by the Treasury Department, more Chinese entities were added to the U.S. sanctions list. Mnuchin at the time said the Treasury ""will continue to increase pressure on North Korea"" by, among others, ""isolating them from the American financial system."" All big four state-owned banks in China have in recent years increased their presence in the U.S., where their operations now include providing loans, issuing bonds and financing trade activities. The four major Chinese banks are also the largest lenders by assets in the world, according to the latest ranking by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is the world's largest bank with $3.47 trillion in total assets as of the end of 2016, S&P said. Another three Chinese banks round up the top four of the global ranking: China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China. Those three lenders have assets between $2.60 trillion and $3.02 trillion. In comparison, the largest American bank is JPMorgan Chase at sixth place on the S&P ranking, with assets of $2.49 trillion as of the end of 2016. The biggest European bank, HSBC, was seventh with $2.37 trillion worth of assets. The growing size of the Chinese lenders has also allowed Asia's largest economy to overtake the euro zone as the world's biggest banking system last year with total assets of $33 trillion, according to an analysis by the Financial Times. Rep. Pete King tweet: UN must impose oil embargo on N Korea ASAP. If China or Russia veto, US must sanction anyone doing business with NK, including Bank of China. The health of the Chinese financial system is closely-watched as banks hold more than 90 percent of total assets in the world's second-largest economy, according to Reuters. Sanctioning the largest players would thus have ""international economy and markets"" implications, Scott Seaman, director for Asia at geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""The U.S. Treasury Department has often been hesitant to expand the secondary sanction regime to include, for example, restrictions on Chinese SOEs (state-owned enterprises) and Chinese large banks in part because the Chinese government will react very negatively, but also it will have an impact on international economy and markets,"" Seaman said. ""But we do expect the U.S. to come up with additional restrictions on things that will probably make Beijing upset,"" he added.

Zameena Mejia,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"Face it, we can't all be Elon Musk and work nearly 90 hours a week. Nor are we all fortunate enough to make a living working under 40 hours a week. No matter where you fall, half of all Americans feel  overworked and burned out. Amber Discko, a former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer who worked on her social media team, is out to change that. Discko, 27, created the beginnings of self-care app Aloe while experiencing a difficult time working the final four months of Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. ""It was an incredible experience to work on it, but it was hard to balance my mental health with the stress of the campaign and dealing with the toxic news cycle,"" Discko tells CNBC Make It. She created a personal checklist, which assessed wellness items like if she was hydrated, had taken a break from the computer screen in the last hour and if she had been going to sleep on time. Despite working with a ""diverse, smart group of people,"" she noticed that others working on the campaign were also suffering from exhaustion. ""It's very common, especially with millennials, to overwork yourself when you're super passionate about a cause,"" Discko says. ""We are so driven to do our best that we let other things slide by."" Discko surpassed her  Kickstarter $40,000 goal, raising $50,528 for Aloe, primarily through Twitter followers, and continues receiving support through creative funding platform Patreon. The app is expected to be released for iOS devices first in January with Android to come later. With help from the Femsplain community, an online publication Discko ran the past three years, Aloe already exists in the form of her now-public, online self-care checklist, a printable checklist for your desk and as interactive Twitter bot ""@aloebud."" garden tweet Once completed, Aloe will have three main sections: a check-in area to mark your accomplishments, a reminders section to motivate you throughout the day and a mad-lib style reflections section that gives a glance at how you feel and what your next goal will be. There will also be also a community support feature to connect with others using the app. Discko says Aloe will provide a simpler path to wellness for even the hardest workers out there. She hopes teams in offices will put the app to use. ""Because people are chained to their desks, they are working long hours,"" Discko says. ""I'm hoping if workplaces can encourage their teams to take moments for themselves throughout the day, it will create a better environment to work in."" For those who are unsure if they feel worker burnout, Stanford psychologist and research scientist Emma Seppälä notes it's when you are lacking energy, feeling down and feel generally unmotivated to do work. ""It seems ridiculous to need an app to remind you to sleep, breathe, eat,"" Seppälä tells CNBC Make It, ""but we've gotten to the point where people do need reminders."" She says this is because people are caught up in an ""overwhelming"" amount of responsibilities. ""Plunged into our virtual worlds and crunched for time, we tune out completely from our own needs for sleep, exercise, even food,"" Seppala says. In researching her book, ""The Happiness Track,"" Seppälä found that half of American workers, regardless of profession or position in corporate hierarchies,  are burned out. ""We've gotten so addicted to working, we're so overwhelmed with notifications from our devices, and we're generally so overwhelmed trying to balance home life and work,"" Seppälä says, ""that it's no surprise we're seeing 50 percent burnout across industries right now."" work tweet Apps like Aloe can provide reminders and a  supportive community to help keep us on track, Seppälä says. ""We are profoundly social people for whom connection and a sense of belonging is crucial for health and happiness,"" Seppälä says. Since we are no longer always living in tight-knit communities with family and friends reminding us to take care of ourselves or pitching in to help cook a meal, Seppälä says ""online communities are sometimes a great way to make sure you have people to connect with, be motivated by and look out for."" Without self-care, notes Seppälä, comes more burnout. ""When complete burnout happens, then you can have health consequences,"" she notes, including stress-induced health problems like inflammation and diabetes. Discko says she has received online criticism and constant questions about the usefulness or necessity for the app, which will be free when launched and have in-app upgrades for personalization. A post shared by Aloe (@aloebud) on Mar 10, 2017 at 10:18am PST But Seppälä wants people to consider this: health care expenditures at high-pressure companies are nearly 50% greater than at other organizations. She cites an  American Psychological Association estimate which finds that the U.S. economy loses more than $500 billion due to workplace stress as well as 550 million workdays lost yearly to stress on the job. Seppälä says wellness apps like Aloe can promote a more inclusive workplace culture if the entire work culture buys into the idea that self-care is important, adding they should ""for the sake of the bottom line if anything."" ""You need an entire workforce, and especially its leaders, to support the idea,"" Seppälä says. Discko says Aloe can help bosses and managers lead the conversation on mental health at work. ""Being able to say you need to take a moment to manage your own health and talk with your colleagues who know you've been working hard is important,"" Discko says. ""If people in the workplace were kinder to one another, making sure they feel good about their work and their day,"" she adds, ""I think more people would be inclined to work harder and work together.""

"Andrew Zaleski, special to CNBC.com",09072017,CNBC,08312017,"About four years ago Jeff Burnstein attended his first China International Robotics Show, the annual Shanghai-based expo now in its seventh year. At the time, Burnstein, president of the Robotic Industries Association, a Michigan-based trade group, wasn't impressed. He said he walked around the show and thought many of the robots on display looked like copies of what American companies were already doing. In today's China a different picture is taking shape, courtesy of a blueprint known as the Made in China 2025 plan. Announced in 2015, the initiative is China's massive government-backed push to be a world leader in a number of high-tech industries, such as medical devices, aerospace equipment and robotics — the key piece of the country's desire to automate sectors of its economy: automotive manufacturing, food production, electronics and more. But to do that, China needs more robots. In addition to the Made in China 2025 plan, the government has also released the Robotics Industry Development Plan, a five-year plan to rapidly expand the country's industrial robotics sector. By 2020, China wants to be able to manufacture at least 100,000 industrial robots annually. The country is racing full steam ahead to a robot-powered future in a push to not only remake its own economy but also to transform into the world's robot capital — overtaking Japan, Germany and the United States in the process. ""The Chinese are the fastest-growing and largest user of robotics in the world by now,"" said Burnstein. ""The 2025 plan will only accelerate it."" According to the International Federation of Robots, China is already home to the biggest share of robots, a global market worth about $30 billion. It is currently ranked the No.1 sales market for industrial robots, with the United States coming in at No. 4. (South Korea and Japan are two and three, respectively.) While the United States is arguably the worldwide leader in automation in vehicle manufacturing, China is quickly making gains to outstrip the U.S. and other global competitors. Over the first half of this decade, China  installed 90,000 industrial robots, or one third of the world's total, compared to 80,000 industrial robots installed between 2010 and 2015 elsewhere in Asia, Europe and the United States combined. ""I'm sure there are lots of manufacturers in China who are focused on crushing the U.S.,"" said Matt Beane, a robotics researcher and fellow at the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. ""But it seems like China's whole goal is to become self-sufficient."" A new  International Federation of Robots report shows that China will likely represent 40 percent of the total worldwide sales for robots by 2019, an increase from 27 percent in 2015. China's steady growth in spending on robotics has even caught the eye of entrepreneur and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. In an  open letter to President Donald Trump last December, he said the United States should invest $100 billion into the robotics industry in order to compete with China. ""We have to win the robotics race. We are not even close right now,"" Cuban wrote. More from CNBC Disruptor 50: Investors poured $2.8B into reaching outer space. They may not be done
AirPods don't go far enough: Reinventing headphones for 'hearables' era
Stadiums are getting smarter, giving ticket-holders money's worth But many of these robots are ones produced elsewhere that Chinese companies purchase. The country would now like to flip the script and produce in country more of the industrial robots it needs in a variety of economic sectors. By 2020 the government wants more than 50 percent of the total robotics sales volume to be filled by robots made in China by Chinese companies. Producing robots in-house, so to speak, is where China is looking to outpace America. Beane noted that China has ""never had this character of deliberately going toe-to-toe with another global power."" But what they do have is a desire to look toward the future by investing billions of dollars in robotics and complementary technologies, like artificial intelligence, in order to not rely on other nations to outfit their factories. ""China will throw tons of money toward [robotics] that we will not,"" Beane said. ""They're looking to play a long game where, through steady investment, they make it less and less likely that countries that act impulsively can catch up."" Robots and automation are priorities in China, where salaries have increased more than 100 percent over the last 10 years while the national labor force has been shrinking. With industrial robots, Chinese companies hope to keep innovating while cutting costs. Signs of this shift are already present. Foxconn, a leading supplier of Apple iPhones,  replaced 60,000 workers with robots in just one of its Chinese factories last year. ""The long-term goal in China is to transform it from a low-cost labor source to being a high-tech labor source,"" said Frank Tobe, publisher of the Robot Report in California. ""That's a major technology transformation, and they're doing it."" As Tobe wrote in a  rundown of the Made in 2025 plan, China wants to ""overtake Germany, Japan, and the U.S. in terms of manufacturing sophistication by 2049."" The Made in China 2025 plan helps out by offering subsidies, low-interest loans and rent-free land to Chinese companies. Consider what Guangdong, just one Chinese province, is doing: offering almost $140 billion in subsidies to about 2,000 local companies, including robotics firms. ""To reduce the threshold of innovative entrepreneurship, the government provides appropriate financial subsidies for rent, broadband access and public software for new businesses,"" said John Rhee, general manager of the Los Angeles office for UBTECH, a Chinese robotics company headquartered in Shenzhen City that makes humanoid robots for the home. UBTECH is one such company currently benefiting from the Made in China 2025 plan. In April the company signed a ""strategic cooperation agreement,"" Rhee said, with the municipal government of Kunming City in the southwestern province of Yunnan, which will aid the company in robot building and developing artificial intelligence capabilities in Yunnan province for the purpose of making Kunming and other municipalities A.I.-enabled ""smart"" cities. But how quickly China can get itself up to speed in the globally competitive robotics field is still a question, as is the overall effectiveness of the Made in 2025 plan on growing China's robotics industry. ""China can manufacture simple robots but nothing complicated, like the six-axis ones by Japan, Germany and the U.S.,"" said Zi Yang, a China analyst at the Washington, D.C.-based Jamestown Foundation. ""It's hard to close the gap due to several reasons, mainly because of China's lack of innovativeness due to its weak intellectual property laws and government-led projects that focus on quantity over quality."" Indeed, that push for quantity is one of the aggressive goals China has set for itself in its Made in 2025 plan. By the end of next decade, the country wants to be producing 400,000 industrial robots annually. That's a tall order, considering just a little more than 250,000 industrial robots were  sold the world over in 2015 alone, according to the IFR. Some Chinese companies are actively buying the expertise in robotics that has been developed elsewhere. One such company, Midea,  closed a $4 billion deal earlier this year to acquire Germany-based Kuka AG, a leading, global robotics supplier for plant and automotive robots with a research and development center in Austin, Texas. While Yang admits this is a sign of a shift from quantity and toward quality, he also said that Chinese robotics companies ""can't buy their way into industry leadership. They must innovate, and that's the most difficult hurdle to overcome, since the constraints are structural."" There are signs that that's beginning to happen. This past July, RIA president Burnstein went back to CIROS in Shanghai. He said he left with a different impression after seeing many new companies and many of the same companies he saw just a few years ago. ""It's a lot more sophisticated. You wouldn't say it's all copies anymore,"" he said. ""Basically, China wants to compete everywhere, and they want to be a major, global robot supplier. And they're actively doing it."" These start-ups are on the cutting edge of big consumer, technology and business shifts — and already worth billions. Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson says it's not enough for tech companies to accept that hate speech is a complicated issue. A successful online retail start-up like Rent the Runway can't beat Amazon on overall selection or price, but it can defend against the risk from Jeff Bezos' giant by focusing on quality, curation and community. It's working. Kevin O'Leary says the Trump administration has finally ""unshackled the small businesses in America"" by eliminating past administrations' regulation-heavy policies.

"Alexandra Ossola, special to CNBC.com",09072017,CNBC,08312017,"Amidst the media hubbub of the new presidential administration, autism was back in the news. Well-known vaccine skeptic Andrew Wakefield attended one of President Donald Trump's inaugural balls; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental attorney and outspoken critic of vaccines, claimed that Trump had asked him to chair a commission on ""vaccine safety and scientific integrity,"" though seven months after those initial reports no concrete plans for such a commission have been made public. Both Wakefield and Kennedy have expressed their doubts about the safety of vaccines on the basis that they may be linked to increased incidence of autism. For many researchers working to find the causes of autism, this is frustrating, if well-tread, rhetoric. ""Regarding vaccines, the case has been closed for many years as far as the evidence is concerned,"" says Mayada Elsabbagh, an assistant professor of psychiatry at McGill University. Alycia Halladay, the chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, called the discussion about vaccines and autism a ""distraction"" because money spent looking into it isn't being dedicated to more pressing research questions. In the past decade, researchers have come a long way in narrowing down which conditions may make autism more likely to develop. What they learn could lead to more sophisticated treatments for autism at its early stages, or even prevent the disorder from developing in the first place. Autism Spectrum Disorder, or autism for short, is a disorder that can affect how the brain develops. It's characterized by social challenges, difficulties in communication and behavioral issues, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms usually appear in children between 12 and 18 months old. And the effects of autism can range from slight social challenges to severe cognitive impairment. ""If you've met one person with autism, you've met one person with autism — everyone looks a little different,"" says Heather Volk, an assistant professor in the department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. About 1 in 68 children are diagnosed with autism, according to the CDC. Today the Autism Society estimates that 3.5 million Americans are living with an autism spectrum disorder, and the prevalence has been rising over time, increasing by 119.4 percent between 2000 and 2010, according to the CDC. Though that's likely also driven by greater awareness of the condition and its symptoms, as well as access to services, Elsabbagh says. A 2014 study found that it costs $2.4 million to support a person with autism and an intellectual disability (which appears to affect 40 percent to 60 percent of those with autism) throughout the course of his or her life. Scientists spent decades looking for a specific gene, or a specific part of the brain, that could be causing the symptoms of autism. But that work hasn't turned up any one specific answer. Instead, researchers have had to change their questions. They now suspect that autism, like other complex diseases such as cancer or obesity, comes about by the interaction of many different genes and environmental factors. Researchers estimate that there may be hundreds of genes that could make someone more likely to develop autism, but merely having any one of those genes doesn't determine whether or not the disorder develops, or how severe it is if it does. Through careful epidemiological studies conducted on large populations, a number of scientists, including  Craig Newschaffer at Drexel University and Peter Bearman at Columbia University, have been able to point to some factors that correlate to the risk of autism. Over the years, researchers have determined that childhood or prenatal exposure to toxic chemicals, such as pesticides ; hormone-disrupting phthalates (often found in plastics) and some found in air pollution, have played a role. Mothers who have bacterial or viral infections during pregnancy or those who are obese are also more likely to give birth to babies who are later diagnosed with autism. It's important to note, however, that these are risk factors for autism, not causes — there's a correlation between these factors and autism, but researchers aren't quite sure of the mechanism that might make the disorder more likely to develop. Researchers are getting creative with the kinds of studies they are designing to better assess these and other potential risk factors. One long-running study at the University of California, Davis tracks a huge array of children's genetic and environmental factors in children as young as two years old to compare those that develop autism to those that do not. Other research efforts start even earlier, tracking moms — since autism seems to run in families, scientists are recruiting mothers who already have one child with autism, then recruit the next sibling. ""If you do this during pregnancy, you can give the mom questionnaires in real time and ask her things like where she drove, what she ate,"" Volk says. Plus, you can take samples from the mother during her pregnancy or even image the fetus' brain as it develops. More from Modern Medicine:FDA testing groundbreaking science: Human organs-on-a-chip
Venture capitalist wages war against Parkinson's after own diagnosis
A new sickle-cell drug 25 years in the making But even if a well-designed study uncovers a new risk factor, that has to be validated and replicated by other scientists. And so far, Volk says, researchers are not far enough down the road to come up with any interventions to treat or prevent autism based on those findings. There are some findings that, if reflected in policy, are generally beneficial, such as having cleaner air and making baby bottles that are BPA-free. ""But we're not far enough to think about pharmacological interventions in pregnancy,"" Volk says. Right now the most effective interventions for autism take place after a child has begun to show symptoms. ""The best way for us to support children with autism is to support parents so that they interact with children and address concerns with children together,"" Elsabbagh says. Programs are popping up all over the world to help parents do exactly that—to modify their own behavior towards children with autism so that, over time, the children's brains develop in the most optimal way possible. In the US, some of those programs include the UC Davis MIND Institute, the  Center for Autism and the Developing Brain in New York and the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA. Researchers are working on how to make these costly programs available to all families who need them, Elsabbagh says. It's not clear what future interventions might look like. But scientists are working on it. ""I think the best thing we can do as scientists is ask smart questions and follow the data where it seems to point,"" Volk says. Sometimes, that process is time consuming or surprisingly complex. ""I think maybe the challenge in that type of reporting is that science changes incrementally. We make small discoveries over time,"" Elsabbagh says. And though they've been at it for decades, researchers are hopeful that they can unravel autism to provide more effective interventions for people with autism. ""I don't think [understanding autism] is an unsolvable problem. I don't think any autism researcher would be doing it if it were,"" says Halladay of the Autism Science Foundation. According to the National Autism Association,  a person with autism may: Not respond to his or her name.Have obsessive interests.Avoid eye contact or physical contact.Have difficulty understanding, or showing understanding, of others' feelings or their own.Repeat words or phrases.React more or less sensitively than usual to sounds, smells, tastes, sights or physical sensations.

Marijuana stocks are blazing hot, and it's not hard to see why. According to ArcView, a leading cannabis research firm, the compound annual growth rate for legal North American weed sales is estimated to be 26% between 2016 and 2021. In terms of numerical value, we're talking about almost $15 billion in legal sales growth as a result of ongoing legalization efforts in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S., as well as organic growth opportunities in already legal nations and states. We've also witnessed a very discernible shift toward favorability among the American public. CBS News' latest poll from April 2017 found that an all-time record number of respondents (61%) wants to see pot legal across the country. A separate study from Quinnipiac University, also this past April, found almost universal support (94%) for medical cannabis when asking if it should be legal in the United States. Image source: Getty Images. Opinions are shifting toward cannabis, sales are growing rapidly, and marijuana stock investors are profiting. Of the one dozen largest marijuana stocks by market cap, the average of these weed stocks has more than doubled in value over the trailing-12-month period. But do these rising valuations make sense? That will depend on whether these publicly traded pot stocks have the sales growth to back up their budding valuations. Today, we're going to take a look at three pure-play marijuana stocks with the highest annual sales, based on their most recent full-year earnings report. You'll note the use of ""pure play,"" meaning we're excluding publicly traded marijuana companies that only derive a portion of their revenue from legal pot. This means Scotts Miracle-Gro, which generates near 10% of its annual sales from its focus on hydroponics (growth in a nutrient-rich water solution), soil, and lighting solutions, for the medical cannabis industry won't make the cut. Neither will Insys Therapeutics, which only recently launched its oral dronabinol solution Syndros as a treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, as well as anorexia associated with AIDS. Insys relies predominantly on sales of breakthrough cancer therapy Subsys for the time being. Instead, the following three pot stocks, which all share something in common, are your true ""green giants."" Image source: Getty Images. In terms of annual sales, no marijuana stock generates more than Canadian medical cannabis grower and retailer MedReleaf (NASDAQOTH:MEDFF), which only went public about three months ago. As you'll note below, all three of the top-selling pot stocks are Canadian producers and retailers for the country's medical weed industry. MedReleaf is in fine financial shape for a number of reasons. Rather than having to effect numerous bought-deal financings that could balloon its outstanding share count, its recent initial public offering raised bountiful capital that it can use to expand its Bradford facility in Ontario. This will lead to new capacity that can help MedReleaf meet rising demand from the medical side of the equation, as well as the growing possibility that Canada may legalize recreational marijuana by July 1, 2018. In particular, MedReleaf has two advantages that have allowed it to thus far stand out from a crowded field. First, it tends to focus on higher-quality strains of cannabis, which also cost more. MedReleaf has discovered that medical pot patients will pay more for a higher-quality product, which is one reason why the company's sales more than doubled from fiscal 2016. Second, MedReleaf has a keen focus on cannabis oils. According to a company investor presentation, it controlled 44.5% of the Canadian cannabis oils market as of the fourth quarter of 2016. Cannabis oils traditionally have a higher price point and margins than dried cannabis, which has set MedReleaf up for success. Image source: Getty Images. By a seemingly razor-thin margin, Canopy Growth Corp. (NYSE:CGC) has the second-highest annual sales total at $32 million.  However, it saw considerably quicker growth than MedReleaf in its most recent fiscal year as a result of its aggressive acquisition strategy. According to its full-year report, the company's sales grew by 214% from the previous year. Canopy Growth is attempting to become the kingpin of the Canadian market by gobbling up other companies and land. Earlier this year, it completed its acquisition of Mettrum Health, which wound up giving Canopy Growth access to about half of Canada's registered medical patients. That's a sizable patient pool considering that Health Canada in May noted a 10% monthly growth rate in registered medical weed patients. It also acquired 472,000 square feet of land surrounding its headquarters, which could serve to expand its grow capacity if Canada were to legalize recreational weed. Another interesting tidbit about Canopy Growth that's helped its sales soar is the fact that it's one of just a handful of producers that's been cleared to export its cannabis to countries where medical marijuana is legal. A good example is Germany. Medical cannabis recently became legal in Germany, but domestic production is minimal, which is where Canopy Growth's exports come into play. Finally, Canopy Growth relies on branding partnerships to attract new customers. Its Tweed branding is among the most recognized in Canada, and partnerships with well-known rap artist Snoop Dogg have only aided its efforts to improve brand awareness. Image source: Getty Images. In a distant third, but growing very rapidly, is Canada's Aphria (NASDAQOTH:APHQF), which produced $16.4 million in full-year sales for fiscal 2017. Every headline figure moved in the right direction for Aphria in its latest full-year report, including 142% sales growth, 962% EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth from the previous year, a 44% decline in cash costs to produce dried cannabis, and a 670-basis-point increase in adjusted gross margin. Like MedReleaf, Aphria is trying to grow its operations primarily through organic expansion. It's in the process of working on a multiphase expansion that'll boost its growing capacity to 1 million square feet. In fact, it recently upped its projected annual output to 100,000 kilograms once its $100 million phase 4 project is complete. As with the other producers above, this project couldn't come at a better time considering the rapid growth in registered medical patients and the possibility of legal recreational pot coming to Canada by next summer. Aphria is also among that aforementioned group of companies that have been given the OK to export cannabis to foreign countries. Between demand from Europe, Canada's medical pot industry, and the possibility of a recreational legalization, Aphria and its peers may struggle to meet demand, which would have been an almost laughable scenario just a few years before.

    These 3 Pure-Play Marijuana Stocks Are Generating the Highest Annual Sales -- The Motley Fool

  "
Todd Campbell,09072017,Fool,08312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Following Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) decision to buy Kite Pharma (NASDAQ:KITE) for $11.9 billion in cash, we couldn't help but wonder what other healthcare stocks could be takeover targets, too. A full transcript follows the video. Todd Campbell: Buyouts, buyouts, buyouts! Harjes: Yeah, I can see why. Last week, you were talking to my colleague Michael Douglass on this show about Gilead Science's acquisition of Kite Pharmaceuticals. So, this week, we figured we would continue the trend a little bit by highlighting some stock we think might be the next takeover candidates. After that, we'll discuss the demise of Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA), a stock that shed half its value just last month. But first, Todd, I feel like the biotech space is particularly talked about in terms of buyout speculation. Why do you think that is? Campbell: People like to hit home runs in this industry. [laughs] You know? By the nature of the beast, with clinical trials failing and successes being rare, and failures being more frequent, when people go in and buy biotech stocks, they tend to be more risk tolerant. Wouldn't you agree, Kristine? Harjes: Yeah, sure. And, investors should be pretty risk tolerant if they're going to enter particularly clinical-stage biotech space. I don't know, it confuses me why there's so much speculation and hope for buyouts, because if it were me and I was buying one of these companies that had what I thought could be a blockbuster drug, I wouldn't want it to get bought out. I would want all that upside of them potentially bringing it to market and actually succeeding. But maybe that's a long-term, short-term difference. Campbell: Yeah, but Kristine, it's not like consumer goods, where you're dealing with a brand like Coca-Cola. All of biotech is driven by patent expiration or protection. With innovation moving so quickly, you may have a great, innovative product, but how long will that innovation keep you ahead of the competition that's coming up the pipeline behind you? From a corporate standpoint, [I think there are] some reasons why you've got entrepreneurs who are saying, ""Let's ring the register and be willing to sell,"" and from the acquirer standpoint, you've got people saying, ""OK, we've got patents expire in, what's the next big thing and can we bring it into our fold to offset that risk?"" Harjes: Yeah, you're right, I can totally see why both sides of the equation would be interested in it. I guess my hesitation is, why do investors push for it so much? I think it's more just the fun of speculating, and that's exactly what we're about to do, is speculate a little bit on who we think could be the next big buyout. One place where there's been a ton of hype around potential acquisitions is none other than the CAR-T space. As a refresher, Kite Pharma, as I mentioned earlier, was bought by Gilead Sciences, it's a CAR-T cancer drug developer. On Kite's acquisition, a bunch of the other CAR-T developers also had their share prices pop, which to me is very indicative that people think that some of these other smaller players might also get acquired. Campbell: Yeah, that move up in Juno was pretty insane, wasn't it, Kristine? Harjes: Yeah, I was pretty happy to see it. A long time ago, I realize I probably should have had my money in Kite instead of Juno, but I'm still sitting on my Juno shares. I was definitely a happy camper that day. Campbell: Yeah, I think we got, what, a 40% move up in the span of a couple of days? Obviously, investors were extrapolating, ""If Novartis gets their CAR-T approved, and Kite theoretically gets its approved in November, and Gilead just spent all this money acquiring Kite to be able to get that upside, and then Juno, Juno has these CAR-T drugs, too, and maybe those drugs will be even better. So, perhaps I should get involved with that!"" Harjes: Yeah. I think there are a couple of different ways people might be looking at this. The first is, Gilead might not be finished buying CAR-T developers. I think there are some people out there who look at Gilead's strategy here and say, ""They're not done, they don't want just Kite. They want to build an entire oncology franchise built around cellular therapy,"" which is exactly what you heard John Milligan say on the conference call regarding the Kite acquisition, that they're looking to do this, to see other companies they could fold in and augment what they've already built by buying Kite. So, this is that string of pearls acquisition technique where, instead of making one enormous splashy purchase, you can tuck in a couple of companies here and there, and they definitely have the money to do that. And, on the other side of that coin, you could also have speculation that someone else is going to buy Juno. I'm not sure who exactly that would be, but it could be Celgene. Campbell: I'll throw a name in the mix there, Kristine. Harjes: Who are you going to throw? Campbell: I'll say Celgene. Harjes: Yep. [laughs] Campbell: Why not? Harjes: They've already been looking at Juno in terms of partnerships. Campbell: Oh, absolutely! Correct me if I'm wrong, but they took a stake in it previously when it inked its deal on CAR-T development. I think Celgene has shown that it loves to tie itself to the wagon of emerging biotechnology. They don't have an internal CAR-T option. They do have some collaborations, one with bluebird bio, which was another stock that rallied significantly following the news on Kite. We've discussed that one on the show previously. So, they've got a couple deals externally for CAR-T, but they don't have anything internally. And since they've already shown that they want to be a major player in cancer, you could see that as being a possibility. But, I always get so nervous when we start talking about ifs and buts and whens and what ifs. Harjes: Yeah, you sound like you're about to throw out some caveats. Campbell: Well, yeah. If you look at what's been happening with CAR-T, Juno, I'm not going to call it and also-ran, but they went from being a front-runner to now being in, we'll call it third place. Their JCAR015, they had to shutter development of that. That was their lead product candidate, and they had to shutter development when safety risks caught up to them. Specifically, people were dying because of brain swelling. They had some patient deaths because of brain swelling. Well, they've now shifted their focus to JCAR017, which is a very intriguing drug. It's next generation CAR-T, and they think it could be safer. But, it's not like they've necessarily proven that out. They're not at the same stage as, say, Kite was, with a pending FDA application, or that Novartis was with their CAR-T in getting unanimous support from an adcom committee. So, I think there's a significant amount of risk with all the remaining CAR-T players, and that does make me a little bit cautious on the idea of them being a buyout. Harjes: Yeah. And they're, appropriately, a lot smaller than Kite. At their inflated market cap, Juno and bluebird are both around less than half the size currently. And that, of course, reflects the fact that they are earlier stage. Even bluebird is super early, but they also have this entire side gene therapy program. One more name that I want to mention, because Todd, you brought up the safety risks involved here with CAR-T, and this company that I think has a really a novel way of addressing the safety risks is so, so tiny. They're only $350 million in market cap, which, for Gilead to purchase them, that would be pennies to them. This company is called Bellacom. They have an interesting molecular switching technology that could potentially make it best-in-class down the road, but way down the road. It'll be years. Their lead candidate could maybe hit the market in 2019. So, super interesting technology that could potentially improve the outcomes of some of these CAR-T therapies, things like stem cell transplants, which often have complications. But, this, again, is an extremely early stage company. I'm not even sure if Gilead would be interested in them, because it's so tiny that it probably won't even be a needle mover. Campbell: Yeah. A company like Gilead, they like to focus on companies that are a little bit further along in their development, a little bit closer to market, where they can see a return on their investment in a relatively short period of time. They tied their wagon to Kite right now. I think, unless one of these other companies comes out there and shows that they really have dropped-dead better efficacy, better safety. Safety is going to be key in CAR-T, Kristine. I think that's the differentiator. Harjes: Well, that's a bunch of the Juno theory right now, that they're not going to be first but they might be safest. Campbell: Exactly! And if they are the safest, that's critical, because right now CAR-Ts are getting approved for use in refractory disease, heavily pretreated patients, these patients don't have a lot of treatment options. If they want to be able to tap into the much larger pool of cancer patients and move that up into earlier forms of treatment, they need to be able to prove that these drugs are safe. Now, in clinical trials, I think Juno has shown some really interesting interim results that suggest, possibly, it may have a better safety profile than, say, Kite's Axi-Cel. But, you need to roll this out in more patients, you need to evaluate this because we interim stuff that we saw in JCAR015 looked good, too, right? Harjes: Yeah. You definitely need a bigger sample size. Campbell: Oh, yeah, absolutely! Whenever it comes to investing in clinical-stage companies, I really do caution investors chasing the news and trying to buy something simply because it's running up because of something that's happened to another company. It's a risky way of investing. I think you're better off saying, do I like the technology, after doing the research? Reading everything there is on The Fool about Juno, am I convinced that this company has a better mouse track? If you think that's the case, then be a little patient, wait for shares to balance out a little bit. They've had a big run up. And then pick your spots. Again, keep it to a small, diversified position in your portfolio. Harjes: Yep. Let's pivot pretty hard here away from CAR-T and go over to the robotic surgery market, where Todd, you brought up to me another company that you think might be a very good buyout candidate. Campbell: Kristine, we spent a lot of time talking on the show about companies in biopharma. We don't really talk as much about companies in med-tech. And I thought it might be interesting to go out and try to find a company in med-tech that fits three criteria. I wanted to find something that's a little bit off the beaten path, something that's disrupting an industry. I also wanted to find something that already has a product on the market that's delivering sales growth, and I wanted to find a company that was already being shown some interest or some love by a larger company that could potentially become and acquirer. And when I put all that stuff up in the mixing bowl, the name that popped out for me was Mazor Robotics, a robotics company that's reenvisioning the way surgeons do spinal surgery. Harjes: At first, when I looked at this company, I was like, ""Oh, well, Intuitive Surgical, they're just going to dominate this space, why would I ever be interested in a smaller player?"" But, it turns out that there's actually two pretty separate markets. Mazor has the Mazor X and the Renaissance System that helps surgeons perform spine and brain procedures, which is pretty different from what Intuitive Surgical -- which, if listeners aren't familiar with them, they are the Goliath in robotic surgery. But, Intuitive focuses on gynecological, urology, and general surgery. Campbell: Right, more laparoscopic stuff. Harjes: Right. So, what Mazor is improving the accuracy of surgeons when they're doing these surgeries, it reduces complications, it minimizes the need for inner operative X-rays, which is great because that will lower the radiation doses that patients are exposed to, and it leads to a faster recovery and less postoperative pain. All good stuff there. Campbell: Which is very important. You have to remember that these procedures are being reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid at fixed rates. So, the more that hospital can reduce, say, recovery times, get patients in, get patients out, avoid complications that may end up having them return to the hospital where they're not likely to get reimbursed as much from Medicare and Medicaid, the better. I equate this company, Mazor, to where Intuitive Surgical was maybe five years ago, in the stage of, OK, we're at the tipping point where we've invested a lot of time, effort, and energy over the course of the last few years, and trying to establish ourselves with those first-mover surgeons, the ones who are saying, ""yes, I want to be on the cutting edge of technology."" And now we're getting to a point where there's enough clinical data and papers published and things going on that it's becoming a little bit more mainstream. You're reaching that tipping point where more hospitals may go out and start buying these machines, which are relatively expensive machines. They can run $800,000 to $1,000,000. So, it's a big investment for these hospitals and surgery centers. I think that's what we're seeing now. We're seeing Mazor generate pretty rapid growth for its latest system, which is the Mazor X. Harjes: Which is a win-win, because the more hospitals and surgery centers that you can get into, you not only have the sales from the systems themselves, you also get roughly $1,500 per procedure in disposables sales. That's that razors and blades model that we talked about with Intuitive Surgical. Plus, you also get the service contracts. So, at this point, Mazor just wants to sell the most of these machines that they can to continue getting in that constant revenue from the procedure sales and from the service contracts. So, what they've done is, they've enlisted a little bit of help. Campbell: Yes. And this brings us to the big company that's showing it some love part of the segment, where we step back and say, what's the spine market look like? And, if this company is disrupting the spine market, what players in spine right now are paying attention? And the company that is really paying attention is Medtronic. Medtronic cut a deal with Mazor last year to start using its sales force to generate out leads that would get surgeons at the hospitals that it calls upon to go check out Mazor's system. Harjes: Yeah. This is a partnership that had initially the responsibility for the two of these two companies to both be marketing these machines through the end of this year. Then, it had some options that came at the end of the year. But, we actually just found out earlier this week, I believe it was, that Phase II of the agreement is already going to kick in, which means that Medtronic will take over the exclusive rights to distribute the Mazor X system, and it'll also make another investment in the company. Campbell: Right. It was kind of like a courtship. You went out on a date to see if the two of you liked each other. You had Medtronic giving some very preliminary training on Mazor's system, learning a little bit about it, and then of course, starting to talk about it with the people they were calling upon and get those people to go. The way that the deal had structure originally was, if the Phase I portion of the deal had gone well, then you would advance to Phase II, where Medtronic takes over 100% of all the marketing of it. But that wasn't expected to happen until February of 2018. Instead, they're doing it now. So, that tends to show you a little bit of the opportunity that Medtronic thinks there is for the Mazor X, and how it thinks it may dovetail into its own spine platform, which includes things like, say, the implants that are being used by this system during these surgical procedures, and some of the other componentry that's used by this system during these procedures. You have Medtronic doing $649 million in quarterly sales tied to spine alone. And you have Mazor possibly on the cusp of contributing much more meaningfully to that number over time, now that Medtronic is taking over the responsibility of marketing them. Which, by the way, is global marketing, which is huge, because up toward now, Mazor has really only penetrated the U.S. market. It's not very well penetrated outside the U.S. Harjes: Yeah. I haven't even seen ex-U.S. numbers as projections from Mazor, but within the U.S. alone, the opportunity is still huge. Last year, they only used the system in 5,000 different procedures in the U.S., but they estimate that the total addressable market in just the U.S. is 500,000. So, stretch that out to the global opportunity, and yeah, absolutely, this opportunity is enormous. Campbell: Yeah, I don't know if this is going to get to the size of an Intuitive Surgical. I think there's a likelihood that at some point, Medtronic maybe just swoops in and buys up the company lock stock and barrel. It's already, Kristine, as part of these deals, putting its money where its mouth is and buying shares in Mazor. Harjes: Yep. The equity stake is also huge, just as a vote of confidence from Medtronic, which is a Goliath in the space. Campbell: Right. There are three tranches that Medtronic took advantage of. They bought some shares at $11.42, which has worked out really well for them. They bought another 4% at $21.84. Now, they have a third tranche that they're buying at $38.46. Once they're all said and done, they're going to already own about 12% of Mazor, with a potential to take that up to between 14 and 15% because of some warrants. Harjes: We'll be watching to see if that ever hits 100%. Onto the second segment of today's show where we answer the question, what the heck happened with Teva last month? Campbell: I feel like we've seen this movie before, Kristine. Harjes: With Teva? Campbell: Yeah. A company goes out, spends a lot of money on acquisitions, gets heavily indebted, sales start to fall, next thing you know ... Harjes: Yeah, here we are. Teva has a lot going on right now, but we will unpack all of that. As a reminder, back in August 2016, Teva bough Actavis, which is Allergan's generic business. This was largely funded by debt. Now, fast forward a little bit to today, and that's gotten them in some trouble. Campbell: Yeah, a little bit. The timing of it ... it looked like a really good deal at the time. It was a $40 billion deal, with some of it being done in Teva stock, and the rest of it being done in ""cash."" They borrow the money because, ""Why not, the interest rates are low, I can go out and buy this money and finance it with the sales growth and the cash flow."" That thinking is wonderful as long as you don't stumble and cash flow doesn't start to decline. Harjes: Yeah. When Teva reported earnings on August 23rd, its stock dropped 24% right away, which was due to a confluence of negative news in the earnings report. The most relevant one to this generics business was them saying that because of customer consolidation and increased competition from other generic drug makers, they're just not getting the prices that they're used to. Apparently, the negotiations that they went through on their contract renewals led to a 6% overall price decrease. They expect that to continue eroding through the rest of the year. So, that's alarming on its own, but I'm also really worried by the fact that management didn't really seem to see this coming. Campbell: No. I don't think a lot of the industry did, to be fair. I think some of the pharmacies themselves have been surprised by the impact of falling generic pricing. I think you've seen it throughout the entire supply chain. The reality is this is the situation we're in today on September 6th. We have a company that's a mammoth, it's a Goliath in generic drugs, that now has this rope around its neck in the form of this big debt payment that it has to make. That's going to force it to make some pretty drastic decisions. They've decided to cut their dividend substantially. Harjes: 75%, yeah. Campbell: Yeah, which is something that income investors never want to hear. You can almost hear the shares being flushed out of income portfolios on that news. And they have all sorts of other problems right now with the share price, because Allergan, as part of that deal, got a whole bunch of shares in Teva. They don't want those shares, so they're planning on unloading them in the open market, selling them. So, you have that weight on the share price as well. So, you have a pitch situation where you have generic drug price compression hurting margins and crimping cash flow, interest expense rising because of all of this debt, and a lot of shares becoming available for sale that's affecting the supply and demand for the pricing of the individual shares. Throw on top of all that, Kristine -- Harjes: Yeah, we're not done yet. If you had asked me a year ago, ""What is Teva's largest problem?"", I would have said the fact that Copaxone, which is a huge part of their branded business -- we talked about Teva as a generics business, but it actually does have a branded segment as well that is dominated by this one multiple sclerosis drug, it's the most popular MS drug in the world, and it's going to come off-patent as early as next year. It could be facing unbranded competition, dragging down its profits from this drug. So, we've had our eye on that forever. And all of the sudden, that problem is just one of many. Campbell: Right, they went from 20mg to 40mg so they could improve the dosing schedule, that protected market share for a couple of years. Now, there's been ongoing patent disputes between them and some generics that have some people thinking that you could end up with a 40mg competitor in relatively short order. This is a billion dollar a quarter drug. At one point, it was racking up $4 billion in sales. And in the second quarter, sales were down I think 12% in the United States to $843 million. This is a significant potential headwind at a time where the company doesn't need any more significant potential headwinds. Harjes: Yeah. I'll also know that they are still looking for a permanent CEO. The guy that they have right now is not anything other than an interim president and CEO after the old CEO stepped down last February. Todd, to wrap up this segment, when you're looking at this company, it has gotten really cheap if you look at it on an earnings multiple basis. Do you think it could be a value player right now? Campbell: A value player or a falling knife, take your pick. I don't know. Whenever you look at these metrics, they're either trailing 12 month metrics, which really don't reflect the situation that Teva's moving into, or they're based on forward estimates, which could very well not pan out depending on how this business ends up performing over the next few quarters. It's very hard to say it's cheap at 3X earnings per share if those are earnings per share could end up getting revised 50% lower. So we just simply don't know. You're right, it's trading at a price to book value that's less than one. It's trading at a low single-digit P/E ratio. But, the current ratio is also less than one, which means it doesn't have a whole heck of a lot of wiggle room in the short-term when it comes to financing its short-term or paying its short-term obligations. Do I think that Teva Pharmaceuticals is going to disappear? I guess, push come to shove, no. Am I willing to bet more than 1% of my portfolio on it? [laughs] I think that's the way you have to look at it. You have to say, ""Maybe this is cheap, and I think it's going to come out on the other side. And certainly, there are big demographic trends at support generic prescription volume over time. Maybe I'll put 1% of my portfolio in it, and if it ends up tripling or quadrupling from these levels over a course of five or 10 years, yay, I'm rewarded."" Harjes: Yeah. You also have that dividend yield that, at this point, is looking kind of insane. I want to say it somewhere around 7%. But, I agree with the hesitation in your voice that says this one is likely to be a falling knife. Campbell: Yeah. Kristine, that dividend yield, though, is based on the trailing, not the forward, I don't think. And now that they've cut the dividend, I don't think it's yielding nearly as much. I don't think it's nearly as attractive on that. Over time, you could get into a situation where cash flow stabilizes, they have a plan to restructure by selling some units, raising some cash. If they can do those kind of things, and cash flow grows again, maybe the dividend starts increasing, and that will be one of the key drivers that makes the stock go much higher. But, it's a very high risk-reward stock in my opinion. Harjes: Absolutely. That'll do it for today's show.

    Are These Healthcare Stocks Top Takeover Targets? -- The Motley Fool

Sean Williams,09072017,Fool,08312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Few industries, if any, are growing as quickly as legal marijuana. According to cannabis research firm ArcView, the North American legal-weed industry generated $6.9 billion in sales in 2016, which still pales in comparison with the $46.4 billion in sales estimated on the black market. However, by 2021 it's believed that the legal North American pot market will have vaulted in value to $21.6 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate of 26%. If there's a single factor that can be pinpointed for this growth, it'd be the rapid shift in consumer opinion toward marijuana. Gallup, which has taken periodic polls on cannabis' favorability for nearly 50 years, found in 1995 that only a quarter of those surveyed wanted it to be legal across the United States. Of course, this poll was also conducted during the War on Drugs. As of 2016, Gallup's same poll found that an all-time record 60% of respondents want to see it legal nationally. The belief is that as this figure rises, pressure will mount on lawmakers in Congress to adjust their scheduling of the drug. Image source: Getty Images. Paramount to the success of the U.S. legal-weed industry, aside from organic growth in already legal states, is the ability to expand into new states. The 2016 elections saw a nearly ""green"" sweep, with marijuana initiatives and amendments being passed in eight out of nine states (sorry, Arizonans). The chances are decent that the 2018 elections will bring another serious opportunity for adult-use marijuana to be legalized in a handful of states. Of course, we have to remember that not all states have the same voting process. Whereas some states have a referendum and initiative process, whereby residents can gather signatures to introduce and vote on propositions, bills in other states have to be introduced and passed entirely at the legislative level. For instance, both houses of Vermont's legislature voted in favor of legalizing recreational cannabis earlier this year, however Gov. Phil Scott (R-Vt.) vetoed the measure. Despite presumed strong support for recreational cannabis in Vermont, its residents have no official say in the process, save for voting Scott out of office, should they choose to do so in a future election. Two dozen states in the U.S. lack this referendum and initiative process. So which states are the likeliest to have their residents heading to the polls in 2018 to vote on a recreational marijuana bill? Once we exclude the aforementioned states without a referendum and initiative process, the following three rise clearly to the top of the list. Image source: Getty Images. One of the more interesting quirks of voting on marijuana bills is that the first time isn't always the charm -- but the second time seems to be. In the November 2016 elections, Arizona wound up voting down Prop 205 (52% opposed to 48% in favor), which would have legalized recreational marijuana in the state. However, the margin of loss was close enough that pro-legalization groups are expected to focus their efforts on the state for the 2018 election. History would suggest that Arizona has a decent shot of approval in 2018. Oregon, which is one of the most pro-legalization states in the country, initially failed to legalize an adult-use measure itself when voters went to the polls in 2012. Oregon wound up officially legalizing through a 2014 vote by state residents. The same can be said for Florida, which voted down a medical-marijuana amendment by just 2% in 2014. With a new medical-cannabis amendment on the ballot in 2016, and pro-legalization groups putting a lot of effort into Florida between 2015 and 2016, the measure passed with ease last November. The second time could very well be the charm for Arizonans. Image source: Getty Images. Residents in Michigan have been here before. It appeared that the Wolverine State would have no issues getting a recreational-weed initiative on the 2016 ballots, but they were thwarted by a number of invalid signatures. The upcoming election in 2018 could be redemption for pro-legalization groups. According to MLive.com, as of mid-July the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol (CRMLA) had collected more than 100,000 signatures, which is well on its way to the 252,523 valid signatures needed to get an initiative on the ballot come the 2018 elections. CRMLA spokesman Josh Hovey has suggested that the current momentum could see the pro-legalization group hitting its signature target in four months instead of the six months given to collect valid signatures. If approved, there would be a 10% excise tax and 6% sales tax on legal weed. Polling data also suggests that Michigan presents a compelling case to legalize. A statewide poll of 600 Michigan voters from Marketing Resource Group this past May found that 58% support legalizing adult-use weed, compared to just 36% who opposed it. This is a stark reversal from the 55% who opposed it and 41% who supported the idea of recreational legalization in 2013. Image source: Getty Images. Lastly, Ohioans could head to the polls for a second time in three years in 2018 to vote on recreational marijuana. The last time they went to the polls in November 2015, they voted down Issue 3 with authority (35% to 65%). However, we have to keep in mind that the reason Ohioans voted down Issue 3 was that it had two inherent flaws. To begin with, Issue 3 called for just 10 predetermined sites to grow and manufacture recreational weed. It would have created an oligopoly for some well-to-do backers and ensured that competition stayed out of their way for years. It would have been terrible for Ohio's consumers. The second problem with Issue 3 was that it was a dual medical and recreational marijuana legalization measure. That's never been done before, and it's exceptionally difficult to pull off without the medical infrastructure already in place. The reason 2018 looks so promising is that Ohio's legislature wound up passing a medical-marijuana law in 2016, not too long after Issue 3 was defeated.  By 2018, the state will have about two years of planning under its belt, and presumably around a year of experience with medical cannabis sales and patients. This, along with a focus from pro-legalization groups, could make Ohio a state likely to vote on recreational cannabis next year. ","

Brian Stoffel,09072017,Fool,08312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There's no question they're bad for your health. But given their addictive nature, both beer and cigarettes have proven to be investments with enviable returns. That's why so many investors flock to Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD). But which of these dividend-paying stalwarts is a better bet for your portfolio today? While that's not a question that can be answered with 100% certainty, there are ways to getting some more clarity on the decision. If we break it down to three simple categories, the picture gets clearer. Image source: Getty Images This is by far the most important thing to keep an eye on for long-term investors. A sustainable competitive advantage -- otherwise referred to as a ""moat"" -- is what differentiates one company from the next. Because there's nothing prohibiting start-ups from making their own beer or cigarettes, the key moat for both of these companies is the strength of their brands. Given both companies' ubiquity globally, and the apparent pricing power that comes with those brands, I'm calling this one a tie. Winner: Tie The main draw for investors in these companies is the dividend that they pay out. With recognizable brands and comparatively low input costs, they both spit out lots of cash. But while we'll get to those payments in a minute, it's worth considering how much cash the company keeps on hand for a rainy day as well. While such an allocation might be boring, it is also crucial. That's because every company, at one point or another, is bound to experience difficult economic times. Those that have cash on hand have options: buy back shares on the cheap, acquire weaker rivals at a discount, or outspend the competition into bankruptcy. Debt-heavy companies are in the opposite boat, forced to narrow their focus just to make ends meet. Here's how these two stack up, keeping in mind that Anheuser is valued at a 25% premium -- via market capitalization -- to Philip Morris. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Philip Morris $7.3 billion $26.6 billion $7 billion $8.1 billion Anheuser-Busch InBev $30 billion $108 billion $4 billion $6.5 billion Data sources: SEC filings and Yahoo! Finance. Net income and free cash flow presented on trailing-12-month basis. Figures rounded to nearest billion. To be honest, I'm not terribly impressed with either company's balance sheet. While reliable free cash flow means that neither has much to worry about when it comes to meeting their debt obligations, both companies have a fair amount of leverage. Both companies have identical cash-to-debt ratios, but the differentiator is Philip Morris' free cash flow, which is far superior to Anheuser-Busch, even though the latter is a bigger company. Winner: Philip Morris And then we have valuation. There's no one metric that can tell you just how expensive a stock is. Instead, I like to use a number of data points to get a more holistic picture. Company P/E Ratio P/FCF Ratio PEG Ratio Philip Morris 26 23 2.3 Anheuser-Busch InBev 39 35 1.3 Data sources: SEC filings, Yahoo! Finance, and E*Trade. P/E represents non-GAAP earnings. On the surface it might seem that Philip Morris is cheaper than Anheuser -- on both an earnings and free cash flow basis. But it's important to remember that the latter's numbers are slightly skewed given the acquisition of SAB Miller. That's where the PEG ratio -- which factors normalized growth into the equation -- comes in. On that metric, Anheuser appears to be trading at a 40% discount to Philip Morris. With both companies having relatively similar and strong yields, the scale tips ever-so-slightly in favor of Anheuser-Busch. Winner: Anheuser-Busch InBev So there you have it: We have a draw. Both companies have strong moats provided by their ubiquitous brands. Philip Morris has the stronger cash flows for now, while investors appear to be getting a better bargain on Anheuser-Busch InBev at current price levels. ","

Stratfor analysts,09072017,MarketWatch,08312017,"Published: Sept 3, 2017 3:51 p.m. ET Talks and negotiations between superpowers and North Korea may now be a thing of the past By North Korea appears to have conducted a sixth nuclear test shortly after noon local time on Sept. 3. Initial reports from South Korea say the quake connected to the test measured 5.6 on the Richter scale, larger than the last test, which measured a magnitude of 5.1. Subsequent reports from the U.S. Geological Survey agency said the blast reached a magnitude of 6.3, indicating a significant increase in yield from any of the North’s previous nuclear tests. The test follows Pyongyang’s claim that it had completed the miniaturization of a hydrogen bomb capable of being fitted to an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea has repeatedly claimed perfection of hydrogen bomb technology, producing weapons that employ a more powerful fusion reaction, as opposed to the usual fission reaction of North Korea’s more primitive nuclear weapons. Read: North Korea hails ‘perfect success’ of nuclear test This is an important component of the North’s deterrent strategy: It feels it must showcase that it can do significant damage to a city on the U.S. mainland to change U.S. calculus on military action or attempted regime change in North Korea. The North’s 2016 test, when it claimed to have carried out a fusion reaction, was largely dismissed by international observers because of the relatively small size of the seismic wave. Pyongyang claims that it has had to carry out only small tests because it does not have the facilities or space that the United States, China or Russia had for their nuclear tests — North Korea is a small country, and claims that if it tested a larger device underground, it would create risks for the country itself. It is still too early to determine just what Pyongyang tested, whether an enhanced traditional nuclear weapon, or some small-scale hydrogen bomb, but it is clear that the North has not slowed the pace of its nuclear and missile program despite international sanctions, condemnation and warnings from the United States. Explained: What is a hydrogen bomb? From Pyongyang’s perspective, it has a narrow window in these final stages of testing to complete a program before the United States amasses the political will and international support to carry out preventive action. If the test is confirmed as a high-yield hydrogen bomb, it would mark a very significant development for North Korea’s ability to deter U.S. and allied military action. The power of a hydrogen bomb means that the North Koreans would still be able to inflict significant damage to the United States without the need for their missiles to be particularly accurate. It also means that the missile could cause major damage without having to survive reentry, as a high-altitude airburst could still prove devastating, especially to electronic systems. South Korea has already called for a special session of its own National Security Council and it is likely the United States will call for increased sanctions and isolation of the North. China and Russia, however, are likely to call for talks, even if the talks have little long-term ability to reverse the Pyongyang’s path. But as Beijing argues, at least North Korea’s pace of testing slows during talks, slowing the timeline for any potential crisis. But if the North Korean program is advancing at the pace it claims, it may be too late to debate over negotiations or their meaning — the North may be closer than anyone expected to having a viable nuclear deterrent.

The S&P has climbed 10.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has surged 19% since the start of the year. “Biotech rally, which created an upside momentum in the market amid very low volumes, has been driving the market over the past two days,” said Sahak Manuelian, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities. Some analysts said the market has been supported by earnings and a positive economic environment over the past several months. Thursday’s economic releases came in mostly in line with expectations, confirming a positive trend in growth. Low levels of first-time jobless claims  suggest the labor market remains robust, while consumer spending — the biggest driver of the economy — picked up in July, thanks to higher income for consumers and low inflation. “In an environment where the economy and earnings continue to grow, markets will also climb. Geopolitics shake up markets from time to time, but usually do not have long-lasting impact,” said Arian Vojdani, investment strategist at MV Financial. Equities and other assets viewed as relatively risky have stabilized after a late-August slump thanks in part to that better-than-expected U.S. data and a stronger-than-anticipated reading on Chinese manufacturing out Thursday, according to Richard Perry, a Hantec Markets analyst. Data deluge: Consumer spending rose 0.3% last month, helped by higher incomes and low inflation. The pace of inflation, meanwhile, was little changed in July, up 0.1%. Initial jobless claims in the period running from Aug. 20 to Aug. 26 rose by 1,000 to 236,000, which is still close to a postrecession low, pointing to another solid monthly employment report near the end of summer. The official jobs report will be released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern on Friday. Separately, the Chicago PMI held steady at 58.9 in August.

                                    has rallied from the range bottom, reaching nearly three-week highs. Still, the blue-chip benchmark is firmly lower Tuesday. Tactically, near-term support matches the breakout point (21,912) and is followed by a deeper floor, circa 21,770. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has reached one-month highs. The rally punctuates a break atop major resistance — Nasdaq 6,342 — an area that remains an inflection point, also illustrated below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has reclaimed the breakdown point (6,342), rising within striking distance of record territory. Consider that last week’s close (6,435) marked a record, though the Nasdaq’s absolute all-time high (6,460.84) remains just overhead. An immediate breakout would be unexpected against the current backdrop, though the retest is worth tracking. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has rallied from well-defined support. The specific area matches the breakout point (21,682) and the 50-day moving average, currently 21,725. Conversely, the Dow’s record close (22,118) is closely followed by its absolute record peak (22,179). Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has come to life technically. As illustrated, the S&P has reclaimed the 2,453 breakdown point, a level closely matching trendline resistance. This area matches the 50-day moving average, also 2,453, and pivots to support. As partly detailed above, the widely-tracked U.S. benchmarks are off to a constructive September start. On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have reclaimed their breakdown points — S&P 2,453, and Nasdaq 6,342, respectively — rising within striking distance of record territory. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF

                                   has reversed respectably from three-month lows. In the process, the small-cap benchmark has reclaimed the 200-day moving average, and the tactically more important breakdown point, circa 138.85. A posture within the prevailing range, to the extent it’s sustained, supports a bullish-leaning intermediate- to longer-term bias. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has rallied atop the 200-day moving average, rising to the former range. Tactically, the range bottom, circa 314.60, pivots to support. Slightly more broadly, the small- and mid-cap reversals have been fueled by lighter relative volume versus the early-August downdraft. Meanwhile, the SPDR Trust S&P 500

                                   remains comparably stronger, rising firmly atop the 245 inflection point. In fact, last week’s close (247.84) missed a record close by just three cents. Resistance broadly spans from about 247.80 to 248.90, and the SPY’s response to the range top should be a useful bull-bear gauge. Similarly, the S&P 500’s backdrop remains relatively straightforward, even amid the jagged late-summer price action. Tactically, the S&P has reclaimed the headline 2,453 mark, an area matching trendline resistance and the 50-day moving average. To be sure, the reversal has registered low marks for style, as measured by volume and breadth, though as always, price action trumps other indicators. And when gauging price action, the S&P’s breakout was directionally sharp, placing record territory firmly within view, and technically neutralizing the mid-August downdraft. The S&P 2,450 area pivots to well-defined support, and sustained posture higher supports a bullish intermediate-term bias.

The shares initially stalled four weeks ago, pulling in from a downtrend pinned to the January 2017 peak. The downturn placed the shares at one-month lows, and has been punctuated by a successful test of the range bottom (9.32). Tactically, the downtrend defines major resistance — currently matching the 10.00 area — and a retest is underway Tuesday. A posture lower supports a bearish longer-term technical bias, though this week's price action should add color. Conversely, the SPDR Gold Trust

Recall that the upturn resolves a bullish double bottom, the “W” formation defined by the May and July lows. Tactically, gap support closely matches the breakout point, circa 123.30, and a posture higher supports a firmly-bullish bias. Similarly, the iShares Silver Trust

The trendline subsequently offered support. More recently, the shares have extended the breakout, clearing the 200-day moving average amid a sustained volume spike.

As illustrated, the group has rallied from three-month lows, rising to challenge the 50-day moving average, currently 168.80. The 50-day has marked a bull-bear inflection point, and the retest remains underway. A sustained break higher would strengthen the bull case.

Technically, the shares have rallied from a tight six-week range, notching a nominal all-time high. To be sure, the slight breakout has been fueled by decreased volume following a three-month distribution phase. (Very generally, the summer downturns have been fueled by increased volume, and punctuated by lighter-volume rallies.) Still, the price action is constructive, opening the path to uncharted territory, and potential follow-through. The former range bottom closely matched the 50-day moving average, and a posture higher supports a bullish bias.

Gasoline futures eased back for a fourth-straight session, despite a hefty weekly drop in U.S. stockpiles, with refinery capacity improving as floodwaters from the storm recede.

Early Thursday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said domestic crude supplies climbed by 4.6 million barrels for the week ended Sept. 1. The rise followed nine-consecutive weeks of declines. Forecasts for the supply data differed somewhat. Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts forecast a rise of 2.7 million barrels for crude stocks, but a survey from The Wall Street Journal showed expectations for a larger rise of 5 million barrels. The American Petroleum Institute reported Wednesday that U.S. crude supplies rose 2.8 million barrels last week. Crude-oil refinery inputs fell by 3.3 million barrels a day last week, to average 14.5 million barrels a day, while refineries operated at just 79.7% of capacity, the EIA said. “We do expect to see [crude] demand destruction not only in the Texas region but also in Florida with the impact of [Hurricane] Irma,” said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors. “We do feel we will continue to see crude oil builds in the weeks to come due to the demand destruction and especially since we are past the summer driving season.” He expects to “continue to see builds [for crude supplies] in the weeks to come as we see refineries slowly come back online and we are also going to refinery maintenance season.” Gasoline stockpiles were down 3.2 million barrels for the week, while distillate stockpiles edged down by 1.4 million barrels, according to the EIA. The S&P Global Platts survey showed forecasts for declines of 4.2 million in gasoline and 1.9 million barrels for distillates, which include heating oil.

Traders were also monitoring the development of Hurricane Irma which is heading toward Florida, where oil and gasoline demand could be affected. GasBuddy has been reporting big shortages of fuel at Florida gas stations ahead of the storm, with 41% of Gainesville stations without gas Thursday afternoon. Read: Hurricane Irma set to squeeze a lot more than just Florida’s oranges “So far, this [Atlantic] hurricane season has certainly had an extraordinary impact on the energy market, but almost exclusively thanks to Hurricane Harvey,” Tyler Richey, co-editor of the Sevens Report, told MarketWatch. “WTI was hit hard in the wake of Harvey’s landfall as a substantial percentage of Gulf Coast refineries were shut, essentially cutting oil demand by between 15% and 20%.” As of late Wednesday, about 12.7% of U.S. refining capacity remained down, according to S&P Global Platts. Separate data from the energy and commodities information provider showed that crude output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fell in August for the first time in five months. The group produced 32.65 million barrels a day in August, down 170,000 barrels a day from July. Natural-gas prices, meanwhile, saw a modest decline after separate EIA data Thursday showed that domestic supplies of the commodity rose by 65 billion cubic feet for the week ended Sept. 1. That matched the average forecast of analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts.

Myra P. Saefong,09072017,MarketWatch,08312017,"Published: Aug 31, 2017 7:49 p.m. ET 1 million barrels of oil can produce half a million barrels of gasoline By U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry authorized an emergency release of oil from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve on Thursday in an effort to ease shortages of gasoline in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, but analysts doubt it will have much impact. I authorized the SPR to execute an emergency exchange agreement authorizing crude oil to be drawn down from @ENERGY site. #Harvey Statement: pic.twitter.com/9TQXwiQfmd Perry first authorized a release of 500,000 barrels of crude oil from the emergency oil reserve early Thursday. A spokeswoman said it would be delivered directly by pipeline directly to the Phillips 66 refinery in Lake Charles, La. “This is a drop in the bucket,” said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy. It “won’t do much” and while it will be enough oil for two days of operations, “we need the Port of Houston to open to make a notable difference.” On Thursday afternoon, the Energy Department announced the release of another 500,000 barrels of oil from the reserve, taking the total release to 1 million barrels. “Hurricane Harvey has been far more devastating for U.S. energy infrastructure than anyone could have imagined even a week ago,” said Dave Ernsberger, global head of energy at S&P Global Platts. He said the SPR is “often criticized in the industry because it usually ends up offering to provide more crude, on an emergency basis, when what the market really needs is refined products like gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.” But “the scale of the storm is so massive that this could be the first time in a long time when crude supplies might be increasingly tapped in to,” said Ernsberger. “No crude vessels have called into Houston [ports] for five days, and it might be quite some time before they do again.” So let’s do the math: U.S. refineries produced an average of about 20 gallons of motor gasoline and about of 11 gallons of ultralow sulfur distillate fuel oil from one 42-gallon barrel of crude oil, according to the Energy Information Administration. Many other petroleum products are refined from crude oil. But if you look at just gasoline, that 1 million barrels of oil would produce about half a million barrels of gasoline, according to James Williams, energy economist at WTRG Economics. The amount of oil could feed refinery operations for around 4 days and “make enough gasoline to fuel U.S. autos for an hour and 15 minutes,” he said. In 2016, U.S. drivers consumed about 143.37 billion gallons, or about 3.41 billion barrels, of finished motor gasoline, according to the EIA, a daily average of about 391.73 million gallons, or 9.33 million barrels. At the retail level, the average price per gallon for regular unleaded gasoline stood at $2.482 late Thursday afternoon, according to GasBuddy. That’s up 13 cents from last week’s average. Read: Why September’s gasoline futures contract has left October’s in the dust The SPR release shows that refineries still in operation are having a hard time finding crude, or at least the grade of crude they need, said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group. “With refining margins soaring, refiners are going to be paying up to get their hands on crude,” he said. Many domestic and international refiners will be putting off maintenance, helping drive demand for crude. If gasoline prices continue to soar, “crude prices will be dragged higher.” On Thursday, October West Texas Intermediate crude

There was no settlement for oil and gasoline Monday because of the Labor Day holiday. “What happens next in the energy markets will be all about how quickly the refineries come back online, and when downstream operations are restored to normal,” Tyler Richey, co-editor of the Sevens Report. “If the damage keeps refineries shut, expect further volatility and notable strength in the refined products, while a return to normal operations would be demand-side bullish for oil, and would see the products’ bid unwind.” As of late Sunday, about 17% of total U.S. refinery capacity remained shut, according to S&P Global Platts. Motiva Enterprises’s Port Arthur, Texas refinery, the nation’s largest, is in the initial phases of a refinery start up, according to a company statement Tuesday. Motiva expects the refinery to initially return to approximately 40% production by the end of this weekend. Demand for crude is set to rise as refinery capacity recovers, while the shortage that has buoyed gasoline prices is likely to ease. Analysts at Commerzbank pointed out that Labor Day marked the end of the summer driving season in the U.S., “so the market focus is likely to move away from gasoline again.” “Generally speaking, little attention should be paid in the next few weeks to reports of crude and oil product stocks and trade given the numerous short-term disruptions,” they said. Inventory data for last week will be published by the American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday, delayed a day due to the holiday. Official supply figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are slated for Thursday. Meanwhile, Hurricane Irma in the Atlantic is bearing down, “and if the expected track begins to favor a Gulf landfall, expect speculation bids to come flowing into the energy space again, including natural gas, which traded well last week on the weather-related drama and a less-reported bullish development in supply,” said Richey.

Vitaliy Katsenelson,09072017,MarketWatch,08312017,"Published: Sept 7, 2017 2:42 a.m. ET Debt, discord create unstable conditions for global markets By Conditions for investors around the world are getting worse. Let’s start with Europe, the world’s second-largest economy. The European Union is a collection of states that are vastly different from one another. They are separated by culture, language (which impedes labor mobility, resulting in semipermanent labor productivity disparity between countries — think Greece and Germany), economic growth rates, indebtedness and history. European political (EU) and monetary (EMU) unions were great experiments that made a lot of sense on paper. Europe, at roughly the same-size population and economy as the U.S., was at a competitive disadvantage as dozens of currencies embedded extra transaction costs in cross-border trade, and each currency on its own had little chance of competing with the U.S. dollar

Germans were haunted by their past; they had started two world wars in the 20th century, and a united Europe was their way of lowering the risk of future European wars. Economic and monetary union sounded like a logical marriage of all the significant powers of post–World War II Europe, but the arrangement was never really a marriage. It was more like a civil union. EMU members combined their currencies into one, the euro

Read:  The world is becoming desperate about deflation Though treaties put limits on budget deficits (limits that, ironically, Germany was the first to exceed), each country went on spending its money as it wished. Some were relatively frugal (like Germany); others (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) went on spending binges, like newly hitched college students who had just gotten their first credit card, with an irresistibly low introductory rate and a free T-shirt. Now let’s turn to Brexit, the U.K. referendum on exiting the EU. Ironically, the U.K. doesn’t have half the problems that most EU nations are going through. Because it is not part of the EMU, it has retained its currency and its central bank. The U.K.’s main dissatisfaction with EU membership stems from the immigration issue. Because treaties have turned the EU into a borderless union, when Germany accepted refugees from the Middle East and Northern Africa, it basically made a unilateral decision on behalf of all EU members to accept those refugees to all EU countries. High unemployment, wage stagnation and terrorism are now endemic in the EU, and you can see how the U.K.’s citizenry might have a problem with this. After the Brexit vote, the financial media lit up with opinions on its consequences for the EU and the global economy. They’ve varied from “Brexit is a nonevent” to “This is a Lehman moment for the global economy,” referring to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy that almost brought the financial system to a halt in 2008. The arguments on both sides are quite convincing. The argument for Brexit’s being a nonevent is simple and straightforward. The U.K. maintained its currency, and the pound’s

                                   decline in the aftermath of the referendum will help cushion any negative fallout on the British economy. The U.K. and the EU will forge new trade treaties. There is a fear that the EU may impose trade sanctions on U.K., not so much to punish the U.K. but to threaten other EU members that exit will come at a stiff economic cost (effectively turning this voluntary club into a prison). However, the U.K. is a net importer of goods from the EU; thus any sanctions will hurt remaining EU members more than the U.K. The Lehman moment argument is less simple, but not unimaginable. Brexit may provide the spark that will ignite already gasoline-soaked ground. Though the EU and EMU were supposed to unite Europeans, they may have had the opposite effect — causing a groundswell of nationalism. In all honesty, Italy is more concerning than the U.K. Italy is the third-largest economy in the EU, and its debt stands at 132% of GDP, second only to Greece (171%). Seventeen percent of Italian bank loans are noncurrent. In the depths of the financial crisis, that number was 5% in the U.S. Italian lenders account for nearly half of bad debt in the EU. If Italy was not part of the EMU, it could just print lire and bail out its banks. But it gave up that luxury when it joined the single currency. To make things worse, in 2014 the EU passed a law that prohibits governments from bailing out their banking systems; thus the shareholders, debtholders, and depositors may bear the brunt of the eventual bailout. Unless the EU passes a new law that bends the 2014 law — or the Italian government takes matters into its own hands, violating EU rules — we may see Italian debtholders and depositors hit with the cost of bank bailouts take to the streets and demand “Italexit.” Nationalism is a highly emotional, zero-sum, us-against-them sort of business. Add immigration concerns on top of economic ones, and it’s not hard to see how Europe has turned into a highly combustible mixture looking for a match. And because emotions are often antilogical, future decisions by EU countries may not necessarily be beneficial to the European Continent. Given that the situation in Europe is so complex and combustible, it’s unclear whether Brexit will be just another match that simply burns out or the one that starts the fire. Will it trigger other exits? Will it slow down EU growth, thus straining an already leveraged system? No one knows. Meanwhile, China is the world’s second-largest economy and is experiencing the largest debt bubble we’ll probably ever see in our lifetimes. From 2007 to 2014, the country’s debt quadrupled, to $28 trillion from $7 trillion. Over the same period, China’s economy grew to $10.5 trillion from $3.5 trillion. These numbers are staggering and point to one indisputable fact: All Chinese growth since 2007 has come from borrowing. There was no miracle in it. But it gets worse, much worse. The numbers also show that every $1 of new debt brought only pennies of GDP growth. In the absence of skyrocketing debt, the Chinese overcapacity bubble, which was already fully inflated pre-2007, would have burst years ago. As the government continues to engineer growth by borrowing, every yuan of debt will bring less growth. The laws of economics have not been suspended in China. American economist Herbert Stein’s law states that things that cannot go on forever, won’t. When its debt bubble bursts, China will become a headwind for global growth. This brings us to Japan. It is the most-indebted developed nation in the world, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 230%. Japan is the proof of Stein’s law — its economy is still suffering a hangover from what at the time seemed like an endless real estate party (bubble) that lasted from the mid-1980s into the early 1990s. Japan has been on the quantitative easing and endless stimulus bandwagon longer than anyone else and has nothing (except a lot of debt) to show for it. Japan also has the oldest population in the world — 26% of its people are older than 65 (in the U.S. the figure is 15%). Rising debt and an aging population are a double negative for the economy, as debt per capita is rising at an even faster rate than total debt. And since the working population is declining at an even faster rate than the population as a whole, debt per working person is growing at an even faster rate. Given this reality, you might think Japan is paying the highest interest rates in the world, perhaps somewhere in the high teens. Wrong. The Japanese 10-year goverment bond carries a negative yield. This is an overview of the challenging environment facing investors around the world. It’s evident that stock market performance has not been driven by the improving health of the global economy. Just as negative interest rates are not a positive for the continued health of the economy, current stock market performance does not augur rosy future returns for stocks. In fact, the opposite is true. So, how does one invest in this overvalued market? Our strategy is spelled out    in this fairly lengthy article.

Ryan Vlastelica,09072017,MarketWatch,08312017,"Published: Sept 1, 2017 7:52 a.m. ET Fund holds companies seen as “highly supportive” to Republican causes and PACs By The market for exchange-traded funds has gotten so large that investors can use them to express their views on essentially any region, asset class, strategy or sector. Increasingly, however, fund providers are trying to offer ways for investors to express their thoughts on politics through where they put their money. One proposed fund, the Point Bridge GOP Stock Tracker ETF holds companies that are seen as sympathetic to the Republican Party. The ticker, MAGA, is a reference to “make America great again,” the slogan that President Donald Trump used in his successful White House run. It wasn’t clear when the fund might begin trading. According to a June filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the fund will track an index of companies “whose employees and political action committees are highly supportive of Republican candidates for election to the United States Congress, the Vice Presidency, or the Presidency and related Republican Party committees,” including the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, as well as Republican leadership PACs. The index the fund tracks will look at the components of the S&P 500

Currently, the Republican Party controls both the White House and both houses of Congress, along with a majority of governorships and state legislatures. In an updated filing on Wednesday, Point Bridge wrote that the fund would charge an annual expense ratio of 0.72%, or $72 for every $10,000 invested. That is significantly higher than what is charged for other funds with a large-cap U.S. stock focus, which with it will likely have a large overlap in the names held, though the proportions will be different.

The filing didn’t say what securities would be held in the fund, instead directing individuals to the website “www.investpolitically.com”, where it said daily portfolio holdings would be available. That link, as of Thursday, simply features a place for users to log in, as well as a tagline, “Shhhh... We must be very very quiet.” Point Bridge was listed as the fund’s adviser, with Vident Investment Advisory listed as the sub-advisor. Denise Krisko, Vident’s president, was named as the portfolio manager. She did not immediately return a request for a comment. This is not the first time a politically themed ETF has been suggested. In April, Event Shares, a new ETF issuer, filed for a Republican Policies Fund, a Democratic Policies Fund, a U.S. Tax Reform Fund and a fund that is designed to rise if the European Union breaks up. All four are actively managed, which means their holdings will be handpicked by a manager, as opposed to tracking an index. Read more: Would you buy a GOP ETF? You may soon get the chance The Point Bridge ETF appears to differ from the proposed Event Shares product by focusing on companies that donate to Republican parties, as opposed to ones that a portfolio manager — the Event Shares funds were designed to be actively managed, as opposed to tracking an index — would outperform because Republican politicians were in office.

Jason Notte,09072017,MarketWatch,08312017,"Published: Sept 1, 2017 10:16 a.m. ET ‘Lifestyle’ beers such as Corona, Dos Equis and Kona are among the biggest sellers in the U.S. By The beer industry has a phrase for beers that have become inextricably tied to images of sun, blue ocean and relaxation: lifestyle beers. On its own, Corona Extra is a yellow lager produced in Mexico and packaged in a clear flint bottle. However, for about three decades, its handlers in the United States have done everything in their power to connect drinkers’ perceptions of that beer to rolling waves, white sand and a wedge of lime in the bottle.

                                   says Corona’s evolution from a Mexican beer to the “Corona way of living” and “passport to carefree enjoyment” was started by drinkers themselves. U.S. spring breakers coming back from Mexican beach resorts brought memories of the beer with them. Spring breakers “We saw that consumers’ first interaction with the brand was in Mexico,” Alvarado said. “It was before we’d started importing it to the U.S., and that experience was largely around a vacation in a beautiful setting.” However, spring breakers’ memories tend to be a little fuzzy. Corona’s ad agency at the time, Campbell Mithun Esty (CME), decided that maybe beer-swilling college students weren’t ideal pitchmen for Corona and steered the brand’s add campaign toward serene, sometimes-irreverent images of Gulf Coast beaches. The resulting campaign carved out Corona’s personality and lingers in a palm-tree-laden ad that’s aired during every holiday season for the past 27 years. It’s also made generations of beer drinkers entirely comfortable with throwing a twist of lime into their light lager. In 2010, ad agency Cramer-Krasselt tweaked the Corona formula into “Find your beach,” making concerts, rooftop parties, a Sunday in the stadium with the Los Angeles Rams or University of Texas Longhorns (both sponsored by Corona) or the local bar the vacation destination Corona drinkers envision. As new “A Corona Gets its Lime” ads make clear, Constellation Brands’ lifestyle focus is less about where drinkers enjoy their beer and more about their reaction to it. “The lime ritual does a lot of work for us as the trigger to inspire those carefree enjoyment moments,” Alvarado says. “That ritual does a lot in terms of the physical, when they put the lime into the bottle and enhance the refreshing benefit of the product, but there’s also the emotional side of that: That sense of “ah” when they push the lime down that inspires them to find their beach and find those experiences.” Top-selling import That broad idea, not tethered to any one place, has made Corona an invaluable commodity.

It was so valuable, in fact, that Anheuser-Busch still paid that price even after the Justice Department ruled that it would be in violation of antitrust law if it didn’t sell the U.S. rights to the Grupo Modelo brand. Corona’s U.S. distributor, Constellation Brands, picked up those rights for $4.75 billion and set up its own brewing facility (with another on the way this year) and glass bottle plant in Mexico. Corona has been the top-selling import brand in the U.S. for the past 20 years. However, since its U.S. rights were sold to Constellation Brands, sales have increased by more than 1 million barrels. The nearly 8.5 million barrels sold last year not only makes Corona the fifth-largest brand in the U.S., but would make it the third-largest brewery in the U.S. if the brand split from Constellation Brands entirely. ‘Interesting’ beer It’s bigger than all of Heineken’s

                                   U.S. sales, but it isn’t for lack of trying on Heineken’s part. With help from years of commercials and memes featuring “The Most Interesting Man in the World,” Heineken’s Dos Equis brand also skews into “lifestyle brand” territory. In contrast with Heineken’s Tecate, which Heineken chief marketing officer Nuno Teles says is targeted toward Mexican-American drinkers and markets, Dos Equis relies on both its Mexican roots and a heavy dose of adventure-driven marketing to associate itself with a somewhat higher-octane version of Corona’s “beach.” “The Dos Equis brand stands for ‘seek interesting’ and is all about seeking a more interesting life,” says Teles. “Consumers are afraid of having nothing to say to their friends in social context and often say they’d rather be dead than dull.” It’s been effective. Dos Equis sales have increased nearly 33% since 2013, while sales through the first six months of this year alone are up 4.2%, according to Chicago-based market-research firm IRI. While it still sells roughly half as much beer as Heineken’s namesake brand, it’s far outpacing Heineken’s 1.4% growth in the first half of the year. That daydream “lifestyle” narrative has driven Mexican beer brands, which Nielsen says accounted for $4.4 billion of the $6.8 billion spent on imported beers in 2016. According to the Brewers Association craft beer industry group, it’s also pushing sales of imports ahead of those of small brewers. While the breweries that the Brewers Association considers “craft” saw sales increase 6.2% last year, import sales rose 6.8% during that span. Kona’s island connection If the Brewers Association’s numbers included the Portland, Ore.-based Craft Brew Alliance’s Kona brand, however, craft’s growth might look a little different. Excluded because Anheuser-Busch InBev owns a more than a 30% stake in the Craft Brew Alliance (CBA), Kona was purchased by CBA in 2010 after years of partnering with the group on production, packaging and marketing. Initially intended as a supplement to Pacific Northwest beer brands Widmer Brothers and Redhook, Kona accounted for 397,000 barrels of CBA’s 748,900 barrels of production in 2016 — more than shrinking, regionalizing Redhook and Widmer Brothers combined. That was 12.9% growth year over year and nearly 33% more beer than the Kona brand sold in 2014. CBA Chief Executive Andy Thomas, who was a consultant with CBA when it purchased Kona in 2010, says he expects sales of Kona to reach upwards of 450,000 barrels in 2017, but he didn’t necessarily see this success coming. “For me, Kona has always been about the islands not because they’re commercially viable, but because that’s who [Kona] was,” he says. “Also, popularity is a funny thing: You don’t know what’s going to be popular until it’s popular, otherwise we’d all just go to Vegas and bet on the right numbers.” It makes it slightly easier to hedge those bets when you play to a beer’s strengths. During Kona’s early years on the mainland, it gained traction in states including California, Oregon and Washington with help from drinkers’ attachment to the island. Whether they were from the islands themselves or frequent vacationers from the West Coast, the name and imagery connecting Kona to Hawaii’s big island resonated with consumers and provided an opening for CBA. Four years ago, CBA enlisted ad agency Duncan Channon to create its “Dear Mainland” ads featuring two Hawaiian brothers offering polite suggestions on how to relax. Around that time, it also changed the labeling on bottles and packages of Kona, streamlined the number of beers the brand offered and began selling it in bottles molded with the brand’s “Liquid Aloha” slogan and the Hawaiian Islands themselves. “Our procurement people would love for us to go with a stock bottle, which we used to be in, but it’s a matter of picking your battles,” Thomas says. “Are you going to spend money or build in inherent inefficiencies that are valuable in the long term. We happen to believe that the Liquid Aloha bottles speak to people and we have the confidence that, once they’re spoken to and answer the call, they’re going to come back because the beer keeps the promise that it makes to them.” Part of fulfilling that promise includes putting a hefty dose of Galaxy and Citra hops into Kona’s flagship Big Wave Golden Ale to mimic pineapple, passionfruit and other tropical fruits to evoke the flavors of the islands. The other is to be honest about the illusion that’s being created. Though Kona has a brewer in Kona itself and is expanding it to nearly 100,000 barrels of capacity by 2019, there isn’t a bottling facility on the Big Island large enough to handle more production and the trip across the Pacific to the mainland can be rough on beer. That means a whole lot of Kona is made in the lower 48 states, which resulted in a lawsuit claiming that Kona was deceiving consumers about its brewing location. However, Kona bottles are clearly marked with multiple point of beer origin, including Oregon, Washington, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Colorado. What’s clear is that a “lifestyle” beer has to fulfill a promise to drinkers. “That experience is something that, across demographics from millennials to boomers to Gen X and across ethnicities, really resonates,” says Alvarado of Constellation Brands. “We make sure that we depict the world in a way that’s inviting to those consumers relative to the world that they live in today.” Jason Notte is a freelance writer based in Portland, Ore.

United had failed to qualify for the Champions League for Mourinho’s debut campaign but their Europa League triumph last season secured a return to Europe’s elite competition. The Old Trafford outfit begin their campaign on Tuesday, hosting Swiss side FC Basel in the opening group stage match. “Being back in the Champions League is going back to the natural habitat. Manchester United (have been there) season after season,” Mourinho told reporters. “Motivation is very high.” “We have to try to go to the last 16 and enjoy that special knock-out phase with the best teams in Europe.” The Portuguese boss believes his team are in good form after starting their league campaign with three wins and a draw. Mourinho says he loves the packed Christmas schedule that English teams have and believes they cannot use the busy schedule as an excuse for poor Champions League performances. “We have no winter break, and in other countries there is a winter break, but that’s cultural - it means a lot, and I have to admit I love it,” he added. “But no complaining this is what we have, we have squads and if we think they’re tired we play with other players.” Mourinho also said he was not surprised by the sacking of Crystal Palace manager Frank de Boer after just four league games in charge. “In football, nothing surprises me. I was sacked as a champion, (Claudio) Ranieri was sacked as a champion, Frank de Boer is sacked after four games,” Mourinho said. “Next season something incredible will happen again.” Defenders Eric Bailly and Phil Jones are serving suspensions and will be replaced by Chris Smalling and Victor Lindelof at the centre of defence for Tuesday’s game, while midfielder Marouane Fellaini is a doubt as he recovers from a calf injury.

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"LONDON, (Reuters) - Proposed United States budget cuts could put in jeopardy great progress in reducing global poverty and disease and lead to 5 million more deaths from AIDS alone, the philanthropist Bill Gates warned on Wednesday. Gates, whose Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is a major provider of global health and development funding, said there was currently “more doubt than usual about the world’s commitment to development”. A global health report by the foundation, co-authored by the Gates and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington (IHME), analyzed progress against diseases such as malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. It also tracked rates of poverty, maternal and infant death, access to contraception, sanitation and other development issues. Forecasting good and bad future scenarios, it found millions of lives hanging in the balance. In a telephone briefing about the findings, Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation, said remarkable progress had been made in recent decades but that shifting priorities, instability and potential budget cuts could lead the world to turn away, jeopardizing the gains. HIV, which currently infects almost 37 million people worldwide, is an “iconic example”, Gates said, “because the world really did step up with an incredible level of generosity which has meant (annual) AIDS-related deaths have fallen by almost a half since the peak in 2005.” The Gates IHME analysis, called the Goalkeepers report, forecast that a 10 percent cut in global donor funding for HIV treatment could mean more than 5 million extra deaths by 2030. Under budget proposals from U.S. President Donald Trump released in May, U.S. funding for global health programs including efforts on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria would see a 24 percent cut to about $6.5 billion for 2018. But opposition Democrats and many of Trump’s fellow Republicans have blasted his plan, saying they will reject it. Congress, not the administration, controls U.S. spending. Gates said his foundation is working hard to secure continued U.S. government funding for global health and development and remained hopeful the proposed cuts will not be  approved.

But while preliminary talks were held over the summer with Nestle, which favored a joint venture deal, no agreement was reached, two of the sources added. The global market for consumer health products is worth an estimated $233 billion in sales this year, according to Euromonitor International, which ranks Merck’s business in the sector as the 32nd biggest, with a 0.4 percent share. One source said Merck was eyeing a price of 5 billion euros, while others said that 4 billion euros would be too ambitious because the business lacks global reach. Analysts at Bernstein have put a price tag of 3.7-5.6 billion euros on the business. Consumer health is very fragmented and has proved fertile ground for deals in recent years, as aging populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand. Nestle, which wants to become a “nutrition, health and wellness company,” recently said it would pursue opportunities to expand in the sector. Merck, which confirmed JP Morgan’s role but declined to comment on other aspects of the process, prefers an outright sale of the business, which owns brands such as Bion nutritional supplements and decongestant Nasivin, the sources said. But Nestle, which also declined to comment, could yet decide it wants to buy the whole business, they said. Two people familiar with the situation said Guggenheim Partners was also helping in the sales process. Merck and the boutique bank both declined to comment on its involvement. The German group said earlier this week it would give itself until early next year to make a decision on what to do with the business.

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen called on the United States on Friday to withdraw Peace Corps volunteers in an escalating row over accusations that U.S. agents conspired with an opposition leader to plot treason. Hun Sen was responding after the U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh issued a travel warning that urged citizens to show caution amid “anti-American rhetoric by officials”. “Are you scaring Cambodians?” Hun Sen said of the United States in an address to garment workers at factories which export much of their production to the United States. “Are you prepared to invade Cambodia and that’s why you told Americans to be careful? It’s good if you pull out the Peace Corps,” Hun Sen said. The U.S. embassy declined to comment. It has previously dismissed the accusations of collusion with opposition leader Kem Sokha and called for his release. On Friday, the embassy was swearing in 71 new volunteers from the Peace Corps, which sends Americans abroad to help with local projects with the stated goal of promoting mutual understanding. Hun Sen said on Friday that he had ordered an investigation into whether any Americans were involved with Kem Sokha. Opponents of Hun Sen accuse him of arresting Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha and cracking down on independent media and other critics ahead of a general election next year. The evidence presented against Kem Sokha is a video recorded in 2013 in which he discusses a strategy to win power with the help of unspecified Americans. Hun Sen, a close ally of China, has taken a series of measures against U.S. interests this year from ending joint military exercises to expelling a naval aid unit to forcing a U.S.-funded pro-democracy group to leave. On Thursday, Hun Sen said he was suspending cooperation with Washington to find the remains of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. According to the U.S Embassy, more than 500 Peace Corps volunteers have served and worked in Cambodia since 2006, providing English teaching and teacher training as well as community health education. U.S. President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps in 1961 to promote world peace and friendship. ","

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia on Thursday defended its anti-narcotics efforts after U.S. President Donald Trump said he considered downgrading the country in a White House assessment because of an uptick in the cultivation of coca, the base ingredient for cocaine. Tens of millions of dollars in development and security funding and logistical help could be in danger should the United States decide the South American country is not doing enough, and such a decision could even jeopardize Colombia’s access to monies from multilateral organizations. The two countries have long been close allies in the fight against illegal narcotics but in recent years have broadened the focus of their relationship to include trade and Colombia’s peace process with leftist guerrillas. However, Trump said this week he had contemplated declaring in the White House’s annual review of countries it considers hubs for narcotics trafficking that Colombia is not meeting its drug fight obligations because of decade-high coca production. The government of President Juan Manuel Santos took issue with Trump’s statement. “Colombia is without a doubt the country which most has fought drugs, and which has had the most success on that front,” the government said in an early morning statement. “No one has to threaten us to confront this challenge.” In the last seven years, the country has confiscated 1,621 tonnes of cocaine, the statement said. The United States has expressed its worry about a sharp uptick in coca cultivation and cocaine production at the close of last year, after Colombia signed a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), its largest rebel group, and halted the spraying of powerful herbicide glyphosate over health worries. Coca cultivation was up to 188,000 hectares (464,000 acres), while cocaine production capacity climbed to 700 tonnes annually, the highest figures for at least a decade. Colombia is counting on more than $400 million in funding help from the United States for implementing the FARC deal and has rejected the possibility of restarting fumigation with glyphosate, something Washington has backed. Instead, Colombia favors manual eradication and crop substitution in concert with rural communities, as agreed upon in the FARC deal. The country is planning to manually eliminate 50,000 hectares of coca. Rebel groups, right-wing paramilitaries and crime gangs have all been involved in drug trafficking during Colombia’s five-decade conflict, which has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions from their homes.

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - At least 1.4 million people uprooted by Boko Haram’s insurgency in northeast Nigeria are living in ‘cholera hotspots’, prey to an outbreak of the deadly disease which is sweeping through camps for the displaced, the United Nations said on Thursday. An estimated 28 people have died from cholera in the conflict-hit region, while about 837 are suspected to have been infected with the disease, including at least 145 children under the age of five, said the U.N. children’s agency (UNICEF). The outbreak was first identified last week in the Muna Garage camp in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, which is the heart of jihadist group Boko Haram’s brutal eight-year campaign to carve out an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria. About 1.8 million people have abandoned their homes because of violence or food shortages, U.N. agencies say, and many live in camps for the displaced throughout northeast Nigeria. Several aid agencies last month told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that Nigeria’s rainy season could spread disease in already unsanitary displacement camps, and 350,000 uprooted children aged under five are at risk of cholera, UNICEF said. “Cholera is difficult for young children to withstand at any time, but becomes a crisis for survival when their resilience is already weakened by malnutrition, malaria and other waterborne diseases,” UNICEF’s Pernille Ironside said in a statement. “Cholera is one more threat amongst many that children in northeast Nigeria are battling today in order to survive,” added Ironside, UNICEF’s deputy representative in Nigeria. UNICEF said aid agencies have set up a cholera treatment centre at the Muna Garage camp, chlorinated water in camps and host communities to curb the outbreak, and mobilised volunteers and local leaders to refer suspected cases to health facilities. The disease, which spreads through contaminated food and drinking water, causes diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. It can kill within hours if left untreated, but most patients recover if treated promptly with oral rehydration salts. The latest figures represent a 3.3 percent fatality rate - well above the 1 percent rate that the World Health Organization rates as an emergency. The short incubation period of two hours to five days means the disease can spread with explosive speed. More than 20,000 people have been killed in the conflict with Boko Haram, at least 2.2 million have been displaced, and 5.2 million in the northeast are short of food, with tens of thousands living in famine-like conditions, U.N. figures show.

If the deal goes ahead, it will further boost Allianz’s presence in emerging markets and give the global insurer a stronger position in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a market seen as ripe for consolidation. Abu Dhabi Investment Council might hire an adviser for the deal, one of the sources said. The council is an investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government, with holdings in several listed companies such as First Abu Dhabi Bank and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank . Its mandate includes diversifying Abu Dhabi’s economy and the development of the corporate sector. The sale plan is still in its preliminary stages, one of the sources said, but could attract more bidders. It is the latest indication of a shake-up in the fiercely competitive local insurance market that has been suffering amid tighter regulations and losses. French insurance giant AXA Group and its UAE partner, Kanoo Group, in 2014 became major shareholders in Abu Dhabi-based Green Crescent Insurance Co. Zurich Insurance Group decided to exit its general insurance business in the UAE in 2016 after a review concluded the investment needed was not justified by its growth potential. The UAE’s third-biggest insurer by assets, ADNIC has a market value of about $377 million, valuing Abu Dhabi Investment Council’s 24 percent stake at about $90 million. The insurance firm bolstered its capital position last year by selling convertible bonds, prompting rating agency Standard & Poor’s to remove it from its creditwatch list with negative implications. Earlier this year, ADNIC also posted its first annual profit in three years for 2016, a sign the company is turning a corner and that it might be a good time to attract an international insurer as its partner, the sources said. In the UAE, gross written premiums, or the total value of premiums written by an insurer before commissions and other deductions, hit 40 billion dirhams ($11 billion) in 2016, up from 37 billion dirhams in 2015 and 33.4 billion in 2014, according to the UAE Insurance Authority. The recent introduction of mandatory health insurance in Dubai has helped boost demand despite a regional economic slowdown and the impact of building fires in the city. Abu Dhabi unveiled mandatory insurance a decade ago. The Allianz Group, one of the world’s leading insurers and asset managers with more than 86 million retail and corporate customers, declined to comment. Last month, the Munich-based company agreed to buy 98 percent of Nigerian insurer Ensure Insurance Plc. Abu Dhabi Investment Council and ADNIC did not respond to requests for comment. ","

,09142017,Investopedia,09072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A subsidy is a benefit given to an individual, business or institution, usually by the government. It is usually in the form of a cash payment or a tax reduction. The subsidy is typically given to remove some type of burden, and it is often considered to be in the overall interest of the public, given to promote a social good or an economic policy. A subsidy takes the form of a payment, provided directly or indirectly, which provides a concession to the receiving individual or business entity. Subsidies are generally seen as a privileged type of financial aid, as they lessen an associated burden that was previously levied against the receiver, or promote a particular action by providing financial support. A subsidy typically supports particular sectors of a nation’s economy. It can assist struggling industries by lowering the burdens placed on them, or encourage new developments by providing financial support for the endeavors. Often, these areas are not being effectively supported through the actions of the general economy, or may be undercut by activities in rival economies. Direct subsidies are those that involve an actual payment of funds toward a particular individual, group or industry. Indirect subsidies are those that do not hold a predetermined monetary value or involve actual cash outlays. They can include activities such as price reductions for required goods or services that can be government-supported. This allows the needed items to be purchased below the current market rate, resulting in a savings for those the subsidy is designed to help. There are many forms of subsidies given out by the government. Two of the most common types of individual subsidies are welfare payments and unemployment benefits.  The objective of these types of subsidies is to help people who are temporarily suffering economically.  Other subsidies, such as student loans, are given to encourage people to further their education. With the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, a number of U.S. families became eligible for health-care subsidies, based on household income and size. These subsidies are designed to lower the out-of-pocket costs for health insurance premiums. In these instances, the funds associated with the subsidies are sent directly to the insurance company to which premiums are due, lowering the payment amount required from the household. Subsidies to businesses are given to support an industry that is struggling against international competition that has lowered prices, such that the domestic business is not profitable without the subsidy.  Historically, the vast majority of subsidies in the United States have gone towards four industries: agriculture, financial institutions, oil companies and utilities companies. Different rationales exist for the provision of public subsidies; some are economic, some are political and some come from socio-economic development theory. Development theory suggests that some industries need protection from external competition to maximize domestic benefit. Technically speaking, a free market economy is free of subsidies; introducing one transforms it into a mixed economy. Economists and policy makers often debate the merits of subsidies, and by extension, the degree to which an economy should be a mixed one. Pro-subsidy economists argue that subsidies to particular industries are vital to help support businesses and the jobs they create.  Other economists feel free market forces should determine if a business survives or fails; if it fails, those resources are allocated to a more efficient and profitable use. They argue that subsidies to these businesses simply sustain an inefficient allocation of resources. Subsidies: The Pros Economists who promote a mixed economy often argue that subsidies are justifiable to provide the ""socially optimal"" level of goods and services. In contemporary neoclassical economic models, there are circumstances where the actual supply of a good or service falls below the theoretical equilibrium level – an unwanted shortage, which creates what economists call a ""market failure."" One form of correcting this imbalance is to subsidize the good or service being under supplied. The subsidy lowers the cost for the producers to bring the good or service to market. If the right level of subsidization is provided, all other things being equal, the market failure should be corrected. In other words, according to general equilibrium theory, subsidies are necessary when a market failure causes too little production in a specific area: They would theoretically push production back up to optimal levels. There are many goods or services that allegedly provide what economists call ""positive externalities."" A positive externality is achieved whenever a transaction between two parties provides an indirect benefit to a third party. Many subsidies are implemented to promote positive externalities that might not otherwise be provided at the socially optimal threshold. Some theories of development argue that the governments of less-developed countries should subsidize domestic industries in their infancy to protect them from international competition. This is a popular technique seen in China and various South American nations currently. Subsidies: The Cons Free market economists are wary of subsidies for a variety of reasons. Some argue that subsidies unnecessarily distort markets, preventing efficient outcomes and diverting resources from more productive uses to less productive ones. Similar concerns come from those who suggest economic calculation is too inexact and microeconomic models are too unrealistic to ever correctly calculate the impact of market failure. Others suggest that government spending on subsidies is never as effective as government projections claim they will be. The costs and unintended consequences of applying subsidies are rarely worth it, they claim. Another problem, antagonists say: The act of subsidizing helps corrupt the political process. According to political theories of regulatory capture and rent-seeking, subsidies exist as part of an unholy alliance between big business and the state. Companies often turn to government to shield themselves from competition. In turn, businesses donate to politicians or promise them benefits after their political careers. Even if a subsidy is created with good intentions, without any conspiracy or self-seeking, it raises the profits of those receiving beneficial treatment, and so creates an incentive to lobby for its continuance, even after the need or its usefulness runs out. This potentially allows political and business interests to create a mutual benefit at the expense of taxpayers and/or competitive firms or industries. There are a few different ways to evaluate the success of government subsidies. Most economists consider a subsidy a failure if it fails to improve the overall economy. Policymakers, however, might still consider it a success if it helps achieve a different objective. Most subsidies are long-term failures in the economic sense, but still achieve cultural or political goals. An example of these competing evaluations could be seen in the Great Depression. Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt both set price floors on agricultural products and paid farmers to not produce. Their policy goal was to stop food prices from falling and to protect small farmers. To this extent, the subsidy was a success. But the economic effect was quite different.

,09142017,Investopedia,09072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A subsidy is a benefit given to an individual, business or institution, usually by the government. It is usually in the form of a cash payment or a tax reduction. The subsidy is typically given to remove some type of burden, and it is often considered to be in the overall interest of the public, given to promote a social good or an economic policy. A subsidy takes the form of a payment, provided directly or indirectly, which provides a concession to the receiving individual or business entity. Subsidies are generally seen as a privileged type of financial aid, as they lessen an associated burden that was previously levied against the receiver, or promote a particular action by providing financial support. A subsidy typically supports particular sectors of a nation’s economy. It can assist struggling industries by lowering the burdens placed on them, or encourage new developments by providing financial support for the endeavors. Often, these areas are not being effectively supported through the actions of the general economy, or may be undercut by activities in rival economies. Direct subsidies are those that involve an actual payment of funds toward a particular individual, group or industry. Indirect subsidies are those that do not hold a predetermined monetary value or involve actual cash outlays. They can include activities such as price reductions for required goods or services that can be government-supported. This allows the needed items to be purchased below the current market rate, resulting in a savings for those the subsidy is designed to help. There are many forms of subsidies given out by the government. Two of the most common types of individual subsidies are welfare payments and unemployment benefits.  The objective of these types of subsidies is to help people who are temporarily suffering economically.  Other subsidies, such as student loans, are given to encourage people to further their education. With the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, a number of U.S. families became eligible for health-care subsidies, based on household income and size. These subsidies are designed to lower the out-of-pocket costs for health insurance premiums. In these instances, the funds associated with the subsidies are sent directly to the insurance company to which premiums are due, lowering the payment amount required from the household. Subsidies to businesses are given to support an industry that is struggling against international competition that has lowered prices, such that the domestic business is not profitable without the subsidy.  Historically, the vast majority of subsidies in the United States have gone towards four industries: agriculture, financial institutions, oil companies and utilities companies. Different rationales exist for the provision of public subsidies; some are economic, some are political and some come from socio-economic development theory. Development theory suggests that some industries need protection from external competition to maximize domestic benefit. Technically speaking, a free market economy is free of subsidies; introducing one transforms it into a mixed economy. Economists and policy makers often debate the merits of subsidies, and by extension, the degree to which an economy should be a mixed one. Pro-subsidy economists argue that subsidies to particular industries are vital to help support businesses and the jobs they create.  Other economists feel free market forces should determine if a business survives or fails; if it fails, those resources are allocated to a more efficient and profitable use. They argue that subsidies to these businesses simply sustain an inefficient allocation of resources. Subsidies: The Pros Economists who promote a mixed economy often argue that subsidies are justifiable to provide the ""socially optimal"" level of goods and services. In contemporary neoclassical economic models, there are circumstances where the actual supply of a good or service falls below the theoretical equilibrium level – an unwanted shortage, which creates what economists call a ""market failure."" One form of correcting this imbalance is to subsidize the good or service being under supplied. The subsidy lowers the cost for the producers to bring the good or service to market. If the right level of subsidization is provided, all other things being equal, the market failure should be corrected. In other words, according to general equilibrium theory, subsidies are necessary when a market failure causes too little production in a specific area: They would theoretically push production back up to optimal levels. There are many goods or services that allegedly provide what economists call ""positive externalities."" A positive externality is achieved whenever a transaction between two parties provides an indirect benefit to a third party. Many subsidies are implemented to promote positive externalities that might not otherwise be provided at the socially optimal threshold. Some theories of development argue that the governments of less-developed countries should subsidize domestic industries in their infancy to protect them from international competition. This is a popular technique seen in China and various South American nations currently. Subsidies: The Cons Free market economists are wary of subsidies for a variety of reasons. Some argue that subsidies unnecessarily distort markets, preventing efficient outcomes and diverting resources from more productive uses to less productive ones. Similar concerns come from those who suggest economic calculation is too inexact and microeconomic models are too unrealistic to ever correctly calculate the impact of market failure. Others suggest that government spending on subsidies is never as effective as government projections claim they will be. The costs and unintended consequences of applying subsidies are rarely worth it, they claim. Another problem, antagonists say: The act of subsidizing helps corrupt the political process. According to political theories of regulatory capture and rent-seeking, subsidies exist as part of an unholy alliance between big business and the state. Companies often turn to government to shield themselves from competition. In turn, businesses donate to politicians or promise them benefits after their political careers. Even if a subsidy is created with good intentions, without any conspiracy or self-seeking, it raises the profits of those receiving beneficial treatment, and so creates an incentive to lobby for its continuance, even after the need or its usefulness runs out. This potentially allows political and business interests to create a mutual benefit at the expense of taxpayers and/or competitive firms or industries. There are a few different ways to evaluate the success of government subsidies. Most economists consider a subsidy a failure if it fails to improve the overall economy. Policymakers, however, might still consider it a success if it helps achieve a different objective. Most subsidies are long-term failures in the economic sense, but still achieve cultural or political goals. An example of these competing evaluations could be seen in the Great Depression. Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt both set price floors on agricultural products and paid farmers to not produce. Their policy goal was to stop food prices from falling and to protect small farmers. To this extent, the subsidy was a success. But the economic effect was quite different. Artificially high food prices lowered the standard of living for consumers and forced people to spend more on food than they otherwise would have. Those outside of the farm industry were worse off in absolute economic terms. Sometimes both the economic and political results of a subsidy appears to indicate failure. In 2012 and 2013, the Department of Energy (DOE) gave out more than $60 billion in subsidies to renewable (non-oil-based) forms of energy.

Christina Wilkie,09142017,CNBC,09072017,"Sen. Bernie Sanders unveiled his single-payer health-care proposal, ""Medicare for All,"" on Wednesday, to a packed room of supporters on Capitol Hill. The bill already has 16 Democratic co-sponsors, a number that would have been unimaginable just a year ago. The independent senator from Vermont also released a white paper on how the government might finance such a health-care system, which included an income-based tax increase, an expansion of the estate tax, and a new tax on incomes of the 0.1 percent of Americans. ""Today, we begin the long and difficult struggle to end the international disgrace"" of U.S. health-care costs, Sanders said, emphasizing that Americans pay more in health-care costs than any other developed nation, nearly 18 percent of U.S. GDP. ""The American people want to know what we're going to do to fix a dysfunctional health-care system."" Under a Medicare for All plan, ""depending on your income, your taxes may go up,"" Sander said, ""but this will be more than offset"" by overall household savings on health-care costs, premiums and copays. The senator also stressed that a government-managed plan would simplify the financial affairs of both individuals and small- and medium-sized companies. ""You will no longer be writing checks to private insurance companies,"" he said. ""And today we tell the business community that we understand you want to focus on your core mission, not spending countless hours wondering how you're going to cover your employees' health insurance."" Sanders was joined at the podium by a number of high-profile Democrats said to be eyeing potential presidential campaigns in 2020. Among them were Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. There was also a distinctly campaign-like vibe at the hourlong rollout, with supporters cheering and holding signs. Sanders contributed to the energy, telling the crowd that the launch was the start of a national grass-roots campaign. ""Our job now is to take this legislation to every state in the country and hear what the people have to say."" Theatrics aside, Sanders' bill would create a national health insurance program managed by the federal government and modeled on the current Medicare program. Private insurance would still exist to cover elective medical procedures, but would otherwise be phased out as the Medicare for All program was introduced and expanded over a four-year period. Even before it was launched, Sanders' plan received swift and bitter criticism from Republicans, including White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, whose daily briefing overlapped with the senator's event. Huckabee Sanders called single-payer health-care systems a ""horrible"" idea, and said, ""I can't think of anything worse than having government more involved in your health care."" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, unveiling his own health-care plan earlier in the day, declared, ""Bernie, this ends your dream of a single-payer health-care system in America."" But polls show that support for single-payer health care is growing in the U.S. According to a  recent poll by Kaiser Health News, 53 percent of adults, and one-third of respondents who identified as Republicans, support a single-payer government health-care system. As long as Republicans control Congress and the White House, Sanders' bill has no chance of becoming law. Nonetheless, it serves as an important benchmark of where the Democratic Party, and Democratic voters, stand going into the 2018 midterm elections and the 2020 presidential contest.

Jacob Pramuk,09142017,CNBC,09072017,"President Donald Trump weighed in on — but did not explicitly endorse — a last-ditch Obamacare repeal plan unveiled by multiple Republican senators on Wednesday. The president, who had recently appeared to shift his focus to tax reform after the Senate failed to pass various forms of a health-care overhaul this summer, said he applauded the senators ""for continuing to work toward a solution."" ""As I have continued to say, inaction is not an option, and I sincerely hope that Senators Graham and Cassidy have found a way to address the Obamacare crisis,"" Trump said in a statement. Trump's comments about the plan appear less forceful than those he made earlier in the year when he repeatedly urged senators to repeal President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement, a top campaign promise. Four GOP senators, led by Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, introduced the long-shot plan earlier on Wednesday. It aims to get rid of subsidies and mandates under the Affordable Care Act, and instead give block grants to states to help to make coverage affordable. Republican Senate leaders appear to have little interest in pushing forward with the health-care plan. The GOP faces a Sept. 30 deadline to use budget reconciliation for fiscal year 2017 and will lose its ability to pass a health-care bill with only the 52 Republican senators at that time. Graham cast the plan as the last, best hope to roll back Obamacare. He also described it as the only thing standing between the United States and a single-payer health care, which independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and various Democrats will put their weight behind Wednesday. ",Trump talks Graham Cassidy Obamacare repeal plan
Qin Chen,09142017,CNBC,09072017,"The United Nations Security Council on Monday unanimously approved new sanctions against North Korea, the harshest yet — capping North Korea's oil imports, banning textile exports, ending additional overseas labor contracts. Bitcoin ""mining"" could become a viable income source for this further-isolated nation that's craving nuclear weapons. ""We weren't able to determine the volumes, like how many bitcoin they can generate per certain time period. We could just see activity,"" said Priscilla Moriuchi, the director of strategic threat development at Recorded Future. ""First [hypothesis] is that the activity is sponsored by the state, as a way to generate funds for the regime,"" said Moriuchi. ""The second hypothesis is that it's an individual user, among this small sliver of leaders and their families who have access to the internet."" ""Mining"" is a process of earning bitcoins. Miners use high-performance computers to solve complex mathematical problems and verify bitcoin transactions online. In return they are rewarded with bitcoins. But who would be capable of pulling off such activity in the autocratic country? After all, most North Koreans have no access to the internet. Only a small minority of users — university students, scientists and select government officials — have access to Kwangmyong, a domestic intranet ""that offers email and websites but is totally shut off from the rest of the world,"" according to a  Slate article. ""Only the most senior leaders and ruling elite are granted access to worldwide internet directly,"" Moriuchi wrote in her report. North Korean elites access internet primarily through three IP ranges, one of which is assigned by China Netcom. Bitcoin one-year price chart Bitcoin has more than tripled in value this year to $3,800, and North Korea's neighbor and biggest trading partner, China, is also a major player in the bitcoin world. More than half the newly mined bitcoins come from mining pools in China. Chinese companies such as Bitmain and Canaan also dominate the bitcoin-mining hardware games. Their ASIC miners — computer cards that mine bitcoin 50 times faster than traditional video graphics cards — have become the go-to mining tools for large-scale mining operations. Jonathan Mohan, a blockchain consultant and the founder of Bitcoin NYC meetup, said, ""It wouldn't surprise me if, perhaps, hypothetically, North Korea were to have pre-existing business relationships in China that wouldn't mind purchasing bitcoin from them, and then just disseminating it to the Chinese market as you would with any other bitcoin."" The Chinese general administration of customs did not respond to CNBC requests for comment. In 2014, the U.S. Treasury Department addressed concerns about how digital currencies can be used by countries looking to evade sanctions: ""If a sanctioned entity could use virtual currencies to transact anonymously, our sanctions would have a weaker bite."" A year before that, Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) asked digital currencies exchanges — platforms for buying, selling and storing digital currencies — to register with FinCEN, and ""report suspicious transactions to adequately guard against money laundering and terrorist financing abuse."" Many digital currencies exchanges have since registered, including Coinbase, one of the major exchanges. Coinbase does not operate in North Korea or other sanctioned countries and would not comment to CNBC on any North Korean bitcoin activity. Any North Korean activity in bitcoin is likely a tiny fraction of global trade activity. The total trade volume of bitcoin was nearly $2 billion, according to CryptoCurrency Market Capitalizations. Also, Recorded Future's report is based on a limited dataset from April 1 to July 6, provided by its intelligence partner, Team Cymru (a nonprofit Internet security research group). ""It's possible they [North Korea] have been ""mining"" bitcoin for a while, but they stopped for a period of time. ... or maybe they are using infrastructure and computers in other places,"" said Moriuchi. ""We happen to have the view to this one snapshot for this one period of time."" At first, Moriuchi and her team at Recorded Future were looking to develop some type of tools or warnings of North Korea's missile launches. They just happened to stumble across the bitcoin ""mining"" activity. ""One week, when I retrieved the data for the week of May 17, I noticed there was unusual amount of bitcoin activity that I have not seen before ... from nothing to hundreds of data points a day, clearly bitcoin mining. And it was ongoing, through the end of my dataset,"" said Moriuchi. She also flagged the bitcoin ""mining"" as ""suspect activity"" in the report. ""Bitcoin ['mining'] in itself is not criminal by any means; it's not a suspect activity. But the timing of that activity was an interesting correlation with the WannaCry [cyber]attack,"" said Moriuchi. The ""mining"" started five days after the cyberattack, which locked tens of thousands of computer and data files for ransom payments in bitcoin. The attack has also been attributed to North Korea by the U.S. National Security Agency. North Korea is drenched in chronic economic problems, due to a one-sided focus on military spending and decades of economic sanctions from the international community. Under the U.N. sanctions imposed in August, China has banned imports on North Korea's iron, coal and seafood, which accounts for about 35 percent of North Korea's trading income. North Korea may be ""mining"" bitcoin as a way to get around the tighter sanctions. It also helps that bitcoin is an open and decentralized network, making ""mining"" a legal and relatively easy activity for anyone who has access to the internet. Ultimately, it's up to the international community and the bitcoin community to decide whether they're comfortable trading bitcoin with North Korea. ""People are still free to choose who they want to interact with, so if enough people choose to reject bitcoin that are associated with North Korea, then North Korea wouldn't be able to do anything with bitcoin,"" said Nchinda Nchinda, internal operations officer of MIT Bitcoin Club, a cryptocurrencies research organization run by Massachusetts Institute of Technology students.

"Linda Ha, special to CNBC.com",09142017,CNBC,09072017,"Raphael Natividad is guilty of something most millennials don't usually do: ignoring his phone. Natividad, who recently graduated from the University of California, Irvine, with a degree in heath policy, has a legitimate reason, one that speaks to an existential crisis that has befallen a growing number recent graduates. ""I was ashamed that I didn't have a full-time job right after college, and that shame made me hesitant to spend time with underclassmen or with peers who I thought had brighter futures,"" Natividad told CNBC in a recent interview. ""I consistently tried to avoid people, and I would ignore messages on my phone or on group chats to avoid any conversation about the future."" Although not an official designation by the American Psychiatric Association, a few therapists are using the term ""post-graduation depression."" According to mental health professionals — and recent graduates feeling its effects — the condition is characterized by a period of severe sadness, loss of motivation, helplessness and isolation due to constant change and an overabundance of choices. From kindergarten through college, school becomes the primary structure giving students a sense of certainty, while providing them with a social network for learning and support. Yet after graduation, that structure crumbles, and with no set timetables or mandatory classes to study for, anxiety, depression and a sense of loss about what to do next become all too common. ""This is a real issue unique to this generation called 'a quarter-life crisis,'"" said Cyrus Williams, a licensed professional counselor and an associate professor at Regent University in Virginia. Millennials are ""struggling in terms of milestones, getting jobs, parenting, finding jobs, having too many choices, and having debt coming right out of college."" Satya Byock, a psychotherapist based in Portland, Oregon, who primarily treats millennials, said it's inevitable that this age group will experience a long period of confusion and uncertainty. She told CNBC that each individual establishes what life looks like for them, but in a way that was never required before. ""College is explicitly about scholarships, academia, left-brain learning, and in large [part] it has nothing to do with life preparation, mental health, physical health, nutrition, or basic life skills,"" said Byock. In her opinion, she added, ""the notion that people wouldn't struggle after college is kind of silly."" Natividad, who graduated in June, is among those grappling with his life choices. He's currently working a part-time job doing research at his alma mater. ""There are so many paths I can follow,"" he said, but added he's ""struggling to decide if I should apply for graduate school this year or next year, or if I should even apply at all."" A big reminder of the need to make decisive life choices is the intractable problem of student debt, currently sitting at all-time highs. According to Federal Reserve data, the average monthly payment for a borrower in their 20s is $351 a month, while the average balance carried by that age group is about $22,135. With only six months to devise a financial plan to pay off this debt, some graduates find themselves pushed to make career decisions based on their financial needs — while the search for a so-called dream job takes a back seat. Decerry Donato, earned a bachelor's degree in literary journalism and was unemployed for five months. Since then, she has worked as a retail sales associate, freelance writer and photographer, and is currently a receptionist at a genetics lab. ""People assume that just because you have a degree, you're set and you're going to get a job right after college,"" said Donato. She said graduates often feel pressured by relatives to secure a job, particularly parents, even if it doesn't help them gain experience in their desired career field. ""I sent 20 applications a day, and was happy to even get a rejection email back from an employer because you could send hundreds of applications and never get a reply back,"" Donato told CNBC. In that context, more than 4 in 5 adults in the U.S. report that they constantly check their email, texts and social media accounts, according to a recent American Psychiatric Association report. That attachment to electronic devices is associated with higher stress levels for millennials, the study found. The APA reports that on average, millennials experience the highest level of stress than any other generation, suggesting a need for more conversation surrounding mental health and the pressures facing recent graduates. The situation also creates room for unhealthy comparisons to other recent graduates, many of whom post seemingly high-achieving photos of their lives on Facebook and Instagram. Recent studies suggest social media feeds feelings of envy and anxiety. ""Having external validation as our only validation is damaging. So I think it's really critical for all individuals, in particular, young adults to have time for introspection and self-love and self-knowledge,"" said Byock. The therapist said everyone posting on social media is 'projecting okayness' which may lead to problems asking others for help. ""But, pretty much everyone else is also struggling,"" she added. ","Millennials face life after college, finding a 'quarter-life crisis' instead of dream jobs"
"Douglas Quenqua, special to CNBC.com",09142017,CNBC,09072017,"As a social worker with 30 years' experience working in hospice care, Christina Ingenito expected to face death gracefully when her time came. But when a breast cancer diagnosis at 59 left this once ebullient woman ""severely clinically depressed"" — her words — she turned to an unusual research project for help. In 2016, Ingenito became one of 18 subjects in the first-ever FDA-cleared study to explore the therapeutic effects of MDMA — commonly known as ecstasy — on people with life-threatening illnesses who are suffering from depression. After four standard (i.e., sober) therapy sessions with the two psychologists leading the study, Ingenito embarked on three ""medicine journeys,"" as she calls them: marathon eight-hour therapy sessions fueled by capsules of MDMA. ""Incredible"" is how she describes the experience now. ""From the very first moment that I felt the medicine in my body, it radically transformed all the trauma that I had been holding, not only from the diagnosis but previously from my life as well. My anxiety is gone; the depression is gone; my life force is back."" Today she is free from both cancer and depression. Depression now affects 16 million Americans and 350 million adults worldwide, according to the NIMH, making it one of the most common disabilities in the world. But even with more than 20 antidepressants approved by the FDA over the past 60 years, many people still struggle with the condition: One-third of Americans simply don't respond to any of the currently available medicines, studies say, and there hasn't been a significant breakthrough in decades. As the years of desperation mount, doctors are finding themselves turning to new and unexpected sources for the next big antidepression drug. Though there is no shortage of antidepression drugs currently available, analysts believe there is still plenty of opportunity in the nearly $17 billion global market. The notion that a ""party drug"" like MDMA could be used for more than recreation may have been out of fashion for many years, but it's not a new idea. Before it was outlawed in the 1960s, LSD showed promise as a treatment for depression and alcoholism. Dr. Phillip Wolfson, an author of Ingenito's study, was one of several mental health professionals experimenting with MDMA as a therapy aid in the early 1980s before it was outlawed. But a combination of prohibition and social stigma rendered it nearly impossible to get government permission, much less funding, to perform any sort of research with such drugs. Now a handful of studies — and the persistent researchers behind them — are pointing to a future where drugs like LSD, MDMA, ketamine and psilocybin (the active ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms) could find a second life not just as therapeutic aids but as potential blockbusters.

Insurers, doctors battle over new heart disease drugs ""MDMA has a blockbuster aspect in many, many areas,"" said Dr. Wolfson in a telephone interview. ""It could be used for PTSD, depression, couples' work, relationship work and probably OCD."" The evidence, he claims, is in the studies now being published. Though results of Ingenito's study are still being analyzed, preliminary data suggests the MDMA sessions dramatically alleviated depression in the subjects. That follows an earlier study that tested MDMA as a treatment for PTSD in which 80 percent of subjects no longer suffered from the condition after just two sessions. Early studies with psilocybin have been similarly encouraging. In a 2016 NYU study looking at whether the drug could alleviate anxiety and depression in cancer patients, more than 80 percent of subjects reported significant improvements. A smaller  2012 study yielded similar results. Ketamine — which goes by the street name Special K — has been studied more than most illicit drugs, thanks to its legal status in the United States as a tranquilizer (usually for animals). And results have been so encouraging that both Allergen and Johnson & Johnson currently have ketamine-inspired antidepressants in late-stage clinical trials. Of course, ketamine and MDMA are powerful drugs with serious side effects that would need to be managed. Ketamine's paralyzing effect can be so powerful, it's often classified as a date-rape drug, and users sometimes asphyxiate because they can't clear their own airwaves. MDMA can induce symptoms resembling a panic attack — sweating, nausea, chills, involuntary teeth clenching — and is occasionally associated with heat stroke.  Due to the risks, there is a clinical study under way at Stanford University to test if ketamine acts like an opioid. Promising as the research on some illicit drugs is, scientists caution that many of these treatments are still years away from commercial availability, and the testing itself is, in many cases, still in its infancy. For example, a team of researchers in the U.K. last year became the first ever to produce images of the human brain on LSD — a remarkable fact, considering how widely the drug has been consumed over the past 50 years. But the obstacles to working with the drug were simply too great, said Professor David Nutt, a neuropsychopharmacologist at Imperial College and an author of the study. ""The illegal status of LSD meant that researchers were scared, and the costs of complying with the regulations were prohibitive, and governments wouldn't fund the research because the drugs were illegal."" Still, the results of the scans strongly suggested that LSD could help treat depression in much the way psilocybin does. ""It switches off regions of the brain that are overactive in depression,"" Nutt said. It also disrupts communication between certain sections of the brain, producing an ""ego dissolution"" that helps users feel more connected to the world around them. Such results are going a long way toward easing the path for researchers who want to explore these drugs. As is the existence of groups like MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies), which has helped secure private funding for much of the research on these drugs — a notoriously difficult endeavor given the stigma surrounding them. Of course, MAPS is not the first group to advocate for the legal use of psychedelics. And hopes of a breakthrough in the area seem to arise every decade or so, suggesting the path to FDA approval may still be a long, arduous one. But Dr. Wolfson, who has watched the enthusiasm for researching psychedelic drugs rise and fall over the decades, says he's never seen the surge of interest like he is seeing now. ""Interest is peaking,"" said Dr. Wolfson, but ""it hasn't peaked yet.""

This rogue supply of painkiller is alarming, given the latest data on addiction deaths: Even after years of heightened attention from politicians and the press to the nationwide opioid epidemic, 2016 saw an increase in overdose deaths of 21 percent, with rates of synthetic-opioid deaths doubling, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""There are around 200 million opioid scripts a year. ... It's an extraordinary reserve,"" said Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University who worked on drug policy for the Obama administration. ""That's just as many scripts as there are adults; it's such a huge reservoir to tap. ... Lots of people just don't think about it,"" Humphreys said. As many as 92 percent of patients don't finish their painkillers, and less than 10 percent dispose of them properly — either flushing them down the toilet or returning them to a hospital, pharmacy or law enforcement, according to a new study published in the journal JAMA Surgery. ""For almost every injury we looked at, patients had pills they didn't use,"" said Johns Hopkins pain-management specialist Mark Bicket, who led the study. ""They become a source for illicit use. Other adults use them, and children and adolescents can find them when they're exploring,"" he said. At least two-thirds of a total of 810 patients didn't use their entire opioid prescription but kept the unused pills, according to the data Johns Hopkins studied, and roughly 75 percent of patients ignore warnings to keep opioids in a locked cabinet. ""If it was only one or two pills, it would be one thing,"" Bicket said. ""But most patients have more than 10 — almost the entire prescription — just lying around."" He said many patients hoard the drugs, not to get high but so they can react to a relapse of pain or some new injury without seeing a doctor again. Many patients stop taking pills because their pain has receded, according to between 42 percent and 71 percent of those studied. A smaller group of patients stopped taking the pills because of side effects. Either way, leaving the pills around the home leads to abuse. ""Some teenage kids want to experiment, but a teenager can also be entrepreneurial,"" Humphreys said. ""You can sell a 20-milligram OxyContin pill for $20 on the street."" He added that other threats are beyond a family's ability to foresee: There have been cases where visitors to a real estate open house clean out pill cabinets. Opioids account for 2 million people with a substance-abuse problem, according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine. Most people with opioid problems began by using pills they were prescribed as pain relievers, but more recent twists in the epidemic include a resurgence of heroin addiction and abuse of fentanyl, the drug that singer Prince overdosed on last year. Drug overdoses in 2016 killed more than 64,000 Americans, with the largest numbers coming from people who abuse prescription pills such as oxycodone or hydrocodone, whose brand-name versions are OxyContin and Vicodin. More recently, the  growth in overdose deaths has come mostly from fentanyl and heroin, the CDC data shows. The simplest thing patients can do to dispose of prescription drugs properly is to simply flush them down the toilet, Bicket said. Patients are right to fear doing environmental damage by flushing — the Drug Enforcement Administration has stated it can affect the water supply — but it's still a better option than leaving unused pills around the house. ""It's a trade-off of risks,"" Humphreys said. ""I think the candid answer a DEA official would give you is that flushing down the toilet isn't good, because it's not good to throw toxic chemicals into the water supply, but flushing, although bad, is less bad than hoarding."" The National Drug Prescription Take Back Day — created by the Justice Department and Drug Enforcement Administration as a way to get unused prescription drugs out of the public supply — is another option and is conducted twice annually. The next Take Back Day will be on Oct. 28 (as of Oct. 1 the Justice/DEA site will list collection locations). There were more than 5,400 collection sites across the country last April and 450 tons of prescription drugs collected. Initially focused on law-enforcement location drop-off, the Obama administration expanded the program in late 2014, giving pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and other ""authorized collectors"" the ability to take back drugs. CVS, among other companies, now offers customers the ability to drop off unused prescriptions. Patients and their family members can also mail their prescription controlled substances to an authorized collector using prepaid mail-back packages that can be obtained at a pharmacy, or from other locations, like libraries and community centers. If drop-off is not an option, the DEA recommends preparing unused drugs for disposal by mixing with coffee grounds or used cat litter, sealing them and then throwing them in the garbage. Humphreys said these efforts work — to a point. ""I remember I was in Russell, Arkansas, for a Take Back day, and in three hours in front of a Wal-Mart, we got more pills than there were people in the town."" But he added that Take Back Days are for all pills — not just controlled substances — and many people bring in vitamins and ""Grandma's liver pills."" He also said the National Take Back Days are designed as ""special occasions"" and, as such, can never be a complete solution. ""We need to force it into a cultural habit so it is not a special event."" Even year-round drop-off at select sites lacks a key component: incentive. Humphreys said the best suggestion he has heard recently about getting unused prescription painkillers off the market is to create a recycling program that includes a financial reward. ""People return bottles because of the deposit."" More from Modern Medicine:A new source of addiction is seducing millions: the Internet Marijuana's role in Alzheimer's research hits federal roadblock The battle over drug pricing hits America's No. 1 killer The Johns Hopkins study doesn't limit culpability to patients. Analyzing data from six previous opioid studies, Bicket found that doctors are failing to keep tabs on where all those pills go. ""Surgeons may not be aware of the magnitude of the problem,"" Bicket said. Doctors and patients are changing how they work with opioids but need to do more. The simplest solution is to not prescribe addictive painkillers: Over-the-counter painkillers, like Tylenol and Advil (acetaminophen and ibuprofen), can be more effective than many patients think, especially when used in tandem, Bicket said. Alternating between the two can enable a patient take more, with a low risk of toxic reaction than if the same patient used more than the recommended dosage of either one. States and the federal government are moving to cut off the flow of unused opiates onto the black market. Massachusetts and Maryland are considering laws to limit the number of pills that can be prescribed at one time, and the federal government last year passed the Reducing Unused Medications Act, which gives doctors or patients the right to direct that a prescription for opioids be dispensed in several separate lots. That way, the patient will return to the pharmacy for more pills only if they are still in pain. ""It is critical to limit the number of pills that travel home from the pharmacy in the first place ... in the absence of greater reforms, encouraging prescribers to embrace the partial fill option for their patients can help to reduce the number of opioids left over in homes across the country,"" Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia wrote in a letter to the nation's governors this month, urging them to promote the law in their home states. ""Educating health care professionals about various methods to limit overprescribing, as well as simple policy tools like partial fill and safe disposal of unused medications, are all critical ways to address the opioid epidemic,"" they added. Longer-term strategies could include developing versions of pain drugs that lose their effectiveness after a few months, or adding ways to make the drugs ineffective if they are taken improperly, Bicket said. Neither is ready for the market yet, but ""multiple companies and labs are working on that right now.'' Humphreys said many ideas have been tried over the years, such as putting a shell on a painkiller so if it is crushed for inhalation, the opiate becomes inert; or putting a strong coating on the pill so it makes accessing the opioid difficult. But he said these efforts have limited ability to turn the tide. ""As soon as they [the new drugs] come out, there are internet chat rooms where people say, 'Here is what you do. ... It's an arms race."" There are also boxes that have been designed to only release one opioid every 12 hours, or only dispense when a code is entered or fingerprint-scanned, and these work in some limited situations. ""I'm from West Virginia and you worry about someone breaking into your trailer to steal your painkillers,"" Humphreys said. But as someone who has worked for many years on the opioid epidemic, the Stanford professor isn't hopeful for any single, novel solution. There is only one way to beat addiction: less prescriptions. He said the medical students that he comes into contact with today are ""far more cautious"" about prescribing opioids than their mentors. Even as overdose deaths increased in 2016, the number of prescriptions fell between 2012 and 2015 for the first time in decades. ""If you look at American opioid prescribing, which is off the charts, if you reduced it by 75 percent, we would still be among the list of top nations,"" Humphreys said. He added that there is no known estimate for the rogue opioid supply but thinks the ""off-book"" supply of drugs has to be ""massive."" If the level of prescriptions doesn't keep coming down, ""all this other stuff is at the margins,"" he said.

Stacey Yuen,09142017,CNBC,09072017,"North Koreans are likely to face serious food shortages despite recent relief from an intense dry spell, officials from the UN Food and Agricultural Organization told CNBC. Rainfall this year was ""considerably lower"" than a corresponding period in 2001, when cereal production in the communist dictatorship plunged to record lows, the UN said in a July report. An estimated 20 percent of herd animals have also reportedly been severely affected this year in the worst-hit regions. The worst dry conditions, which ran from April to June, could threaten this year's overall agricultural yield and exacerbate food shortages in the country. According to the report, cereals, potato and soybeans comprise the main source of nutrition for North Korea's population — many of whom are already underfed. Even before taking the drought into account, the UN estimates that the average North Korean consumes approximately 1,640 calories of food each day. That compares with the 2,000 calories recommended for Americans by the U.S. Department of Health. Rainfall has improved over large parts of the country since August, but the shift in precipitation will be insufficient to reverse the adverse effects of the drought, said Mario Zappacosta, senior economist at the UN. By the time rain fell, ""the optimal planting period was over … and the early planted crops were already affected by the drought,"" he said. The months of April to June are critical for crop development, according to the UN report. North Korea's overall yields for the 2017 ""main season"" crops — those harvested around September and October — are expected to fall compared with 2016, Zappacosta added. It's not yet possible to determine how much, however. Still, crop output is unlikely to fall to the unprecedentedly low levels in 2000 to 2001, according to Cristina Coslet, country monitor at the UN Food and Agricultural Organization. Coupled with the latest round of UN sanctions, which aim to pressure North Korean leader Kim Jong Un into giving up his nuclear weapons, unfavorable weather conditions are likely to severely hurt Pyongyang's economy. ""They are facing a very bad harvest. And with the latest sanctions, [Kim] won't be able to pay in credit for his oil imports anymore,"" said Mark Matthews, head of research for Asia at Switzerland-based private bank Julius Baer. Kim would do well to pause his weapons testing in exchange for aid from China or the United States, Matthews added. North Korea is currently harvesting its main-season crops, scheduled to be completed by mid-October. The UN agency will await until then to determine its final production estimates for the country, which will not be ready before end October, Coslet said. The regime still cannot feed its own people without external food aid, who rely on black markets to buy rice, produce, beer and even school supplies. Chinese food exports to North Korea have soared over the past year, despite increasing sanctions imposed by the UN, hinting at Pyongyang's increasing reliance on Beijing.

"Alexandra Ossola, special to CNBC.com",09142017,CNBC,09072017,"Amidst the media hubbub of the new presidential administration, autism was back in the news. Well-known vaccine skeptic Andrew Wakefield attended one of President Donald Trump's inaugural balls; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental attorney and outspoken critic of vaccines, claimed that Trump had asked him to chair a commission on ""vaccine safety and scientific integrity,"" though seven months after those initial reports no concrete plans for such a commission have been made public. Both Wakefield and Kennedy have expressed their doubts about the safety of vaccines on the basis that they may be linked to increased incidence of autism. For many researchers working to find the causes of autism, this is frustrating, if well-tread, rhetoric. ""Regarding vaccines, the case has been closed for many years as far as the evidence is concerned,"" says Mayada Elsabbagh, an assistant professor of psychiatry at McGill University. Alycia Halladay, the chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, called the discussion about vaccines and autism a ""distraction"" because money spent looking into it isn't being dedicated to more pressing research questions. In the past decade, researchers have come a long way in narrowing down which conditions may make autism more likely to develop. What they learn could lead to more sophisticated treatments for autism at its early stages, or even prevent the disorder from developing in the first place. Autism Spectrum Disorder, or autism for short, is a disorder that can affect how the brain develops. It's characterized by social challenges, difficulties in communication and behavioral issues, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms usually appear in children between 12 and 18 months old. And the effects of autism can range from slight social challenges to severe cognitive impairment. ""If you've met one person with autism, you've met one person with autism — everyone looks a little different,"" says Heather Volk, an assistant professor in the department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. About 1 in 68 children are diagnosed with autism, according to the CDC. Today the Autism Society estimates that 3.5 million Americans are living with an autism spectrum disorder, and the prevalence has been rising over time, increasing by 119.4 percent between 2000 and 2010, according to the CDC. Though that's likely also driven by greater awareness of the condition and its symptoms, as well as access to services, Elsabbagh says. A 2014 study found that it costs $2.4 million to support a person with autism and an intellectual disability (which appears to affect 40 percent to 60 percent of those with autism) throughout the course of his or her life. Scientists spent decades looking for a specific gene, or a specific part of the brain, that could be causing the symptoms of autism. But that work hasn't turned up any one specific answer. Instead, researchers have had to change their questions. They now suspect that autism, like other complex diseases such as cancer or obesity, comes about by the interaction of many different genes and environmental factors. Researchers estimate that there may be hundreds of genes that could make someone more likely to develop autism, but merely having any one of those genes doesn't determine whether or not the disorder develops, or how severe it is if it does. Through careful epidemiological studies conducted on large populations, a number of scientists, including  Craig Newschaffer at Drexel University and Peter Bearman at Columbia University, have been able to point to some factors that correlate to the risk of autism. Over the years, researchers have determined that childhood or prenatal exposure to toxic chemicals, such as pesticides ; hormone-disrupting phthalates (often found in plastics) and some found in air pollution, have played a role. Mothers who have bacterial or viral infections during pregnancy or those who are obese are also more likely to give birth to babies who are later diagnosed with autism. It's important to note, however, that these are risk factors for autism, not causes — there's a correlation between these factors and autism, but researchers aren't quite sure of the mechanism that might make the disorder more likely to develop. Researchers are getting creative with the kinds of studies they are designing to better assess these and other potential risk factors. One long-running study at the University of California, Davis tracks a huge array of children's genetic and environmental factors in children as young as two years old to compare those that develop autism to those that do not. Other research efforts start even earlier, tracking moms — since autism seems to run in families, scientists are recruiting mothers who already have one child with autism, then recruit the next sibling. ""If you do this during pregnancy, you can give the mom questionnaires in real time and ask her things like where she drove, what she ate,"" Volk says. Plus, you can take samples from the mother during her pregnancy or even image the fetus' brain as it develops. More from Modern Medicine:FDA testing groundbreaking science: Human organs-on-a-chip

A new sickle-cell drug 25 years in the making But even if a well-designed study uncovers a new risk factor, that has to be validated and replicated by other scientists. And so far, Volk says, researchers are not far enough down the road to come up with any interventions to treat or prevent autism based on those findings. There are some findings that, if reflected in policy, are generally beneficial, such as having cleaner air and making baby bottles that are BPA-free. ""But we're not far enough to think about pharmacological interventions in pregnancy,"" Volk says. Right now the most effective interventions for autism take place after a child has begun to show symptoms. ""The best way for us to support children with autism is to support parents so that they interact with children and address concerns with children together,"" Elsabbagh says. Programs are popping up all over the world to help parents do exactly that—to modify their own behavior towards children with autism so that, over time, the children's brains develop in the most optimal way possible. In the US, some of those programs include the UC Davis MIND Institute, the  Center for Autism and the Developing Brain in New York and the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA. Researchers are working on how to make these costly programs available to all families who need them, Elsabbagh says. It's not clear what future interventions might look like. But scientists are working on it. ""I think the best thing we can do as scientists is ask smart questions and follow the data where it seems to point,"" Volk says. Sometimes, that process is time consuming or surprisingly complex. ""I think maybe the challenge in that type of reporting is that science changes incrementally. We make small discoveries over time,"" Elsabbagh says. And though they've been at it for decades, researchers are hopeful that they can unravel autism to provide more effective interventions for people with autism. ""I don't think [understanding autism] is an unsolvable problem. I don't think any autism researcher would be doing it if it were,"" says Halladay of the Autism Science Foundation. According to the National Autism Association,  a person with autism may: Not respond to his or her name.Have obsessive interests.Avoid eye contact or physical contact.Have difficulty understanding, or showing understanding, of others' feelings or their own.Repeat words or phrases.React more or less sensitively than usual to sounds, smells, tastes, sights or physical sensations.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. If you're one of the millions of Americans with Medicare Part D or Medicare Advantage coverage, or if you're signing up for one of these plans for the first time, then you're probably wondering: How do I lower my drug costs when Medicare falls short? Here are six tips that can save you a pile of money on your medicine when you're on Medicare. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Every year, Medicare Part D members can switch their plan, and if you find that you're paying more than you want to pay for drugs on your existing plan, it may be time to switch to a plan that provides better coverage. For example, the standard Part D deductible is $400, but some plans provide coverage from dollar No. 1. You may pay a little more per month for the additional coverage, but that's not always the case. Some plans with no deductible cost roughly the same per month as a standard plan. At a minimum, eliminating your deductible can help you avoid the up-front cash crunch caused by paying a deductible before your coverage kicks in. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Once the total retail price of the drugs you buy reaches $3,700, you're typically responsible for 100% of your drug costs up to a cap of $7,425 in 2017. This $3,725 gap in coverage is called the ""donut hole."" Fortunately, some plans offer additional donut hole coverage that can save you money. For example, you may be able to find a plan that allows you to pay the same copay as you would prior to entering the donut hole. This coverage will increase your monthly premium, but it can lower your total spending if you find yourself in the donut hole every year. A word of caution, though: Every plan covers individual drugs differently, and oftentimes, donut hole coverage doesn't include expensive brand-name drugs. Therefore, review the lists of covered drugs carefully and contact the insurer to confirm your medicine is covered. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. It can pay off to ask your doctor about generic alternatives to your existing medications, because generic drugs are cheaper than brand-name drugs, and the FDA only approves generic drugs after they've proven to be equivalent to the brand-name drugs you're already taking. Generic drugs offer lower copays, and they're more likely to be included in the donut hole coverage I recommend in tip No. 2. Furthermore, generic drugs' lower retail price can help you delay, or potentially avoid, exceeding the $3,700 annual threshold that puts you in the donut hole in the first place. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Insurers negotiate with drugmakers for the cheapest price, and the cheapest drugs are included in each insurer's preferred drug list. You can save a lot of money by picking a plan whose ""preferred"" drugs include the ones you need -- especially when you use the plan's preferred pharmacy to fill your prescription. For example, CVS Health's SilverScript Plus' California plan offers $0 copays for preferred generic drugs filled by its preferred pharmacy, which, unsurprisingly, is CVS. If you use a nonpreferred pharmacy to fill a preferred drug on this plan, it will cost you $10. Meanwhile, filling a prescription for a preferred brand-name drug at a preferred pharmacy can cost as little as $67.50 -- less than half what it would cost to fill the same prescription at a non-preferred pharmacy. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. If you take the same medicine all year long, filling 90-day prescriptions instead of 30-day prescriptions will also save you money. For example, the copay for a preferred generic drug filled by AARP's MedicareRx Preferred plan in Ramsey County, Minnesota, is $0 for a 90-day supply when it's filled by AARP's preferred mail-order pharmacy, OptumRx. The copay for a 90-day supply of a preferred brand-name drug that's filled by OptumRx is $90, which is a 21% discount to the cost of filling a 30-day supply at a nonpreferred pharmacy. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. If you've taken advantage of these tips and your medicine is still costing too much, then you may still have some ways to cut those expenses even further. Many drug companies offer discount savings programs for patients in the donut hole, and you can see if such a program exists for the medicine you take by going to Medicare's pharmaceutical assistance program website. You may also qualify for a pharmaceutical assistance program through Medicare, Social Security, and/or your state of residence. If you qualify for Medicare and Social Security's program, you could pay no more than $3.30 for each generic drug or $8.25 for each brand-name covered drug in 2017. If you don't qualify, many states also offer programs that may help. For instance, New York's EPIC program can reduce drug costs for couples with annual household income of up to $100,000. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. It's important to discuss your financial situation candidly with your doctor, because they may recommend changes to your treatment plan that can reduce your out-of-pocket costs. They know how expensive drugs have become, and they're in the best position to help you figure out your options. Overall, even if you're in good health, don't skimp on your coverage. It's better to over-prepare financially by buying the best coverage you can afford than to get caught flat-footed when an unexpected illness or injury strikes. ","

Big changes are coming to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) this fall, which is more commonly known as Obamacare, and they aren't of the variety that's likely to increase enrollment and make the program more sustainable for insurers. According to Department of Health and Human Services officials, the Trump administration is slashing outreach and navigator funding for the upcoming enrollment cycle, which begins on Nov. 1, 2017 and ends on Dec. 15, 2017, for the 2018 calendar year. Outreach funding, which involves marketing and advertising to make consumers aware of their enrollment options, is being cut by 90% to just $10 million, while navigator funding (navigators answer questions for consumers and guide them in their search for an ACA plan) will be cut by 41%. The administration justified the latter cut by pointing out that navigators hadn't been hitting their enrollment objectives. Image source: Getty Images. In addition to less funding being available for marketing for the upcoming enrollment cycle, premiums are also expected to soar. President Trump has made it crystal clear that repealing and replacing Obamacare is a prime goal while he is in the Oval Office. The uncertainty created by Trump's and the GOP's efforts to repeal, coupled with ongoing losses for a number of national insurers, has precipitated a huge spike in rate requests by health-benefit providers. While there is no clear consensus as of yet regarding how much rates could rise nationally in 2018 since many states are still negotiating with insurers, ACASignUps.net estimates that premiums could jump 15.44% across the 47 states it has data on thus far. This scenario assumes that the Trump administration keeps cost-sharing reductions (which help lower the cost of copays, coinsurance, and deductibles) in place. Should these be removed, coupled with no enforcement of the Shared Responsibility Payment (the penalty consumers are supposed to pay for not buying health insurance), premiums could rise by an average of 29.49% across 47 states. It's not a very pleasant forecast, but there are (thankfully) ways for consumers to potentially save money in the upcoming year. Here are 10 Obamacare tips that could help put extra money in your pocket when shopping for health coverage. Image source: Getty Images. The first move you'll want to consider making is applying for the Advanced Premium Tax Credit (APTC) if you're earning between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. APTCs are the subsidy attached to the ACA that lowers your out-of-pocket premium costs. The APTC is an especially helpful tool for seniors aged 50 to 64 and lower-income individuals and families that makes their premiums affordable. In 2018, the federal poverty level for a household of one will be $12,060, meaning folks with earned income of $12,060 to $48,240 may qualify for the APTC. Based on the federal poverty levels for 2018 coverage, those earning between $12,060 and $30,150 may qualify. Image source: Getty Images. While it's true that we've witnessed an insurer exodus from the ACA for the upcoming year, consumers still need to take the time to shop around if they hope to get the best deal. Insurers frequently change their premiums and coverage options from one year to the next, meaning the best value one year (note that value may not mean the lowest-cost plan) may not be your best choice the following year. As noted above, the 2018 enrollment period will be made all the more challenging with Aetna (NYSE:AET) and Humana (NYSE:HUM) announcing their complete exit from the ACA exchanges in the upcoming year, and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) slashing their coverage by more than 90% this year from 2016. Even Anthem (NYSE:ANTM), the company behind the Blue Cross Blue Shield name in 14 states, has announced that it'll be pulling out of a handful of states. If you won't be subsidized by CSRs or the APTC in 2018, it still pays for you to shop around the ACA networks to see if there's an insurance plan that meets your medical and financial needs. However, don't be shy about looking off-network for deals. Private networks like eHealth may offer unsubsidized consumers considerably more options than the ACA exchanges do -- and these private markets are presumably far more stable than Obamacare. Image source: Getty Images. Consumers should also understand that they have a number of exemptions at their disposal that may not only keep them from paying the Shared Responsibility Payment, but could also open up new coverage options. For example, some folks may still qualify for catastrophic insurance coverage, which involves very low premiums but really high deductibles, if they meet certain criteria. For instance, if you're under 30 years old, or you're over the age of 30 and qualify for a hardship exemption, you may be able to purchase a catastrophic plan which, at least from a premium perspective, could be friendlier on your wallet. Arguably one of the greatest aspects of Obamacare is that it allows children to stay on their parents' health plan until they turn 26, which is great for college-aged students who may be too busy focusing on their studies to worry about paying for health insurance. If you're under the age of 26, consider putting hubris aside and latching onto your parents' health plan. Best of all, if you do land a great job with paid coverage from an employer, you can always opt out of your parents' plan. Image source: Getty Images. Another smart decision to consider is purchasing a pricier gold- or platinum-tier plan if you visit the doctor often or have a chronic illness. Though bronze and silver plans may be tempting for their lower premiums, the deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses associated with these plans are considerably higher than under a gold or platinum plan. Even with higher premiums, sicker individuals who head to the doctor more often should be able to save money -- and have fewer out-of-pocket surprises -- by choosing a pricier ACA plan. We Americans typically don't like to be told what to do, but if you want to save some money in the upcoming year on your health insurance, you'll choose to put the tobacco products down. Under ACA guidelines, only five factors determine what you're charged for health insurance: If you use tobacco, insurers have the right to charge up to 50% more for your monthly premiums. This is because scientific studies have shown that smoking leads to an increased risk of heart disease, cancer, and a host of other ailments. Image source: Getty Images. You should also take into consideration, as pointed out above, that where you live can influence what you'll pay each month for health insurance. States like Wyoming and Alaska have frequently offered the highest monthly premiums in the country because of their minimal population and lack of specialized equipment throughout their sparsely placed hospitals and medical centers. States and counties that have dense populations are often some of the cheapest places to buy health insurance since the likelihood of having specialized equipment nearby is high. Finally, consider opening or contributing to a health savings account (HSA). In order to qualify for an HSA, you'll need to be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan, not be enrolled in Medicare, and be able to say you're not being claimed as a dependent by anyone else. If you meet these criteria, you'll be able to contribute pre-tax dollars to an HSA, which you can then lean on to help cover the costs of eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses on a tax-free and penalty-free basis. Since HSA dollars are pre-tax, it also means contributions can lower your current-year tax liability. If you come into the open enrollment period prepared, there's no reason you can't save yourself money on health coverage in the coming year. ","
      
    10 Obamacare Tips to Save You Money in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

Sean Williams,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Chances are you'd struggle to find an industry that's been stronger over the trailing one-year period than legal marijuana. Cannabis research firm ArcView pegged North American legal weed growth at 34% in 2016 and foresees a compound annual growth rate of 26% over the coming five-year period.  Not surprisingly, marijuana stocks have jumped, as an aggregate, by an average of more than 100% over the trailing year, if we only consider the 14 with a current market cap above $200 million. Aside from the massive sales growth behind pot stocks, changing public perceptions have played a key role. No longer perceived to be on the same level as heroin, LSD, and other Schedule I substances, some 60% of respondents want to see marijuana legalized across the U.S., according to Gallup's October 2016 poll. This represents an all-time record high, and it suggests that pressure could be mounting on Congress to make changes in their scheduling of cannabis at the federal level. Image source: Getty Images. However, rapid sales growth and changing perceptions have also attracted a sea of speculators who've thrown around a number of bad reasons to buy into the budding weed industry. If any of the following five reasons summarize why you've purchased a marijuana stock, or a group of stocks, it may be time to re-evaluate your holdings. The thesis here is pretty simple: The percentage of folks who want to see marijuana legalized in some form is skyrocketing, meaning Congress and state governments will have no choice but to listen to the will of the people and legalize cannabis, or risk being voted out of office. In addition to the 60% of Gallup respondents who want to legalize recreational weed, 94% in a Quinnipiac University poll want medical cannabis to be legal nationally. Sounds like a valid thesis, right? There's just one big problem: Congress doesn't have to do anything. Not to deny the fact that Americans have dramatically shifted their views on pot over the past two decades, but it seems highly unlikely that a single issue like marijuana is going to be the reason incumbents are voted out of office if they don't alter their stance on weed. At the moment, Congress is far too concerned with healthcare and tax reform, the debt ceiling, and the upcoming budget to even remotely consider federal marijuana legislation. Image source: Getty Images. Another common investment thesis in marijuana stocks is that expansion via state approvals should lead to growth. Right now, 29 states have legalized medical cannabis, leaving just 21 that haven't, and eight states have legalized the sale of adult-use weed to those aged 21 and over. With more than half of all U.S. states having legalized, marijuana stocks have to be a great investment, right? Not exactly. Quite a few of the remaining 21 states that haven't legalized medical cannabis are run by Republicans, who are among the two groups, along with senior citizens, who still oppose the expansion of marijuana. Also, 24 U.S. states lack the initiative and referendum process, meaning legislation at the state level is essentially the only way to pass medical and recreational pot laws, leaving residents with very little say in the matter. Earlier this year, Vermont's state legislature passed a bill to legalize recreational cannabis and become the ninth state to do so, but Gov. Phil Scott (R-Vt.) vetoed the measure. Long story short, expansion opportunities appear to be dwindling, not increasing, in the United States. Image source: Getty Images. Some speculators turn to the eye-popping growth rates behind legal weed as a reason to invest. As noted, ArcView sees legal marijuana sales in North America growing by 26% annually through 2021, reaching nearly $22 billion by that time. With some of the fastest growth estimates around, marijuana stocks have to succeed, right? Wrong. One of the biggest issues with the marijuana industry being so new is that we haven't seen much in the way of industry consolidation. It means that smaller mom and pop-type dispensaries and even grow farms are competing against one another. Without industry consolidation, it makes it incredibly difficult for the retail investor to profit from the growth of legal weed. What's more, marijuana's Schedule I categorization leads to a host of disadvantages for businesses that include an inability to take normal corporate income-tax deductions, as well as difficulty in securing basic banking services, even for something as simple as a checking account. Researchers also struggle to get the green light to run critical clinical studies into the benefits and risks of medical cannabis. Image source: Getty Images. Another clear argument in favor of investing in marijuana stocks -- especially those that are developing cannabinoids to fight disease, or are utilizing the body's natural cannabinoid receptor system -- is the idea that marijuana is medicine. With 29 states having legalized cannabis for medicinal purposes, investors see its benefits outweighing its risks and therefore generating a lot of money for pot stocks. Solid thesis, right? On one hand, we have the example of GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:GWPH), which dazzled in multiple phase 3 trials with oral cannabidiol drug Epidiolex as a treatment for two rare types of childhood-onset epilepsy. In all instances, Epidiolex led to a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency, setting the drug up for what could be a 2018 approval from the Food and Drug Administration. However, there's been no shortage of cannabinoid-based failures, either. GW Pharmaceuticals' Sativex failed miserably as a treatment for cancer pain in U.S. phase 3 trials, while Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ZYNE) recently disappointed in two studies involving its cannabidiol-based gel, ZYN002. Zynerba's lead drug failed to produce a statistically significant reduction in focal seizures for epileptic patients in the Star 1 study, while the Stop trial for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee also missed its primary endpoint. At least the Stop study hit a few secondary endpoints, offering some glimmers of hope. Long story short, cannabis may be medicine, but it's not a miracle cure by any means based on this clinical data. Image source: Getty Images. Lastly, some folks might be buying into marijuana stocks simply for the sake of sticking with what they known. In other words, marijuana users, be it medical or recreational, are buying into marijuana stocks because they're familiar with the product, much in the same way you could buy Coca-Cola stock because you drink Coke. Buying what you know is a great investment thesis, right? Generally speaking, yes it is, as long as the product has staying power. But there's no guarantee that the weed industry has any staying power, for two key reasons. To begin with, in case you forgot, cannabis is still wholly illegal at the federal level. ""Buy what you know"" doesn't work very well when the federal government outlaws what you're investing in. The other issue here is Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who'll seemingly stop at nothing to ensure that marijuana's scheduling at the federal level isn't changed. In short, pot is likely to remain a Schedule I drug throughout the Trump presidency, severely hampering the ""buy what you know"" thesis. For marijuana stocks to be investment-worthy, we're going to need to see clear changes at the federal level and industrywide consolidation. For the time being, the safest place continues to be on the sidelines. ","
      
    The 5 Worst Reasons to Buy Marijuana Stocks -- The Motley Fool

  "
Todd Campbell,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Following Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) decision to buy Kite Pharma (NASDAQ:KITE) for $11.9 billion in cash, we couldn't help but wonder what other healthcare stocks could be takeover targets, too. A full transcript follows the video. Todd Campbell: Buyouts, buyouts, buyouts! Harjes: Yeah, I can see why. Last week, you were talking to my colleague Michael Douglass on this show about Gilead Science's acquisition of Kite Pharmaceuticals. So, this week, we figured we would continue the trend a little bit by highlighting some stock we think might be the next takeover candidates. After that, we'll discuss the demise of Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA), a stock that shed half its value just last month. But first, Todd, I feel like the biotech space is particularly talked about in terms of buyout speculation. Why do you think that is? Campbell: People like to hit home runs in this industry. [laughs] You know? By the nature of the beast, with clinical trials failing and successes being rare, and failures being more frequent, when people go in and buy biotech stocks, they tend to be more risk tolerant. Wouldn't you agree, Kristine? Harjes: Yeah, sure. And, investors should be pretty risk tolerant if they're going to enter particularly clinical-stage biotech space. I don't know, it confuses me why there's so much speculation and hope for buyouts, because if it were me and I was buying one of these companies that had what I thought could be a blockbuster drug, I wouldn't want it to get bought out. I would want all that upside of them potentially bringing it to market and actually succeeding. But maybe that's a long-term, short-term difference. Campbell: Yeah, but Kristine, it's not like consumer goods, where you're dealing with a brand like Coca-Cola. All of biotech is driven by patent expiration or protection. With innovation moving so quickly, you may have a great, innovative product, but how long will that innovation keep you ahead of the competition that's coming up the pipeline behind you? From a corporate standpoint, [I think there are] some reasons why you've got entrepreneurs who are saying, ""Let's ring the register and be willing to sell,"" and from the acquirer standpoint, you've got people saying, ""OK, we've got patents expire in, what's the next big thing and can we bring it into our fold to offset that risk?"" Harjes: Yeah, you're right, I can totally see why both sides of the equation would be interested in it. I guess my hesitation is, why do investors push for it so much? I think it's more just the fun of speculating, and that's exactly what we're about to do, is speculate a little bit on who we think could be the next big buyout. One place where there's been a ton of hype around potential acquisitions is none other than the CAR-T space. As a refresher, Kite Pharma, as I mentioned earlier, was bought by Gilead Sciences, it's a CAR-T cancer drug developer. On Kite's acquisition, a bunch of the other CAR-T developers also had their share prices pop, which to me is very indicative that people think that some of these other smaller players might also get acquired. Campbell: Yeah, that move up in Juno was pretty insane, wasn't it, Kristine? Harjes: Yeah, I was pretty happy to see it. A long time ago, I realize I probably should have had my money in Kite instead of Juno, but I'm still sitting on my Juno shares. I was definitely a happy camper that day. Campbell: Yeah, I think we got, what, a 40% move up in the span of a couple of days? Obviously, investors were extrapolating, ""If Novartis gets their CAR-T approved, and Kite theoretically gets its approved in November, and Gilead just spent all this money acquiring Kite to be able to get that upside, and then Juno, Juno has these CAR-T drugs, too, and maybe those drugs will be even better. So, perhaps I should get involved with that!"" Harjes: Yeah. I think there are a couple of different ways people might be looking at this. The first is, Gilead might not be finished buying CAR-T developers. I think there are some people out there who look at Gilead's strategy here and say, ""They're not done, they don't want just Kite. They want to build an entire oncology franchise built around cellular therapy,"" which is exactly what you heard John Milligan say on the conference call regarding the Kite acquisition, that they're looking to do this, to see other companies they could fold in and augment what they've already built by buying Kite. So, this is that string of pearls acquisition technique where, instead of making one enormous splashy purchase, you can tuck in a couple of companies here and there, and they definitely have the money to do that. And, on the other side of that coin, you could also have speculation that someone else is going to buy Juno. I'm not sure who exactly that would be, but it could be Celgene. Campbell: I'll throw a name in the mix there, Kristine. Harjes: Who are you going to throw? Campbell: I'll say Celgene. Harjes: Yep. [laughs] Campbell: Why not? Harjes: They've already been looking at Juno in terms of partnerships. Campbell: Oh, absolutely! Correct me if I'm wrong, but they took a stake in it previously when it inked its deal on CAR-T development. I think Celgene has shown that it loves to tie itself to the wagon of emerging biotechnology. They don't have an internal CAR-T option. They do have some collaborations, one with bluebird bio, which was another stock that rallied significantly following the news on Kite. We've discussed that one on the show previously. So, they've got a couple deals externally for CAR-T, but they don't have anything internally. And since they've already shown that they want to be a major player in cancer, you could see that as being a possibility. But, I always get so nervous when we start talking about ifs and buts and whens and what ifs. Harjes: Yeah, you sound like you're about to throw out some caveats. Campbell: Well, yeah. If you look at what's been happening with CAR-T, Juno, I'm not going to call it and also-ran, but they went from being a front-runner to now being in, we'll call it third place. Their JCAR015, they had to shutter development of that. That was their lead product candidate, and they had to shutter development when safety risks caught up to them. Specifically, people were dying because of brain swelling. They had some patient deaths because of brain swelling. Well, they've now shifted their focus to JCAR017, which is a very intriguing drug. It's next generation CAR-T, and they think it could be safer. But, it's not like they've necessarily proven that out. They're not at the same stage as, say, Kite was, with a pending FDA application, or that Novartis was with their CAR-T in getting unanimous support from an adcom committee. So, I think there's a significant amount of risk with all the remaining CAR-T players, and that does make me a little bit cautious on the idea of them being a buyout. Harjes: Yeah. And they're, appropriately, a lot smaller than Kite. At their inflated market cap, Juno and bluebird are both around less than half the size currently. And that, of course, reflects the fact that they are earlier stage. Even bluebird is super early, but they also have this entire side gene therapy program. One more name that I want to mention, because Todd, you brought up the safety risks involved here with CAR-T, and this company that I think has a really a novel way of addressing the safety risks is so, so tiny. They're only $350 million in market cap, which, for Gilead to purchase them, that would be pennies to them. This company is called Bellacom. They have an interesting molecular switching technology that could potentially make it best-in-class down the road, but way down the road. It'll be years. Their lead candidate could maybe hit the market in 2019. So, super interesting technology that could potentially improve the outcomes of some of these CAR-T therapies, things like stem cell transplants, which often have complications. But, this, again, is an extremely early stage company. I'm not even sure if Gilead would be interested in them, because it's so tiny that it probably won't even be a needle mover. Campbell: Yeah. A company like Gilead, they like to focus on companies that are a little bit further along in their development, a little bit closer to market, where they can see a return on their investment in a relatively short period of time. They tied their wagon to Kite right now. I think, unless one of these other companies comes out there and shows that they really have dropped-dead better efficacy, better safety. Safety is going to be key in CAR-T, Kristine. I think that's the differentiator. Harjes: Well, that's a bunch of the Juno theory right now, that they're not going to be first but they might be safest. Campbell: Exactly! And if they are the safest, that's critical, because right now CAR-Ts are getting approved for use in refractory disease, heavily pretreated patients, these patients don't have a lot of treatment options. If they want to be able to tap into the much larger pool of cancer patients and move that up into earlier forms of treatment, they need to be able to prove that these drugs are safe. Now, in clinical trials, I think Juno has shown some really interesting interim results that suggest, possibly, it may have a better safety profile than, say, Kite's Axi-Cel. But, you need to roll this out in more patients, you need to evaluate this because we interim stuff that we saw in JCAR015 looked good, too, right? Harjes: Yeah. You definitely need a bigger sample size. Campbell: Oh, yeah, absolutely! Whenever it comes to investing in clinical-stage companies, I really do caution investors chasing the news and trying to buy something simply because it's running up because of something that's happened to another company. It's a risky way of investing. I think you're better off saying, do I like the technology, after doing the research? Reading everything there is on The Fool about Juno, am I convinced that this company has a better mouse track? If you think that's the case, then be a little patient, wait for shares to balance out a little bit. They've had a big run up. And then pick your spots. Again, keep it to a small, diversified position in your portfolio. Harjes: Yep. Let's pivot pretty hard here away from CAR-T and go over to the robotic surgery market, where Todd, you brought up to me another company that you think might be a very good buyout candidate. Campbell: Kristine, we spent a lot of time talking on the show about companies in biopharma. We don't really talk as much about companies in med-tech. And I thought it might be interesting to go out and try to find a company in med-tech that fits three criteria. I wanted to find something that's a little bit off the beaten path, something that's disrupting an industry. I also wanted to find something that already has a product on the market that's delivering sales growth, and I wanted to find a company that was already being shown some interest or some love by a larger company that could potentially become and acquirer. And when I put all that stuff up in the mixing bowl, the name that popped out for me was Mazor Robotics, a robotics company that's reenvisioning the way surgeons do spinal surgery. Harjes: At first, when I looked at this company, I was like, ""Oh, well, Intuitive Surgical, they're just going to dominate this space, why would I ever be interested in a smaller player?"" But, it turns out that there's actually two pretty separate markets. Mazor has the Mazor X and the Renaissance System that helps surgeons perform spine and brain procedures, which is pretty different from what Intuitive Surgical -- which, if listeners aren't familiar with them, they are the Goliath in robotic surgery. But, Intuitive focuses on gynecological, urology, and general surgery. Campbell: Right, more laparoscopic stuff. Harjes: Right. So, what Mazor is improving the accuracy of surgeons when they're doing these surgeries, it reduces complications, it minimizes the need for inner operative X-rays, which is great because that will lower the radiation doses that patients are exposed to, and it leads to a faster recovery and less postoperative pain. All good stuff there. Campbell: Which is very important. You have to remember that these procedures are being reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid at fixed rates. So, the more that hospital can reduce, say, recovery times, get patients in, get patients out, avoid complications that may end up having them return to the hospital where they're not likely to get reimbursed as much from Medicare and Medicaid, the better. I equate this company, Mazor, to where Intuitive Surgical was maybe five years ago, in the stage of, OK, we're at the tipping point where we've invested a lot of time, effort, and energy over the course of the last few years, and trying to establish ourselves with those first-mover surgeons, the ones who are saying, ""yes, I want to be on the cutting edge of technology."" And now we're getting to a point where there's enough clinical data and papers published and things going on that it's becoming a little bit more mainstream. You're reaching that tipping point where more hospitals may go out and start buying these machines, which are relatively expensive machines. They can run $800,000 to $1,000,000. So, it's a big investment for these hospitals and surgery centers. I think that's what we're seeing now. We're seeing Mazor generate pretty rapid growth for its latest system, which is the Mazor X. Harjes: Which is a win-win, because the more hospitals and surgery centers that you can get into, you not only have the sales from the systems themselves, you also get roughly $1,500 per procedure in disposables sales. That's that razors and blades model that we talked about with Intuitive Surgical. Plus, you also get the service contracts. So, at this point, Mazor just wants to sell the most of these machines that they can to continue getting in that constant revenue from the procedure sales and from the service contracts. So, what they've done is, they've enlisted a little bit of help. Campbell: Yes. And this brings us to the big company that's showing it some love part of the segment, where we step back and say, what's the spine market look like? And, if this company is disrupting the spine market, what players in spine right now are paying attention? And the company that is really paying attention is Medtronic. Medtronic cut a deal with Mazor last year to start using its sales force to generate out leads that would get surgeons at the hospitals that it calls upon to go check out Mazor's system. Harjes: Yeah. This is a partnership that had initially the responsibility for the two of these two companies to both be marketing these machines through the end of this year. Then, it had some options that came at the end of the year. But, we actually just found out earlier this week, I believe it was, that Phase II of the agreement is already going to kick in, which means that Medtronic will take over the exclusive rights to distribute the Mazor X system, and it'll also make another investment in the company. Campbell: Right. It was kind of like a courtship. You went out on a date to see if the two of you liked each other. You had Medtronic giving some very preliminary training on Mazor's system, learning a little bit about it, and then of course, starting to talk about it with the people they were calling upon and get those people to go. The way that the deal had structure originally was, if the Phase I portion of the deal had gone well, then you would advance to Phase II, where Medtronic takes over 100% of all the marketing of it. But that wasn't expected to happen until February of 2018. Instead, they're doing it now. So, that tends to show you a little bit of the opportunity that Medtronic thinks there is for the Mazor X, and how it thinks it may dovetail into its own spine platform, which includes things like, say, the implants that are being used by this system during these surgical procedures, and some of the other componentry that's used by this system during these procedures. You have Medtronic doing $649 million in quarterly sales tied to spine alone. And you have Mazor possibly on the cusp of contributing much more meaningfully to that number over time, now that Medtronic is taking over the responsibility of marketing them. Which, by the way, is global marketing, which is huge, because up toward now, Mazor has really only penetrated the U.S. market. It's not very well penetrated outside the U.S. Harjes: Yeah. I haven't even seen ex-U.S. numbers as projections from Mazor, but within the U.S. alone, the opportunity is still huge. Last year, they only used the system in 5,000 different procedures in the U.S., but they estimate that the total addressable market in just the U.S. is 500,000. So, stretch that out to the global opportunity, and yeah, absolutely, this opportunity is enormous. Campbell: Yeah, I don't know if this is going to get to the size of an Intuitive Surgical. I think there's a likelihood that at some point, Medtronic maybe just swoops in and buys up the company lock stock and barrel. It's already, Kristine, as part of these deals, putting its money where its mouth is and buying shares in Mazor. Harjes: Yep. The equity stake is also huge, just as a vote of confidence from Medtronic, which is a Goliath in the space. Campbell: Right. There are three tranches that Medtronic took advantage of. They bought some shares at $11.42, which has worked out really well for them. They bought another 4% at $21.84. Now, they have a third tranche that they're buying at $38.46. Once they're all said and done, they're going to already own about 12% of Mazor, with a potential to take that up to between 14 and 15% because of some warrants. Harjes: We'll be watching to see if that ever hits 100%. Onto the second segment of today's show where we answer the question, what the heck happened with Teva last month? Campbell: I feel like we've seen this movie before, Kristine. Harjes: With Teva? Campbell: Yeah. A company goes out, spends a lot of money on acquisitions, gets heavily indebted, sales start to fall, next thing you know ... Harjes: Yeah, here we are. Teva has a lot going on right now, but we will unpack all of that. As a reminder, back in August 2016, Teva bough Actavis, which is Allergan's generic business. This was largely funded by debt. Now, fast forward a little bit to today, and that's gotten them in some trouble. Campbell: Yeah, a little bit. The timing of it ... it looked like a really good deal at the time. It was a $40 billion deal, with some of it being done in Teva stock, and the rest of it being done in ""cash."" They borrow the money because, ""Why not, the interest rates are low, I can go out and buy this money and finance it with the sales growth and the cash flow."" That thinking is wonderful as long as you don't stumble and cash flow doesn't start to decline. Harjes: Yeah. When Teva reported earnings on August 23rd, its stock dropped 24% right away, which was due to a confluence of negative news in the earnings report. The most relevant one to this generics business was them saying that because of customer consolidation and increased competition from other generic drug makers, they're just not getting the prices that they're used to. Apparently, the negotiations that they went through on their contract renewals led to a 6% overall price decrease. They expect that to continue eroding through the rest of the year. So, that's alarming on its own, but I'm also really worried by the fact that management didn't really seem to see this coming. Campbell: No. I don't think a lot of the industry did, to be fair. I think some of the pharmacies themselves have been surprised by the impact of falling generic pricing. I think you've seen it throughout the entire supply chain. The reality is this is the situation we're in today on September 6th. We have a company that's a mammoth, it's a Goliath in generic drugs, that now has this rope around its neck in the form of this big debt payment that it has to make. That's going to force it to make some pretty drastic decisions. They've decided to cut their dividend substantially. Harjes: 75%, yeah. Campbell: Yeah, which is something that income investors never want to hear. You can almost hear the shares being flushed out of income portfolios on that news. And they have all sorts of other problems right now with the share price, because Allergan, as part of that deal, got a whole bunch of shares in Teva. They don't want those shares, so they're planning on unloading them in the open market, selling them. So, you have that weight on the share price as well. So, you have a pitch situation where you have generic drug price compression hurting margins and crimping cash flow, interest expense rising because of all of this debt, and a lot of shares becoming available for sale that's affecting the supply and demand for the pricing of the individual shares. Throw on top of all that, Kristine -- Harjes: Yeah, we're not done yet. If you had asked me a year ago, ""What is Teva's largest problem?"", I would have said the fact that Copaxone, which is a huge part of their branded business -- we talked about Teva as a generics business, but it actually does have a branded segment as well that is dominated by this one multiple sclerosis drug, it's the most popular MS drug in the world, and it's going to come off-patent as early as next year. It could be facing unbranded competition, dragging down its profits from this drug. So, we've had our eye on that forever. And all of the sudden, that problem is just one of many. Campbell: Right, they went from 20mg to 40mg so they could improve the dosing schedule, that protected market share for a couple of years. Now, there's been ongoing patent disputes between them and some generics that have some people thinking that you could end up with a 40mg competitor in relatively short order. This is a billion dollar a quarter drug. At one point, it was racking up $4 billion in sales. And in the second quarter, sales were down I think 12% in the United States to $843 million. This is a significant potential headwind at a time where the company doesn't need any more significant potential headwinds. Harjes: Yeah. I'll also know that they are still looking for a permanent CEO. The guy that they have right now is not anything other than an interim president and CEO after the old CEO stepped down last February. Todd, to wrap up this segment, when you're looking at this company, it has gotten really cheap if you look at it on an earnings multiple basis. Do you think it could be a value player right now? Campbell: A value player or a falling knife, take your pick. I don't know. Whenever you look at these metrics, they're either trailing 12 month metrics, which really don't reflect the situation that Teva's moving into, or they're based on forward estimates, which could very well not pan out depending on how this business ends up performing over the next few quarters. It's very hard to say it's cheap at 3X earnings per share if those are earnings per share could end up getting revised 50% lower. So we just simply don't know. You're right, it's trading at a price to book value that's less than one. It's trading at a low single-digit P/E ratio. But, the current ratio is also less than one, which means it doesn't have a whole heck of a lot of wiggle room in the short-term when it comes to financing its short-term or paying its short-term obligations. Do I think that Teva Pharmaceuticals is going to disappear? I guess, push come to shove, no. Am I willing to bet more than 1% of my portfolio on it? [laughs] I think that's the way you have to look at it. You have to say, ""Maybe this is cheap, and I think it's going to come out on the other side. And certainly, there are big demographic trends at support generic prescription volume over time. Maybe I'll put 1% of my portfolio in it, and if it ends up tripling or quadrupling from these levels over a course of five or 10 years, yay, I'm rewarded."" Harjes: Yeah. You also have that dividend yield that, at this point, is looking kind of insane. I want to say it somewhere around 7%. But, I agree with the hesitation in your voice that says this one is likely to be a falling knife. Campbell: Yeah. Kristine, that dividend yield, though, is based on the trailing, not the forward, I don't think. And now that they've cut the dividend, I don't think it's yielding nearly as much. I don't think it's nearly as attractive on that. Over time, you could get into a situation where cash flow stabilizes, they have a plan to restructure by selling some units, raising some cash. If they can do those kind of things, and cash flow grows again, maybe the dividend starts increasing, and that will be one of the key drivers that makes the stock go much higher. But, it's a very high risk-reward stock in my opinion. Harjes: Absolutely. That'll do it for today's show.

John Mauldin,09142017,MarketWatch,09072017,"Published: Sept 12, 2017 10:45 a.m. ET Be prepared for the imposition of a value-added tax By There is a big debate over the exact amount of global debt. Parts of it get hidden in many out-of-the-way pockets. But, broadly speaking, global debt is about 325% of gross domestic product (GDP), and likely over $225 trillion as I write this. Global debt is growing faster than global GDP This chart from McKinsey & Co. is almost three years old, but it shows the growth of debt over time, and we know that global debt has ballooned by about $26 trillion in the past two years. The above chart requires a few observations. First, notice that the growth of household and financial debt has decelerated. Corporate debt continues to grow at roughly the same pace as before. The real acceleration of growth in debt is coming from government borrowing. Second, we are on pace to grow the debt by significantly more between 2014 and 2021 than we did in the previous seven years. Last, global debt is growing faster than global GDP. We are borrowing money faster than we are creating wealth. Lies about the U.S. deficit U.S. government debt is about 100% of GDP, or $20 trillion, and growing around $1 trillion a year. Forget what they say when they talk about budget deficits. They lie, because they don’t want to admit what the true deficit is. Read: The U.S. is now over $20 trillion in debt — here’s how it got there However, you can determine the true deficit simply by looking at the amount of money the Treasury has borrowed at the end of the year and see that another $400 billion-$500 billion of “off-budget” debt has been added. If I ran my regulated investment businesses with the same sort of spurious accounting, the Securities and Exchange Commission and a raft of other agencies would shut me down faster than you can say “MD&A” and ban me forever from participating in the financial industry. As they should. You simply cannot lie when you have the public’s trust at stake. Well, you can’t unless you are Congress and the government. Then you can pass laws that allow you to lie. But I digress. To be able to compare our debt to that of other countries, we have to include state and local debt, which is another $3 trillion. That means total U.S. government debt is 115% of GDP. Japan now serves as the U.S.’s crystal ball That is certainly less than the 250% of debt-to-GDP that Japan finds itself saddled with. But Japan does offer us a clue as to how this will play out. If you had told me 10 years ago that Japan could essentially monetize well over 100% of its GDP and not have its currency fall through the floor, I would have laughed at you. Since the yen didn’t collapse, we start having to look for other causes and effects. Read: China’s 2,000-year path to the top of the economic heap, in one chart When the next recession blows in, it will likely balloon the U.S. government deficit up to $2 trillion a year. The Obama administration took eight years to run up a $10 trillion debt after the 2008 recession. It might take just five years after the next recession to amass the next $10 trillion. Here is a chart my staff created in my free weekly newsletter, Thoughts From the Frontline (subscribe here), using Congressional Budget Office data, that shows what will happen if the next recession comes in 2018 and revenues drop by the same percentage as they did in the last recession (without even counting likely higher expenditures next time). And on top of the $1.3 trillion deficit that this chart predicts, you can add the more than $500 billion in off-budget debt that I mentioned above, plus higher interest rate expense as rates rise. By the early to mid 2020s, barring substantial increases in taxes or reductions in government benefits and entitlements, the deficit will be approaching $2 trillion annually. There will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth. If you are in the top 25% of income earners in the United States, you have a big target painted on your income and wealth. The imposition of a VAT seems almost guaranteed. That is the only real way to boost revenues to offset the increases in entitlement spending. The Republicans don’t want to impose a VAT now as part of major tax reform. But a future Democratic administration and congressional majority will.

Early Thursday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said domestic crude supplies climbed by 4.6 million barrels for the week ended Sept. 1. The rise followed nine-consecutive weeks of declines. Forecasts for the supply data differed somewhat. Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts forecast a rise of 2.7 million barrels for crude stocks, but a survey from The Wall Street Journal showed expectations for a larger rise of 5 million barrels. The American Petroleum Institute reported Wednesday that U.S. crude supplies rose 2.8 million barrels last week. Crude-oil refinery inputs fell by 3.3 million barrels a day last week, to average 14.5 million barrels a day, while refineries operated at just 79.7% of capacity, the EIA said. “We do expect to see [crude] demand destruction not only in the Texas region but also in Florida with the impact of [Hurricane] Irma,” said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors. “We do feel we will continue to see crude oil builds in the weeks to come due to the demand destruction and especially since we are past the summer driving season.” He expects to “continue to see builds [for crude supplies] in the weeks to come as we see refineries slowly come back online and we are also going to refinery maintenance season.” Gasoline stockpiles were down 3.2 million barrels for the week, while distillate stockpiles edged down by 1.4 million barrels, according to the EIA. The S&P Global Platts survey showed forecasts for declines of 4.2 million in gasoline and 1.9 million barrels for distillates, which include heating oil.

Traders were also monitoring the development of Hurricane Irma which is heading toward Florida, where oil and gasoline demand could be affected. GasBuddy has been reporting big shortages of fuel at Florida gas stations ahead of the storm, with 41% of Gainesville stations without gas Thursday afternoon. Read: Hurricane Irma set to squeeze a lot more than just Florida’s oranges “So far, this [Atlantic] hurricane season has certainly had an extraordinary impact on the energy market, but almost exclusively thanks to Hurricane Harvey,” Tyler Richey, co-editor of the Sevens Report, told MarketWatch. “WTI was hit hard in the wake of Harvey’s landfall as a substantial percentage of Gulf Coast refineries were shut, essentially cutting oil demand by between 15% and 20%.” As of late Wednesday, about 12.7% of U.S. refining capacity remained down, according to S&P Global Platts. Separate data from the energy and commodities information provider showed that crude output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fell in August for the first time in five months. The group produced 32.65 million barrels a day in August, down 170,000 barrels a day from July. Natural-gas prices, meanwhile, saw a modest decline after separate EIA data Thursday showed that domestic supplies of the commodity rose by 65 billion cubic feet for the week ended Sept. 1.

                                   are capping costs of flights so that people can evacuate safely. Delta said this week it’s capping airfares for areas affected by the hurricane. On Friday, their airline said it also added more than 5,000 seats and 24 extra flights from San Juan, Miami, Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and Key West since Wednesday. This comes after a Twitter user noted the company was increasing tickets from $547.59 to $3,258.50 for a flight out of Miami. A spokesman from Delta said that, contrary to this report, the airline has not raised any fares in response to the hurricane and that the price hike was related to dynamic pricing on the third-party travel site where the customer was booking the flight. George Hobica, founder of flight booking site Airfarewatchdog.com said the price increases were likely not intentional. “I don’t think airlines would be callous or stupid enough to be consciously jacking up fares,” he said. “If there’s any gouge, it’s just the last minute walk-up airfares that are designed for desperate business fliers.” “As the storm approached we actually reduced the price level of our highest fares (which are typically seen when customers are booking last-minute travel and inventory is limited) to and from cities in its projected path,” he said. American Airlines is also capping pre-tax fares at $99 for main cabin seats on direct flights out of Florida until Sept. 13, a spokesperson told MarketWatch. IT added additional flights from affected areas including St. Maarten (SXM), St. Kitts (SKB), Providenciales, Turks and Caicos (PLS); and San Juan, and Puerto Rico (SJU). JetBlue is capping direct flights out of Florida at $99 for direct flights or a maximum of $159 for connecting flights. “We want those trying to leave ahead of the hurricane to focus on their safe evacuation rather than worry about the cost of flights,” JetBlue spokesman Doug McGraw told Reuters. (JetBlue did not respond to request for comment.) In addition to cheap fares for those in Irma’s path, Frontier Airlines has been offering charitable support for victims of Hurricane Harvey. The company donated $1 of every ticket booked on Wednesday, Sept. 6 to the American Red Cross for hurricane relief efforts. The airline sent relief supplies to Houston on the first flight back to the area after operations were resumed and, for the next week, it is capping all fares to and from Houston at $99 one way. “We are able to make travel affordable in this time of need,” chief operating officer Jim Nides said in a statement. Other U.S. airlines are waiving fees for passengers re-booking flights in Caribbean destinations as well as Florida, including Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines. Under these changes, passengers can alter their itinerary without paying fees that normal amount to $200 or more per passenger. JetBlue shares have fallen 16% in 2017, Delta shares are down 3.7% and United shares have shed 17%.

Let’s start with Europe, the world’s second-largest economy. The European Union is a collection of states that are vastly different from one another. They are separated by culture, language (which impedes labor mobility, resulting in semipermanent labor productivity disparity between countries — think Greece and Germany), economic growth rates, indebtedness and history. European political (EU) and monetary (EMU) unions were great experiments that made a lot of sense on paper. Europe, at roughly the same-size population and economy as the U.S., was at a competitive disadvantage as dozens of currencies embedded extra transaction costs in cross-border trade, and each currency on its own had little chance of competing with the U.S. dollar

Germans were haunted by their past; they had started two world wars in the 20th century, and a united Europe was their way of lowering the risk of future European wars. Economic and monetary union sounded like a logical marriage of all the significant powers of post–World War II Europe, but the arrangement was never really a marriage. It was more like a civil union. EMU members combined their currencies into one, the euro

Read:  The world is becoming desperate about deflation Though treaties put limits on budget deficits (limits that, ironically, Germany was the first to exceed), each country went on spending its money as it wished. Some were relatively frugal (like Germany); others (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) went on spending binges, like newly hitched college students who had just gotten their first credit card, with an irresistibly low introductory rate and a free T-shirt. Now let’s turn to Brexit, the U.K. referendum on exiting the EU. Ironically, the U.K. doesn’t have half the problems that most EU nations are going through. Because it is not part of the EMU, it has retained its currency and its central bank. The U.K.’s main dissatisfaction with EU membership stems from the immigration issue. Because treaties have turned the EU into a borderless union, when Germany accepted refugees from the Middle East and Northern Africa, it basically made a unilateral decision on behalf of all EU members to accept those refugees to all EU countries. High unemployment, wage stagnation and terrorism are now endemic in the EU, and you can see how the U.K.’s citizenry might have a problem with this. After the Brexit vote, the financial media lit up with opinions on its consequences for the EU and the global economy. They’ve varied from “Brexit is a nonevent” to “This is a Lehman moment for the global economy,” referring to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy that almost brought the financial system to a halt in 2008. The arguments on both sides are quite convincing. The argument for Brexit’s being a nonevent is simple and straightforward. The U.K. maintained its currency, and the pound’s

There is a fear that the EU may impose trade sanctions on U.K., not so much to punish the U.K. but to threaten other EU members that exit will come at a stiff economic cost (effectively turning this voluntary club into a prison). However, the U.K. is a net importer of goods from the EU; thus any sanctions will hurt remaining EU members more than the U.K. The Lehman moment argument is less simple, but not unimaginable. Brexit may provide the spark that will ignite already gasoline-soaked ground. Though the EU and EMU were supposed to unite Europeans, they may have had the opposite effect — causing a groundswell of nationalism. In all honesty, Italy is more concerning than the U.K. Italy is the third-largest economy in the EU, and its debt stands at 132% of GDP, second only to Greece (171%). Seventeen percent of Italian bank loans are noncurrent. In the depths of the financial crisis, that number was 5% in the U.S. Italian lenders account for nearly half of bad debt in the EU. If Italy was not part of the EMU, it could just print lire and bail out its banks. But it gave up that luxury when it joined the single currency. To make things worse, in 2014 the EU passed a law that prohibits governments from bailing out their banking systems; thus the shareholders, debtholders, and depositors may bear the brunt of the eventual bailout. Unless the EU passes a new law that bends the 2014 law — or the Italian government takes matters into its own hands, violating EU rules — we may see Italian debtholders and depositors hit with the cost of bank bailouts take to the streets and demand “Italexit.” Nationalism is a highly emotional, zero-sum, us-against-them sort of business. Add immigration concerns on top of economic ones, and it’s not hard to see how Europe has turned into a highly combustible mixture looking for a match. And because emotions are often antilogical, future decisions by EU countries may not necessarily be beneficial to the European Continent. Given that the situation in Europe is so complex and combustible, it’s unclear whether Brexit will be just another match that simply burns out or the one that starts the fire. Will it trigger other exits? Will it slow down EU growth, thus straining an already leveraged system? No one knows. Meanwhile, China is the world’s second-largest economy and is experiencing the largest debt bubble we’ll probably ever see in our lifetimes. From 2007 to 2014, the country’s debt quadrupled, to $28 trillion from $7 trillion. Over the same period, China’s economy grew to $10.5 trillion from $3.5 trillion. These numbers are staggering and point to one indisputable fact: All Chinese growth since 2007 has come from borrowing. There was no miracle in it. But it gets worse, much worse. The numbers also show that every $1 of new debt brought only pennies of GDP growth. In the absence of skyrocketing debt, the Chinese overcapacity bubble, which was already fully inflated pre-2007, would have burst years ago. As the government continues to engineer growth by borrowing, every yuan of debt will bring less growth. The laws of economics have not been suspended in China. American economist Herbert Stein’s law states that things that cannot go on forever, won’t. When its debt bubble bursts, China will become a headwind for global growth. This brings us to Japan. It is the most-indebted developed nation in the world, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 230%. Japan is the proof of Stein’s law — its economy is still suffering a hangover from what at the time seemed like an endless real estate party (bubble) that lasted from the mid-1980s into the early 1990s. Japan has been on the quantitative easing and endless stimulus bandwagon longer than anyone else and has nothing (except a lot of debt) to show for it. Japan also has the oldest population in the world — 26% of its people are older than 65 (in the U.S. the figure is 15%). Rising debt and an aging population are a double negative for the economy, as debt per capita is rising at an even faster rate than total debt. And since the working population is declining at an even faster rate than the population as a whole, debt per working person is growing at an even faster rate. Given this reality, you might think Japan is paying the highest interest rates in the world, perhaps somewhere in the high teens. Wrong. The Japanese 10-year goverment bond carries a negative yield. This is an overview of the challenging environment facing investors around the world. It’s evident that stock market performance has not been driven by the improving health of the global economy. Just as negative interest rates are not a positive for the continued health of the economy, current stock market performance does not augur rosy future returns for stocks. In fact, the opposite is true. So, how does one invest in this overvalued market? Our strategy is spelled out    in this fairly lengthy article.

Andrea Riquier,09142017,MarketWatch,09072017,"Published: Sept 8, 2017 5:23 p.m. ET ‘A catastrophic storm that this state has never seen,’ Florida governor warns residents By Winds from Hurricane Irma, already the most powerful Atlantic hurricane on record, on Friday picked up speed as it barreled toward Florida, prompting Gov. Rick Scott to urge all Floridians to evacuate. “Based on what we know, the majority of Florida will have major hurricane impact and deadly winds,” Scott said in a news conference. “We expect this along the entire East Coast and West Coast.” At 5 p.m. Eastern, Irma was about 345 miles southeast of Miami, with winds reaching speeds of 155 miles an hour, according to the National Hurricane Center. The hurricane was projected to reach the Florida Keys and southern tip of the peninsula by Sunday morning. Hurricane Jose was right behind it. The first hurricane hunter plane to make contact with Jose, on Friday morning, found it “much stronger than previously estimated,” the National Hurricane Center said. The hurricane, which is smaller than Irma but packing winds that are blowing just as fast, is forecast to pass near or east of the Leeward Islands by Saturday. Multiple counties issued mandatory evacuation orders spanning their entire county, including St. Johns, Nassau, Glynn, Camden, Atlantic Beach, and Flagler. “This is a catastrophic storm that this state has never seen,” Gov. Scott said Friday.

Preparations should be rushed to completion.  #Irma pic.twitter.com/eto2KVWtgP Hurricane warnings are in effect for the Florida Keys, Lake Okeechobee, Florida Bay, Jupiter Inlet, and further into central Florida, and states of emergency have been declared in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. President Donald Trump’s seaside Mar-a-Lago resort was also ordered to evacuate beginning Friday morning, along with the barrier islands and low-lying areas of Palm Beach County, the Sun Sentinel newspaper confirmed. Trump has owned the private golf club since 1985. The president has vacationed and conducted business there numerous times early in his presidency, including hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other foreign leaders, sometimes raising controversy over security. Read also:  Hurricane Irma set to squeeze a lot more than just Florida’s oranges Irma has already rampaged through a string of Caribbean islands, leaving at least 19 people dead and many injured. The tiny island of Barbuda of about 1,600 inhabitants has been “totally demolished,” while 95% of St. Martin—a popular destination with U.S. and European travelers—has been destroyed. The Red Cross estimates that at least 1.2 million people have been battered by Irma. Read: Tiny island of Barbuda ‘practically uninhabitable’ in Irma’s devastating wake Trump also owns properties in that region, including a multimillion-dollar mansion on St. Martin that is listed for sale, according to the Miami Herald. It remained unclear what had happened to the property, but French officials said that the four most solid buildings on the island had “suffered serious damage,” making it unlikely Trump’s house had been spared. Puerto Rico narrowly avoided a direct hit as the eye moved northwest about 50 miles offshore, but were still lashed with rains and heavy winds. Nearly 900,000 people were reportedly without power, and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority gave a stunning warning Wednesday that parts of the island could be without electricity for up to six months. Cruise operators have been forced to cancel and reroute sailings, while thousands of flights have been delayed or canceled due to Irma. Read now:  Taking a cruise, flight or hotel room in the path of Hurricane Irma? Here’s what you need to know… Due to #HurricaneIrma, please confirm that your flight is operating before coming to the airport. Many flights have been canceled. Hurricane Jose is on its way to the Caribbean islands of Barbuda, St. Martin and Anguilla, all of which have already taken heavy damage from Irma. A Hurricane Watch is in effect for all three islands, and rainfall of up to 5 inches is expected to maintain or even add to existing flooding. Additionally, Katia, a Category 1 hurricane, is still strengthening in the Mexican Gulf, and now has maximum sustained winds of 105 miles an hour. A Hurricane Warning is in effect for Cabo Rojo to Laguna Verde. The center of the storm will make landfall in Mexico later Friday or early Saturday. “Some intensification” was possible before landfall, followed by “rapid weakening,” the NHC said in its latest advisory. The trio of hurricanes comes just two weeks after Harvey brought widespread destruction to the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast, estimated by AccuWeather to have caused damages of up to $190 billion. If realized, that would make it the costliest-ever U.S. national disaster. But Irma could top that. On Friday, Bryan Norcross, a senior Weather Channel hurricane specialist, called Irma “extraordinary” on his Facebook page. He told The Wall Street Journal that “the odds favor this being the most expensive natural disaster in the history of the United States” in part because of the storm’s size, and because of the population in her path.

                                   meanwhile, slipped 31.10 points, or 0.5%, to end at 6,429.08. A reading on consumer prices, known as the consumer-price index, showed an increase of 0.4% in August, beating consensus estimates for a rise of 0.3%, while first-time jobless claims last week came in at 284,000, versus forecasts for 300,000. Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, said Thursday’s data did little to alter the policy path for the Federal Reserve. Inflation data offered the first read of some of the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which inundated the Houston area and resulted in the shutdown of a trove of crude-oil refineries, driving gasoline prices higher. “CPI was a bit above expectations,” but market participants can’t be surprised that higher gasoline prices and some other expected inputs moved inflation toward the Fed’s 2% target, Warne said. She said the report was “not so strong that it’s likely to change views that the Fed will continue to be cautious and slow in raising interest rates.” Inflation readings have been trending below the Federal Reserve’s target and leading some to question whether the central bank would feel comfortable lifting benchmark interest rates once more in 2017. On Wednesday, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq Composite all gained between 0.1% and 0.2%, finishing at all-time closing highs for a second straight session. The equity market’s continued run to new heights, with the bull market in its ninth year, has raised concerns about lofty stock valuations. “The S&P 500 continues to confound skeptical investors, as it adds to its above-average number of new highs,” said Sam Stovall, CFRA’s chief investment strategist, in a note. The benchmark has scored 33 record closes this year, more than twice the annual average since 1945. However, Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading, said he was sanguine about the outlook for the stock market. “If you look at the market and you look at the backdrop for equities, it is still pretty good right now,” he said. “Yeah, you always could run into this situation where you can have a 5% correction. That is always a possibility,” he said. “But I do not see any major structural issues with the market that could turn into a bear market,” Kepner added, referring to a decline of at least 20%. Read:  Stock market’s 5-month win streak should cheer the bulls Earlier Thursday, North Korea made more threats in response to the latest United Nation sanctions, vowing to sink Japan with a nuclear weapon and “reduce the U.S. mainland to ashes and darkness.” The acerbic rhetoric comes after the U.N. Security Council on Monday unanimously adopted tougher sanctions against North Korea targeting its exports and oil imports. Economic and political news: The Bank of England on Thursday kept its key interest rate on hold and made no changes to its quantitative-easing program, but warned that rates could rise faster than traders currently are pricing in.

On the political front, President Donald Trump and top Democrats appear to be nearing a deal to give legal status to the children of illegal immigrants. Trump tweeted early Thursday that no deal had been reached yet, after Democrats late Wednesday said they had an agreement with him to enact protections for “Dreamers” in exchange for increased border-security measures that don’t include funding for a wall.

Monster Hurricane Irma slammed into Caribbean islands today after making landfall in Barbuda, packing ferocious winds and causing major flooding in low-lying areas. As the rare Category Five storm barreled its way across the Caribbean, it brought gusting winds of up to 185 miles per hour (294 kilometers per hour), weather experts said. PHOTO: AFP. WASHINGTON: Irma has been downgraded to a Category Four hurricane but is still extremely dangerous, the National Hurricane Center said on Friday. The storm raging in the Caribbean which is en route to Florida is now packing maximum sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (250 kilometres per hour), the agency said its 0900 GMT update. Hurricane Irma kills at least eight on French island of Saint-Martin That is down from speeds of 185 mph when Irma was at its peak as a Category Five hurricane.

But, unfortunately, it looks as if it will. For investors, there may be trading opportunities, as shares of some companies may be punished more than they should be. For them, it is important to consider the following three scenarios: • Damage is less than expected • Damage is in line with expectations • Damage is worse than expectations To understand the trading setups, let us start with a chart.

                                   an insurance company that does a lot of business in Florida. The chart shows that the stock has fallen to the first support zone in anticipation of large damages from Hurricane Irma. It also shows the second support zone. It appears that investors are anticipating about $40 billion-$50 billion of insured losses in Florida. As a reference, Hurricane Andrew, which was somewhat similar to Hurricane Irma, caused $15.5 billion of insured losses in 1992. Since 1992, the value of the dollar has fallen and there has been more construction. According to some estimates, if Hurricane Andrew were to hit today, the insured losses would be about $50 billion. From a trading perspective, if the damage is significantly less than anticipated, the stock may not only recover the entire loss, but may go even higher to the zone shown on the chart. The reason is that after the hurricane, insurance companies may be able to raise rates. Furthermore, if the stock starts moving higher, a short squeeze may propel the stock artificially higher than the fundamentals may warrant. Similar reasoning can be used to trade other scenarios. If the damage is less than expected, the pre-hurricane moves will reverse themselves.

If that comes true, then on Monday many of the moves being seen will reverse themselves, and there may be several trading opportunities. The problem with buying or short-selling these stocks and ETFs now is that the storm is not projected to hit until Sunday, when the markets are closed. On Monday these stocks can gap up or down, potentially making a lot of money or losing a lot of money for investors. There is no good way to control risk at this time. That’s why it’s best to wait until Monday, even at the cost of missing any opportunities.

Ann Skeet,09142017,MarketWatch,09072017,"Published: Sept 7, 2017 2:55 p.m. ET U.S. Constitution offers leaders a way to resolve ethical dilemmas By President Donald Trump’s decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and then ask Congress for a law to resolve this thorny immigration issue, underscores an ethical dilemma faced by people in formal leadership roles. It is a common challenge for those in top jobs who have one title but many roles and duties that are, at times, in conflict with one another. How can leaders meet these challenges? The president is the country’s chief legislator, commander-in-chief, chief diplomat, administrator, and magistrate.  The responsibilities are identified in Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution, which states, ""He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."" Some see Trump’s direction to Congress  earlier this week to “legalize DACA,” without recommending his own legislation, as lacking executive leadership. Trump has chosen to place greater weight on his duties as chief magistrate, to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed” than the power he has to recommend new laws. In contrast, former President Barack Obama chose to emphasize his role as chief executive, using an executive order to create DACA and grant a reprieve of the laws as applied to young immigrants he identified as contributors to our country and owed certain rights. It is not uncommon for different people in the same position to emphasize different aspects of their role as a signal of their leadership priorities. Trump’s DACA decision follows through on an oft-stated campaign promise. He is both demonstrating compassion for those affected, and is allowing Congress to play its role by drafting this important immigration legislation. These are all positive elements of ethical leadership. We offer a framework for ethical decision-making at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. It prompts people facing challenging decisions to ask questions to weigh rights and perspectives that can be add odds with one another, drawing on philosophical traditions. These include: Which option produces the most good or does the least harm? Which protects the rights of all who have a stake? Which treats people equally or proportionately? Which best serves the community as a whole? Which leads me to act as the sort of person I want to be? Two additional areas of position and mission can aid leaders faced with such dilemmas, namely:  What do the duties of my position call for me to do, and which interests am I asked to protect?  What is the mission of the organization or group I am leading?  Am I acting in a way that is consistent with that mission? I view this well-known sentence from the Declaration of Independence to be our country’s vision statement, our aspirations for a future ideal:  “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” What about guidance the president and Congress can find in the country’s mission?  Scholars and courts have turned to the Constitution’s preamble as embodying the purpose and principles of our federal government. To me, this serves as America’s mission statement: “We the People, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America.” Presidents take an oath to uphold the Constitution. Can we find additional guidance from the document’s principles? Take the preamble and derive some questions from it, an exercise I recommend for organizations seeking to define ethical behavior and decisions. Does this option offer justice? Is it fair, treating people equally or proportionately? Does this option insure domestic tranquility? Does it keep the peace? Does this option provide for the common defense — keeping our country safe from attack? Does this option promote the general welfare — the health, happiness, and fortunes of a person or group? Does this option secure the blessings of liberty — a freedom from oppressive restrictions for people now and in the future? Congress has other places to turn for direction. Each of the U.S. departments represented in the cabinet has a mission statement.  For example, here’s the mission statement for the Department of Defense: “Create a more secure, democratic and prosperous world for the benefit of the American people and the international community.” If Congress can use questions derived from mission and purpose of both the U.S. and the federal government to address young people currently without immigration status because of decisions made by their parents, then legislation should emerge that garners broad-based support and is signed by the president.

                                   , which makes drones for military and enterprise customers, are up 81% this year and 102% in the past 12 months. That was boosted by a 9% rally after AeroVironment reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings last month. While Chinese drone maker DJI has crushed much of the competition for consumer drones, commercial drone makers are finding success, especially in military and enterprise applications. AeroVironment, which makes drones both for reconnaissance and as lethal weapons, is increasingly turning to small drones, about the size of a water bottle. “The demand for our small UAS products and solutions internationally is strong and continues to be strong,” AeroVironment Chief Executive Wahid Nawabi said during the company’s quarterly earnings call last week. Aerovironment has delivered 30 of its Snipe drones to the U.S. Department of Defense. The 5-ounce, cell phone-sized camera drone has motors so quiet that it is difficult to detect, and is used for reconnaissance. AeroVironment sells its drones to 40 other countries, and this quarter signed contracts with the Australian military and an unnamed Middle East customer. “We are impressed with continued international demand for small UAS,” analysts at Raymond James said in a note last week. Another drone maker focused on enterprise and defense, Israeli-based Airobotics, announced on Thursday that it had nabbed $32.5 million in funding. Meanwhile, China’s DJI has been the subject of controversy recently after a leaked memo indicated that the U.S. Army would discontinue using its drones due to “cyber vulnerabilities.” Some drone service providers have also said their clients will not allow them to use DJI products because of related security concerns. And while DJI has a massive market share in the consumer market, those security concerns could be an opportunity for other drone makers to leap into the commercial side of the market. “Our small UAS solutions are designed to be highly secure and reliable,” AeroVironment’s Nawabi said, in reference to the DJI news. The U.S. Army later clarified that it could continue using DJI drones if the software passes a security check. DJI also followed up on the news by releasing a new flight mode that stops internet traffic to and from the app that operates it, in order to provide enhanced data-privacy assurances for sensitive government and enterprise customers. Nawabi indicated that recent rulings by the Federal Aviation Administration are holding back aspects of the commercial drone market. The FAA currently does not allow commercial pilots to fly at night, over people, or to fly drones beyond their line of sight without special permission. So while a farmer might be able to fly a drone over their farmland, an electric utilities company that has thousands of miles of transmission lines would not be able to legally use a drone. “The FAA will play, and is going to play, a critical role as an enabling factor for the adoption of this market,” Nawabi said. There are more than 60,000 licensed commercial drone operators in the United States, according to the FAA. The FAA said in a statement Wednesday that it “is using a risk-based approach to enable increasingly more complex UAS operations,” but added that current restrictions on commercial drone use would likely be eased.

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican leaders sought to nail down the final votes needed to pass what U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday called their “last best chance” to repeal Obamacare while a new analysis underscored how Democratic-leaning states stand to lose large amounts of federal funding under the legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to bring the bill introduced by fellow Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy to a vote next week, as his party seeks to make good on seven years of promises to erase Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement. With no Democratic support for the bill, Republicans remain a handful of votes short in the Senate, needing 50 votes in a 100-seat chamber they control 52-48, with Pence casting a potential tie-breaking vote. Senator Rand Paul opposes it and at least six others are undecided: John McCain, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan, Rob Portman and Jerry Moran. Asked whether the legislation will pass, Pence said, “We’ll see. We’re close.” Republicans, still reeling from their failure in July to win Senate passage of previous legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, have set a Sept. 30 deadline for passage of this bill. “This may well be our last best chance to stop and turn around and head America back in the direction of the kind of healthcare reform that’s based on individual-choice, state-based innovations,” Pence told Fox New Channel. President Donald Trump has been pushing Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, which would fulfill one of his top campaign promises from last year. The current bill would take money that the federal government now spends on healthcare through the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and subsidies to help Americans buy private insurance and distribute it to the states in block grants. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has not yet assessed the bill’s effects but independent analyses indicate it would fundamentally redistribute federal healthcare money, generally with Republican-leaning states benefiting and Democratic-leaning states losing. The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare research group, estimated on Thursday that states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare would lose $180 billion under the bill from 2020 to 2026, while non-expansion states would gain $73 billion in the same time period. The Graham-Cassidy bill in 2020 would end the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, which many Democratic-governed states had carried out while many Republican-governed states did not, and limit overall federal spending on the five-decade-old program regardless of how many Americans qualify for its benefits. Republicans have called Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, a federal overreach, and say block grants would give states discretion on how to provide healthcare coverage. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, five states would stand to lose more than 30 percent of their federal healthcare money from 2020-2026: New York (down 35 percent), Oregon (down 32 percent), Connecticut (down 31 percent), Vermont (down 31 percent) and Minnesota (down 30 percent). All are Democratic leaning. The analysis found that six Republican-leaning states would get at least 40 percent more in federal funds: Mississippi (up 148 percent), Texas (up 75 percent), Kansas (up 61 percent), Georgia (up 46 percent), South Dakota (up 45 percent) and Tennessee (up 44 percent). In total dollars, the state with the largest forecast loss of funds is California, losing $56 billion. The biggest gainer would be Texas, with a $34 billion increase. California, the most populous U.S. state, is Democratic leaning. Texas is the second most populous state and the largest Republican-leaning one. “It’s absolutely true to say the Graham-Cassidy bill over time levels out on a per-person basis the way we distribute money on healthcare, which I think resonates with most Americans,” Pence said. McCain, Collins and Murkowski were the three Republicans who voted against the last Republican healthcare legislation brought up in the Senate, which failed 51-49 in July. Paul, who voted in favor of that bill after previously expressing misgivings, on Thursday went to Twitter to underscore his criticism that the Graham-Cassidy bill does not go far enough to erase Obamacare. The insurance industry, hospitals, medical advocacy groups such as the American Medical Association, American Heart Association and American Cancer Society, the AARP advocacy group for the elderly and consumer activists have come out against the bill, urging a bipartisan fix to the current law that was abandoned this week. More medical and civil rights advocacy groups lined up against the Graham-Cassidy bill on Thursday, including the American Psychological Association, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the NAACP. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, estimated that the bill would cause more than 30 million people to lose insurance. The Graham-Cassidy proposal would let states opt out of the requirement that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates, causing a furor among advocacy groups that say it could make health insurance unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions.

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"Pfizer said in the suit that J&J is offering discounts on its Remicade treatment in exchange for essentially excluding Pfizer’s drug from insurance coverage, keeping it out of the hands of patients. J&J said in an e-mailed statement that the lawsuit was without merit and that the company is competing on value and price. “To date Pfizer has failed to demonstrate sufficient value to patients, providers, payers and employers,” said Scott White, President of Janssen Biotech Inc, a unit of J&J. J&J signed exclusionary contracts with health insurers, hospitals and doctor groups after U.S. regulators approved it as a reasonable substitute for Remicade in 2016, Pfizer said. Both Aetna and Anthem declined to comment. Other U.S. insurers contacted for this story did not have an immediate comment. Remicade is an infused treatment for chronic autoimmune disorders and costs about $4,000 per dose, or $26,000 a year, Pfizer said in the suit. Its Inflectra rival is priced 19 percent lower than that list price. But Pfizer said it has not been able to reach customers because of J&J’s anticompetitive actions. The suit comes at a time when insurers, consumers and the U.S. government have pushed for lower drug prices, saying double-digit annual price increases are unsustainable. Biosimilars are intended to be lower cost alternatives to expensive biotech medicines. But because they are made from living cells and it is not possible to make an exact copy of the branded medicine, they are not automatically substituted for the existing branded drug the way a generic drug would be. Pfizer said in the lawsuit that J&J’s contracts with many insurers exclusively pay for Remicade and only pay for Inflectra in limited cases where patients “fail first” on Remicade. In return, Pfizer said, J&J pays after-market rebates on both new and existing customers’ Remicade purchases. To make up for the J&J rebates and discounts on this large base of old and new customers, Pfizer said it would need to price Inflectra below its own average variable cost. Pfizer shares were up 1.3 percent, or 45 cents, at $35.90 and J&J shares fell 1.6 percent, or $2.10, to $133.11. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. ","

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is making it more difficult for skilled foreigners to work in the United States, challenging visa applications more often than at nearly any point in the Obama era, according to data reviewed by Reuters. The more intense scrutiny of the applications for H-1B visas comes after President Donald Trump called for changes to the visa program so that it benefits the highest-paid workers, though he has not enacted any such reforms. Data provided by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services shows that between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31, the agency issued 85,000 challenges, or “requests for evidence” (RFEs), to H-1B visa petitions - a 45 percent increase over the same period last year. The total number of H-1B petitions rose by less than 3 percent in the same period. The challenges, which can slow down the issuance of visas by months, were issued at a greater rate in 2017 than at any time in the Obama administration except for one year, 2009, according to the USCIS data, which has not been previously reported. The trend is likely to cheer supporters of Trump’s hardline stance on immigration. They say visas for skilled foreigners undercut American workers by replacing them with low-paid employees shipped in from abroad. But major tech companies, universities and hospitals contend the visas allow them to fill highly specialized jobs for which there are sometimes few qualified Americans. The USCIS inquiries typically challenge the basis of the original petitions and assert that the employers do not qualify for the visas. Employers and their lawyers must then provide further evidence to prove their need and eligibility for the visas. To be sure, the Obama administration also issued a large number of H-1B challenges – nearly 59,000 - from January through August 2016, and a similar number in 2015. Immigration attorneys have for years complained about redundant and burdensome challenges to high-skilled employment visas. But they say they are seeing a new trend in the Trump era. In addition to querying applications more often, the Trump administration is targeting entry-level jobs offered to skilled foreigners. The lawyers say this violates the law governing H-1Bs, because it allows for visa holders to take entry-level jobs. Several attorneys said they view the increase in challenges and focus on entry-level jobs as a stealth campaign by the administration against the H-1B program in the absence of public regulatory changes or changes passed by Congress, which could be debated and decided in the open. “One way to have an immigration policy that’s consistent with the policy that’s been articulated by the Trump administration is to put more scrutiny on H-1B cases,” said Cyrus Mehta, a New York-based immigration attorney. USCIS spokesman Robert C. Langston did not directly address the new trend identified by lawyers or the sharp spike in RFEs this year. In an email, he said the agency is applying “currently existing policy that interprets existing statutory and regulatory requirements to evaluate petitions.” Partners HealthCare is a healthcare system that includes Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, two prestigious teaching hospitals for Harvard Medical School. It has received more than 50 RFEs from USCIS so far this year, compared to fewer than 15 all of last year in response to a similar number of H-1B petitions, said Anthony Pawelski, an immigration attorney who handles H-1B applications for Partners. USCIS questioned the hospitals’ connection to the university even though their applications included proof of their non-profit status, a 1948 agreement between Harvard Medical School and the hospitals and even text from the hospitals’ website referencing a 200-year history with the university, Pawelski said. “They’re doing anything they can to delay the processing and adjudications and in their mind close any perceived loopholes,” he said. Langston declined to comment on specific H-1B petitions. It is still unclear how the increase in challenges will affect the number of visas issued this year. In the 2016 fiscal year, USCIS approved 87 percent of H1-B petitions. By June 30 of this year, the agency had approved 59 percent of H-1B petitions, although that number is incomplete because it does not take into account the last three months of the 2017 fiscal year, when a large portion of H-1B applications are processed. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have criticized H-1B visas, because the biggest beneficiaries are outsourcing firms, which critics say use the program to fill lower-level information technology jobs and replace American workers. Members of both parties have introduced legislation this year to reform the visa’s use. In an April executive order, Trump directed a review of the H1-B program, aimed at ensuring the visas “are awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid” applicants. The order itself did not implement changes but directed agencies to suggest reforms. “What the Trump administration has done for the first time in a very long time is take seriously the fact that companies are misusing the H-1B system,” said Russell Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, the American branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The group opposes the H-1B program but supports giving more high-skilled foreigners employment-based permanent residence. Many of the government challenges for visas for entry-level jobs either say that the salary should be higher because the job is too complex or that the job does not count as a “specialty” occupation, as required by the H-1B program, according to a review of hundreds of RFEs by the American Immigration Lawyers Association provided to Reuters. Entry-level jobs are positions for fresh university graduates with little or no work experience. Such jobs can pay “Level 1” wages, the lowest of four tiers. “An RFE may be justified if the wage level is not appropriate for the position,” said Langston, the USCIS spokesman. The USCIS data did not specify what positions the RFEs challenged or the reasons for the challenges. Lawyers question the implicit argument advanced by USCIS in the challenges - that specialty jobs cannot be entry-level. They point to young doctors and engineers, for instance, who may not have work experience but have spent years learning technical skills. Though the challenges can come across all industries, the AILA review showed software developers and computer systems analysts were challenged more often than other jobs. Silicon Valley tech giants either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment on whether they had been receiving more RFEs. The requests can increase legal fees associated with each H-1B visa by as much as half, attorneys said. Government fees for H-1B visas can run upwards of $2,500, and standard fees paid to lawyers per application can easily reach $2,000 or more. The increased costs and hassle could discourage employers from hiring such foreign workers especially at junior levels, immigration lawyers said. Jeffrey Gorsky, an attorney with Berry Appelman & Leiden LLP, one of the largest corporate immigration firms in the country, said one of the firm’s clients, a mid-sized tech company, was hit with six RFEs from USCIS in a single day this year. Between late 2015 and the end of 2016, the company received just one RFE on an H-1B visa petition, he said. ","

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chalk one up for the nationalists. Among the many signals that Donald Trump sent in his speech to the United Nations on Tuesday, one was especially clear: former chief strategist Steve Bannon’s White House departure has not muted the president’s “America First” foreign policy instincts. Trump’s eight months in office have been characterized by a sometimes dramatic tug-of-war between “globalists” and “nationalist” advisers who have sought to move the president in myriad ways on issues both domestic and international. Bannon’s exit last month caused some of the former New York businessman’s core supporters to fret that the more multilateral-leaning group inside the administration had gained ground. Not on foreign policy, at least not on Tuesday. Trump’s strident defence of national sovereignty during his debut at the annual U.N. General Assembly showed his campaign-honed policy inclinations very much intact and presented a Trump Doctrine to the world that focused unabashedly on the U.S. homeland. “The chief nationalist in this administration is Donald J. Trump. And he knows what he’s trying to say,” said Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and a Trump supporter. He said the speech showed that Trump had a doctrine that was defined by more than tweets, with roots in the conservative philosophies of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, France’s Charles de Gaulle, and Britain’s Margaret Thatcher. “It’s not a one-sided American nationalism, it’s a re-centring on sovereignty that’s really, really important,” Gingrich said. The speech, in which Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if attacked, divided Trump’s supporters and opponents. Ben Rhodes, an adviser to former Democratic President Barack Obama, said Trump was upending international order with threats of war and attacks on diplomacy. It did not divide Trump’s often warring advisers, however, an administration official said. “It was the most collaborative speech among the senior people in the national security cabinet that the president has given to date,” the official said. He said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stood up after Trump’s speech and shook chief speechwriter Stephen Miller’s hand and said “you did a great job.” Miller is considered a nationalist and an ally of Bannon, while Tillerson is more globally minded. “This was more ... Trump just being Trump,” said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign adviser, adding he thought the nationalist versus globalist tension in the administration played itself out more on domestic policy issues such as immigration policy. The administration has given mixed signals on foreign policy, too. Gary Cohn, the president’s top economic adviser and a member of the so-called globalist wing, had to clarify with U.S. allies this week that Trump still intended to pull the United States out of the Paris climate change agreement unless there were a renegotiation to make it more favourable for U.S. interests. But Trump seemed to stun some people in the United Nations hall, despite his well-known penchant for blunt talk. His speech included a condemnation of the Iran nuclear agreement reached with U.S. allies under Obama, and an observation that some portions of the world were “going to hell”. Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations, said allies would interpret the speech as a sign that Trump was wary of undertaking major commitments around the world. “Neither of the biggest problems, North Korea and Iran, can be solved by an America First, Lone Ranger policy,” he said, adding the speech showed that globalists within his administrations were “throwaways” and that Trump was still driven by nationalism.

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen called on the United States on Friday to withdraw Peace Corps volunteers in an escalating row over accusations that U.S. agents conspired with an opposition leader to plot treason. Hun Sen was responding after the U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh issued a travel warning that urged citizens to show caution amid “anti-American rhetoric by officials”. “Are you scaring Cambodians?” Hun Sen said of the United States in an address to garment workers at factories which export much of their production to the United States. “Are you prepared to invade Cambodia and that’s why you told Americans to be careful? It’s good if you pull out the Peace Corps,” Hun Sen said. The U.S. embassy declined to comment. It has previously dismissed the accusations of collusion with opposition leader Kem Sokha and called for his release. On Friday, the embassy was swearing in 71 new volunteers from the Peace Corps, which sends Americans abroad to help with local projects with the stated goal of promoting mutual understanding. Hun Sen said on Friday that he had ordered an investigation into whether any Americans were involved with Kem Sokha. Opponents of Hun Sen accuse him of arresting Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha and cracking down on independent media and other critics ahead of a general election next year. The evidence presented against Kem Sokha is a video recorded in 2013 in which he discusses a strategy to win power with the help of unspecified Americans. Hun Sen, a close ally of China, has taken a series of measures against U.S. interests this year from ending joint military exercises to expelling a naval aid unit to forcing a U.S.-funded pro-democracy group to leave. On Thursday, Hun Sen said he was suspending cooperation with Washington to find the remains of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. According to the U.S Embassy, more than 500 Peace Corps volunteers have served and worked in Cambodia since 2006, providing English teaching and teacher training as well as community health education. U.S. President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps in 1961 to promote world peace and friendship. ","

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea told a U.N. rights panel that international sanctions imposed on it over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs would endanger the survival of North Korean children. Han Tae Song, Pyongyang’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, was speaking at a hearing of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child late on Wednesday. The panel of independent experts challenged North Korean officials over allegations of forced child labor, sexual abuse and trafficking in North Korea, Pyongyang’s health and education budget, and Internet access for children. Han said North Korea, whose population is 26 million, is a “people-centered socialist country... where protection and promotion of the rights and welfare of the child are given top priority ... There is room for improvement.” But Han said that new sanctions imposed by the United States and the U.N. Security Council over North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile tests were hampering the production of nutritional goods for children and provision of textbooks. “The persistent and vicious blockade and sanctions against the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) are not only hampering the endeavors for the protection and promotion of the rights of the child but also seriously threatening their right to survival,” he said, calling for sanctions to be lifted. The U.N. Security Council has unanimously imposed nine rounds of sanctions on North Korea since 2006, the latest earlier this month capping fuel supplies to the isolated state. Han said that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un - denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump as “Rocket Man” - “personally guides the construction in different parts of the country of schoolchildren’s palaces, children’s hospitals, baby homes, children’s homes, and primary and secondary boarding schools and works with devotion for the well-being of the young generation”. South Korea approved a plan on Thursday to send $8 million worth of aid to North Korea as China warned the crisis on the divided Korean peninsula was getting more serious by the day and the war of words between Pyongyang and Washington continued. The U.N. panel asked how North Korea’s “songbun” (caste system) that ranks citizens based on family loyalty to the ruling dynasty affected children’s access to education, health and food. The North Korean delegation replied that this was an “imaginary concept” invented by hostile forces. Human Rights Watch has called on the rights panel to press North Korea’s delegation on cases of child sexual abuse, which the New York-based group said it had documented. “The (North Korean government) report was silent on the issue of sexual abuse so the delegation was asked to provide data,” read a U.N. summary of the hearing. North Korea’s delegation said that forced child labor did not exist in the country and was banned, and that the maximum duration of young people’s work in agricultural fields was limited to three weeks per year. “In response to a question on the use of the Internet, the delegation explained that there was public control of this medium in order to give preference to access to positive information for children. In addition, all children had access to the (North Korean internal) Intranet,” the summary said. The committee will issue its conclusions on Oct. 4. ","

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States, Britain and other countries opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will not support the reconstruction of the country until there is a political transition “away from Assad,” British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Monday. The “Friends of Syria” group, an alliance of mainly Western and Gulf Arab countries, met in New York on Monday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly at a time when the conflict in Syria, now in its seventh year, appears to be less urgent with attention focused on the North Korean nuclear threat and the fate of the Iran nuclear deal. “We believe that the only way forward is to get a political process going and to make it clear to the Iranians, Russians and Assad regime that we, the like-minded group, will not support the reconstruction of Syria until there is such a political process and that means, as Resolution 2254 says, to a transition away from Assad,” Johnson said. He was speaking after a meeting of about 14 countries that back the Syrian opposition including France, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United States. The U.N. Security Council has adopted a Syria transition road map through a Geneva-led process. Russia joined the war on Assad’s behalf in 2015, turning the momentum in his favour. Assad also enjoys robust support from Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Meanwhile, the moderate Syrian opposition is moribund and the United States has largely stepped back from a leading role in Syrian diplomacy. Earlier this year the Trump administration also halted the CIA’s covert program to equip and train certain rebel groups fighting Assad. Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, David Satterfield, said all those at the meeting agreed that “there has got to be a political process if there is to be any international participation in the reconstruction of Syria.” “The regime and the regime supporters cannot declare a victory solely based on a map and colours of positions on the ground,” Satterfield said. “The reconstruction of Syria depends very much on that credible political process. That political process is focused on Geneva and the role of the United Nations.” The meeting on Monday was in stark contrast to last year’s which took place after a ceasefire deal between the United States and Russia effectively collapsed when an aid convoy was bombed in Aleppo, Syria’s largest city. Aleppo is now in the hands of Assad’s forces and Assad himself is in a much stronger position, thanks to Russian and Iranian support. The last major international attempt to resolve the crisis ended in failure when the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), which included Iran, was cast aside after Syrian government forces retook the rebel stronghold of Aleppo in 2016. Russia, Turkey and Iran have been negotiating separately for months in Astana to try to reduce the violence on the ground by creating de-escalation zones across the country, although those talks do not cover a long-term political solution “We discussed here how to bring it back to the U.N.-led process and Geneva,” Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallström told Reuters. Asked if there was consensus on that, she said “I would say so.” “It’s good if the Astana process leads to de-escalation and a reduction of the violence but it has to lead into the political process.” Earlier on Monday, France warned that the status quo in Syria risked leading to the country’s permanent fragmentation and opening the door to new radical Islamist groups. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters in New York he would hold a meeting with the four other permanent members of the Security Council - Britain, China, Russia and the United States - on Thursday to persuade them to create a contact group to give new impetus to end the seven-year conflict. Le Drian said “realism” dictated that Assad could not stay in power after millions of Syrians had fled the country due to the war, but that it was vital major powers worked together to help revive U.N.-brokered peace talks in Geneva. Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said the French contact group proposal was not discussed at the Friends of Syria meeting. But Riyad Hijab, a prominent Syrian opposition leader, said he told French President Emmanuel Macron that the initiative was important in part because “of American withdrawal and Russia is dominating the entire process. So Mr. Macron’s initiative  is the right way to fix this because it’s vital all five (permanent Security Council members) are involved in the process.” ","

Pret, meanwhile, has built its reputation selling organic coffee and wholesome sandwiches to office workers in Britain and in cities like Hong Kong and New York. Jollibee had been holding talks with an advisor over an offer for Pret, the sources said. They declined to be named as the talks were not public. The sources said Jollibee’s offer could value Pret at over $1 billion, based on its 2016 core earnings of just over 93 million pounds. A successful bid by Jollibee would mark the biggest overseas deals to date by the Flipino company, and potentially one of the biggest ever outbound deals from the Philippines. Jollibee, with a market value of $5.2 billion, operates the largest food service network in the Philippines with 2,700 restaurant outlets, including its eponymous chain of fast food stores with the ubiquitous smiling bee logo. But it has also been expanding across Southeast Asia and beyond, hoping to appeal to lucrative local consumers as well as Filipino expatriates with coffee, donut and noodle offerings. Pret, a chain with more than 400 shops worldwide, has built its reputation selling gourmet baguettes and offerings like wild crayfish-and-rocket sandwiches to office workers, and has since embraced health options like dairy-free coconut porridge. Citing sources, Reuters reported earlier this year that Pret’s private equity owner, Bridgepoint, was preparing for a New York listing later this year. Pret reported 2016 revenues of 776 million pounds ($1.1 billion). Still, the company’s interest in Pret is still at an early stage and it has not yet finalised a valuation or had direct discussions with Pret, one of the sources said. Jollibee declined to comment on Pret but said acquisition of new businesses was part of its growth strategy. “Very few selected companies reach completion‎ of acquisition, while the vast majority of potential targets does not,” Chief Financial Officer Ysmael V. Baysa told Reuters in an emailed response. Baysa said Jollibee had not submitted a formal or informal bid for any company in recent months. Bridgepoint and Pret declined to comment when reached by Reuters. Jollibee’s most recent expansion move was the acquisition in 2015 of a 40 percent stake in Smashburger, a U.S.-based chain, for roughly $100 million, a deal that already marked a shift towards higher end ready-to-grab meals. The unsolicited offer for Pret, however, would also have to compete with the likely valuation from the potential listing. Jollibee’s foreign businesses - including joint ventures in China, the United States and Vietnam - account for 30 percent of its system-wide global sales. That is a measure of all sales to consumers both from company-owned and franchised stores. Pret would mark a more dramatic step, however, given its network of more than 400 shops globally, with the majority based in the United Kingdom. Bridgepoint bought the Pret chain at the height of the buyout boom in 2008 for 500 million euros ($539 million). ($1 = 0.7362 pounds) ($1 = 51.1630 Philippine pesos) ","

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia on Thursday defended its anti-narcotics efforts after U.S. President Donald Trump said he considered downgrading the country in a White House assessment because of an uptick in the cultivation of coca, the base ingredient for cocaine. Tens of millions of dollars in development and security funding and logistical help could be in danger should the United States decide the South American country is not doing enough, and such a decision could even jeopardize Colombia’s access to monies from multilateral organizations. The two countries have long been close allies in the fight against illegal narcotics but in recent years have broadened the focus of their relationship to include trade and Colombia’s peace process with leftist guerrillas. However, Trump said this week he had contemplated declaring in the White House’s annual review of countries it considers hubs for narcotics trafficking that Colombia is not meeting its drug fight obligations because of decade-high coca production. The government of President Juan Manuel Santos took issue with Trump’s statement. “Colombia is without a doubt the country which most has fought drugs, and which has had the most success on that front,” the government said in an early morning statement. “No one has to threaten us to confront this challenge.” In the last seven years, the country has confiscated 1,621 tonnes of cocaine, the statement said. The United States has expressed its worry about a sharp uptick in coca cultivation and cocaine production at the close of last year, after Colombia signed a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), its largest rebel group, and halted the spraying of powerful herbicide glyphosate over health worries. Coca cultivation was up to 188,000 hectares (464,000 acres), while cocaine production capacity climbed to 700 tonnes annually, the highest figures for at least a decade. Colombia is counting on more than $400 million in funding help from the United States for implementing the FARC deal and has rejected the possibility of restarting fumigation with glyphosate, something Washington has backed. Instead, Colombia favors manual eradication and crop substitution in concert with rural communities, as agreed upon in the FARC deal. The country is planning to manually eliminate 50,000 hectares of coca. Rebel groups, right-wing paramilitaries and crime gangs have all been involved in drug trafficking during Colombia’s five-decade conflict, which has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions from their homes.

Dan Mangan,09212017,CNBC,09142017,"Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday said the Trump administration fully supports a last-ditch Senate bill to gut and replace Obamacare — but 10 governors of both parties immediately afterward called on Senate leaders to not even consider that legislation. The dueling views came as the clock kept ticking toward to a Sept. 30 deadline for passage of the Graham-Cassidy bill, which would effectively replace the Affordable Care Act. Republicans, who have 52 seats in the Senate, continue to struggle to cobble together the 50 votes they need in that chamber to pass the bill. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Tuesday did not commit to holding a vote on the bill before the end of the month, a sign of the political difficulty it faces. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of the bill's sponsors, told reporters that if Republicans passed the legislation it would ""stop a march toward socialism."" Graham warned that if the bill fails, the nation would move closer to adopting a single-payer health system of the kind called for last week by Sen. Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist from Vermont. ""Here's the choice for America: socialism or federalism when it comes to your health care,"" said Graham, whose bill would block grant federal funds to individual states to craft their own health coverage systems. But Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Graham-Cassidy is ""a bill to end Medicaid as we know it."" Schumer said individual Republicans are ""ashamed"" of the bill, and are trying to ram it through Congress without a traditional set of hearings and without a full analysis of its effects by the Congressional Budget Office because ""they're afraid to find out what it actually does"" to Americans. Pence said he was set to tell Republican senators at a lunch Tuesday that the House of Representatives will reject any legislation to prop up individual insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act. But the 10 governors — Republicans, Democrats and an independent — called on the Senate to pass exactly that kind of insurance market stabilization legislation. A Senate committee led by Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., has been considering a series of measures to prop up Obamacare markets, including by guaranteeing the continuation of federal subsidies paid to insurance companies in exchange for discounts in customers' out-of-pocket health costs. Pence's comments came aboard Air Force Two as it flew to Washington from New York, with Graham aboard. On Monday night, Pence told a pool reporter aboard the flight that President Donald Trump called Graham to encourage him, and to say the bill must be passed by Congress. When Graham said he had gained a new appreciation for the president's tenacity, Pence quipped, ""You're learning."" Pence said he planned to tell senators Tuesday, ""This is the moment. Now is the time"" to pass an Obamacare repeal bill. Pence said he also would make clear that Obamacare is collapsing and that the House will not support any efforts to either fix or bolster that health-care law. ""We have 12 days,"" Pence added, referring to deadline for passing the Graham-Cassidy legislation under the terms of the reconciliation process being used to get the bill approved with just 50 senators voting for it. The vice president said that he and Graham have been lobbying senators on the phone to support the bill. Pence said he has even called Sen. Joe Manchin, the Democrat from West Virginia, to ask him to vote for the legislation. However, no Democrat or independent in the Senate is expected to vote for a repeal bill. The duo also has reached out to governors to ask for their support, particularly Alaska's Bill Walker, who has said he is worried about the bill leading to Medicaid cuts. The independent Walker, it turned out, was one the 10 governors who signed a letter Tuesday asking the Senate to reject Graham-Cassidy. At one point during the conversation, Pence left the cabin of the plane to speak with Trump. Graham told the pool reporter that he has struck an unlikely partnership with Steve Bannon, the recently fired Trump advisor, whom he referred to as ""Darth Vader,"" to push the health-care bill. ""I have got Alan Greenspan, Jeb Bush and Steve Bannon"" behind the bill, Graham said. ""If anyone can do better I'd like to meet them."" The letter Tuesday to McConnell and Schumer was signed by the governors of Ohio, Colorado, Montana, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Louisiana, Nevada, Massachusetts and Vermont, as well as by Alaska's Walker. ""As you continue to consider changes to the American health care system, we ask you not to consider the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson amendment and renew support for bipartisan efforts to make health care more available and affordable for all Americans,"" the letter said. ""Only open, bipartisan approaches can achieve true, lasting reforms,"" the governors wrote. ""We ask you to support bipartisan efforts to bring stability and affordability to our insurance markets. Legislation should receive consideration under regular order, including hearings in health committees and input from the appropriate health-related parties."" ""Improvements to our health insurance markets should control costs, stabilize the market, and positively impact coverage and care of millions of Americans, including many who are dealing with mental illness, chronic health problems, and drug addiction."" Schumer, in his own remarks to reporters Tuesday, blasted Graham's bill, which he called even more ""dangerous"" than prior Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare. Schumer said if Graham-Cassidy becomes law ""millions will lose coverage,"" there will be no guarantees of affordable coverage for people with pre-existing health conditions, and would cripple Medicaid. Earlier Tuesday, the American Medical Association and the National Council for Behavioral Health joined a host of other health-care groups that have announced their opposition to the bill. ""We believe the Graham-Cassidy Amendment would result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance coverage, destabilize health insurance markets, and decrease access to affordable coverage and care,"" wrote AMA Executive Vice President and CEO Dr. James L. Madara in a letter to Senate leaders. ""We sincerely urge the Senate to take short-term measures to stabilize the health insurance market."" In a letter to all senators on Tuesday, AARP, the leading lobbying group for older Americans, said it opposed the bill ""on behalf of our nearly 38 million members"" because it would not help make premiums more affordable, lower out-of-pocket costs, and offer coverage they can count on. ""Overall, the Graham/Cassidy/Heller/Johnson bill would increase health care costs for older Americans with an age tax, decrease coverage, and undermine preexisting condition protections,"" the group wrote. ""In addition, this bill would jeopardize the ability of older Americans and people with disabilities to stay in their own homes as they age and threaten coverage for individuals in nursing homes.""

I appreciate it. And I'm greatly honored to host this lunch, to be joined by the leaders of Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Nambia, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, and South Africa. In particular, I want to thank President Condé, who is representing the African Union. Thank you. Thank you. In this room, I see partners for promoting prosperity and peace on a range of economic, humanitarian, and security issues. We hope to extend our economic partnerships with countries who are committed to self-reliance and to fostering opportunities for job creation in both Africa and the United States. Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich. I congratulate you. They're spending a lot of money. But it does — it has a tremendous business potential and representing huge amounts of different markets. And for American firms it's really become a place that they have to go — that they want to go. Six of the world’s ten fastest-growing economies are in Africa. Increasing American trade and investment across diverse industries — including agriculture, energy, transportation, health care, travel, and tourism — will further transform lives throughout the continent. Secretary Tillerson and the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation are already considering an investment worth hundreds of millions of dollars in Côte d’Ivoire, which has made impressive economic reforms. Really, you've done a tremendous job. We also hope that African firms — like the company Sasol — consider making investments in the United States. Sasol, as an example, is building a $9 billion petrochemical plant in Louisiana, which will bring new jobs to the state and, really, hard-working Americans will be manning those jobs. But we cannot have prosperity if we're not healthy. We will continue our partnership on critical health initiatives. Uganda has made incredible strides in the battle against HIV/AIDS. In Guinea and Nigeria, you fought a horrifying Ebola outbreak. Nambia’s health system is increasingly self-sufficient. My Secretary of Health and Human Services will be traveling to Africa to promote our Global Health Security Agenda. Yet, we know that our prosperity depends, above all, on peace. The United States will partner with the countries and organizations, like the African Union, that lead successful efforts to end violence, to prevent the spread of terrorism, and to respond to humanitarian crises. I commend your troops currently serving in the field. Very brave. Very, very brave what they’re going through. As you well know, too many people are suffering from conflict in Africa. In the Central African Republic, the Congo, Libya, Mali, Somalia, and South Sudan, among others, they’re going through some very, very tough and very dangerous times. Terrorist groups, such as ISIS, al-Shabab, Boko Haram, and al-Qaeda also threaten African peace. The United States is proud to work with you to eradicate terrorist safe havens, to cut off their finances, and to discredit their depraved ideology. And a number of you have told me — actually, last night — that we’ve been doing a very good job over the last six or seven months in particular. We're closely monitoring and deeply disturbed by the ongoing violence in South Sudan and in the Congo. Millions of lives are at risk, and we continue to provide humanitarian assistance. But real results in halting this catastrophe will require an African-led peace process and a sincere — really sincere commitment of all parties involved. And I know you’re working on that, and you’re working on that very hard. To assist in these efforts, I'm sending Ambassador Nikki Haley to Africa to discuss avenues of conflict and resolution and, most importantly, prevention. Lastly, I want to discuss our partnership against a global challenge. Today, the world faces an enormous security threat from North Korean regime. We must all stand together and be accountable in implementing United Nations sanctions and resolutions in response to North Korea’s hostile and menacing actions. We believe that a free, independent, and democratic nation, in all cases, is the best vehicle for human happiness and success. Thank you for joining me for this critical discussion of the challenges and the opportunities facing our nations. Africa, I have to say, is a continent of tremendous, tremendous potential. The outlook is bright. I look forward to hearing from you and your advice during the meal. I thought rather than just eating, we’ll have long discussions — and I look forward to that very much. But I also look forward to getting to know so many of you, and so many of you I do know. And it’s an honor. It’s an honor. And I really want to congratulate you — growing very fast economically and in every other way. You’ve done a terrific job, you’ve had some tremendous obstacles placed in your path, but you have done, really, an absolutely incredible job. So I want to thank you, and I look forward to our discussion. Thank you. Thank you all very much. (Applause.) ","Trump's puzzling speech to African leaders, annotated - The Washington Post"
Christina Wilkie,09212017,CNBC,09142017,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday was met with silence when he congratulated the leaders of African countries on the continent's economic progress, telling them, ""I've so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich. I congratulate you. They're spending a lot of money."" Trump delivered the remark at a luncheon he hosted with the leaders of many of the 54 diverse nations on the African continent. And while Trump almost certainly meant it as compliment, and even seemed to pause for applause, not one attendee clapped. For centuries, Europeans and Americans have exploited Africa's natural resources and labor force, not least during the trans-Atlantic slave trade. In the post-Colonial era, the U.S. government has supported dozens of authoritarian regimes on the African continent, while American companies have made billions of dollars from deals with dictatorships. Since taking office in January, Trump has nominated ambassadors to only around a dozen African nations, despite having recalled all Obama-era ambassadors before he was inaugurated. This means that the vast majority of nations on the continent do not currently have a U.S. ambassador with whom they can conduct bilateral diplomacy. During the same speech, Trump also mispronounced Namibia as ""Nambia,"" saying very clearly that ""Nambia's health system is increasingly self-sufficient."" A White House transcript confirmed that Trump meant to say Namibia. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

Christina Farr,09212017,CNBC,09142017,"Karl Kaufmann, an emergency room physician at Washington's Valley Medical Center, spends a lot of time at the end of a shift doing administrative work, like typing words and checking boxes into electronic medical records. But recently, he's been testing out a virtual medical scribe called SayKara. SayKara was developed by a group of former employees from companies like speech recognition giant Nuance and Amazon. The team is based in Seattle and is launching this week after several years quietly developing the technology and securing a $2.5 million seed round from local investment firm Madrona Venture Group. ""I use SayKara in two ways, both to recap a patient visit and to incorporate the pertinent details of a patient interaction into the medical record,"" said Kaufmann. Similarly to Amazon Alexa, SayKara starts working when a physician says a hot word, like ""OK Kara"" or taps on the app that runs on iOS devices, including iPhone and iPad. Kaufmann was one of the first to try out SayKara, which aims to be an alternative to human scribes and existing dictation tools like Nuance's Dragon. The goal is to accurately transcribe audio to text, parse the information to make it structured, and insert it cleanly into an electronic health record. Voice is rapidly becoming big business in health care, as medical systems look for new ways to help doctors focus on the patient interaction, rather than the computer. Studies have shown that doctors today spend about a quarter of their time on the patient visit, with nearly half on desk work and charting in the electronic health record. As a result, hospitals are already tinkering with Amazon's voice technology Alexa. And businesses like Augmedix are leveraging Google's Glass hardware to offer electronic health record support with a remote scribe. But SayKara says it's taking a different approach. Unlike Amazon, it is narrowly focused on the health-care space. And unlike more established competitors like Augmedix, it doesn't rely on human transcribers, which are expensive and take months to train. SayKara CEO Harjinder Sandhu says the first inspiration for the technology was Amazon Alexa, but that the team realized early on it needed to focus on the needs of the medical sector to get it right. In order to sell to hospitals, SayKara needs to meet compliance, security and privacy requirements, and ensure that it doesn't make seemingly small mistakes that can actually have an enormous effect (a difference is ""hypo"" versus ""hyper""). ""The hurdles in health care are very high,"" admits Sandhu. But Sandhu believes that the current technology is good enough for physicians to use. ""We're taking the state of the art in speech recognition and machine learning and we're applying it,"" he explained. ""The key is to couple it with deep knowledge of how physicians work and the information that is relevant to them."" The company hasn't figured out a price yet, but Sandhu maintains that it cost a fraction of a human scribe. Ralph Pascualy, former CEO of Swedish Medical Group, is one of the first to sign up to use the tool. In his view, so much of his doctors' time is wasted in medical records that any company that can eat ""even halfway into the problem"" is worth the cost. He also appreciates SayKara's approach in not claiming to replace doctors, but to help them with specific challenges. ""Unlike some AI tools, this company isn't attempting to boil the ocean,"" he said. ""I think physicians will be more comfortable with that."" ",SayKara building Amazon Alexa for health care
 ,09212017,CNBC,09142017,"The long-term battle on trade between the U.S. and China shows no sign of ending as a war of words ensued this week between the two. First, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer called China an ""unprecedented"" threat, because of the ""sheer scale of their coordinated efforts to develop their economy, to subsidize, to create national champions, to force technology transfer and to distort markets."" Then China countered, repeating its long-held stance that the bilateral relationship is good for both sides. ""The nature of China-U.S. trade relations is mutually beneficial,"" said Lu Kang, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry. ""China and the U.S. should work together to uphold authority of the WTO rules."" China refuses to be ruffled by what the U.S. has to say, as Beijing is more keen than ever to maintain stability ahead of a major leadership shuffle in a few weeks' time. But the U.S. doesn't look like it plans to simmer down anytime soon, especially as President Donald Trump is expected to visit China later this year and the two sides prepare to sit down at the negotiating table. The trade deficit between the world's two largest economies is in excess of $300 billion a year, something many critics have pointed to as evidence of an unbalanced relationship. China, meanwhile, counters that ""many U.S. products are not favored by Chinese,"" according to an editorial in state media Global Times. ""But China still imports them for its trade balance. Some terribly produced Hollywood movies have profited handsomely on the Chinese market."" It's a tricky line to toe for Beijing — middle-class Chinese consumers have clamored for foreign products in the wake of many food and health safety scares over the years. And the government restricts the number of foreign films that can be released in China each year. But never mind all that: Clearly, the message China wants to send is that it's not a one-sided relationship. ""Washington doesn't need to act as if it has been taken for a ride,"" wrote the nationalistic Global Times. The official media goes on to point that China bought U.S. Treasury bonds for the sixth straight month in July, becoming again the largest holder of U.S. debt, which it says is ""the epitome of mutually beneficial trade relations."" It also said Lighthizer's comment that China unfairly subsidizes companies to create national champions was ironic in light of Trump's ""America First"" campaign. Still, the Trump administration continues to pressure China. A few weeks ago, the U.S. launched an investigation into Chinese intellectual property theft under ""Section 301"" of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, a tactic that is rarely used and could see the U.S. take retaliatory action within a year.

"Douglas Quenqua, special to CNBC.com",09212017,CNBC,09142017,"As a social worker with 30 years' experience working in hospice care, Christina Ingenito expected to face death gracefully when her time came. But when a breast cancer diagnosis at 59 left this once ebullient woman ""severely clinically depressed"" — her words — she turned to an unusual research project for help. In 2016, Ingenito became one of 18 subjects in the first-ever FDA-cleared study to explore the therapeutic effects of MDMA — commonly known as ecstasy — on people with life-threatening illnesses who are suffering from depression. After four standard (i.e., sober) therapy sessions with the two psychologists leading the study, Ingenito embarked on three ""medicine journeys,"" as she calls them: marathon eight-hour therapy sessions fueled by capsules of MDMA. ""Incredible"" is how she describes the experience now. ""From the very first moment that I felt the medicine in my body, it radically transformed all the trauma that I had been holding, not only from the diagnosis but previously from my life as well. My anxiety is gone; the depression is gone; my life force is back."" Today she is free from both cancer and depression. Depression now affects 16 million Americans and 350 million adults worldwide, according to the NIMH, making it one of the most common disabilities in the world. But even with more than 20 antidepressants approved by the FDA over the past 60 years, many people still struggle with the condition: One-third of Americans simply don't respond to any of the currently available medicines, studies say, and there hasn't been a significant breakthrough in decades. As the years of desperation mount, doctors are finding themselves turning to new and unexpected sources for the next big antidepression drug. Though there is no shortage of antidepression drugs currently available, analysts believe there is still plenty of opportunity in the nearly $17 billion global market. The notion that a ""party drug"" like MDMA could be used for more than recreation may have been out of fashion for many years, but it's not a new idea. Before it was outlawed in the 1960s, LSD showed promise as a treatment for depression and alcoholism. Dr. Phillip Wolfson, an author of Ingenito's study, was one of several mental health professionals experimenting with MDMA as a therapy aid in the early 1980s before it was outlawed. But a combination of prohibition and social stigma rendered it nearly impossible to get government permission, much less funding, to perform any sort of research with such drugs. Now a handful of studies — and the persistent researchers behind them — are pointing to a future where drugs like LSD, MDMA, ketamine and psilocybin (the active ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms) could find a second life not just as therapeutic aids but as potential blockbusters. More from Modern Medicine:Scientists invent a pen that identifies cancer in 10 secondsScientists narrow down the risk factors that can cause autism
Insurers, doctors battle over new heart disease drugs ""MDMA has a blockbuster aspect in many, many areas,"" said Dr. Wolfson in a telephone interview. ""It could be used for PTSD, depression, couples' work, relationship work and probably OCD."" The evidence, he claims, is in the studies now being published. Though results of Ingenito's study are still being analyzed, preliminary data suggests the MDMA sessions dramatically alleviated depression in the subjects. That follows an earlier study that tested MDMA as a treatment for PTSD in which 80 percent of subjects no longer suffered from the condition after just two sessions. Early studies with psilocybin have been similarly encouraging. In a 2016 NYU study looking at whether the drug could alleviate anxiety and depression in cancer patients, more than 80 percent of subjects reported significant improvements. A smaller  2012 study yielded similar results. Ketamine — which goes by the street name Special K — has been studied more than most illicit drugs, thanks to its legal status in the United States as a tranquilizer (usually for animals). And results have been so encouraging that both Allergen and Johnson & Johnson currently have ketamine-inspired antidepressants in late-stage clinical trials. Of course, ketamine and MDMA are powerful drugs with serious side effects that would need to be managed. Ketamine's paralyzing effect can be so powerful, it's often classified as a date-rape drug, and users sometimes asphyxiate because they can't clear their own airwaves. MDMA can induce symptoms resembling a panic attack — sweating, nausea, chills, involuntary teeth clenching — and is occasionally associated with heat stroke.  Due to the risks, there is a clinical study under way at Stanford University to test if ketamine acts like an opioid. Promising as the research on some illicit drugs is, scientists caution that many of these treatments are still years away from commercial availability, and the testing itself is, in many cases, still in its infancy. For example, a team of researchers in the U.K. last year became the first ever to produce images of the human brain on LSD — a remarkable fact, considering how widely the drug has been consumed over the past 50 years. But the obstacles to working with the drug were simply too great, said Professor David Nutt, a neuropsychopharmacologist at Imperial College and an author of the study. ""The illegal status of LSD meant that researchers were scared, and the costs of complying with the regulations were prohibitive, and governments wouldn't fund the research because the drugs were illegal."" Still, the results of the scans strongly suggested that LSD could help treat depression in much the way psilocybin does. ""It switches off regions of the brain that are overactive in depression,"" Nutt said. It also disrupts communication between certain sections of the brain, producing an ""ego dissolution"" that helps users feel more connected to the world around them. Such results are going a long way toward easing the path for researchers who want to explore these drugs. As is the existence of groups like MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies), which has helped secure private funding for much of the research on these drugs — a notoriously difficult endeavor given the stigma surrounding them.

"Andrew Zaleski, special to CNBC.com",09212017,CNBC,09142017,"Gary Foster was in his 50s when his eyesight started to fail. The native Canadian eventually lost all central vision in both his eyes a few years ago as a result of age-related macular degeneration. Place a peanut on a table, and Foster won't be able to see it; if he turns slightly and uses his peripheral vision, he might catch a glimpse of it. He can't see people's faces or read text on a page. After he lost his central vision, he lost his license. After he lost his license, he lost his job, since it required him to drive. ""There is no cure. All I ever heard from the doctor is, 'Sorry, there is nothing we can do for you,'"" said Foster, now 63. But several years ago Foster happened upon a piece of technology at a public exhibition in Calgary. It was a pair of glasses called eSight, and when he put them on, he realized that his vision drastically improved, so much so that he could see faces and read books. ""When I first put it on, I was able to read to the bottom of the eye chart,"" Foster said. Foster is not the only visually impaired person turning to new technologies to either improve vision or assist with everyday tasks. A growing cohort of companies, like eSight, offer visual tools that can enhance vision — making things bigger, brighter and bolder so that they're able to be visible to people like Foster. Other companies, like San Diego-based Aira, connect people to real-time support services that — thanks to devices such as Google Glass — can see what the blind can't and navigate users interacting with, for example, a vending machine by talking to them over the phone. Founded in 2006 by Conrad Lewis, a computer engineer with two legally blind sisters, Toronto-based eSight developed its own pair of proprietary glasses, backed by a decade of in-house research. The company keeps many specifics under wraps. According to communications director Jeffrey Fenton, eSight is ""backed by tens of millions of dollars,"" and there are ""thousands of stories that showcase"" people using eSight. The company released its latest pair of glasses, eSight3, last February. The glasses, which look like a visorlike headset, are rechargeable and good for eight hours on a single charge. Each houses a high-speed, high-definition camera that captures what the user is looking at. The device uses algorithms to enhance the video feed and displays the video through eSight's OLED screens in front of the user's eyes. Almost immediately, the cameras enhance the footage that beams across two screens, one in front of each eye. A 24-times zoom also helps out. The wearable headset has Wi-Fi and HDMI capabilities to stream digital content, and it can send pictures and videos. Each person who wears the glasses are able to control color, contrast and magnification. The result is that many people who use the eSight3 today are able to read books and street signs, see objects from far away and know what their friends' and relatives' faces actually look like. More from Modern Medicine:It sounds futuristic, but it's not sci-fi: Human organs-on-a-chip Glasses like the eSight3 are good for people suffering from any one of about a dozen eye conditions, among them Stargardt disease, optic atrophy, macular degeneration and some forms of glaucoma. According to the National Federation of the Blind, roughly 10 million Americans are blind or visually impaired, and about 1.3 million of that number are legally blind, defined as central vision acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye. ""It works for the overwhelming majority of the legally blind,"" Fenton said, who added that its oldest user is 97. The youngest user: four years old. The main problem with technology like eSight is the cost. ""There's still a major group of people out there who want but cannot afford the technology,"" Fenton said. Foster purchased his own eSight glasses for $15,000 out of pocket. The eSight 3, the new version of glasses, costs less, with a price tag of $9,995. Paying for this kind of technology when you're blind can be difficult, as the costs are often not covered by health insurance. ""The technology becoming available is phenomenal, and most people won't be able to get their hands on it,"" said Mindy Jacobsen, first vice president of the National Federation of the Blind of New York. Each year, the overall tally of low-vision or blind people in the United States increases by 75,000, according to the NFB. But 70 percent of working-age blind adults are unemployed. Medicare and health insurance companies determine whether eyesight technology is going to be reimbursable or covered at all. Historically, most insurance companies have seen glasses as something different from the correction of a medical problem, according to Melissa Chun, director of the Vision Rehabilitation Center at the Los Angeles-based Stein Eye Institute. For example, prosthetics technology for a person with a missing limb is classified as durable medical equipment and is therefore covered by insurance. Vision-assisted equipment, almost universally, are classified as glasses, which are not covered by insurance. ""This technology is wearable tech and video magnification, really, a whole different route for people with low vision. And it's really more appropriate to call it vision-assisted equipment rather than anything else,"" Chun said. ""It can be perceived as a form of discrimination, actually, if [insurance companies] don't cover vision-assisted equipment."" The one-time cost of equipment like eSight contrasts with other pricing models. Aira, founded in 2015 with $15 million in venture capital from firms including New York City's Lux Capital, employs 70 agents throughout the United States who are available daily from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. EST who provide over-the-phone instructions to people with low vision or blind vision. Aira users pay for one of four monthly plans and then receive a pair of Google Glasses and an AT&T data plan. ""Users connect to an agent using the phone, and when they connect to the agent, they can yield the camera to the agent,"" said Suman Kanuganti, CEO and co-founder of Aira. ""Our agent is literally living in the world of the blind person whenever a call is coming in."" But a basic plan through Aira costs $89 per month and only gets a user 100 minutes to speak to someone over the phone. So far, Aira counts thousands of users and 3,800 hours of service over the last six months, Kanuganti said. He added that navigation comprises only 20 percent of all calls. ""Users cook; they go to museums to get descriptions of the artwork. Someone read a children's book to a daughter. Someone went to his father's funeral using Aira,"" he said. The NFB's Jacobsen demonstrated using Aira in a recent video produced by CNBC. Again, the main problem with Aira for many users is the cost. The Aira plan with unlimited minutes costs $329 per month. For someone who can only afford the basic, $89 package, they have to judiciously use the 100 minutes they receive every month. Bringing the cost down of making products for those with vision impairments is going to be a matter of scale, Kanuganti said. Companies like eSight, on the other hand, think it's up to large organizations — companies and the government — to be willing to employ people with vision impairments and pay for eyesight technology. ""We continue to believe that society could and should provide this to the blind at low or no cost,"" Fenton said. His company has a financial stake in the matter, but it does put its money where its mouth is: About 20 percent of eSight's own workforce of 100 are legally blind. Foster is one of those employees. He's been working at eSight for the last couple of years, demonstrating the technology at various events throughout Canada. Before he lost his central vision, he was a highways supervisor for Parks Canada in charge of coordinating jobs like snow removal and clearing major accidents from roadways that pass by the Yoho and Banff national parks in the western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, respectively. He lost that job when he lost his vision, since it meant he could no longer drive. While he's still not licensed to drive, Foster said the glasses effectively restore his central vision. He's now able to travel on his own, without his wife's help, and take part in his main hobby of carpentry. ""My wife has normal vision, and she doesn't even try to read prescription bottles anymore. She just hands them to me,"" Foster said. ""It just made me completely independent again."" The effectiveness of the flu shot wanes over time so it's best not to get it too early in the season, according to several recent studies. It takes 10 to 14 days to get the vaccine levels in your system so you are protected. Testosterone replacement therapy is gaining wider use, but there are potential health risks.

"Elizabeth MacBride, special to CNBC.com",09212017,CNBC,09142017,"While President Trump lays out a foreign policy agenda based on nationalism and ""America First"" principles, his daughter Ivanka has taken a different worldview. Three months ago Ivanka Trump stood next to her father and other world leaders at the G20, announcing a plan to bring $1 billion to help women entrepreneurs in emerging markets. The media and the development world scorned, calling it a naked bid for good press and an attempt by world leaders, especially those in Saudi Arabia, to curry favor with the American president through his daughter's pet project. The World Bank quickly downplayed Ivanka's role, and it's unclear how involved she remains. After Ivanka met with Arab women entrepreneurs, money from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates seeded the initiative. But the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative — or We-Fi, as it's called — has spread, with about a dozen other countries, donating a total of $325 million to the financing facility that launched on October 12 to provide funding to women-owned enterprises. But now We-Fi is emerging as an innovative attempt to spur private investment in women's enterprises in countries around the world. There are already signs that insurance companies, venture capitalists and private equity funds are looking more seriously at investing and designing products with an emphasis on including women. The new managing partner at the Abraaj Group's $1.6 billion impact investment arm, Kito de Boer, for instance, said it is considering launching a fund focused on diversity. Ivanka's goals seem to contradict President Trump's. In March he said he wants to cut off the spigot that has helped fund many micro ventures around the world: a little-noticed federal agency called OPIC that is a backstop lender for community banks in developing countries. ""This World Bank fund is very important because it cuts through the politics and diplomacy,"" said Sofana Dahlan, a Saudi lawyer, entrepreneur and government official who met with Ivanka in Saudi Arabia. ""A lot of countries do refrain from helping Saudi women, because they don't want to be politically incorrect."" Ivanka, Dahlan said, may have seized a rare moment when the Saudi government was open to change. ""Saudi Arabia welcomed the idea. It's very important to act on it right away."" We-Fi — which appears to have rapidly folded in some ideas that the World Bank has been studying and experimenting with for the past five years — is different from other financing initiatives for women. While most programs for women have focused on grants and low-interest loans, We-Fi is making the money available for equity investments — meaning venture capital and private equity funds will be able to tap into it — and insurance products. That may give big insurers an incentive to develop products for women in emerging markets. There are only about 60 funds worldwide with a specific focus on investing in women entrepreneurs, based on her research, said Suzanne Biegel, senior gender lens investing adviser at the Wharton Social Impact Initiative, part of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. They have a combined $1.3 billion. An additional $500 million to $600 million is sought collectively by the funds. Against this universe, ""for women entrepreneurs, $1 billion is a huge number,"" she said. More from iCONIC:7 lessons from Elon Musk's first, forgotten small-business success A report from the World Bank, financial services giant Axa and consultancy Accenture found the market for insurance for women, including women entrepreneurs, in 10 emerging markets that it studied would be $1.7 trillion by 2030, up from $800 billion in 2013. Money from We-Fi, which will be distributed through development banks that likely will award the money based on project applications, could conceivably be used in projects like developing insurance products aimed at women entrepreneurs, or to loan money to women-led brokerages. The first calls for proposals will be out in October, according to the World Bank. ""I'm sitting in Tanzania talking to 19 entrepreneurs about scaling up,"" said Biegel. ""Insurance is a huge need. They can't get crop insurance or greenhouse insurance. Without insurance, you are vulnerable."" We-Fi will make the $325 million pledged by donor countries available for equity deals where partners include venture capitalists and private equity funds. That means the World Bank could be an investor in funds that invest in women-led start-ups, or the start-ups themselves, in emerging tech hubs, like Dubai or Nairobi's ""Silicon Savannah."" The presence of World Bank money in a deal often reassures co-investors from the United States or Europe and gives funds working in geographies or with populations that investors see as risky a longer time frame. World Bank investments in funds in the Middle East and North Africa has helped launch several venture capital funds there. The We-Fi money may push more funds to focus on women. For instance, a $150 million Cairo-based fund, Ripples Impact, aims to launch in the second quarter of 2018 to invest in growth-stage companies in the Middle East and North Africa working in health and food security, with women's empowerment one of its guiding investment principles. If women participated equally with men around the world, $12 trillion would be added to the global economy, consulting firm McKinsey estimated in 2015. Funding women entrepreneurs, especially in traditionally male-dominated industries, is seen as one of the best ways to spur greater equality. The White House did not respond to questions about Ivanka's continuing role in the We-Fi initiative, though she was involved over the summer, meeting with investment and entrepreneurship experts and hosting meetings at the White House. She is leading the U.S. delegation to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Hyderabad, India. The annual summit is an Obama initiative. Saudi Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, an advocate for women and a philanthropist, investor and the founder of several luxury lifestyle companies, will become an advisor to the fund. Part of the vitriol directed against Ivanka came from her lack of experience in global entrepreneurship, as well as her father's stated intention to dismantle global financial infrastructure. Her clothing line has come under fire for not monitoring the treatment of factory workers to which it outsources.  ""She has got zero credibility when it comes to global women's entrepreneurship, much less financing entrepreneurship,"" said one expert. It is a deeply complicated issue, one that has so far defied most solutions. ""If we are trying to change patterns of capital distribution, we should be bold and purposeful and choose areas that will demonstrate what's possible,"" said Laurie Spengler, CEO of Washington, D.C.-based Enclude, which advises businesses and financial institutions on how they can serve underserved entrepreneurs. ""With $1 billion, you're trying to lead others."" Take Kenya, for instance. It is a financial center, and, as home to a flourishing mobile money ecosystem based on MPesa, an emerging tech capital. But women there still face a long road to working or founding businesses in traditionally male-dominated sectors. On a recent Thursday, about 20 articulate, confident 7th-grade girls at a school in Kibera run by the nonprofit Shining Hope for Communities, sat around a table describing their aspirations. Most wanted to be teachers and doctors. One or two mentioned business. One girl, Susan, spoke up and said firmly: ""I want to be a banker."" Despite the top-notch education at the school, the odds are still stacked high against Susan if she wants to work in finance in Kenya. ""It's hard to convince a male CEO of a bank to listen to you,"" said Peris Bosire, co-founder of a Nairobi-based company called Farm Drive that enables small farmers to keep track of their revenue and expenses and apply for loans. As the company gathers more data on repayment rates, she hopes to be able to convince more banks to take a risk on Farm Drive and the farmers it works with, and to find investors to back the company. ""Most investors and the people you're trying to do business with, they have subconscious bias against us. They think of us, 'OK, the two young girls' and not in a nice way."" Women provide 80 percent of Kenya's farm labor and manage 40 percent of the country's smallholder farms, yet they own only roughly 1 percent of agricultural land and receive just 10 percent of available credit, USAID reported in 2015. While funding for start-up tech businesses is beginning, one of the gaps for women's enterprise in emerging markets is growth capital for traditional businesses, said Spengler. Two she has worked with in Karachi are a pest-control company and Al-Karam Packaages, which makes plastic bags. Founded by a divorced mother, Mussarat Ishaq, who worked days as a babysitter and cleaner while she learned the business, it now has 250 employees. Now, she wants to move into environment-friendly packaging materials. Banks in Pakistan often don't approve such loans: convincing them to do so involves analyzing new market segments perceived as ""too risky"" for banks; developing the right bank products and services; training loan officers in cash-flow based lending and demonstrating he positive P&L results that come from investing in underserved segments, Spengler said. Few banks in emerging markets are willing to make the investment, so some programs to support women entrepreneurs offer banks low-interest capital. The supply of capital for ambitious women entrepreneurs falls far short of the demand. In India, for instance, the World Bank estimated $30 billion in working and fixed capital requirements for women entrepreneurs in India. The supply from banks and other formal sources is estimated at less than $9 billion. It is not money alone that enables women entrepreneurs to grow. Saudi Arabia has set aside a budget of $180 million to promote entrepreneurship in its economy, and women are meant to be part of that group. But the reality is far different. Initiatives need to be carefully calibrated not to run afoul of culture to succeed. Women are entering the tech sector in higher numbers, possibly because it is a new part of the economy. Dahlan's company helps creative people, like graphic designers, start businesses. She is also cautious, as she talks to women, to tell them they can become entrepreneurs after their children go to school. ""We need to look at building sectors in Saudi Arabia where women can easily operate and take matters into their own hands and open their own ventures,"" she said. She stays inspired, she said, by something her grandmother told her: ""The footsteps of a woman with coins in her pocket has a different sound."" ""I can only have a voice if I am financially independent. Nobody can tell me if I can fly or not, because I pay my own ticket,"" she said.

Sean Williams,09212017,Fool,09142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. 2016 was a banner year for the airline industry, with 928.9 million domestic and international passengers being served by airlines that flew into, within, or out of the United States. That marked the highest total in history, besting the previous all-time high of 897.9 million passengers set the year prior. Expectations for 2017 are that we could wind up setting a new traffic record yet again. This added traffic is a bit of a double-edged sword for the airline industry. While the boost in travel demonstrates that demand from consumers is healthy, it's also increased the voracity of competition among the airline industry. This competition, especially fare-price wars, has been weighing on margins for the industry as a whole. Lower fares may not be good news for airline margins, but it tends to make the consumer pretty darn happy. Image source: Getty Images. You know what else makes passengers happy? Perks. A number of airlines have been bringing back ""extras"" or emphasizing existing perks to win customers over. Examples include a few of the majors bringing back complimentary meals on long domestic flights, or in rarer cases the opportunity to bring one or two bags of luggage onboard for free. But passengers want more than just a free meal or a free checked bag. If they're going to stick with an airline for the long haul, they want to feel appreciated and get rewarded for their loyalty. That's where an airline's elite status comes into play. We're talking here about what perks a passenger is offered for flying a certain amount of miles, or spending a specific amount of money, with an airline in a given year. The better the perks, the assumption would be the more likely a consumer is likely to choose one airline over another. And loyalty can be a very important profit driver in the airline industry, especially if loyal customers prove to be less reliant on sales when making their purchases. So which airlines have the best elite status perks? To answer this question, we'll turn to a brand-new report from ThePointsGuy.com, which examined six national airlines: Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and United Continental (NYSE:UAL). What happened to Frontier, Hawaiian, Spirit Airlines, Sun Country, and Virgin America, you ask? Frontier, Hawaiian, Spirit, and Sun Country were excluded because they're regional carriers with limited elite status perks outside their hubs, while Virgin America is currently merging with Alaska Air and is already included in its results. Image source: Getty Images. The report examined these six national airlines across eight broad categories, each with a percentage weighting of importance: Lastly, the analysis looked at four separate categories of elite status: The performance of the six airlines was averaged across all four tiers, so a first-to-worst list with regard to elite status could be assembled. Let's look at the results. Image source: Alaska Air. Alaska's outperformance is perhaps the highest in the mid-tier elite category, where MVP Gold members earn a 100% bonus on the miles they fly, which for 50,000 miles translates to about $950. The other major carriers offer three miles per dollar spent, or about 18,000 miles total. MVP Gold members are also privy to fee waivers, which comes in handy for those last-minute flight changes since it won't result in extra fees. Not surprisingly, J.D. Power in May announced that Alaska had earned the highest ranking in terms of customer satisfaction among traditional airlines for the 10th consecutive year. With perks like these, it's no wonder its passengers are happy and Alaska's business is excelling. Image source: Getty Images. United Airlines, the second best performer based on elite status, finished a respective, fourth, second, third, and first in the low-, mid-, high-, and road-warrior-tiers. Whereas Alaska was top dog for casual to regular fliers, United Airlines appears to be the preferred choice for those who are seemingly always flying the friendly skies. Interestingly enough, the analysis shows that there's nothing specific about the United Premier 1K status (for those with 100,000 miles flown and $12,000 in spending) that sets it apart from the competition other than it finishing consistently in the top three in seven of the eight categories examined. Perks include enhanced award availability in economy and premium cabins, complimentary drinks and snacks, and a total of six regional premier upgrades and six global premier upgrades. Another perk offered to United customers is its RewardPlus partnership with Marriott, which allows automatic reciprocal status between both companies. This crossover perk platform helps really boost United's non-flying perks. Image source: Delta Air Lines. Delta Air Lines came in third overall with consistent respective finishes of third, third, second, and third across the low-, mid-, high-, and road-warrior-tiers. For Delta, its in-flight perks and flexible perks appear to be the lure it'll be using to attract passengers. For example, in the high-tier category Delta offers a longer upgrade window of 120 hours (compared with United at 72 hours), complimentary access to preferred seats, and extra-legroom economy seats. Similar to United, Delta also offers a crossover rewards partnership with Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG). While ThePointsGuy.com finds that the United partnership with Marriott is tops on the list, Delta's crossover rewards with SPG come in a close second. The bottom half of the rankings consisted of American Airlines in fourth, JetBlue in fifth, and Southwest Airlines, which J.D. Power found ranked highest in customer satisfaction among low-cost carriers for the first time in 2017, ranked dead last. Certainly an odd position for Southwest to be in considering its financial success. Image source: JetBlue Airways. Why did these airlines rank so poorly on elite status relative to the aforementioned three? To begin with, in the low-tier category neither JetBlue nor Southwest offers perks. You'll have to reach mid-tier status just to receive perks from either airline -- though the report notes that even there JetBlue and Southwest lag the other major airlines. At the mid-tier level, neither company offers a first class or premium upgrade for elite members, and you'll receive no benefits based on your status when flying with partner airlines. As for American Airlines, it does offer a few welcome perks, such as priority security to low-tier elite status fliers, and waiving same-day stand-by fees. However, high-tier elite members are restricted to two free checked bags weighing less than 50 pounds each, while United and Delta offer high-tier elites three free bags with each allowed to weigh up to 70 pounds. An overweight bag on American can set you back up to $200, the steepest penalty in the industry. The question is: Are elite status perks the end-all deciding factor for passengers? To that end I'd suggest it's still debatable. Take the aforementioned J.D. Power Customer Satisfaction survey into account. Southwest and JetBlue's scores of 807 and 803 were respectively higher than Alaska at 765, and well above the remaining legacy airlines. Yet as the analysis from ThePointsGuy.com shows, JetBlue and Southwest brought up the caboose in elite status perks. This suggests it's quite possible that customer satisfaction is still derived primarily by cost savings via lower fares than perks derived from loyalty, although the two sort of go hand in hand. If this is indeed the case, then low-cost carriers like Southwest and JetBlue have little to worry about and probably won't spend too much time trying to compete with legacy carriers on elite status perks anytime soon. What matters more to you: a low fare, or being rewarded for your loyalty? ","

Investors in Nabriva Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NBRV) are having a wonderful start to the trading week. Shares of the clinical-stage biotech focused on antibiotics rose 36% as of 11:30 a.m. EDT on Monday in response to reporting encouraging data from its phase 3 LEAP 1 trial. The LEAP 1 trial was designed to study the safety and efficacy of the company's lead compound lefamulin in treating community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). CABP is leading cause of death from infection in the United States and is a very serious public health issue. Top-line data from the 551 patient trial showed that lefamulin was able to meet the FDA's and European Medicines Agencies primary endpoints of non-inferiority when compared to moxifloxacin with or without adjunctive linezolid. Specifically, the early clinical response rate assessed for lefamulin was 87.3%, while moxifloxacin's rate was 90.2%. What's more, lefamulin's safety data was also comparable to moxifloxacin. Dr. Colin Broom, Nabriva's CEO, offered investors the following commentary on the trial: ""These Phase 3 data provide strong evidence of the potential of lefamulin to treat adults with CABP and provide an alternative to a current gold standard treatment regimen. Due to lefamulin's flexible dosing and targeted spectrum of activity against the pathogens most commonly associated with CABP, including multidrug-resistant strains, we believe that lefamulin is well suited to be a first-line empiric monotherapy."" Given the clinical results, it is easy to understand why traders are bidding up shares on Monday. Image source: Getty Images. CABP is responsible for more than 3 million hospitalizations each year in the U.S. and has a mortality rate of more than 5%. What's more, the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is exacerbating the need for new and improved treatment options. These facts suggest that lefamulin could quickly become a top seller if it manages to cross the finish line. However, investors should remember that Nabriva is far from the only company with a dog in this race. Paratek Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:PRTK) is another clinical-stage biotech that is focused on next-generation antibiotics, and just a few months ago the company reported encouraging top-line results from a phase 3 study evaluating its investigational drug omadacycline as a treatment for CABP. The company also reported that it plans to have the drug in regulators hands in early 2018. That represents a faster timeline than Nabriva is currently on with lefamulin so the company's investors should watch omadacycline's progress closely. Nabriva is moving forward with its LEAP 2 trial, which is the company's second pivotal phase 3 study comparing oral lefamulin to moxifloxacin. Enrollment is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year and top-line data should be available in early 2018. Potential investors might want to wait until data from the LEAP 2 trial becomes available before they decide whether or not to jump in. ","

Sean Williams,09212017,Fool,09142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Few industries have been able to put up growth numbers like the legal marijuana industry over the past couple of years. Though estimates vary, most analysts estimate the legal weed industry can grow by 25% to 35% annually between 2016 and 2021. GreenWave Advisors is calling for perhaps the highest growth rate, with $30 billion in U.S. sales and all 50 states legal to some degree (medical or recreational) by 2021. The prospects of this consistent growth are what's fueled a ferocious rally in marijuana stocks over the past year. A number of cannabis producers and retailers have seen their share prices surge by 100% or more. It also hasn't hurt that more than half of all U.S. states have legalized to some degree, Mexico legalized medical cannabis in June, and Canada is considering legalizing recreational pot by next summer. Image source: Getty Images. However, in spite of these clear positives for marijuana proponents and investors, the industry faces an almost insurmountable hurdle: the federal government. At the federal level, cannabis still holds a Schedule I designation, meaning it's on par with heroin and LSD, is entirely illegal, and has no perceived medical benefits. Lawmakers' worries can essentially be boiled down to two primary concerns. First, they often claim that there isn't enough reliable clinical data on the benefits and risks of medical cannabis to consider altering its scheduling. Though you'll note that there are seemingly hundreds of university-sponsored research studies involving cannabis, there are very few Food and Drug Administration-approved studies involving cannabis and cannabinoids. It's the latter that Congress will want before deciding pot's fate on Capitol Hill. Perhaps the greatest irony here is that lawmakers want more clinical data, but the current scheduling of marijuana makes it extremely difficult to get the OK for researchers to run clinical studies. The second issue many lawmakers have with the legal weed thesis is that it'll make it easier for adolescents to get their hands on pot. Some university studies have shown that adolescent minds can be adversely impacted by marijuana use while their brains are still developing, which makes lawmakers fear home-grow options that often accompany legalization efforts, as well as access to medical cannabis in a household, could ease access for teens. But there may be good news on this latter objection. Image source: Getty Images. Recently, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) released findings from its 2016 survey on drug use and health. The results showed that just 6.5% of teens aged 12 to 17 had used marijuana over the past month, which was down 0.5% from 2015, 1.7% from 2002, and is the lowest reading over the past 15 years. Mind you, eight states have voted to legalize adult-use weed since 2012, yet teen use rates have fallen by more than 1% between 2011 and 2016. And this isn't the only data point that suggests teens aren't being lured by marijuana. Pro-legalization reform group Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) pointed out following the release of the SAMHSA report that teen pot use rates in both Colorado and Washington haven't materially changed since they began to sell adult-use weed in 2014. Why the drop despite purportedly easier access to weed? MPP suggests that a tightly regulated industry, coupled with the clear notion that there's a line-in-the-sand legal age requirement for marijuana, has sunk in with adolescents. ""Regulating marijuana for adults reinforces that message and creates effective mechanisms for making it more difficult for teens to obtain marijuana,"" said Morgan Fox, senior communications manager for Marijuana Policy Project. Image source: Getty Images. For those who want to see medical cannabis, or even recreational weed, legalized across the United States, the data from the national SAMHSA report is great news. It wouldn't be surprising if the Canadian parliament looked to this data as well, as it's in the process of debating the legalization of adult-use weed throughout Canada in 2018. One of the biggest objections in Canada has been the home-grow option and the likelihood of adolescent getting their hands on marijuana. Nevertheless, the excitement from this report can only extend so far. When all is said and done, it remains highly unlikely that marijuana has a path to rescheduling under the Trump administration. For starters, Congress is far too busy with healthcare and tax reform at present to consider marijuana legislation. Even if these two issues get tackled, President Trump will likely want to move onto passing an infrastructure bill next. There's next to no room on the docket for cannabis on Capitol Hill. But this is far from the only issue. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will seemingly stop at nothing to ensure that marijuana's expansion is slowed or stopped completely. Sessions hasn't minced words in his views of marijuana, and in May, the attorney general sent a letter to congressional leaders asking them to repeal an amendment that protects medical cannabis businesses from federal prosecution. Sessions seems unwilling to let off the gas in his pursuit to prosecute pot businesses. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) is unlikely to be of help, either. It had an opportunity to review two petitions to reschedule marijuana last summer and chose to stand pat on its scheduling. The DEA determined that there wasn't enough clinical benefit-versus-risk data available to alter its scheduling, and noted concerns about abuse and oversight if its scheduling were to be changed. It can take a long time for petitions to work their way up to the DEA, so don't look for any chance of rescheduling anytime soon. Despite industrywide momentum, the ceiling on the industry and marijuana stocks remains very much in place. ","

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",09212017,Fool,09142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The first thing that I ask myself when looking for stocks that I could hold in my portfolio forever is ""Will this business be around in 50 years?"" For example, people will need safe places to store their wealth, reliable ways to get around, and access to healthcare. Once it has been established that the industry will endure the test of time, there are a few other attributes to look for in a ""forever stock."" Financial strength, growing revenue, and a shareholder-friendly capital return policy are a few examples. With these things in mind, here are three stocks that you could buy and hold for decades to come. These stocks could build wealth in your portfolio until your retirement and beyond. Image source: Getty Images. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is the fifth-largest bank that's based in the United States, and to be clear, the stock isn't cheap. In fact, the bank's price to-book value is the highest of the largest U.S. banks by far. USB Price to Book Value data by YCharts. However, the stock is expensive for a reason. U.S. Bancorp is consistently the most profitable of the big banks, and the bank has grown tremendously over the past decade or so, emerging from the financial crisis even stronger than it went in. In addition, the bank is among the strongest financial institutions in the U.S. As my colleague John Maxfield recently pointed out, U.S. Bancorp was one of the few banks in the recent Federal Reserve stress tests that would still make money during a hypothetical nine-quarter downturn. This shouldn't be too surprising -- U.S. Bancorp never even had a single quarterly loss during the actual financial crisis. With excellent asset quality, a solid balance sheet, and strong profitability, there's no doubt in my mind that U.S. Bancorp is a stock that you can confidently buy and hold for the long haul. Shares of automaker General Motors (NYSE:GM) trade for just 6.1 times trailing-12-month earnings at a time when most of the market looks rather expensive, despite the company posting some excellent profits over the past few years. To be fair, auto industry experts are projecting a downturn in vehicle sales in the next few years, and this is likely to put pressure on General Motors' profits. To name a few examples, analysts at Morgan Stanley see auto sales peaking in 2017, while J.D. Power is projecting a small drop this year. However, there's still a good case to be made, even if a rather large drop in auto sales does occur. The company is generating enough cash to cover its 4% dividend several times over, and has plenty of cash in reserve. In fact, it is committed to maintaining a cash reserve of $18 billion. Operating margins have been expanding thanks to the popularity of highly profitable vehicles such as crossovers and pickup trucks. Finally, it has become a leader in innovation and plans to stay that way, even throughout a downturn. In a nutshell, this is not the same General Motors that existed before the Great Recession. In fact, GM has become a solid, well-run company that is capable of thriving in any environment, but it's trading at a valuation as if it were headed toward insolvency. Healthcare is certainly an industry that will be needed forever -- regardless of what happens with the Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare) and other healthcare legislation, people will always need quality medical care. My favorite way to invest in healthcare is through real estate, specifically the types of healthcare properties that stand to benefit from the expected growth in the U.S. population. Ventas (NYSE:VTR) is one of the largest healthcare real estate investment trusts (REITs), and it has a lot of opportunity for growth over the coming decades. Ventas owns more than 1,200 properties, and about 55% (by net operating income) are senior housing, with another 19% comprised of medical offices. Life science facilities, health systems, and a few other property types take up the rest. Ninety-four percent of tenants' revenue comes from private-pay revenue sources, which are more stable than government reimbursements like Medicare and Medicaid. To make a long story short, Ventas is a forever stock because it is one of the largest and most efficient operators, and should have tremendous growth opportunities as the senior citizen population grows over the coming decades. The 75-and-older age group is expected to grow by 14 million people by 2030, and is growing at seven times the rate of the overall population. In addition, less than 15% of healthcare properties are REIT-owned, which will create a lot of opportunity for consolidation. And Ventas' size and financial flexibility give it a major advantage over peers. ","

Robert Schroeder,09212017,MarketWatch,09142017,"Published: Sept 20, 2017 10:41 a.m. ET White House may give up on push to repeal estate tax By Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price took private jets on five separate flights last week for official business, in a sharp departure from his predecessors that cost tens of thousands of dollars more than commercial travel, according to Politico. Politico said the flights took the HHS chief to a resort in Maine where he participated in a discussion with a health-care industry CEO, and to community health centers in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. HHS spokespeople declined to confirm details of the flights or respond to questions about who paid for them, Politico said. A spokesperson told Politico that Price sometimes charters planes when commercial flights aren’t feasible. Charter operators estimated the five flights would cost at least $60,000, Politico said.

Rand Paul of Kentucky in a tweet Wednesday morning, saying the Republican is a friend but “such a negative force” on fixing health care. Paul is publicly opposing the GOP’s latest effort to repeal major parts of Obamacare, a bill authored by Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. It’s still unknown whether the bill will even come up for a vote. It needs 50 “yes” votes, and with Paul a “no,” getting to that number is in doubt. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska still hasn’t made her position known. The Graham-Cassidy plan repeals Obamacare’s individual and employer mandates and would distribute federal funding to states in the form of block grants.

I hope Republican Senators will vote for Graham-Cassidy and fulfill their promise to Repeal & Replace ObamaCare. Money direct to States!

Also currently working with the President to finalize better replacement with cross state purchase of inexpensive insurance. Coming soon! Timeline for bill: If Republicans move forward with the Graham-Cassidy bill, they’re facing an extremely tight timeline, as Politico explains. Senators left Washington Tuesday ahead of Rosh Hashanah, and are not expected to return until Monday evening. The deadline for acting on the bill under so-called reconciliation hits on Saturday, Sept. 30. Yom Kippur begins the evening of Sept. 29, and Sen.

Giving up on estate-tax repeal: The Washington Post reports the White House and Republican leaders are considering major changes to tax legislation, including scaling back plans for large-scale tax cuts for the wealthy and giving up on a push to repeal the estate tax. The Post says the White House is considering keeping the top tax rate for individuals at 39.6%, scrapping an earlier proposal that would have cut that rate to 35%.

Jacob Passy,09212017,MarketWatch,09142017,"Published: Sept 20, 2017 4:37 p.m. ET North Carolina becomes the latest state to join the effort to uphold climate change agreement despite Trump’s pull-out. By The state-based movement to continue meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change following President Trump’s choice to withdraw is making headway. The U.S. Climate Alliance, as the group is called, said Wednesday that it is on track to meet and possibly surpass its portion of the Paris Agreement’s targets of a 24% to 29% reduction in greenhouse gas emission rates from 2005 levels by 2025. The Paris Agreement, which was adopted in 2015 by 195 countries, aims to reduce emissions in order to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. The bipartisan coalition of states was created by three Democratic governors — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, California Gov. Jerry Brown and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee — after President Trump announced in June his plan to withdraw the U.S. from the international accord. North Carolina became the latest and 15th state to join the U.S. Climate Alliance, which also includes Puerto Rico. Additionally, two states with Republican governors, Massachusetts and Vermont, are part of the alliance. “Either we end this problem or this problem will end us,” Cuomo said during a press conference in New York, which was also attended by Brown, Inslee and former Secretary of State John Kerry. In recent days, reports suggested that the Trump administration might be reconsidering its stance on the agreement, but the White House later issued a statement saying that there had been no change to the U.S.’s position. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also tweeted that the U.S. will withdraw “unless we get pro-America terms.” Don’t miss: 11 ways to build a Paris climate change accord — in your own community During the press conference, the attendees lambasted the president’s choice to pull out of the agreement. “No burden was placed on the United States other than what we in the United States set for ourselves,” Kerry said. “He forfeited American leadership.” The governors and Kerry also made repeated references to the hurricanes that have made landfall on U.S. soil — Harvey, Irma and now Maria — as well as the wildfires burning across the West Coast as an indication of what could occur if climate change worsens. The U.S. Climate Alliance is just one way in which state governments are working to continue the U.S.’s commitment to the climate change agreement despite Trump’s actions. Cuomo touted New York’s Green Bank, a state-sponsored financial entity that aims to increase investment in clean energy markets, and said that the bank will be going national. He also expressed interest in potentially working with California on a carbon market. The Golden State has already established a cap-and-trade program with the Canadian province of Quebec, with Ontario set to join the burgeoning market.

Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets, said gold prices moved lower after the FOMC statement “because the market has perceived the statement as somewhat hawkish.” “The Fed still thinks that more interest-rate hikes are possible despite the fact that the size of the balance sheet will also be reduced,” he said. The central bank said it would taper its $4.5 trillion balance sheet by $10 billion a month.

U.S. stocks continued to trade mostly lower. Higher rates can boost the dollar, in which gold is priced. They typically move inversely. A rising interest-rate climate also tends to dull the appeal of nonyielding bullion. Precious-metals traders also weighed Tuesday’s comments from President Donald Trump at the United Nations, in which he referred to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as “rocket man” and threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if it attacks the U.S. or its allies.

                                   meanwhile, slipped 31.10 points, or 0.5%, to end at 6,429.08. A reading on consumer prices, known as the consumer-price index, showed an increase of 0.4% in August, beating consensus estimates for a rise of 0.3%, while first-time jobless claims last week came in at 284,000, versus forecasts for 300,000. Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, said Thursday’s data did little to alter the policy path for the Federal Reserve. Inflation data offered the first read of some of the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which inundated the Houston area and resulted in the shutdown of a trove of crude-oil refineries, driving gasoline prices higher. “CPI was a bit above expectations,” but market participants can’t be surprised that higher gasoline prices and some other expected inputs moved inflation toward the Fed’s 2% target, Warne said. She said the report was “not so strong that it’s likely to change views that the Fed will continue to be cautious and slow in raising interest rates.” Inflation readings have been trending below the Federal Reserve’s target and leading some to question whether the central bank would feel comfortable lifting benchmark interest rates once more in 2017. On Wednesday, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq Composite all gained between 0.1% and 0.2%, finishing at all-time closing highs for a second straight session. The equity market’s continued run to new heights, with the bull market in its ninth year, has raised concerns about lofty stock valuations. “The S&P 500 continues to confound skeptical investors, as it adds to its above-average number of new highs,” said Sam Stovall, CFRA’s chief investment strategist, in a note. The benchmark has scored 33 record closes this year, more than twice the annual average since 1945. However, Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading, said he was sanguine about the outlook for the stock market. “If you look at the market and you look at the backdrop for equities, it is still pretty good right now,” he said. “Yeah, you always could run into this situation where you can have a 5% correction. That is always a possibility,” he said. “But I do not see any major structural issues with the market that could turn into a bear market,” Kepner added, referring to a decline of at least 20%. Read:  Stock market’s 5-month win streak should cheer the bulls Earlier Thursday, North Korea made more threats in response to the latest United Nation sanctions, vowing to sink Japan with a nuclear weapon and “reduce the U.S. mainland to ashes and darkness.” The acerbic rhetoric comes after the U.N. Security Council on Monday unanimously adopted tougher sanctions against North Korea targeting its exports and oil imports. Economic and political news: The Bank of England on Thursday kept its key interest rate on hold and made no changes to its quantitative-easing program, but warned that rates could rise faster than traders currently are pricing in.

On the political front, President Donald Trump and top Democrats appear to be nearing a deal to give legal status to the children of illegal immigrants. Trump tweeted early Thursday that no deal had been reached yet, after Democrats late Wednesday said they had an agreement with him to enact protections for “Dreamers” in exchange for increased border-security measures that don’t include funding for a wall.

Barry Eichengreen,09212017,MarketWatch,09142017,"Structural reforms since financial crisis are slowly but surely starting to bear fruit, with the lowest unemployment since 2009 and production ratcheted up Jennifer Rankin Sat 16 Sep 2017 16.00 BST


Last modified on Sat 2 Dec 2017 02.44 GMT It was a story few predicted: the eurozone is growing faster than the United States. When Jean-Claude Juncker gave his annual state of the union speech on Wednesday last week, Europe’s booming economy was near the top of his list. Ten years since the crisis struck, “Europe’s economy is finally bouncing back,” the European commission president told MEPs. Detailing the economic resurgence, but also referring to the EU’s newfound unity after Britain’s vote to leave, Juncker declared: “the wind is back in Europe’s sails”. In fact, growth in the 19-country eurozone has quietly outshone the US for the last two years. The latest annualised growth numbers show the single currency bloc growing at 2.3%, compared with 2.2% for the world’s largest economy. Eurozone unemployment has fallen to the lowest level since 2009, while factories are humming again, with production up 3.2% on last year. The upturn in fortunes is likely to continue, says James Nixon, chief European economist at consultancy Oxford Economics. “The euro area has done a lot of work over the last decade to get its house in order and also a lot structural reform. That has been an extraordinary, excruciatingly slow process but it is starting to bear fruit.” The eurozone might be doing better, but the crisis has left deep scars and many wounds are far from healed. In France, the economy is expanding at an annualised rate of 1.7%, fuelled by confidence in French president Emmanuel Macron and his reform agenda, but growth continues to lag the eurozone average. Germany’s economy remains solid, but Germans are increasingly worried about inequality and low-wage jobs. Spain has bounced back from the crisis, but inequality is rising and unemployment remains painfully high at 17% - second only to Greece. Italy’s economy is doing better, but worries remain over its heavily indebted banks. Despite the rapid pace of job creation, eurozone unemployment remains high (9.1%), worse than the EU average (7.7%) and the US (4.3%). Eurozone economies would need to be expanding faster to generate steeper falls in unemployment, says Cinzia Alcidi, head of economic policy at the Centre for European Policy Studies. “The outlook for the euro area has improved a lot but we are still closer to 2% than 3% [economic growth] so the effect [on unemployment] will be milder and will take more time.” This explains why eurozone watchers are focused on economic reforms. Above all they are looking at whether Macron can succeed in pushing through far-reaching labour reforms to make it easier for small and medium-sized firms to fire workers, thus boosting hiring. French ministers believe such reforms will make it easier for the young and low-qualified to break into the labour market. If France succeeds, pressure is likely to build on Italy to undertake similar measures. “It is possible that, in this framework this could be the start of a decade-long period of expansion, golden years for the euro area,” argues Nixon. European leaders also want to push on with eurozone reforms. Two days after the German elections on 24 September, Macron is expected to set out a detailed blueprint of his ideas, which include a eurozone finance minister and parliament. “Either the eurozone moves from being an imperfect monetary union to a true economic continent, or it could disappear,” finance minister Bruno Le Maire told the Financial Times last week. But there are differences on the detail. “There is a certain alignment in the broad ideas, but... divergences on how to make this happen,” says Alcidi at CEPS. “French ideas could be much more ambitious than Germany could accept,” she says. Differences are likely to emerge over the size of a eurozone budget or what it should be used for. Beyond shoring up the eurozone, the EU is also pressing ahead on trade: the election of Donald Trump on an “America First” ticket helped bring the long-discussed EU-Japan trade deal closer to the finish line. This week Juncker said the commission wanted to start trade talks with Australia and New Zealand - perhaps one in the eye for Brexit dreams of “Canzuk”, a trading alliance of English-speaking commonwealth countries. “The UK position is looking very, very lonely,” Nixon says. “The UK argument, to a certain extent, has always been that we didn’t want to be part of what looked like a failing club and I always felt that was a very Anglo-Saxon jaundiced way of looking at things [that underestimated] the political commitment to making this fly.” ",The eurozone strikes back – why Europe is booming again | Business | The Guardian

                                    and opening borders per the Schengen agreement was so out of step with reality and with the mood in EU countries that he seemed to be on a different planet. In fact, the German daily Die Welt thought the idea of a Bulgaria or a Romania joining the euro was so absurd that one had to ask “on what distant star the spaceship EU under its Captain Juncker has spent the last few years.” Sahra Wagenknecht, a leader of the Left party in Germany — who takes advantage of her party’s marginal status to speak more pointedly than mainstream politicians — said “Mr. Juncker seems to have taken leave of his senses.” The euro is already causing enough damage to the countries that have it, without extending it to the rest of the EU, she said. Even the liberal Guardian, which has been steadfastly pro-Europe, said “Juncker’s federalist vision for the EU is far from reality.” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte described Juncker as a “romantic,” the paper reported, and suggested that people with vision see an eye doctor. But a counter vision offered up by dissidents concerned about the “democratic deficit” in an EU governed by unaccountable technocrats is equally unrealistic. Former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis is spearheading a group called Democracy in Europe Movement 2025, or DiEM25, to promote a different kind of EU. In a New York Times op-ed in July, Varoufakis embarked on a convoluted analysis of how insiders and outsiders were outside and inside the establishment. French President Emmanuel Macron, for instance, was an outsider who upended the French establishment but really has an insider austerity agenda. While Varoufakis’s bitter critique is often right, his solutions seem as far-fetched as Juncker’s vision. “The answer lies in ditching both globalism and isolationism in favor of an authentic internationalism,” he suggested, whatever that means. He wants an International New Deal, modeled on Franklin Roosevelt’s program during the Great Depression to mobilize idle private money for public purposes. He suggests the Group of 20 oversee a massive fundraising coordinated by central banks with development institutions (World Bank et al.) issuing bonds to soak up global savings and spend it on projects to alleviate poverty, develop human capital and so on. Really? Perhaps in an alternate universe. The problem with any grand vision of how to integrate and restructure Europe is that’s not the way history happens. And Europe has a lot of history. Grafting on some notion of a United States of Europe is antithetical to that history, and virtually impossible to achieve politically. In that sense, the notions of a multi-speed Europe propagated by the likes of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble outside of election campaign time, are more realistic. Especially if one of the speeds is reverse. The EU probably reached its peak as a free-trade zone and common market, before the debut of a joint currency and a European Central Bank put member states in a straitjacket that benefited Germany but created problems for other countries. The mistake was to proceed with integration at a forced march even as the bloc expanded to take in the newly liberated countries in Eastern Europe. From the get-go, the political elite have wanted to force the scope and pace of integration. They largely refused to let voters have their say in national referendums on EU membership with all its specific terms or on the joint currency with all its conditions. This was more of a “democracy disconnect,” as Varoufakis observes, that a democracy deficit. A multi-speed Europe, or Europe a la carte, is much more in keeping with European culture and tradition than the effort to create a United States of Europe. The overlapping fealties of a Holy Roman Empire or a Duchy of Burgundy, the commercial connections of a Hanseatic League, or the comfortable tolerances of the Hapsburg Empire are better models for European relations than the runaway centralizing bureaucracy in Brussels. There is no need to force Britain to leave Europe, nor to keep countries like Norway and Switzerland at the door like orphaned stepchildren. In his speech, Juncker proposed “streamlining” EU structure by concentrating power in a single president, combining the roles of Commission president (Juncker) and the European Council president (Donald Tusk). Instead, the EU should become looser, more flexible, less centralized, with more dispersion of power. There’s no need to try to imitate our United States. Europe has its own political traditions that have evolved over centuries, and they should be allowed to evolve on their own, even if takes a few more centuries.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Health stocks are highly sensitive to news about regulatory and legislative change. This week is another test with the latest Republican effort to repeal President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. The overall S&P 500 healthcare sector .SPXHC has underperformed the broader stock market in the past two weeks as Senate Republicans seek to generate enough support to overhaul Obamacare with their latest bill, known as Graham-Cassidy. The sector rebounded somewhat on Tuesday as odds for the bill’s passage appeared to diminish after a key senator opposed it. The Senate faces a Saturday deadline because of an expiring rule that lets the Republican healthcare legislation pass with just a simple majority. Here are the main stocks expected to move most from news over the Republican repeal efforts: Graham-Cassidy repeals enhanced federal funding for the Medicaid expansion beginning in 2020 and limits spending through a per capital cap. It also adds uncertainty by providing Medicaid funding through block grants to states that allows them to implement their own rules. “The Graham-Cassidy bill is looking to reduce funding for Medicaid in the longer term. That is a benefit that we have seen improve the earnings outlooks for these hospitals,” said Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut. The proposal also repeals the requirement that individuals buy insurance or pay a fine, known as the individual mandate, which also could reduce insurance coverage, hurting hospitals. One possible positive for hospitals could be the bill’s increase of funding to states that did not previously expand Medicaid under Obamacare, where some publicly traded hospital companies have facilities, said Ipsita Smolinski, managing director at healthcare research consulting firm Capitol Street. “The perception would be fewer members on Medicaid and therefore less revenue,” said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management. But Funtleyder said one benefit could be if the Medicaid block grants to states lead them to seek more services from the companies. But Smolinski notes that while prior Republican repeal bills sought to roll back an industry fee - which was seen as positive for insurers - the Graham-Cassidy bill does not end that fee. At the same time, these larger insurers have significant Medicaid businesses, and the bill leaves Medicaid funding uncertain after 10 years. “If you think about them with regard to the Medicaid business, then that’s probably a little bit of a headwind for them,” Smolinski said. “They are the only industry that got relief here,” Smolinski said. Overall, the passage of the bill could revive regulatory uncertainty over the broader healthcare sector, which hurt its performance ahead of the U.S. election last year. Through Monday, the healthcare sector had climbed 18.2 percent in 2017, topping the 11.5 percent rise for the overall S&P 500 .SPX. “If investors start worrying about what comes next or implementation issues, you could see a rotation into other sectors,” Funtleyder said.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican leaders sought to nail down the final votes needed to pass what U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday called their “last best chance” to repeal Obamacare while a new analysis underscored how Democratic-leaning states stand to lose large amounts of federal funding under the legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to bring the bill introduced by fellow Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy to a vote next week, as his party seeks to make good on seven years of promises to erase Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement. With no Democratic support for the bill, Republicans remain a handful of votes short in the Senate, needing 50 votes in a 100-seat chamber they control 52-48, with Pence casting a potential tie-breaking vote. Senator Rand Paul opposes it and at least six others are undecided: John McCain, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan, Rob Portman and Jerry Moran. Asked whether the legislation will pass, Pence said, “We’ll see. We’re close.” Republicans, still reeling from their failure in July to win Senate passage of previous legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, have set a Sept. 30 deadline for passage of this bill. “This may well be our last best chance to stop and turn around and head America back in the direction of the kind of healthcare reform that’s based on individual-choice, state-based innovations,” Pence told Fox New Channel. President Donald Trump has been pushing Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, which would fulfill one of his top campaign promises from last year. The current bill would take money that the federal government now spends on healthcare through the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and subsidies to help Americans buy private insurance and distribute it to the states in block grants. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has not yet assessed the bill’s effects but independent analyses indicate it would fundamentally redistribute federal healthcare money, generally with Republican-leaning states benefiting and Democratic-leaning states losing. The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare research group, estimated on Thursday that states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare would lose $180 billion under the bill from 2020 to 2026, while non-expansion states would gain $73 billion in the same time period. The Graham-Cassidy bill in 2020 would end the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, which many Democratic-governed states had carried out while many Republican-governed states did not, and limit overall federal spending on the five-decade-old program regardless of how many Americans qualify for its benefits. Republicans have called Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, a federal overreach, and say block grants would give states discretion on how to provide healthcare coverage. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, five states would stand to lose more than 30 percent of their federal healthcare money from 2020-2026: New York (down 35 percent), Oregon (down 32 percent), Connecticut (down 31 percent), Vermont (down 31 percent) and Minnesota (down 30 percent). All are Democratic leaning. The analysis found that six Republican-leaning states would get at least 40 percent more in federal funds: Mississippi (up 148 percent), Texas (up 75 percent), Kansas (up 61 percent), Georgia (up 46 percent), South Dakota (up 45 percent) and Tennessee (up 44 percent). In total dollars, the state with the largest forecast loss of funds is California, losing $56 billion. The biggest gainer would be Texas, with a $34 billion increase. California, the most populous U.S. state, is Democratic leaning. Texas is the second most populous state and the largest Republican-leaning one. “It’s absolutely true to say the Graham-Cassidy bill over time levels out on a per-person basis the way we distribute money on healthcare, which I think resonates with most Americans,” Pence said. McCain, Collins and Murkowski were the three Republicans who voted against the last Republican healthcare legislation brought up in the Senate, which failed 51-49 in July. Paul, who voted in favor of that bill after previously expressing misgivings, on Thursday went to Twitter to underscore his criticism that the Graham-Cassidy bill does not go far enough to erase Obamacare. The insurance industry, hospitals, medical advocacy groups such as the American Medical Association, American Heart Association and American Cancer Society, the AARP advocacy group for the elderly and consumer activists have come out against the bill, urging a bipartisan fix to the current law that was abandoned this week. More medical and civil rights advocacy groups lined up against the Graham-Cassidy bill on Thursday, including the American Psychological Association, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the NAACP. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, estimated that the bill would cause more than 30 million people to lose insurance. The Graham-Cassidy proposal would let states opt out of the requirement that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates, causing a furor among advocacy groups that say it could make health insurance unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday blasted Senator John McCain for dealing a possibly fatal blow to the latest Republican attempt to dismantle Obamacare. According to a new independent analysis, the bill awaiting a Senate vote could lead to 21 million fewer Americans having health insurance. McCain, an Arizona Republican who is being treated for brain cancer and cast a crucial “no” vote to defeat a similar bill in July, said on Friday that he could not “in good conscience” vote for the proposal authored by Republican Senators Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham. “He campaigned on Repeal & Replace. Let Arizona down!” Trump wrote about McCain on Twitter early Saturday morning. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will schedule a vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill by Sept. 30, the last day when it could pass in the chamber with a simple majority of 51 votes instead of the 60 typically required. The bill would take federal money spent on the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, as well as subsidies to help individuals buy private insurance, and deliver it to the states in block grants. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes legislation, has not had time to assess the Graham-Cassidy bill before the expected vote. McCain, a close friend of Graham, said he could not support it without knowing how much it would cost, its effect on insurance premiums, and how many people would be affected. But the Brookings Institution said on Friday that the Graham-Cassidy bill could leave at least 21 million fewer Americans with health insurance by 2020 to 2026. The Washington think tank has generally been supportive of Obamacare, which is formally known as the Affordable Care Act. The coverage estimate “likely understates” reductions in insured Americans because it is not clear how states would use the money or if they would face obstacles in setting up new programs, according to Brookings researchers. “What is clear, however, is that the legislation would result in very large reductions in insurance coverage,” they wrote. Late Saturday, six associations representing U.S. doctors, hospitals and insurers said they opposed the bill because it would cause patients with pre-existing conditions to lose coverage and result in more expensive health insurance. “The Senate should reject it,” the groups said in a statement. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price told Fox News Channel’s ‘America’s News HQ’ on Saturday that he is “providing technical assistance and information” to senators working on the bill. Price said that the bill was “not dead” despite McCain’s announcement and wavering support from several other Republican senators. “The reason it’s not dead is because it’s not finished. The bill hasn’t been completed. We continue to work with the authors on it through this weekend,” Price said. The Senate Finance Committee on Monday will hold a hearing on the Graham-Cassidy bill. Cassidy, a physician, is expected to testify. CBO estimates of previous Republican proposals showed they could lead to more than 20 million fewer insured Americans. This complicated passage in the 100-member Senate, where Republicans hold 52 seats and Democrats are unanimously opposed to repeal-and-replace measures. Republicans need at least 50 votes to pass the bill, relying on Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine has said she was leaning against the Graham-Cassidy bill, as has Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Kansas Senator Jerry Moran and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski are undecided. After blasting McCain, Trump on Saturday singled out Paul and Murkowski. “I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!” Trump wrote on Twitter. Regarding Murkowski, he tweeted that in Alaska: “Deductibles high, people angry!” The insurance industry, hospitals, consumer activists, the AARP advocacy group and organizations such as the American Medical Association, American Heart Association and American Cancer Society all oppose the bill. Shares of some health insurers closed higher on Friday after McCain announced his opposition. Centene Corp ended up 1.6 percent,  while Humana Inc gained 0.2 percent and Aetna Inc rose 0.1 percent, reversing earlier losses. ","

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Sunday slapped new travel restrictions on citizens from North Korea, Venezuela and Chad, expanding to eight the list of countries covered by his original travel bans that have been derided by critics and challenged in court. Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Somalia were left on the list of affected countries in a new proclamation issued by the president. Restrictions on citizens from Sudan were lifted. The measures help fulfil a campaign promise Trump made to tighten U.S. immigration procedures and align with his “America First” foreign policy vision. Unlike the president’s original bans, which had time limits, this one is open-ended. “Making America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet,” the president said in a tweet shortly after the proclamation was released. Iraqi citizens will not be subject to travel prohibitions but will face enhanced scrutiny or vetting. The current ban, enacted in March, was set to expire on Sunday evening. The new restrictions are slated to take effect on Oct. 18 and resulted from a review after Trump’s original travel bans sparked international outrage and legal challenges. The addition of North Korea and Venezuela broadens the restrictions from the original, mostly Muslim-majority list. An administration official, briefing reporters on a conference call, acknowledged that the number of North Koreans now travelling to the United States was very low. Rights group Amnesty International USA condemned the measures. “Just because the original ban was especially outrageous does not mean we should stand for yet another version of government-sanctioned discrimination,” it said in a statement. “It is senseless and cruel to ban whole nationalities of people who are often fleeing the very same violence that the U.S. government wishes to keep out. This must not be normalized.” The American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement the addition of North Korea and Venezuela “doesn’t obfuscate the real fact that the administration’s order is still a Muslim ban.” The White House portrayed the restrictions as consequences for countries that did not meet new requirements for vetting of immigrants and issuing of visas. Those requirements were shared in July with foreign governments, which had 50 days to make improvements if needed, the White House said. A number of countries made improvements by enhancing the security of travel documents or the reporting of passports that were lost or stolen. Others did not, sparking the restrictions. The announcement came as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to hear oral arguments on Oct. 10 over the legality of Trump’s previous travel ban, including whether it discriminated against Muslims. Trump has threatened to “destroy” North Korea if it attacks the United States or its allies. Pyongyang earlier this month conducted its most powerful nuclear bomb test. The president  has also directed harsh criticism at Venezuela, once hinting at a potential military option to deal with Caracas. But the officials described the addition of the two countries to Trump’s travel restrictions as the result of a purely objective review. In the case of North Korea, where the suspension was sweeping and applied to both immigrants and non-immigrants, officials said it was hard for the United States to validate the identity of someone coming from North Korea or to find out if that person was a threat. “North Korea, quite bluntly, does not cooperate whatsoever,” one official said. The restrictions on Venezuela focused on Socialist government officials that the Trump administration blamed for the country’s slide into economic disarray, including officials from the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service and their immediate families. Trump received a set of policy recommendations on Friday from acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke and was briefed on the matter by other administration officials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a White House aide said. The rollout on Sunday was decidedly more organised than Trump’s first stab at a travel ban, which was unveiled with little warning and sparked protests at airports worldwide. Earlier on Sunday, Trump told reporters about the ban: “The tougher, the better.” Rather than a total ban on entry to the United States, the proposed restrictions differ by nation, based on cooperation with American security mandates, the threat the United States believes each country presents and other variables, officials said. Somalis, for example, are barred from entering the United States as immigrants and subjected to greater screening for visits. After the Sept. 15 bombing attack on a London train, Trump wrote on Twitter that the new ban “should be far larger, tougher and more specific - but stupidly, that would not be politically correct.” The expiring ban blocked entry into the United States by people from the six countries for 90 days and locked out most aspiring refugees for 120 days to give Trump’s administration time to conduct a worldwide review of U.S. vetting procedures for foreign visitors. Critics have accused the Republican president of discriminating against Muslims in violation of constitutional guarantees of religious liberty and equal protection under the law, breaking existing U.S. immigration law and stoking religious hatred. Some federal courts blocked the ban, but the U.S. Supreme Court allowed it to take effect in June with some restrictions. ","

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea told a U.N. rights panel that international sanctions imposed on it over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs would endanger the survival of North Korean children. Han Tae Song, Pyongyang’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, was speaking at a hearing of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child late on Wednesday. The panel of independent experts challenged North Korean officials over allegations of forced child labor, sexual abuse and trafficking in North Korea, Pyongyang’s health and education budget, and Internet access for children. Han said North Korea, whose population is 26 million, is a “people-centered socialist country... where protection and promotion of the rights and welfare of the child are given top priority ... There is room for improvement.” But Han said that new sanctions imposed by the United States and the U.N. Security Council over North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile tests were hampering the production of nutritional goods for children and provision of textbooks. “The persistent and vicious blockade and sanctions against the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) are not only hampering the endeavors for the protection and promotion of the rights of the child but also seriously threatening their right to survival,” he said, calling for sanctions to be lifted. The U.N. Security Council has unanimously imposed nine rounds of sanctions on North Korea since 2006, the latest earlier this month capping fuel supplies to the isolated state. Han said that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un - denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump as “Rocket Man” - “personally guides the construction in different parts of the country of schoolchildren’s palaces, children’s hospitals, baby homes, children’s homes, and primary and secondary boarding schools and works with devotion for the well-being of the young generation”. South Korea approved a plan on Thursday to send $8 million worth of aid to North Korea as China warned the crisis on the divided Korean peninsula was getting more serious by the day and the war of words between Pyongyang and Washington continued. The U.N. panel asked how North Korea’s “songbun” (caste system) that ranks citizens based on family loyalty to the ruling dynasty affected children’s access to education, health and food. The North Korean delegation replied that this was an “imaginary concept” invented by hostile forces. Human Rights Watch has called on the rights panel to press North Korea’s delegation on cases of child sexual abuse, which the New York-based group said it had documented. “The (North Korean government) report was silent on the issue of sexual abuse so the delegation was asked to provide data,” read a U.N. summary of the hearing. North Korea’s delegation said that forced child labor did not exist in the country and was banned, and that the maximum duration of young people’s work in agricultural fields was limited to three weeks per year. “In response to a question on the use of the Internet, the delegation explained that there was public control of this medium in order to give preference to access to positive information for children. In addition, all children had access to the (North Korean internal) Intranet,” the summary said. The committee will issue its conclusions on Oct. 4. ","

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"(Reuters Health) - Nearly 50 alcohol-flavored tobacco product lines are marketed by more than 400 tobacco brands in the United States and these products may especially attract teens, luring them into tobacco addiction, according to a new study. Adolescent drinking and smoking tend to go hand in hand, the authors write in the journal Tobacco Control, and the combination of alcohol flavors in tobacco products is sure to appeal to teen users. So-called characterizing flavors in cigarettes, except for menthol, are banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and these restrictions should be extended to the many flavored tobaccos for cigars, cigarillos and hookahs, as well as e-cigarette liquids, they add. “We were surprised by the large number of brands of alcohol-flavored tobacco products on the market and the wide variety of alcoholic flavors,” said lead author Dr. Robert Jackler of Stanford University in California. “Not surprisingly, sweet and fruity varieties . . . which appeal to teenagers predominated,” he told Reuters Health by email. Jackler and colleagues analyzed the top 20 U.S. brands of cigarillos and e-cigarettes using the Nielsen database, which includes unit sales in 25 major chains and 14,000 convenience stores. They also looked for the top hookah and shisha brands online. Then they searched among the top brands for products with flavors related to alcoholic beverages such as beer, appletini and margarita. The research team found 455 e-cigarette brands and more than 100 flavored cigar, cigarillo and hookah brands. The most popular fruity flavors were pina colada, mojito and margarita, and the most popular spirit flavors were rum, bourbon and whiskey. The cigars and cigarillos were marketed by large, multinational tobacco companies such as Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco, Swisher International, Swedish Match and Scandinavian Tobacco Group, and the e-cigarette flavors were nearly all offered by minor brands, the study team notes. “We found it disturbing that major international tobacco companies, which claim to be socially responsible and who profess they would never target underage youth, produce a wide spectrum of flavored mini-cigars and e-cigarettes, including quite a few with alcohol-themed names,” Jackler said. In 2009, the FDA banned flavors other than menthol from traditional cigarettes, but rulings about e-cigarettes and other tobacco products are still under discussion. Since 2009, California cities such as San Francisco, Oakland, Sonoma, El Cerrito, Manhattan Beach and Berkeley have banned some flavored tobacco products. In June, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously banned flavored tobacco. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which makes Newport menthol cigarettes, is reported to have spent $700,000 on a campaign to collect 34,000 signatures and bring a referendum before city voters. The choice will be on the ballot in June 2018. “If R.J. Reynolds spent this much money on a local policy in one city, they’re sending a message that these bans could severely hurt their business and affect who smokes,” said Dr. Pamela Ling of the University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine, who wasn’t involved with the study. “We’re going to see vociferous conversations about tobacco flavors in coming months (in San Francisco),” she told Reuters Health in a phone interview. “I think some people were misled when they were asked to sign the petition and didn’t realize what it was about.” Jackler and colleagues are now studying how flavored products are advertised to appeal to teens. They’re comparing the differences on social media channels such as Twitter, which predominantly appeals to adult smokers, and Instagram, which appeals to younger smokers, he said. “Our overall goal is to provide legislators and regulators with the evidence they need to enact effective regulations to protect American teens,” Jackler said. Ling encourages parents to be informed and take a stand in their communities as well. “Parents should take action and say they don’t want these products in their stores or neighborhoods,” she said. “There’s not a good scientific reason to leave these products on the market. We should protect our young people.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2fcHpyA Tobacco Control, August 23, 2017. ","

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"France angered Italy in July by ordering a “temporary” nationalization of STX, cancelling a deal in which Fincantieri and another Italian investor had agreed to buy 55 percent of the firm, based in Saint-Nazaire in western France. On the back of Wednesday’s deal, which will see Fincantieri effectively holding a 51 percent stake in STX France, Paris and Rome will explore the creation of a Franco-Italian naval defense group, merging French military shipyards company Naval Group with Fincantieri, Macron’s office said. France sees the creation of European champions as crucial to warding off the threat posed by industrial powers in China and the United States. The STX deal comes a day after Macron offered an ambitious vision for European renewal, calling on the continent to forge deeper cooperation. While Macron, who took office barely five months ago, initially appeared determined to protect French strategic assets at all costs, the deals between Alstom and Siemens and now Fincantieri and STX suggest he is willing to see French control diluted if it opens the way for a bigger European champion. Under the terms of Wednesday’s agreement, Fincantieri will take a 50 percent stake in STX. The French state will hold 34.34 percent, Naval Group 10 percent, STX staff 2 percent and STX local suppliers 3.66 percent. In order for Fincantieri to take effective control, the French state will lend it a one percent stake. Paris will have the right to demand the holding back if Fincantieri does not honor commitments on jobs, governance or intellectual property. Before Macron’s July intervention, Fincantieri had agreed in May to pay 79.5 million euros ($93.4 million) for a majority stake in STX France, which was being sold following the collapse of South Korean parent STX. But amid concerns about jobs and the firm’s strategic importance, Paris backtracked on that deal. An Italian Treasury source said Fincantieri had secured a better deal this time as it would now hold a 51 percent stake and not 48 percent. “Now it is possible to work on a 50-50 partnership in the civil and military ship building industry,” the source said, referring to the plans for a wider naval defense partnership. STX’s Saint-Nazaire yard is the only one big enough in France to build aircraft carriers and other large warships, making it a strategic national asset. “I hope that in the naval sector, without wishing to give away anything that might arrive this evening, we can also move towards a world giant in terms of industrial, naval construction  - on a European scale,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters earlier on Wednesday, reiterating his support for the tie-up between Siemens and Alstom.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Supporters of former South Korean president Park Geun-hye have asked a United Nations body to investigate whether her detention during her corruption trial was preventing Park from getting proper medical treatment, a barrister said on Tuesday. Park, ousted earlier this year and in detention since March, is undergoing a lower court trial for charges of abuse of power and bribery. Her current detention period for the lower court trial is due to end on October 17, which the prosecution asked the court to extend on Tuesday. A legal team working for Park’s supporters has asked the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in Geneva to look into whether Park was given medical treatment and whether there were procedural irregularities in her current trial, said Rodney Dixon QC, a London-based human rights barrister. “She is not a flight risk... She has been denied opportunity to receive adequate medical care through provisional release or options of house arrest,” said Dixon. Since her detention began in late March, Park has declined witness appearances in concurrent trials citing health issues, and various South Korean media have reported her as having chronic back and shoulder pains, difficulty sleeping and nodding off more than once during hearings. South Korea’s justice ministry, which oversees the Seoul Detention Center where Park is held, said all detainees are guaranteed ample chances to receive medical care both inside the center and at outside medical facilities when needed, and as such Park is receiving proper medical care. The ministry declined to disclose Park’s exact medical conditions as they are private. Seoul Central District Court, where Park’s trial is ongoing, directed questions about Park to the justice ministry as detention is its purview. The U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention did not respond to a request for comment. Although the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention does not have the power to enforce an action, it can seek information from the South Korean government, organize a visit to Park to investigate and announce its findings. The team working on behalf of Park’s supporters said in a statement this month it will also bring Park’s case before the U.N. Human Rights Council in November during a periodic review of South Korea’s human rights compliance. ","

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"YANGON/DHAKA (Reuters) - The United States wants Myanmar to take urgent action to end violence in Rakhine state, where a military offensive has created a crisis that could jeopardize its economic and political transition, a U.S. official said on Friday. Bangladesh and aid organizations are struggling to help 422,000 Rohingya Muslims who have arrived since Aug. 25, when attacks by Rohingya militants triggered a Myanmar crackdown that the United Nations has branded ethnic cleansing. (For graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2xTId74) A senior U.N. official said an estimated $200 million would be needed to help the refugees in Bangladesh for six months. Aid workers fear a humanitarian crisis is also unfolding in Rakhine state, though Myanmar has restricted access. “We think, urgently, actions need to be taken to stop this violence and facilitate humanitarian assistance, lower the rhetoric, lower the tension and ... start doing the hard work to solve the longer-standing problems,” U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Murphy told reporters. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has faced a barrage of international criticism over the plight of the Rohingya, for not speaking out more forcefully against the violence or doing more to rein in security forces over which she has little power. Sweden, the United States, Britain, France, Egypt, Senegal, and Kazakhstan asked on Friday for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to publicly brief the 15-member Security Council next week on the violence. Tension between majority Buddhists and Rohingya, most of whom are denied citizenship, has simmered for decades in Rakhine, but it has exploded several times over the past few years, as old enmities, and Buddhist nationalism, surfaced with the end of decades of harsh military rule. Murphy, who spent three days in Myanmar this week, said there were “many points of responsibility” and he wanted to see everyone follow through on commitments Suu Kyi made to uphold rights and the law in an address to the nation on Tuesday. “There’s the elected government, there are the security forces which have authorities that don’t fall under the purview of the civilian elected government, there are local leaders and there is the broader population, among which there are many emotions and many tensions,” he said. “Significant responsibility sits with security authorities and local officials in Rakhine state and we are looking for their cooperation to make these commitments a reality,” Murphy told reporters on a conference call from Bangkok. Myanmar dismisses accusations of ethnic cleansing, saying it has to tackle the insurgents, whom it accuses of setting fires and attacking civilians as well as the security forces. While the United States has urged action to halt the violence, China, which has close economic and political ties with Myanmar, has welcomed measures by the government to alleviate the situation in Rakhine state. Murphy said the military’s response to the August insurgent attacks had been disproportionate and the country risked a terrorist backlash. The attacks were claimed by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which Murphy referred to as a “so-called group” of which little was known. It denies links to foreign militants but the government says it is connected to global terrorism. “Whether or not this organization has ties elsewhere is not particularly germane, given the fact that it could be creating an incentive for foreign terrorists to look at a new opportunity and this is among the risks that we have shared with Burmese stakeholders,” he said. Bangladesh was already home to some 400,000 Rohingya who fled earlier bouts of violence and persecution. Given the “massive numbers” arriving in the past few weeks, the United Nations was expected to launch an appeal for $200 million to help them for the next six months, an official said. “It has not been confirmed, but it is a ballpark figure, based on the information we have,” Robert D. Watkins, U.N. resident coordinator in Bangladesh, told Reuters in an interview in Dhaka. Watkins said the situation had not stabilized in terms of new arrivals so it was difficult to say how many people to plan for, or how long. “We don’t want to plan a 10-year operation, obviously, because we want to maintain hope that there will be a way for negotiating a return of the population,” he said. “We can’t plan too far in the future, because it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy ... politically, it sends a strong signal, which we don’t want to send, which is that people are going to be here for a long time. “And our donors are not prepared to respond to anything beyond a one-year time frame, given the massive amounts of money we are asking for.” Aid groups in Bangladesh have warned of a public health disaster unless help is increased massively. “We need to scale up quickly,” said Dr N. Paranietharan, the World Health Organisation representative in Bangladesh. “If we don’t drastically improve water and sanitation we will face water-borne diseases including cholera.” ","

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"COX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Doctors treating some of the 429,000 Rohingya Muslims who have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar in recent weeks have seen dozens of women with injuries consistent with violent sexual attacks, U.N. clinicians and other health workers said. The medics’ accounts, backed in some cases by medical notes reviewed by Reuters, lend weight to repeated allegations, ranging from molestation to gang rape, levelled by women from the stateless minority group against Myanmar’s armed forces. Myanmar officials have mostly dismissed such allegations as militant propaganda designed to defame its military, which they say is engaged in legitimate counterinsurgency operations and under orders to protect civilians. Zaw Htay, spokesman for Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, said the authorities would investigate any allegations brought to them. “Those rape victim women should come to us,” he said. “We will give full security to them. We will investigate and we will take action.” Suu Kyi herself has not commented on the numerous allegations of sexual assault committed by the military against Rohingya women made public since late last year. Violence erupted in Myanmar’s northwestern Rakhine state following attacks on security forces by Rohingya militants last October. Further attacks on Aug. 25 provoked a renewed military offensive the United Nations has called “ethnic cleansing”. Reuters spoke with eight health and protection workers in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar district who between them said they had treated more than 25 individual rape cases since late August. The medics say they do not attempt to establish definitively what happened to their patients, but have seen an unmistakeable pattern in the stories and physical symptoms of dozens of women, who invariably say Myanmar soldiers were the perpetrators. It is rare for U.N. doctors and aid agencies to speak about rape allegedly committed by a state’s armed forces, given the sensitivity of the matter. Doctors at a clinic run by the U.N’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) at the Leda makeshift refugee say they treated hundreds of women with injuries they said were from violent sexual assaults during the army operation in October and November. There have been fewer rapes reported among the influx of refugees since August, said Dr. Niranta Kumar, the clinic’s health coordinator, but those they have seen have injuries suggesting “more aggressive” attacks on women. Several health workers suggested that, whereas in October many women had initially remained in their villages believing the army sweeps were only targeting Rohingya men, this time most had fled at the first sign of military activity. Doctors at the Leda clinic showed a Reuters reporter three case files, without divulging the identity of the patients. One said a 20-year-old woman was treated on Sept. 10, seven days after she said she was raped by a soldier in Myanmar. Handwritten notes say she said soldiers had “pulled her hair” and a “gun used to beat her” before raping her. Examinations often find injuries suggesting forced penetration, beating and even what looked like intentional cutting of the genitals, doctors said. “We found skin marks, it showed a very forceful attack, an inhuman attack,” said IOM medical officer Dr Tasnuba Nourin. She had seen incidents of vaginal tearing, bite marks and signs that seemed to show a firearm was used to penetrate women, she said. Among the new influx of Rohingya she had treated at least five women who appeared to have been recently raped, she said, adding that in each case the physical injuries observed were consistent with the patient’s account of what had happened. At Bangladesh government clinics supported by U.N. agencies in the Ukhia area, doctors reported treating 19 women who had been raped, said Dr. Misbah Uddin Ahmed, head of the main health complex there, citing reports from female clinicians. “The evidence included bite marks, tearing of the vagina, these sorts of things,” he said. In one day alone, Sept. 14, six women showed up at one of the clinics, all saying they were sexually assaulted. “They all said Myanmar army had done this.” An IOM doctor who asked not to be identified, working at one of those clinics near the Kutapalong refugee camp, said a woman who crossed from Myanmar in late August said she was raped by at least seven soldiers. “She was extremely weak and traumatized and said she struggled to make it to the clinic,” the doctor said. “She had a laceration on the vagina.” The doctor treated 15 of the 19 cases of women who appeared to have been raped, and another eight women who had been physically assaulted. Some were given emergency contraceptives, and all were given treatment to reduce the risk of contracting HIV and jabs against hepatitis. Symptoms included bite marks over the arms and back, tearing and laceration on the vagina and vaginal bleeding, the doctor said. Internal reports compiled by aid agencies in Cox’s Bazar recorded that 49 “SGBV survivors” were identified in just four days between Aug. 28-31. SGBV, or sexual and gender-based violence is used to refer to only cases of rape, according to U.N. doctors. Data for reported rape cases was not available for other dates. A situation report from aid agencies says more than 350 people had been referred for “life-saving care” relating to gender-based violence - a broad term that includes rape, attempted rape and molestation, as well as emotional abuse and denial of resources based on gender - since Aug. 25. It did not refer to the perpetrators. Kate White, emergency medical coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Cox’s Bazar said the charity had treated at least 23 cases of sexual and gender-based violence including gang-rape and sexual assault since Aug. 25. “This is a fraction of the cases that are likely to be out there,” she said. Reuters first reported allegations of mass rape of Rohingya women within days of militant attacks in northern Rakhine in October. The same reports were also heard by U.N. investigators who visited Bangladesh in January. A report of the U.N. Secretary General in April said the sexual assaults were “apparently employed systematically to humiliate and terrorise their community”. Before her rise to power last year Suu Kyi had spoken of rape being used as a tool of division in the country’s myriad ethnic conflicts. “It is used as a weapon by armed forces to intimidate the ethnic nationalities and to divide our country, this is how I see it,” she said in 2011 in a video message to a conference on sexual violence in conflict. Her spokesman Zaw Htay said there was “nothing to say” when asked if her view had changed since then. “Everything should be according to the rule of law,” he said. “The military leaders also have said they will take action.” ","

Christina Farr,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"Lyft and the University of Southern California are getting $1 million from insurance giant UnitedHealth to help seniors more easily access the transportation they need. As part of the grant, USC's researchers will study whether taking rides can reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation in seniors and improve their health by helping them get to medical appointments on time. The funds will be used for a pilot program run by the AARP Foundation in Los Angeles. It will provide free Lyft rides to a group of USC Keck Medical Center patients over 60 who have missed at least 2 medical appointments within the past year and have an upcoming appointment on the books. The rides will be available for 3 months. These patients will also receive a Fitbit activity tracker, and are encouraged to log their daily activities. Additional pilots are scheduled for Chicago and Atlanta in 2018. Studies have found that transportation gaps result in many low-income seniors missing or delaying their doctor's visits, which is associated with worse health outcomes. It's also an expensive problem for insurance companies, as these patients are more likely to end up in the emergency room. For Lyft, the business case is clear as it looks to engage new demographics, including seniors, and pick up new sources of revenue in the $6 billion non-emergency medical transportation market. Beyond this specific study, the company is working with a mix of commercial and government insurers will typically foot the bill. ""We want to study whether we can reduce these no-show rates and provide a better experience for elder populations,"" said Lyft's Dan Trigub, who works on health care solutions. Lyft is providing training on how to use the app and it allows a phone-based service for those who lack a smartphone. In that case, the car typically arrives within 30 minutes. Trigub said drivers will be be aware that they need to pickup riders with service animals. That's an issue that got Uber into legal trouble back in 2015. He also said that there's no additional cost for caregivers to join the ride. Ultimately, he said, ""we want to be the premier solution for elder, low-income and underserved populations."" Uber has also made steps into the health and medical market. It ran its own pilot program in 2015 to deliver flu shot packages to workplaces and homes.

Dan Mangan,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"Slightly fewer than half of all Americans were vaccinated for the flu last season, a top federal health official warned Thursday, as he called for nearly every person to get a shot by October for the coming season. ""The science on flu vaccination is clear,"" said Dr. Tom Price, secretary of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. ""Vaccination can help prevent you or someone you love from becoming sick and missing school, or work, or worse, becoming severely ill or being hospitalized from or even dying from the flu."" The hospitalization rate last season for influenza was nearly double that of the 2015-2016 season, officials said. Price himself got vaccinated Thursday during a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington. Tweet He said that for this season, health officials are recommending only injectable vaccines, not nasal spray flu vaccine. ""I urge everyone 6 months and older to do the same as soon as vaccine is available in their community,"" said Price. He noted that next year is the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of Spanish flu, which infected a half billion people, and killed up to 5 percent of the world's population. Data released Thursday showed that while there were slight increases in the vaccination rates among people most vulnerable to the flu — adults over age 50 — there were ""mostly stagnant vaccination rates among all age groups,"" according to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. The flu vaccination rate among all Americans was 48.6 percent last season, up just 1.2 percentage points from the prior season. Among children age 6 months through 23 months, the vaccination rate was 76.3 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was the only age group that exceeded the public health goal of 70 percent vaccination coverage, according to NFID. Officials said that for the 2017-2018 season, vaccine manufacturers have estimated that as many as 166 million doses of flu vaccine will be available nationally. More than 73 million doses have already been delivered. The vaccines this season have been modified to protect against the flu viruses that research suggests will be most common in coming months. Price took no questions at the news conference. The health secretary in the past week has come under heavy criticism after the news site Politico revealed he had taken 26 flights on private jets since May, at a cost to taxpayers of more than $400,000. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he is ""not happy"" with Price's use of charter flights. Trump answered, ""We'll see,"" when asked if he would fire Price.

John Harwood,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"Flickering hopes to repeal Obamacare this year rest on a simple Republican argument: By the virtues of federalism, states will do it better than Washington. That's how Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy tout their plan to shrink Obamacare spending by $215 billion in 2026 and distribute the reduced amount to states through health-care block grants. Even with less federal cash, the sponsors say, states can improve health care through greater efficiency and appreciation for the needs of their residents. The problem, according to experts on state government, is there's no reason to believe it will work out that way. Evidence doesn't back up the prospect of large efficiency gains. And in significant parts of the country, states have shown themselves unwilling or unable to implement the level of services Obamacare calls for. ""It would be very difficult for many states to be able to do that,"" said Christine Todd Whitman, the former New Jersey governor and Cabinet member under President George W. Bush. The current governor, her fellow Republican Chris Christie, opposes Graham-Cassidy on grounds that the projected the loss of $4 billion in federal funds would be ""too injurious"" to New Jersey. Other states that would lose money are also not counting on their superior management to make up the difference. Republican governors such as John Kasich of Ohio, Bill Walker of Alaska and Susana Martinez of New Mexico have broken party ranks to oppose the bill. ""It's going to be impossible for the states to make up the shortfall with greater efficiencies,"" concludes Donald Kettl, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland. He points to 2016 data on Medicare, which is administered by the federal government, and Medicaid, administered by the states. Their rates of improper payments — 11 percent and 10.48 percent, respectively — were nearly the same. By design, the Graham-Cassidy block grant formula takes money from states that have shown greater commitment and capacity to improve health care by expanding their Medicaid programs and signing up more people to state-level Obamacare marketplaces. It redistributes the money to states that have shown less commitment and capacity, without prescribing how they have to use it. That design represents the marriage of partisanship to philosophy. States gaining money are mostly governed by the GOP, which favors a smaller government role in health care and other forms of public assistance. For decades, the United States has moved to narrow disparities among states in top-priority services and protections. On health care, it began with the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s, and continued more recently with the Children's Health Insurance Program program and Obamacare. Similar shifts toward uniform federal protections took place in other realms, such as the safeguards of the Clean Air Act of 1963, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The nation decided, as Kettl puts it, that ""If we wait for the states, we're never going to get there."" If Graham-Cassidy were enacted, big differences among state political cultures would widen state-by-state differences in the quality of health services, predicts Richard Nathan, a leading authority on federalism at the Rockefeller Institute of Government. At a time when information technology gives Americans increasingly common national experiences in commerce and culture, Nathan calls such a move ""incomprehensible."" ""It is, to me, incredible that this is being seriously considered,"" said Nathan, who advised Republican President Richard Nixon as a top budget aide. He advocates both near-term stabilization of existing Obamacare marketplaces and longer-term tax policy shifts to reduce health costs nationally. Whitman cites public opposition to an Obamacare repeal as a sign her party ""would be wise"" to accept the federal government's health-care role. She wants Congress to set aside the Graham-Cassidy proposal and resume bipartisan talks on improving marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act. ""On any issue this big and this complex, it needs to have everybody at the table,"" Whitman said. ""It would make for much better legislation.""

Diana Olick,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"From a broad view, the U.S. housing market looks very healthy. Demand is high, employment and wages are growing, and mortgage rates are low. But the nation's housing market is assuredly unhealthy; in fact, it is increasingly mismatched with today's buyers. While the big numbers don't lie, they don't tell the real truth about the affordability and availability of U.S. housing for the bulk of would-be buyers. First, several reports out this week point to both continued heat in home values as well as pushback from homebuyers. Prices remain nearly 6 percent higher than they were a year ago, nationally, with some local markets seeing double-digit annual price gains. Those prices are being driven by a severe lack of supply at the low end of the market, which is where the most demand exists. That means lower-priced homes are seeing bigger price gains than higher-priced homes because of the competition. At the same time, sales are falling, again, because there are too few homes on the low end, and the homes that are available are very expensive. ""It sets up a situation in which the housing market looks largely healthy from a 50,000-foot view, but on the ground, the situation is much different, especially for younger, first-time buyers and/or buyers of more modest means,"" wrote Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow in a response to the latest home-price data. ""Supply is low in general, but half of what is available to buy is priced in the top one-third of the market."" Supply on the low end is tight because during the housing crash investors large and small bought hundreds of thousands of foreclosed properties and turned them into rentals. There are currently 8 million more renter-occupied homes than there were in 2007, the peak of the housing boom, according to the U.S. Census. Investors could take the opportunity of high prices and high demand to sell these properties, but today's high rents offer them better returns. Low supply of homes for sale might also seem like a great opportunity for the nation's homebuilders. Yes, they went through an epic housing crash, but they have since consolidated market share and righted their balance sheets. Homebuilders are simply not building enough inexpensive houses that the market needs. That is why sales of newly built homes, like existing homes, have been disappointing. The latest read on August new home sales from the U.S. Census surprised analysts with a 3.4 percent monthly drop, along with a rise in inventory. The homes are there, they're just not selling, and it's not hard to figure out why. ""The recent home sales data has reflected a slower pace and I continue to believe it's due to more a push back on pricing,"" wrote Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst with the Lindsey Group, in a response to the data release. Just 2 percent of newly built homes sold in August were priced under $150,000, and just 14 percent priced under $200,000. Compare that with the existing home market, where more than half of homes sold in August were priced under $250,000. Builders say they would like to build more affordable homes but cannot because the math doesn't work. The costs of land, labor, materials and regulatory compliance are just too high. In addition, younger homebuyers want to live closer to urban areas, not in the far-out exurbs, where builder costs are far lower. ""It's time we stopped sugarcoating the truth with this data — the simple fact is that we are severely underproducing housing in this country, relative both to basic demographics and currently high demand from buyers,"" wrote Gudell, who notes that inventory is stuck at roughly mid-1990s levels, but the country has grown by more than 60 million people since then. ""Buying conditions, in theory, are great right now: Jobs and incomes are growing, and rock-bottom mortgage interest rates are helping keep financing costs low. What's missing from the equation is a lack of homes actually available to buy at a price point that's reasonable for most buyers."" The trouble is, even though the market is woefully mismatched, home prices will not come down as long as there are some buyers out there willing and able to spend more and more money for less and less house. ""We expect price pressure to remain pretty strong well into the fall,"" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin. ""First-time buyers are struggling to find a footing in this market. The first-time buyer share is down from historical levels, but the thing is, you don't need everyone to buy a house in this market. As long as there are one or two buyers who can afford, and those buyers can be investors, then the sale will go through, and that's what we're seeing at some level."" So, what does all this mean for the economy and personal wealth? It means the renter nation will persist and fewer Americans will be able to save and grow their money in a home. It also means rents will continue to rise due to high demand, leaving more Americans with less disposable income to spend. In other words, it's not healthy.

Cheang Ming,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"Asian markets were pressured in Tuesday trade, following declines on Wall Street overnight, as the war of words between North Korea and the U.S. escalated. Japan's Nikkei 225 sank 0.33 percent, or 67.39 points, to close at 20,330.19, after the yen strengthened overnight as investors focused on North Korea. Across the Korean Strait, the Kospi declined 0.26 percent to finish the session at 2,374.32 as geopolitical tensions weighed, although the index was off lows touched earlier in the session. Blue chip tech stocks sold off following Wall Street's lead. Samsung Electronics closed down 3.66 percent, SK Hynix tumbled 4.87 percent and LG Electronics fell 2.97 percent. Down Under, the S&P/ASX 200 slid 0.22 percent to end at 5,671. The 1.91 percent gain in the energy sub-index was offset by losses in retailers. The information technology and health care sub-indexes fell by 0.8 percent and 0.75 percent respectively. Greater China markets were mixed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was off 0.06 percent by 3:07 p.m. HK/SIN. On the mainland, the Shanghai Composite inched higher by 0.07 percent to close at 3,343.8274 and the Shenzhen Composite was nearly unchanged, adding 0.007 percent to end at 1,964.0305. The broader MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index was 0.37 percent lower by 3:30 p.m. HK/SIN. Geopolitical tensions came to the fore again overnight after North Korea's foreign minister said U.S. President Donald Trump had declared war. Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that meant the North could target and shoot down U.S. bombers in return. The White House responded that the U.S. had not declared war on the hermit state late on Monday. The ramp up in saber-rattling followed Trump's speech at the United Nations last week, where the president had warned that if forced, the U.S. would have ""no choice but to totally destroy North Korea."" Safe haven assets were buoyed, with spot gold remaining above the $1,300 level reached overnight. The yellow metal, often regarded as a safe haven in times of geopolitical uncertainty, was mostly unchanged from overnight levels at $1,309.42 an ounce at 2:55 p.m. HK/SIN compared with the $1,290 handle most of last week. The Japanese currency extended overnight gains to trade at 111.59 yen to the dollar after trading at the 112 handle during Asian trade on Monday. The yen had firmed slightly following the release of the Bank of Japan's July minutes on Tuesday. The minutes indicated policymakers were optimistic about consumer prices, with some stating that a 2 percent inflation target was a global standard, Reuters said. Markets stateside were jittery on Monday, with a fall in technology stocks adding to declines in major indexes. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 0.24 percent, or 53.5 points, to close at 22,296.09. Analysts said North Korea's accusation that Trump had declared war had made markets nervous. ""The comments have taken the wind out of the sails just when risk was looking fairly upbeat as we headed into Europe, despite the uncertainty around the elections. That said, it's hardly panic selling and the moves look measured and contained,"" said Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG. Elsewhere, the euro was mostly flat after retreating following the German election on Sunday. While provisional results showed German Chancellor Angela Merkel's party had the most votes, she will likely face a tough coalition negotiation. Support for a far-right party was also larger than expected. The common currency traded at $1.1848 at 2:57 p.m. HK/SIN, around its lowest levels since late August. Also in politics, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Monday he would be dissolving the lower house of parliament on Sept. 28 ahead of a snap election expected on Oct. 22, Reuters said. Investors also digested comments from New York Fed President William Dudley and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans. Dudley said Monday that the central bank was on the path to slowly increasing interest rates as ""temporary"" factors affecting inflation faded, Reuters said. Evans adopted a more cautious tone, stating that the Fed had to wait for marked signs that prices were increasing before raising rates. In corporate news, the sale of Toshiba's memory chip unit to a group led by Bain Capital for $18 billion had yet to be signed, according to Reuters. Toshiba had informed its banks on Monday that Apple, which is part of the consortium, had not agreed with conditions in the sale. Toshiba stock finished the session lower by 0.66 percent. Apple suppliers in Asia were lower after the tech giant saw its shares fall around 0.9 percent on Monday. Apple had reportedly informed suppliers to reduce shipments for one of its latest models, the iPhone X, Reuters reported. Taiwan-listed suppliers finished the session lower: Hon Hai Precision Industry closed down 1.43 percent and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company slid 1.38 percent. Samsung Electronics fell along most other South Korean tech stocks, while Hong Kong's AAC Technologies Holding fell 1.1 percent by 2:58 p.m. HK/SIN. On the energy front, oil prices were a touch lower after rising more than 3 percent overnight. Brent crude lost 0.12 percent to trade at $58.95 a barrel after its highest levels in more than 2 years earlier. U.S. crude was off 0.23 percent at $52.10. Prices were buoyed after Turkey on Monday warned it could stop crude flows from Iraq to the rest of the world in response to the Kurdish autonomous region's bid for independence, Reuters said.

"SurveyMonkey's Jon Cohen, chief research officer, and Laura Wronski, research scientist",09282017,CNBC,09212017,"President Trump's tax-reform proposal calls for cutting the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, emphasizing the need ""to help the small businesses that are the true engine of our economy."" The plan the GOP leadership is expected to reveal on Wednesday is still unknown, though there has been talk of a reduction to 20 percent in the corporate rate, not the 15 percent Trump wanted. Either way, small-business owners in the latest CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey have only tepid expectations about tax reform ahead. Not even a third of them expect changes in tax policy to give their businesses a boost, and just about as many anticipate tax policy changes being a drag on their operations (31 percent expect positive changes; 27 percent negative ones). A narrow, 40 percent plurality don't expect such reform to have much of an impact at all. The lukewarm outlook runs counter to the broader support Trump gets among small-business owners, nearly half of whom (47 percent) report paying effective tax rates in excess of 15 percent last year. Another complicating factor: Nearly a quarter of all small-business owners indicated they didn't even know how to bucket their effective tax rate. After all, it's complicated, which is part of the point of reform. One reason for gaps in perceived tax burdens is the difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate — in simpler terms, the tax rate as it is written in the law and the tax rate that corporations actually pay after deductions are taken off, while state taxes are added on. Few corporations pay an effective tax rate as high as their statutory rate. According to a 2013  Congressional Budget Office analysis, the effective tax rate for corporations in the United States is 18.6 percent, significantly less than the 35 percent cap. More from the CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey:Main Street confidence in Trump slips, even among conservatives
Main Street hopes for tax-reform boom decline For example, small businesses with fewer than 25 employees may qualify for the  Small Business Health Care Tax Credit, which incentivizes employers to provide health care for their employees. Among small-business owners, ""taxes"" and the ""cost of employee health care"" are named as the top two most critical issues facing their businesses (mentioned by 22 percent and 18 percent of small-business owners, respectively). These competing demands may create a trade-off for small-business owners deciding how to best balance their accounts while providing for their employees. The new data comes from the quarterly CNBC/SurveyMonkey, which interviewed 2,282 small-business owners from Aug. 10–17. In a recent interview, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that small businesses can have effective  tax rates as high as 44.6 percent and spoke of the need to relieve some of that tax burden. That statistic may be true of a few small businesses, but not the vast majority. In our survey, the same proportion of small-business owners reported effective business tax rates at either extreme: 7 percent say their effective tax rate is 0 percent; 7 percent say their effective tax rate is greater than 35 percent. However, those business owners who fall into that top 7 percent have a lot to gain if Trump's tax-reform proposals are enacted, and they are appropriately the most optimistic at such a prospect. A clear majority (59 percent) of small-business owners in this tax bracket expect changes in tax policy to have a positive effect on their businesses in the next 12 months. They are also more likely than anyone else to name ""taxes"" as the most critical issue facing their businesses (35 percent do so, compared to just 6 percent of small-business owners with an effective tax rate of 0 percent). Trump's approval rating is highest among these small-business owners who have the most to gain from tax reform. Nearly 3 in 4 small-business owners (73 percent) who have the highest effective tax rates say they approve of the way Trump is handling his presidency. For comparison, just 41 percent of small-business owners whose businesses have effective tax rates of zero percent approve of Trump, as do only 35 percent of those whose businesses are taxed at 1 percent to 10 percent. Though this group represents a small proportion of small-business owners overall, they stand to reap outsized benefit if tax reform actually passes. — SurveyMonkey's Jon Cohen, chief research officer, and Laura Wronski, research scientist The CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey is conducted quarterly using  SurveyMonkey's online platform and based on its survey methodology.

 ,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"Following is the transcript of a ""First On"" CNBC interview with Wilbur Ross, U.S. Commerce Secretary. The interview was broadcast on CNBC on 27 September 2017. All references must be sourced to a ""CNBC Interview"". Interviewed by Bernie Lo, Anchor and Akiko Fujita, Correspondent, CNBC. PART 1 Bernie Lo (BL): You had a nice sit down in the great hall with the Premier Li Keqiang and you told him what you expected in November. You get everything you wanted? Wilbur Ross: Well we'll know in November. We had very good discussions with a variety of the Chinese officials but this was the first chat that we really had on that topic. So we'll see in the coming days exactly how it turns out. And then after today I'm on my way to Bangkok and then to Laos. Akiko Fujita (AF): This of course comes at a time when the U.S. is putting increasing pressure on China to crack down on North Korea. Last week, we heard the PBOC calling Chinese banks to stop doing business with North Korea. We've also seen Beijing vowed to ban exports of oil exports or exports of oil. In your conversations in China what assurances did you get from the leadership that they will in fact follow through on these promises? Wilbur Ross: Well that's really a matter more for the Department of State, Department of Treasury and Defense. But I got the impression they were quite serious about living up to the commitments that they've made regarding North Korea. BL: What you say, they're very serious. It took until last week for the central bank to actually issue those statements and formally make the requests. It seems like, you know, a lot of people would have thought, a lot of our viewers were surprised that that hadn't been done long long ago as part of previous sanctions. Do you feel assured or what insurances do you have that on the trade front on your part on your mandate that they're cooperating. Wilbur Ross: On the sanctions side we've been gradually ramping them up. So this was a logical next step in the sanctions. And a very very important one because the Chinese commercial banks had been a big route for facilitation of trade to North Korea. So the fact that the PBOC which is the central bank has really put out a taboo. That's a very big deal. AF: There's Chinese customs data that came out that showed Pyongyang earned more coal export income in August than in January or February. Certainly the Chinese buying this up. This of course came before the latest UN sanctions. Doesn't that show that China is not entirely on board in cooperating in cracking down on North Korea. Wilbur Ross: I think what you need to do is to look forward rather than backward. And that's a gigantic step for the PBOC step. So assuming that it's followed through and assuming that the other parts of the sanctions are followed through that's a very good sign. It's very very important pressure. AF: So looking forward, what is the measure for the administration on the effectiveness of the sanctions. You've got the sanctions in place now at what point do you, can you determine that they have been effective in not just clamping down on North Korea's economy but the weapons program itself? Wilbur Ross: Well remember the sanctions are an end in themselves, they're a means to an end. What we're hoping will happen is that this will bring a sensible resolution of the situation over there. BL: We have talked a lot about you know what China can do on the official front versus the you know the unofficial economy. There's a great deal of trade, there's a great deal of, you know, don't want to a black market necessarily but, you know, unofficial transactions that go on. Were those discussed at all? Did you bring those up with the Chinese? Wilbur Ross: No, my mission is not that. My mission was the pure trade parts and trying to get organized for the president's visit. BL: You say you, you know obviously we want as say look forward not backward at the past history but what can be done in the future. This is what we have right now. But you know between the U.S. and China President Xi Jinping has made a great deal about you know ahead the 19th Congress he'll talk more about it. But about Made in China 2025 and which you know very well what that means. And as the narrative goes you know foreign participation the Chinese economy is always a difficult difficult juggernaut. I mean foreign content, the rules on partnering, that sort of thing. The narrative is that the PRC by 2025 wants to use automation and higher technology to boot out foreign participation, particularly Americans from the internal economy. Wilbur Ross: Well I think that's going a little further than 2025 actually. When I don't think they named America as such in the 2025 but clearly they want to become more self-sufficient in areas like semiconductors of which they are the world's largest consumer. We don't mind competition. We just want the competition to be on a fair and level playing field. And that means not so much in the way of trade barriers. Not so much in the way of protectionist activities. Not so much in the way of impediments to companies operating there. Not so much in the way of forced technology trends through things of that sort. BL: But we know that we know that the game is stacked. We know that China games this playing field in their own favor. And yet from 2002 until last year there were 38 cases involving force transfer of technology IP infringement filed against China. There were 78 filed by various countries around the world against the United States in that same time. Why is that? It sounds like a WTO was not designed for modern China. Wilbur Ross: Well I don't think the WTO was designed necessarily for the modern trade world especially China but all parts of it. It's an archaic system. Remember this is the outgrowth of GATT which came into effect right after World War 2. That point in time the U.S. had concentrated surpluses and had made a very basic policy decision to help Asian and European countries recover from the ravages of World War 2. Problem is the things that were put in place with WTO back then haven't been changed. But it's very hard to say that China as now the world's second largest economy needs the same sort of preferential treatment that might have justified to have decades ago. AF: Let me ask you about the administration's investigation into steel dumping because there are reports that suggest the president rejected a proposal that would have led - the proposal from China that would have led to significant cuts and steel overcapacity which is something that you had endorsed. What specifically is the administration's seeking on this issue? Wilbur Ross: Well what we're seeking is an overall improvement in trade. And if you look at our trade balance, there's one geographic source of our imbalance and that's most importantly China. And there's one product source of our imbalance and that's mostly automobiles. Now the automobiles are not particularly from China. China is not yet exporting any meaningful number of cars especially not to U.S. If you solve the geographic problem and you solve the product problem you've pretty well solved our trade problem. AF: This is of course a complex issue that comes at a very tentious time over in the U.S. as you're trying to push forward with tax reform. Is the administration willing to table some of these trade issues that perhaps some Republicans are not onboard with in order to get them onboard with tax reform. Wilbur Ross: Well President Trump has made it clear that he's delayed this deal and some other events in trade in order to clear the decks so we don't have anything that confuses people while we try to get the tax thing. The tax program is the single most important thing after, obviously the budget and the lifting of the debt ceiling, but going forward the tax reform is important. Why. If you work it right it will increase the GDP growth by one percentage points, so 100 basis points. What does that mean over 10 years. Ten trillion dollars more GDP. 3 trillion dollars more revenues to the federal government. Those are gigantic numbers even for a country the size of the U.S. So the tax changes could be transformative events. BL: When you talk about tax reform, when you talk about tax reform repatriation of overseas you know bundles of cash, there are a lot of American MNCs have it's a very big part of the conversation. Wilbur Ross: Oh yes. And it's a very important objective. We believe that there will be a vast amount of it brought back if the president's notion of a very reduced rate on the immediate repatriation is goes through. So that's a very important part of our tax reform. And then the last important part is individual tax reform. Both rates not so much with the high end but for the middle and lower people. And simplification. Guess how many hours Americans spend filling up their tax returns each year, 6 billion. Imagine how much better an economy we'd have been if those 6 billion hours were devoted to productive activity, not trying to figure out the meaning of a 100 page tax instruction form. AF: And very quickly, is 15 percent corporate tax rate pretty much off the table? Are we looking at a low 20 percent? Wilbur Ross: We've not made an announcement. President Trump has indicated his goal and his hope would be to get as close to the 15 percent as we possibly can. PART 2 BL: Secretary, want to ask you, the whole issue, you know, one of the first things the president did was say ok out of TPP. Everybody else is coalescing. China tried to take the mantle at that point to say, we are holding the mantle, we are the shining light of free trade and all that. Is there a rethink, is there some sort of reformation or a rethink going through the administration right now whether it's really good to isolate the U.S. or give the impression that the U.S. is isolating itself from so many things in the world. Wilbur Ross: That was never our intention to isolate ourselves. That's the fiction that the media had invented. The idea though because we didn't think TPP was an advantageous deal for the United States. So we rejected the deal, not the geography. And if you notice, since the election and since the inauguration Vice President Pence and I were in Japan, he's going back again shortly. I'm over here now going through China, through Hong Kong, through Thailand, through Laos. We've got all kinds of people out here. And that's partly to show quite visibly that we're not forsaking the region at all. The region is hugely important to us. So it's different to say you're rejecting a particular contract from saying we're rejecting the region. Take for example NAFTA we're certainly not rejecting Mexico and Canada we're just saying we think the commercial arrangements with them need to be reformed. AF: The intention is not isolation but as Bernie pointed out we have seen several multilateral trade deals going forward. TPP 11 of course looking to get signed by November. We've got RCEP led by China. We've got the Japan Europe free trade deal that's still being hammered out. I mean this is a trade bloc that would be equivalent to NAFTA. Do those deals come at the expense of the US? Wilbur Ross: I don't think so because we after all are the largest of those import markets. So the trading position that we have, the need for these other countries to get better access to our market, those continue. Plus I would point out those deals have not been finalized. Those are deals under discussion. Big difference between discussion and finalization. And then when they do get finalized. Big question is well what do they really mean. What are the real provisions that are going into effect. BL: Pandora's Box, I mean to use an analogy that's been opened here by revisiting NAFTA after all these years. This morning you came armed with your cell with you. Announcement of commerce you know issuing countervailing duties against mid-sized aircraft made in Canada. There's only one aircraft maker I know in Canada and that's Bombardier and they make 100 to 150 seaters. This wouldn't have happened in the past, would it? Wilbur Ross: Oh sure. This is unrelated to NAFTA. There have been trade complaints back and forth ever since NAFTA was started. The Bombardier thing is very specific. It says the Boeing Company brought an action which we're now processing. Their actions said that the Quebec and the Canadian government illegally subsidize the development of that aircraft. So what came out today was our preliminary determination that that was the case. Now there are a couple more procedural steps so it will be some months before a final determination is made. But this with or without NAFTA this kind of action would have been brought. AF: There are several changes that the administration is taking in NAFTA. One of them is stricter rules of origin. I'm wondering what concessions the U.S. is willing to make to get there. Would you for example or would the administration for example be willing to back off on arbitration panels. Wilbur Ross: Well those are whole complicated issues. The day to day, the negotiations as you know are being handled by the U.S. trade rep. and I think it'd be very tricky for me to comment on bids that haven't been announced while everything is still being negotiated. Because you don't have a deal and anything till you have a deal on everything. AF: Let me follow up very quickly on TPP 11 because Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Japan has made it very clear that they are leading this deal in the hopes that the U.S. will eventually come back to the table. You pointed out that you weren't against TPP 11 multi trade deal per se, it was more about the conditions. Under what conditions would the U.S. be willing to come back to the table on that? Wilbur Ross: Well again we felt that we were giving up much more than we were getting in. And it's much more complicated than we can deal with this morning. It's thousands of page agreement but that's fundamentally the issue that we had with the TPP before. But regardless of who had won the election TPP was dead. There was no political will power either in the Democratic side or the Republican side to go ahead with TPP. So it's a little silly to call that an act by the Trump administration. We administered the coup de gras but it was going to happen in any event. BL: Mr. Secretary is there a, you know, the administration is going on what, 10 month old now. AF: End of September. BL: Yeah 10 months. You know when you signed on for the job, you were coming from private industry. You were a very happy, very successful person on your own. You didn't need this. Wilbur Ross: Well I'm still very happy. BL: OK. I'm glad to know that, I'm really glad, I'm so happy to know that, but because you know we've seen a lot of people come and go it's been a revolving door in many cases you know with a lot of people that were there at the start, gone. But I mean when you signed up for the job did you expect to be here almost a year into the job? And may I add to that. Is there some sort of a, I think everybody in this part of the world wants to know, Trump is in the news every day and if it's not one thing, it's the other. You know he is fighting the NFL for kneeling you know or for sitting during the anthem while he's trying to take on North Korea. Is there some sort of end game, is there some sort of method to the, I could use for lack of a better word, chaos. Wilbur Ross: Well first of all, I don't think there is chaos. Any time you have a new administration particularly a shift from one party that had been in the administration for eight years to another one. You're bound to have a lot of new faces come in. And with hundreds of people with high testosterone coming into the White House the idea that there would be a little pulling and tugging surely is not a strange idea. So that's normal to administrations. What's a little unusual here is it's so public. And the reason it's so public is, the media are intensely focused on Washington now more than I think ever and frankly a lot of the media folks still can't get over the fact that President Trump in fact is the president, is going to be the president, I hope for eight years, not just four. AF: Well you've also got a president who is tweeting on a daily basis. That's partly why some of these thoughts are so public. I mean. I wonder you know, you came in this in January, you're nine months into the job have things moved along a little slower than you expected and how frustrating is it on a daily basis. Yes the media can be focused on it but the reality is the president is sending out mixed messages. How frustrating is it to see those distractions. Because in the end it's derailing from the core goal here and the legislative agenda. Wilbur Ross: Well I don't think it's derailing from the core goal. One disappointment has been Congress's inability to come to conclusions on health care. And we hope that's not a warning sign that they'll have equal problems with other pieces of legislation. The administration's been moving ahead. We've brought 48 percent more trade cases this year than we did last year. ","CNBC Transcript: Wilbur Ross, U.S. Secretary of Commerce"
Ali Montag,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"North Korea's dictator Kim Jong Un and the United States President Donald Trump are at odds. Over recent weeks, rhetoric surrounding North Korea's nuclear ambitions has been intensifying. Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department heightened the tensions by implementing economic sanctions, according to the Treasury. As the two leaders become more deeply entangled, expert Chris Voss tells CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" that both have distinct approaches to negotiation. Voss is an expert in persuasion and served as the lead international kidnapping negotiator for the FBI until 2008, according to his website. Before that, he was the lead crisis negotiator for the New York City division of the FBI and a member of the New York City Joint Terrorist Task Force. He's also the founder of business consulting company, The Black Swan Group. Here's what he sees in each leader's style. Voss sums up Trump's style as assertive. ""He's actually the kind of negotiator that as a hostage negotiator I had to learn how to get the upper hand on, without making them mad, without making it worse,"" he explains. Voss calls Trump ""an assertive, openly aggressive negotiator."" And the problem with that style, explains Voss, is that ""people get tired of dealing with them."" As an example, Voss points to Trump's recent openness to working with Democrats on policy projects like tax reform and health care. ""The reason why he's going to the Democrats is because Republicans are tired of him,"" Voss says. A negotiating tactic that works better is deference, says Voss. ""You know, I can say, 'You have to give me this,' in a demanding way or I can say, 'Look, if we don't put this on the table we can't make a deal.' ""There is great power in deference,"" he says. ""Deference works with everybody."" As for North Korea's leader, who has a tendency toward self importance, with someone like that you should ask ""what does he see in the future that he wants?"" Voss says. ""I want to pick a place in the future that you're going to like, that I want to take you to,"" he says. If both sides can agree on that, ""Now, you're going to be a little bit more cooperative."" More from iCONIC: ",Ex-FBI agent on what you can learn about negotiating from Donald Trump
Keith Speights,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett is, without question, one of the greatest investors of all time. Over the past 50 years, the company he runs, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), has generated compounded average annual returns of 20.8% -- trouncing the S&P 500. However, the oracle of Omaha hasn't beaten the market nearly as much in recent years. One reason why just might be Buffett's greatest weakness: He hasn't been very good at investing in healthcare. Image source: Getty Images. Warren Buffett once famously stated, ""If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes."" Looking at Berkshire Hathaway's investments in the 21st century, however, shows that Buffett hasn't always appeared to be willing to own healthcare stocks for 10 years. He probably wishes he had. For example, Buffett added large health insurance stock UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) to Berkshire's portfolio in late 2006. In early 2007, Berkshire bought another health insurer, Wellpoint, which later became Anthem.By the first quarter of 2010, though, Buffett had sold both stocks. We don't know the exact date when Berkshire bought its positions in the two health-insurance stocks. However, it's a certainty that Buffett lost by double-digit percentages on both positions. He might have lost more than 30% on UnitedHealth Group. But just look at how both stocks have performed compared with Berkshire Hathaway stock since the end of the first quarter of 2010 -- after Buffett sold Anthem (Wellpoint) and UnitedHealth Group. UNH data by YCharts Both of the stocks that Buffett wasn't willing to hold onto for 10 years went on to greatly outperform his own company's stock. UnitedHealth Group nearly quadrupled Berkshire's gains during the period after Buffett sold his shares in the health insurer. But that's not the only time Buffett threw in the towel too early on a healthcare stock. In the third quarter of 2011, Berkshire bought CVS Caremark stock, now known as CVS Health. By the second quarter of 2012, less than a year later, Berkshire no longer owned the giant pharmacy-services company. Buffett probably made a profit on CVS Health stock, but he forfeited additional gains of close to 70% if he had kept his shares. Berkshire Hathaway currently owns three healthcare stocks: DaVita (NYSE:DVA), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Sanofi. Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi have been in Berkshire's portfolio since 2006, while DaVita was added in 2011. At first glance, you might think it's good that at least Buffett has retained some healthcare stocks for the long term rather than selling too early. There's more to the story, though. Buffett drastically cut his position in J&J in 2012 by roughly 95%. At the time, he was quoted as saying the company had ""some wonderful products and a wonderful balance sheet, but too many mistakes have been made."" Those mistakes primarily referred to several J&J product recalls. You probably know where this is going. Had Buffett held on to his J&J stock, his initial large stake in the healthcare giant would have nearly doubled. With dividends included, Johnson & Johnson would have beaten Berkshire's performance in the period following Buffett's big sell-off. What about the two healthcare stocks for which Buffett hasn't slashed his positions? Sanofi has generated stock returns in the single-digit percentages at best over the 11 years it's been in Berkshire's portfolio. Dividends make the overall return look better, but Sanofi has still greatly underperformed Berkshire during the period. As for DaVita, Buffett didn't sell shares of the dialysis services provider but instead added to his position over several years. However, like most of his other healthcare investments, it hasn't turned out all that great, either. DaVita stock has been on a general decline since 2015. Since Berkshire added DaVita, its returns have badly trailed both Berkshire stock and the S&P 500. BRK.A data by YCharts Warren Buffett is a very wealthy man, but he'd probably be much wealthier -- as would Berkshire Hathaway shareholders -- if he had made better decisions on healthcare stocks. If Berkshire's having added no new healthcare holdings in the past five years is any indication, it could be that Buffett will decide to avoid healthcare entirely in the future. On the other hand, Buffett is a smart man and no doubt realizes the potential for the healthcare industry. With the baby boomer generation aging, demand for healthcare services will definitely rise. New healthcare technologies hold the potential to generate fortunes for astute investors. It only takes one big winner to make all the losing stocks in an investment portfolio seem irrelevant. That's been the case for Buffett overall. He once said, ""What we learn from history is that people don't learn from history."" Warren Buffett is a student of history. Don't underestimate his ability to learn from his past mistakes. ","
      
    Could This Be Warren Buffett's Greatest Weakness? -- The Motley Fool

Sean Williams,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In just over five weeks, open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is best known as Obamacare, will begin. The upcoming enrollment period could very well rival the first enrollment period (Oct. 2013 – March 2014) as the most challenging yet, given the uncertainties surrounding what might happen to now-former President Barack Obama's hallmark healthcare legislation. Currently, Republicans are working on last-ditch efforts to repeal and replace the ACA before October 1. Once the new fiscal year hits for the federal government, the possibility of using reconciliation as a tool to repeal Obamacare will come off the table until around March of next year. Reconciliation allows lawmakers to pass bills that have a direct impact on the federal budget with a simple majority vote (51%) as opposed to getting the required 60% of votes needed to make a repeal and replace of Obamacare permanent. Should the ACA be repealed via reconciliation, the new law would sunset in 10 years, reinstituting Obamacare. Image source: Obama White House via Flickr. With the GOP in control of the legislative branches of government, but having no luck thus far in coming to a consensus on what should replace Obamacare, uncertainty reigns. And this uncertainty is just one of many factors that could very well push your Obamacare premium through the roof in 2018. ACASignUps.net has calculated out an average requested increase in premiums next year of 16.22%, assuming the Trump administration doesn't make any drastic changes to the current program. Here's a running list of all the reasons your health insurance premium under Obamacare is probably going to rise by a double-digit percentage in 2018. Image source: President Donald J. Trump's official Facebook page. Photo by Shealah Craighead. Arguably the biggest boost to premiums is derived from the uncertainty surrounding whether or not President Trump will ""go nuclear"" on Obamacare. You see, back in 2014 the GOP sued then head of the Department of Health and Human Services, Sylvia Burwell, over the disbursement of cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) to individuals and families earning between 100% and 250% of the federal poverty level. Their argument was that only Congress can apportion funding for CSRs, which help lower the cost of copays, coinsurance, and deductibles tied with a medical visit, and that this apportioning was never properly made. In 2016, a federal judge agreed and gave Republicans the legal victory they'd been waiting for. However, the verdict has been stayed by an appeal that began with the Obama administration and has continued under Trump's tenure. On one hand, continuing to pay CSRs allows 7 million low-income folks the ability to affordably head to the doctor. On the other hand, Trump wants the ACA repealed, and dropping the appeal to this case would end CSR funding. If that were to happen, these lower-income folks would either choose not to go to the doctor, or they'd stiff insurers with the bill. Either way, it'd be bad news for insurers and consumers. This uncertainty is bound to boost rates big time in 2018. Image source: Getty Images. An even more recent issue for the ACA is the announcement from the Trump administration that it would be cutting outreach funding by 90% ($100 million to $10 million) and navigator funding by 41%, for the upcoming enrollment period. The Trump administration justified the cuts by suggesting that navigators haven't been reaching their enrollment goals, while the 90% gutting to the marketing budget for the ACA is simply par for the course on a program the GOP would rather see gone. While it's tough to pinpoint the exact impact of a major reduction in the marketing expenses tied to the ACA, the expectation is that fewer folks will realize they have options under Obamacare, including the possibility of premium and CSR subsidies. This should result in a reduction of ACA enrollment, which could disincentive insurers from offering plans on the ACA exchanges in the future. Image source: Getty Images. Another concern for the upcoming year is that the Shared Responsibility Payment (SRP) will once again not incentivize younger, healthier adults to enroll. The SRP is the penalty that individuals are supposed to pay for not purchasing health insurance during the year, and last year it was the greater of $695 or 2.5% of modified adjusted gross income. According to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation in Dec. 2015, the estimated SRP for a household in 2016 was $969. Here's the issue: While the average SRP might be close to $1,000, the average bronze-tier plan cost an unsubsidized individual more than $3,700 across the U.S. in 2017, per HealthPocket. Healthy adults could choose to remain uninsured and save themselves around $2,700 for the year. What's more, Trump signed an executive order in January easing the burdens of Obamacare, which allows taxpayers to submit their return without filling in information regarding their SRP payments during the year. In other words, healthy adults have little incentive to enroll, which hurts any shot insurers have of being profitable. Image source: Getty Images. Higher premiums can also be blamed on insurers, which have been leaving the ACA exchanges in droves. Simple economics would suggest that the more supply you have, the greater chance of competitive pricing. Therefore, the more insurers there are operating in a state or county, the more choice consumers will have to buy a plan that matches their budget. In 2014 and 2015, this wasn't an issue since insurers flocked to Obamacare's exchanges fully expecting tens of millions of enrollees. By 2017, though, we began to witness an exodus as losses from the ACA mounted for national insurers. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest national insurer, wound up slashing its coverage from 34 states in 2016 to just three in 2017, while Aetna (NYSE:AET) and Humana (NYSE:HUM), which had their merger plans denied by regulators, slashed their county-based coverage by nearly 70% and almost 90%, respectively, in 2017. More recently, Aetna and Humana both announced that they were pulling out of the ACA's exchanges entirely for the upcoming year. Even Anthem (NYSE:ANTM), the company behind the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand in 14 markets, is cutting back on its coverage in 2018. Fewer options mean higher prices for consumers. Image source: Getty Images. Building off of the previous point, the failure of the risk corridor has also compromised any incentive for competition among insurers. The risk corridor was a fund designed to collect money from overly profitable insurers, and then divvy that money out to insurers with excessive losses that had priced their premiums too low. It was critically underfunded from the get-go since there weren't many profitable insurers (an issue caused by enrolling too many sick folks and not enough healthy adults), leaving insurers to deal with their losses on their own. The result? Out of the 23 approved healthcare cooperatives (co-ops), three-quarters have already shut their doors. These co-ops were a critical source of low-cost premiums designed to attract younger adults without a lot of disposable income. Without many of these co-ops in place, there's even less incentive for young adults to enroll. Image source: Getty Images. You can also expect that your Obamacare premium is going to skyrocket in 2018 because your states' Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC) has very little power. An OIC is designed to be an intermediary between the insurer and the consumer, much in the way a pharmacy-benefits manager acts an intermediary between a drugmaker and an insurance company to lower drug costs. Insurers looking for a rate hike (or decrease) of 10% or higher are required to submit those requests to a states' OIC, along with the reasoning that explains the need for the rate hike (or decline). Ideally, that OIC is supposed to negotiate with insurers on behalf of the consumer to push premium prices as low as is reasonable. Unfortunately, OICs have virtually no power to persuade insurers to lower their premiums, paving the way for ""reasonable"" double-digit rate hikes. Image source: Getty Images. Last, but not least, we can point at prescription drug costs for some of the expected increase in 2018. We've thankfully witnessed weaker generic drug pricing power of late, but specialty drug costs, such as those that fight diabetes and cancer, have generally been rising by around 10% a year. If there is a silver lining to higher prescription drug prices, it's that their list prices aren't what insurers are paying, and therefore not what they're trying to pass along to consumers. Usually, pharmacy-benefit managers are able to reduce prescription drug costs significantly (around half, give or take a bit in each direction, and depending on the drug and indication). Nevertheless, higher drug costs only incentivize insurers to push their premiums higher. No matter how we look at Obamacare in 2018, your premium costs are probably going to be significantly higher.

    7 Reasons Your Obamacare Premium Could Soar by a Double-Digit Percentage in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

Sean Williams,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. These growth figures have also been backed by a notable shift in consumer opinion toward legalizing pot. In 1995, the year before California legalized medicinal cannabis for compassionate use, just 25% of those surveyed by Gallup wanted to see it legalized for adult use across the United States. But by October 2016, approval for the idea of a national legalization had spiked to 60%, an all-time high. Image source: Getty Images. At the other end the spectrum, the U.S. federal government continues to make life challenging for the industry and marijuana stocks in general. A Schedule I categorization for cannabis means it has no recognized medical benefits, placing it on par with heroin and LSD. This scheduling means that weed-based companies are unable to take corporate income tax deductions like normal businesses, nor are they often able to secure basic financial services like a checking account or line of credit. It's also exceptionally difficult for research companies to secure cannabis in order to run risk-versus-benefit studies that have the potential to alter marijuana's scheduling. These inherent disadvantages for the legal weed industry put its companies in quite the bind. They're often stuck dealing with cash, which comes with growth restraints, and they're being forced to pay tax on their gross profits rather than their net profits, leaving less cash left over. That means less in the way of growth opportunities and hiring. Because marijuana is an illegal substance at the federal level, the pot industry also faces challenges within legal states. Individual jurisdictions usually have the right to dictate whether a dispensary is allowed to open within a city or county. The result, as we've witnessed in Colorado, can be something of a Swiss-cheese-like legalization effort, where weed is unwelcome in more jurisdictions than welcome. Image source: Getty Images. However, Nevada is hoping to be a trailblazer of sorts on the marijuana front and turn this latter disadvantage on its head. The Silver State, which only voted to legalize recreational weed in the November 2016 elections, and began selling the product to adults ages 21 and up this past July, is tinkering with the idea of becoming the first state to legally allow pot lounges where consumers can smoke cannabis products in a public place. Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska only allow cannabis to be smoked in the privacy of one's residence, while California, Maine, and Massachusetts, the three other recreational marijuana states, have yet to begin selling adult-use weed. According to a report from The Hill, Nevada's Legislative Counsel Bureau noted last week that its state law does not prohibit city or county governments from operating lounges where consumers can use marijuana. Considering how popular Nevada and more specifically Las Vegas are for tourists, the addition of marijuana lounges or cafes could dramatically boost tourism to the state. For instance, a late 2015 study commissioned by the Colorado Tourism Office found that marijuana played a big role in boosting tourism to the state. The survey revealed that of those folks planning to visit during the summertime and who had also seen the state's ""Come to Life"" ad campaign, practically half (49%) were specifically influenced by the fact that recreational marijuana was legal. Nevada is aiming to have a similar effect on tourism in the state. As you can probably surmise, though, not every lawmaker in Nevada is on board with the idea, including Gov. Brian Sandoval (R-Nev.) who noted, ""I did not support them [pot lounges] previously. I don't support them now."" Kevin Sabet, the head of anti-legalization movement group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, worries that pot lounges will lead to higher crime rates and not be a good thing for the state. Pardon the pun, but there's still a lot to be hashed out with pot-lounge discussions still in the early stages. Image source: Getty Images. Of course, Nevada may have a bit more to be concerned with than just whether it can regulate pot lounges. There's the possibility that the federal government could step up regulatory enforcement in the months to come. In February, now-former White House press secretary Sean Spicer suggested that the Trump administration would take a tougher stance on federal regulatory enforcement of cannabis than the Obama administration. While he failed to outline the specifics of what that added enforcement might entail, it's had the industry on edge ever since. Making matters worse, Attorney General Jeff Sessions appears to be itching to wage war on medical marijuana businesses. The man in charge of the Justice Department sent a letter to congressional leaders in May requesting that they repeal the legislation protecting marijuana businesses operating in legal states from federal prosecution. Sessions has made it abundantly clear in previous speeches and Senate hearings that he doesn't care for marijuana one iota, and that he'll stop at nothing to halt or reverse its expansion. It's also worth noting that Republicans are just one of two groups remaining to still have a negative view of cannabis (senior citizens being the other). With Republicans in control of the legislative branches of government, it's certainly not out of the question that we see a crackdown of sorts on the industry. By the looks of things, the U.S. marijuana industry could have a very challenging year ahead, which serves as a warning to all weed-based companies and marijuana stock investors. ","

So who did we hire, right? We hired our fun friend from college. Or high school. We hired people we knew. And if you're going to hire people that you know at the start of your business, you're probably going to want to make it kind of a fun place to work. You're not probably going to count hours on them, or start counting vacation days. Some of the things that were very countercultural back then still are, as you both know, better than I do. Still countercultural today. It just came to us naturally because of the circumstance by which we started. So that's what we had right. What we didn't have right -- not that it was wrong -- but we didn't yet have the sense that culture was a thing. That that would be how these days people think about their workplace. There wouldn't be workshops, or keynote speeches about culture. There wouldn't be culture Fools. There weren't back then, but there are now, and I'm joined by them today, Kara Chambers and Lee Burbage, respectively. Kara, how long have you been at the Fool? Chambers: Almost 12 years. Gardner: Awesome. Lee? Burbage: Almost 19 years. Gardner: So that's 31, which is more than I've been at the Fool, and both of you are leaders and have helped steer The Motley Fool's culture to become one of the more acclaimed workplaces in America. A little bit of bragging -- I'm not reading from any brag sheet here -- but a couple of times in the last five years Glassdoor.com, the site that has employees rate their workplaces, has had The Motley Fool as the No. 1 place to work for small to medium-size companies in America, so there's a lot of competition. I'm imagining there's at least 10,000 other players out there. Chambers: We're going to talk about well-being. Overall well-being. We have a very highly engaged wellness program at the Fool, but that's part of a larger team. We call ourselves ""the thriving Fools."" We focus on the overall well-being of the individual and just thinking about growth and happiness at work. It's just -- many facets to well-being at work, so we're going to talk a little bit today about the different things we do. Gardner: Awesome! I was trying to establish a little bit of that humbly, because I'm trying to strike the right balance here. We put these ideas forward with humility, but I also want to say that we do put it forward with some authority as well. The Motley Fool, in the Washington, D.C. area, recently got an acclaim, Lee. Gardner: Did we receive an accolade as No. 1 for a certain thing in the last six weeks? Burbage: Yes, we did, David. The healthiest place to work. The most fun. What were the exact words, Kara? Chambers: I think we're the ""most athletic."" Burbage: The most athletic place to work in the D.C. area. Gardner: And I think it was funny, Lee, that you didn't even exactly remember that. Burbage: We win a lot of awards. Gardner: There are those of us who aren't that athletic, like, for example, me. I take great pride. Like I put up the strong-arm emoji on Twitter and say, ""We are the most athletic place to work in Washington, D.C. In the nation's capital."" Burbage: That's correct. Gardner: So whether or not Lee actually knew that, Kara, I'm glad that you did, and you and I similarly, unathletically, take great pride in that. So that's one form of well-being, but I know we're going to talk about others. Without further ado, let's get started. You both have brought some points, as you have in previous appearances. I think you have eight today, so we're going to bounce it back and forth. Who's up first? Chambers: I am. We're going to start with what we call our Bookie Monster program. We went through a very rigorous naming process for that program and just named it Bookie Monster. It's any business book you can request. We have a huge library here at the Fool just sitting there. That just opens up people to explore different topics. We'll talk about this more, but she focuses a lot on when your mind is in ""discover mode,"" when you're feeling good and you're happy, you're going to outperform. And the opposite, when you're stressed, when you're tired, when you're physically or emotionally drained, that's called ""defensive mode,"" and you're less able to learn, less able to solve complex problems. That book really helped to focus, at least me and my team, on this type of work. Gardner: So, Kara, the theme again is overall well-being. So while we did lead with the strong-arm emoji and the word ""athletic,"" you went right to books and reading and the life of the mind. The overall well-being of the Fool. How does the program work? Do people get books for free here? Chambers: They do. They just send an email to Bookie Monster and Bookie Monster will reply back and say, ""I have your book at the front desk."" It's magic. Gardner: Does that mean if I'm kind of a country wit -- I don't work at the Fool but I'm listening to this podcast -- I can just drop an email to bookiemonster@fool.com? Chambers: Oh, no, no! I'm going to check with our CFO first. Gardner: Ah! I thought I found a loophole. Chambers: You could try! Gardner: So is this a program that is well used? Chambers: It's very popular. And it's fun to walk past the front desk. You see the books waiting to be picked up by somebody. You can chat with them in the hallway and say, ""Hey, I just saw you pick that up. How is that one?"" It brings a culture of reading and learning to this office. Gardner: Out of curiosity, because I'm going to be playing the role of, occasionally this week, the small-business entrepreneur. Maybe I have five to 10 employees. Maybe I'm a Realtor and I have my team. We're not The Motley Fool with 300 employees and the kinds of resources that you might be talking about. What is the rough expense I should expect if I were to open up my own Bookie Monster? Per employee, let's say. Chambers: That's a good question. I want to say an Amazon book is maybe $15 and maybe the average person can read a book a month ... Gardner: That's way beyond the average American. Did you know that the average American has not read a book this year? Chambers: Oh, no! Gardner: And I'm not here to dump on my fellow Americans, because there are a lot of great ones, but studies that I've seen suggest that adults, most, don't actually read a full book in a year. Chambers: That's possible. Gardner: So it's possible that I, with my small business, might have a less active Bookie Monster, so it's even cheaper than what you're suggesting. But if I'm doing the math right, 12 times 15-ish is $180 a year ... Chambers: Yeah. Gardner: ... per employee. Burbage: Before I order a book, I go to our internal library and look on the shelf first, to see if it's there. And I'm going to say that fairly frequently I can find a book already. So we encourage people, when you order a book, after you read it, to put it in the library, and then others can use it, and that helps defer costs. Gardner: Awesome. And the last question before we move to Point No. 2. Kara, it's for business books, right? Chambers: Correct. It is broadly. Gardner: What is not a business book? How about that? Gardner: George R.R. Martin has not yet written, although he probably should, maybe has, a business book. Chambers: Business lessons in there that are terrifying. Gardner: OK, good. Lee? Point No. 2. Burbage: So another, it's along the lines of reading in terms of sort of opening up your mind. I think it's easy to get trapped in your day-to-day work and inside the walls of your company, and so we're encouraging people to sort of think outside. And so one way to do that is to bring outside speakers in. And so we encourage Fools at any level -- let's say you've read a book and you're interested in the author. We will reach out to that author and say, ""Hey, would you stop by and visit us?"" What we find is that people will often say yes. They're happy to come in and share their ideas and thoughts, and proud to talk. We had a recent example. I was out in our local community, and I heard a woman from a local school speaking about raising culturally conscious kids. I actually hadn't thought about that concept before. I thoroughly enjoyed hearing her speak and afterward said, ""Hey, would you mind stopping by my office and speaking to anyone in the office who has kids that I think would also enjoy your talk?"" And she said, ""Absolutely."" So we had Kiki come in. She spoke to our Fool parents. It was a chance to take a break from your normal day, think about something that normally you don't have mind space for, and just open up and learn. So we have a number of different speakers in. I'm going to say we have a speaker in at least every couple or few weeks. Again, it could be an author. It could be a business leader. It could be someone that you see in the community. Burbage: LeeB@fool.com. Gardner: LeeB@fool.com. We want to hear from you, and when you're coming through the Washington, D.C., area, if you'd like to come by and speak to our employees, we would treasure that. However, back to my small business. My team of 10 people. Maybe I can't get Elon Musk to come this fall, but it turns out I can get somebody that I met through school as a parent. Or somebody through a professional association that you can come in and have your people learn from. And if you do have a larger company, it doesn't have to be everybody. Maybe somebody like Elon Musk can fill the house. But I like the recent evolution, Lee, which is it feels like we have more speakers with smaller groups, with more diverse possibilities as a consequence. Burbage: Yes, and I think that actually feeds the program. You're going from someone like Elon Musk, who's incredible, but then also someone from your local community talking about a completely different topic. Just allowing your mind to stretch in those different ways is fun and exciting, and to your point exactly, Kiki just lives up the street, right, so it was great to have her in. I know I appreciated it, and so did other Fool parents. I think also what you're identifying is there are different groups and types of people in any company, and so the idea that you're going to bring in one speaker every time that's going to appeal to every person at your company is probably unrealistic. So I think what we find is anybody that you can bring in that 10 or more people are interested in, hey, you've hit a pocket of people -- in my case, Fool parents, people with small children -- who are thinking about ""Hey, how do I get out to these?"" Kara probably didn't come to that talk and was like, ""Hey, I'm not that interested."" But she probably came to the talk on keepers. We had a speaker come in about -- was it a Netflix series? Chambers: A documentary ... Burbage: ... that was super popular. Gardner: Ah, yes. Burbage: I didn't go to that one because that's not particularly interesting to me. I don't consider either one of those a failure. Gardner: And before we move to Point No. 3, have other businesses, maybe local, started to play the same game with us? Inviting either of you to come speak? Do you go out and speak, sometimes, to others? Burbage: Yes, I've been asked several times to come in and talk either to associations, groups, that sort of thing, or to local companies. I was speaking to MITRE, a consulting company here in D.C., on a panel that they had. It's a funny thing. When they asked me, I was like, ""Absolutely,"" because it makes you feel good. You're proud to go out and talk about yourself and the cool things we're doing. So people say yes. Gardner: Kara, I know that Lee really likes to speak. I don't know if either one of us likes to speak as much as Lee does. Do you like to speak? Chambers: It's not my favorite, but I keep trying. Burbage: She's super good at it. Chambers: No. I would say also just paying visits. A couple of years ago, one of my colleagues and I went to San Francisco to a conference, and then we had a day free, so we asked our colleagues for some networking. Zooming around. Visited a couple of companies and met with our counterparts there. Gardner: Great idea. Chambers: So it doesn't have to be a presentation. It can just be, ""Hey, can I talk to you about what you do here, and meet your counterpart?"" It's just, again, broadening the network. It doesn't necessarily have to be a talk. That's one way we connect as well. Gardner: Connecting. So Point No. 1 is reading. Point No. 2 is connecting. Kara, what's Point No. 3? Chambers: I have this as ""listening."" This is a project Lee and I work a lot on. We love our peer-coaching program. I put this in as listening because I read somewhere that one of the best gifts you can give somebody that's free is to just give them your undivided attention. What we do is have a peer-coaching program. You can pick and choose. There are different levels of leadership. Different departments. It's not as heavy-handed as a mentorship. It's kind of lightweight. It's maybe one or two meetings a year. They're the person who's delivering your 360 feedback. They're checking with you at least twice a year to talk about just how you are doing. Are you happy? Are you feeling good? What can we do to support you better? It just gives you another outlet with a slightly different agenda than your manager might have, or HR might have. I like doing a lot of coaching. I actually enjoy it. So I think for us, one aspect of well-being is just having someone to listen to you, and that's free. We've worked on it just to build out the logistics, but we find that valuable source internally. Gardner: Kara, you led with the phrase ""peer coach,"" and then you mentioned ""feedback."" Is that the way feedback happens at this company? Chambers: Yes. In a typical company when you would get your 360 feedback, it would get emailed to your manager, and they would have to deliver it to you. Gardner: So that's not The Motley Fool. This is Acme, Inc. Chambers: Yes. Gardner: Acme, Inc. has your manager giving you the feedback. Chambers: Yes. That's typical, and as a manager, you want to know what's going on with your employee. But we turned it around, and it took away the pressure. There's zero consequences to someone giving you constructive feedback, because no one else is going to see it but you and your coach, and you just talk about it. And it's mine, so if it comes to me as feedback, I figure out what to do with it with the help of my coach. It doesn't get passed along. It's not part of my record. It doesn't affect my compensation. That frees up my colleagues, who are my friends, who don't want to negatively impact my career, to give constructive feedback with zero consequence. What we found is that creates a much more open environment for that conversation. Gardner: I hope this is fair. I'm going to eavesdrop, briefly, with your help, on The Motley Fool's feedback system. We're conducting that this month at the Fool. I'm going to ask you a couple of things about it really quickly. First of all, does everybody get feedback? Chambers: You can opt in. Everything we do here is optional, so you can choose. Gardner: So you decide if you want feedback. And I have to admit. I'm a little bit of a slacker, because it's August and I'm doing enough, so I didn't request it this time. Chambers: That's OK. Gardner: And that's OK, too. So feedback is not compulsory. It is earned by being asked for. Chambers: Yes. Gardner: That's odd. I think that's cool, though. Chambers: Again, if you are driving your own career, and you want to develop, you're the best person to know where you want to develop and how to figure that out. We also leave it open all year, so you can choose any time. It's kind of confusing, but there's a deadline because one of my colleagues calls it ""social permission"" to ask everybody at the company, or ask a bunch of people to fill something out about you, because it's work. It's still work. But we try to make it easy. We keep the questions really simple. Gardner: And that's where I want to keep eavesdropping, because when I used the form and typed in some feedback for one of my peers, there were just three questions. Chambers: Yes. Gardner: Do you remember what they are right off the top? Because again, I'm listening to this podcast this week maybe because I am in business or an organization. I'm curious what you ask. Burbage: We do keep it simple, and we also keep it positive. So what we found is we want a situation that you're going to look forward to. Related to the manager, people don't normally look forward to a meeting with their boss where they're going to hear a bunch of negative things. Gardner: ""It's time for your annual review, Lee! Have a seat, please!"" Burbage: That sounds horrible, and there's been plenty of study in this area. So instead, you're having this meeting with this third-party sounding-board coach. Our questions change a little bit over time, but they tend to be around where are you awesome, and where can you be even more awesome. We're looking for places to double down, or where you're doing a really good job. And then we've added in a feature where you can ask for feedback in a specific area, so maybe you just completed a project, or there's a particular zone, listening or something that you think you're bad at. Gardner: Lee wants to know what you thought of his lemon meringue pie this month. And his new Lemon Meringue Pie Club. Burbage: Yes. So you may want something specific, and, again, we try to keep it positive. We're building systems here, I think, for all of these that we want people to want to use. Like the worst part of an HR job is running around trying to make people do things. We want to build programs that people are like, ""Oh, I can't wait for feedback to start. I'm looking forward to that, and I'm choosing to opt in."" As opposed to Kara and I having to run around telling you you have to do this thing that you don't want to. Gardner: So it sounds to me as if part of the culture is you've subverted yourself to the employee who is your customer, and you're trying to engage and please that person. Without compelling them or forcing them, you're working extra hard to figure out what they're going to like and want to use. But let me flip this back at you before we move to Point No. 4, because I can imagine some people are listening right now saying, ""You know what? There's a person on my team or at our company. They are not doing a good job, and it's very hard for me to be positive about them."" How do you be effective and negative or, I would say, corrective within such a -- to be unfair to you both -- happy-go-lucky, free love, lemon meringue pie environment? Burbage: I think it's actually a fairly straightforward answer, which is I think if you're waiting for some program to start, or a system to be kicked in for you to be able to give that person that negative feedback, you've probably waited too long, and it's probably not appropriate. I think, David, if you're having some problems with my performance ... Gardner: I'm a little uncomfortable with my performance, Lee. That's about me. Burbage: I'm uncomfortable here on the podcast. Gardner: I've picked some bad stocks in the last year. Burbage: Those are the situations where you shouldn't be relying on a program or system like this. You should be pulling that person aside and talk to them, giving them that kind of feedback. A system like this, or any feedback system, isn't designed to handle that super-heavy load. Chambers: It's about development. And we have one other thing we liked. It's another learning we've had, and that's in terms of language. We offer the option to say, ""I would like your advice on this."" We've heard this. Someone else had this concept. But instead of saying, ""I would like your feedback,"" saying, ""I would like your advice."" That's your takeaway tip. It's just easier. People will always want to give you advice. They don't want to give you feedback. They don't give you a grade. But they're like, ""Oh, you want my advice? OK."" And people will open right up. Gardner: Wow! Chambers: That's a thing that we learned recently this year. So we've added that in this round to see how that goes. Gardner: That's a great point. So that was No. 3, listening. Lee, No. 4. For instance, over the last few weeks Kara and I have been super-involved with a volunteer team of Fools that are investigating a potential new business line for our company, and we just need to do a little research work, so the call was put out. ""Hey, anybody interested in helping out?"" Maybe six Fools raised their hand and said they'd love to help out. So they're dedicating a few hours a week that they have free toward this new venture. And what happens over time is we're actually learning as a business if they're good in that area. And they're learning, as an individual, if that might be an area that they'd like to do even more. Sometimes people walk away and they'll be like, ""Ooh, boy. That was awful. I don't want to do that again."" Or we, as a business, might say, ""Ooh, you're actually not very good at that."" Or even better, we're like, ""Hey, you're great! You should do more of that,"" and it builds into more career development. So just getting people to use their extra bandwidth to get out and about the business and reach beyond what their normal day-to-day work may be. Gardner: I'm curious, Lee. You started that by saying we're a project culture. What does that mean, exactly? Burbage: I don't believe that we have a traditional hierarchy here. A traditional career ladder. People work here for many years and do lots of different things. Our favorite people are ones that are working on maybe six or seven different projects at one time. They may be diverse projects. Some may be leading. Some might be followers. Some might be just playing all kinds of different roles on a team. So you're getting your enjoyment here by working with people that you love on really challenging things that are driving toward our purpose, and that's how you're managing your career. It's moving from project to project, trying new things, getting involved in things that you're passionate about. Gardner: So it really is pretty subversive if you're thinking about a traditional org chart, and a title on your business card, and once I'm junior this, my next goal would be senior this, and I'll get that in three years. And there is a downside to not being that way, because sometimes we'll lose people here at the Fool who want that career path or a clearer sense of what's next, and sometimes they leave the Fool after a few years to go back to maybe a more traditional workplace where they can find that. So what we're describing here -- I don't know how idiosyncratic or not it is -- it's definitely how we roll, and we bet we're probably not the only organization that rolls that way. Burbage: Yes. I mean, I was not the first to say this. Gardner: The Greeks were. I don't even know what you're about to say, but it's very obvious, I think, that Socrates said this. Go ahead! Burbage: Socrates once said every company has a culture, but not every culture is right for everyone. So we have a pretty defined and unique culture that fits and is cool for a lot of people, but not for everybody. We're not a great resume builder or LinkedIn profile-builder company, although when people leave here, they do find some pretty great jobs, but it's nontraditional, sure. Gardner: OK, we're at halftime. Thank you for those first four points. You have four glowing points to come. And right after this brief ad break, I'm going to ask you to think about something in the last 12 months, since you last came on this podcast, that hasn't worked so well. It's natural for us to want to share out the things that have worked well, and I think best-practice sharing is much more valuable, but I know, I'm sure some of our listeners are curious about something that, you know, we're trying stuff all the time. What have we learned that we needed to tweak, or hasn't worked so well? So think about that. All right, Lee and Kara. I asked, before we go on to point No. 5, what's something that hasn't worked? Burbage: So one thing that's pretty easy to do is look at your budget and sort of circle those big items. It's probably healthy, right, to circle those in question, and one thing we did last year was to circle our holiday party and say, ""Wow, that's sort of an expensive event to take everyone and a guest."" And it's hard to get a venue during the holidays. Gardner: That's part of what makes it expensive, right, Lee? Because everybody else is trying to rent the same venues for the holidays, and so the rents go up. Burbage: Absolutely. And you know us. We like to do things different, better, special. And so we're like, ""Ha, ha, ha, we'll get them. We're going to do ours in April. We'll just combine it with some other events. And we won't do the plus one."" And so, essentially, we canceled our holiday party. And as it turns out people missed it. That wasn't such a great decision. And when we announced this year that we were bringing it back, we got a lot of notes and a lot of people that were super-excited. So it turns out I think the money is worth it. To bring people together. To bring their spouse. We sometimes only see that person once a year. To break a little bread and celebrate the year, the timing, the spirit. It works, and I think we made a mistake by canceling our holiday party, and I'm pretty stoked out about it. Gardner: And I was one of those people who wrote a note to you both thanking you. I thought I might be the only one who had written that note. Well, that's a good learning. Kara? Chambers: As we just talked about learning, one thing we're working on is we realized over the years that learning and development in an office has a temptation to bring everyone in and teach a class in a classroom. What you find is sometimes you have to bribe them with sandwiches, and maybe that's not in your budget, either, so you bring them in and you find your attendance starts dropping. So we said nothing is mandatory here. And we're noticing this kind of drop-off, and this is over years. Gardner: Because we have internal classes here at The Motley Fool. Now this is maybe not a normal thing for a lot of people. Kara, what would be a typical class that we might have taught over the years here at the Fool? Chambers: It could be an introduction to how a different department does their work. It could be leadership development for team leaders. The how-to. Gardner: How to fill out your 401(k), I can imagine. These kinds of things. Chambers: Yes, and again, those individually went well, and I'm only thinking of the good ones now. The memorable ones. I'm sure there were ones that were not memorable. But we found that their attendance was dwindling, and so we are spending our time thinking about how to create experiential learning. And you have to walk a line, because if you've got your best people working on your most valuable things, you have a hesitancy to take them off those valuable things to learn. So that constant push-pull is getting your best people and developing them even further, but it's a challenge. If you want something done, ask busy people. So just thinking about your really busy people and then you're like, ""Hey, can you teach this class? Can you do it?"" And what you find is it's hard to get that group. So we're trying to find ways. Maybe it's job swapping. We did a workshop with you not long ago on a project that was kind of fun. We're trying to think of other ways to bring people together to learn things without it being classroom-focused. Because, as we saw, the attendance was dropping, until at one point I remember seeing, ""This meeting is at noon and we don't get any food?"" OK, that's not why we're here. Gardner: Something can be fixed here. Chambers: That's not why we're here. That's something I learned. Gardner: Thank you both. Let's get back on our program, Point Nos. 5 to 8. Let's speed it up a little bit. I think my tendency to just enjoy this conversation too much has me asking too many questions. For our last four we're going to focus it a little bit more, and No. 5, Kara, I think I'm back to you. Chambers: I wouldn't be anywhere if I wasn't talking about an app you need to use. For those of you who are Slack users -- Slack is our internal instant-messaging program -- we use an app in there called Donut, and what that does is, it's an algorithm that pairs you with a random Fool for coffee every other Monday. It's optional. You can opt in. And you can drop out of the Slack channel if you don't want to have coffee the next Monday. They're using some kind of magic algorithm with people outside of your group. What I like about it is -- I'm an introvert. Parties or big happy hours I'll be shy at, but one on one I like talking to people. So once we installed it, I went around and I recruited all of my introverts, one by one, and said, ""Come on. It's so much easier to get to know people one on one with this."" Gardner: It's Donut! Donut! Chambers: Come on! Come on! So we have fun. It's really a nice, low-pressure way to build connections at the Fool. I've been in the position of giving and getting feedback of building your network, and for your more introverted people that can be difficult. So one at a time. At random. Chambers: Donut.ar. Gardner: And if you're not a Slack user, darn it, you probably can use pencil and paper and make a program like this, and pair random people who want to talk some. Burbage: Maybe dice. Chambers: Roll dice. Gardner: No, don't get me started. The gamer in me wants to talk about games. We're going to go back to Point No 6. Lee. So David, if you wanted to move your desk, which is just a table on wheels with two cords, you unplug your cords and you roll your desk over to wherever you want to go. You don't need to ask permission. You don't need to trade desks with somebody. There's no packing, or boxes, or anything. Literally just roll around. Our office is literally different every day, and it's because people are moving around and maybe like Kara, they need a few minutes to work by themselves, because they're more introverted, and they roll their desk over. Like, ""Hey, I'm on a team now. Let me roll that over to my team."" So just providing people that mobility and the autonomy to make their own decision about where and how they want to work has been a big thing for us, and I think people are happier and more productive. Gardner: We didn't force-rank these points, so we're not saying that Point No. 6 is the sixth most important thing. But for a lot of offices -- whether you are in a small or a large office -- that's very doable. Now, for some offices, maybe you have mahogany furniture or you have stuff built in. You have cubicles that are basically anchored to the wall. Maybe you can't do that. But at least your chair on wheels, at least being able to slide around and meet with people or hang out for four days in a workpod to get stuff done seems doable. It wasn't until year what of our company, Lee, that we finally figured out we could put stuff on wheels? Burbage: I think it was about eight years ago. Gardner: So year 16. It took us 16 years to figure that out. Burbage: When you were asking before about major mistakes that we made. I will say that when Bryan Tighe and Chad Wolfsheimer, two Fools that work here, came to me and talked to me about this, my first reaction was, ""That sounds crazy! No, no, no!"" And so it took them a little convincing of me. It's really part of the Scrum and Agile push. In your mahogany desk scenario, I would say we've also found a lot of success finding little spaces in hallways. Any little gap in the office where you can shove a couch or roll a few chairs into to just give people options of other places to sit and interact has been pretty powerful, too. So not being tethered to a mahogany desk in the corner, and instead being able to get out and move around and move about the cabin, we think, is a pretty big deal. Again, my idea from the beginning. Gardner: Kara, Point No. 7. Chambers: Caring. I do our engagement surveys, and for at least nine years a very popular engagement survey question is, ""My team leader, or someone at work, cares about me as a person."" And I enjoy, every time I open up the survey, and it goes up one more point. We're at 95%. That's a humble brag there, but I think it's important. It's part of our culture. A very family-oriented culture. And all the things we do, we want to help you feel like this is part of your family. People you see every day you spend a lot of time with, and so caring about each other is a part of your well-being, just knowing that people do. It's a high driver. It's something that we take pride in that's always been part of our culture. Even when other engagement scores go up and down, I see this go up and I say that makes a resilient culture. That tells me that we are all in it because we care about each other, and I would be a sad person if I had to get up in front of a company and present a score like 50. Gardner: And actually implicit in Point No. 7 -- caring, Kara -- is that we're measuring. And we're not really talking about that this time. I think we've talked about that in a prior podcast. By the way, I'm going to plug your two previous appearances at the end, shortly, so people can find more of such ideas. Chambers: Yeah, and what we say is every company is a great place to work in its own way, and for us that's a big one, and if you have that at your company, just building on it, right? It comes from starting with your founders and hiring your friends, but building from there. Starting with people who care about each other. Gardner: And to be maybe just a little bit soupy and sentimental, Kara and Lee, you're some of my good friends here at the Fool, and I didn't know you when we started The Motley Fool. So one of the things that happens, if you're in a good office, and you stay around for a while, and you've got a positive culture, regardless of what business you're in, is that some of your best friends end up being the people that you're working with every day and you didn't even know them when you graduated high school or college. Point No. 8, Lee. Burbage: So No. 8 builds a little bit on my holiday-party point. Just not forgetting the fun and building into the fun. It can be so easy and, again, to use your word, sappy. We're like, ""Hey, we should have another activity, or another fun event!"" So we do still try to have at least some sort of fun company event that's organized once a month. And the one I wanted to highlight was one that we had from last month, because I'm particularly excited. We tried to think about how could we do something fun that also draws in our remote workforce. So we have a decent number of Fools that are working from around the United States and around the world. All different sorts of time zones. And that can make having a fun event difficult to pull off and maybe even makes them sad. So here we're doing something fun at the headquarters, and we've got someone in Singapore who's saddened because they can't participate. So here's what we did -- a push-up challenge. We've come full circle to being the most athletic company here ... Gardner: Yeah. How could we not mention that in Washington, D.C., we are the reigning, most athletic company in the capital of maybe arguably the most powerful nation the world has ever known? Burbage: I think our hope is they never give that award again, and then we're only the only one ever. But we did a push-up challenge, and it was very simple. You can do this in your company. We had a Google doc where you go and put your name in. I know that you both participated. And just on a daily basis you marked down how many push-ups you're doing and you have a goal. And there's actually some banter talking inside the Google doc, and we had some prizes. Gardner: And some teams challenged some other teams with that. Burbage: Absolutely. So if you're in Singapore, you're in Australia, or you're here in Washington, D.C., you can get in that Google doc. You can participate. It happened all month long. We had a super-fun time. We did, I think, 150,000 push-ups as a company. So we found a way for us to have fun as a company, which I think is easy to forget, especially in the busy world that we live in today. So adding some fun into your company and finding ways for everybody to participate is something I'm particularly excited about. Gardner: OK, we're going to close this one up. I want to give a little bit of a plug to one or two resources that people who have enjoyed this podcast can access, but before I do that I want to ask you each one final question, and Kara, randomly I'll pick you for the first one and Lee, you for the second. Each of these comes from a different type of a listener. We're going to call them ""opposite listeners."" Kara, you're going to speak briefly to the person who has no budget. They're either at a smaller company than The Motley Fool -- and there are many smaller companies than The Motley Fool -- or they're a larger company but there's just no budget for things like wellness or fun. So I'm listening to you guys. You're talking about something that sounds great. I mean, I wish I had that kind of pie in the sky, but I don't. What can I learn from this podcast? What can I do? Chambers: Push-ups and Google docs. They're free, so I'll start with that. Talking about mistakes. Before we had a wellness person, we designed our own wellness challenge, and it was really ridiculously complicated, but we did it. Gardner: It's helpful to have senior people who understand what they're doing. Chambers: It's better in the hands of a professional. That's all I'll say. But nobody got hurt. So try. Loaning books among each other is free. Sitting down and listening to your colleagues -- I'd say the No. 1 takeaway, too, is if you're just starting out in a business, it's really easy to think of now I'm in management and I have to be the police for my employees. And for us it's always, come from a place of trust -- a place of positivity -- and it works. That's why I like to go out into the world and say you can have that with three people, and ideally I hope you do. Gardner: So, so much of what we just covered in these 45 minutes or so is free. It's just about making decisions, having frameworks, and having some internal commitment, or willingness to get there. Willingness to experiment. All right, Lee, you're going to come at this from the other angle. ""Hey, The Motley Fool is a cute company. I appreciate the podcast. I've followed some of your stock picks. You guys are just 300 employees. I work at a division that itself is 3,000 employees. We have tons of resources."" So, Fools listening to this hour, I'm wondering if you had twice the budget that you have, because this hypothetical person that you're going to be, for a sec, Lee, does. This person has twice the budget that we have for employees to focus on wholeness and well-being. If you had more, how would you be spending it? Burbage: I reject the question. The reason I say that is I don't think it's about money. I think what I would love in that scenario, if it were me, is I would have scale to do things that Kara and I can't do because we just don't have enough people. For instance, our coaching program, I think, would be even richer, because I would be leveraging all those people that exist at that company. So whether it's the coaching program or speakers, I don't necessarily need to go external to find speakers. I bet you with a large population inside my company, there are some pretty interesting people that could teach a class. Speak about something that they're doing. So just being able to leverage the human power of all the interesting folks in that scenario would be cool. The second thing I would say is killing systems or processes that are unpopular and not very powerful at scale is a big deal. Gardner: Very powerful. Burbage: Yes. To kill the performance appraisal at 300 was a big deal. To kill the performance appraisal at 3,000 or 6,000 -- they'll write a book about you. Gardner: Well, Kara Chambers and Lee Burbage, two world-class thinkers, and I'm going to say that again with my entrepreneurial pride on my sleeve because of The Motley Fool's renown as a place to work and a place that's constantly experimenting, sometimes with small budgets. I love Lee's point that it's not about money. That's what Kara said as well. So much of this is free. But willing to experiment and try and see what works, and try to make the workplace better for one of our key stakeholders that every organization -- for-profit and not-for-profit -- has, and that's your employees or, if you will, your human capital. I mentioned earlier that I've done two previous podcasts with Kara and Lee, and if you'd like to hear either one of them, I'm going to call them out right now. The very first one was their appearance on Dec. 2, 2015: ""10 Traits of a Great Company Culture."" So if you're on iTunes, you can just scroll down to 12/02/15. Listen to it yourself. Share it with your manager or the big boss at your organization -- whoever it is -- share it out! And then they came back in 2016. The day was May 11. And we imaginatively named that one ""10 More Traits of a Great Company Culture."" Not quite sure what we're going to call this one, because I don't make that call each week. More talented people here at the Fool name these, but maybe we'll have ""10 Even More Great Traits,"" or maybe we'll be more focused on wellness, which was the purpose of this podcast. Kara and Lee, sharing with you what they've learned about the overall well-being of your employees. Now Lee, if you're comfortable, let's say I've really enjoyed this podcast, or one of these, and I want to get in touch with this team at the Fool. How do I reach you? Burbage: I'm happy for people to email me. LeeB@fool.com. It's pretty fun, because it's ""Lee B A Fool."" Gardner: LeeB -- letter B ... Burbage: @fool.com. Gardner: Lee B A Fool. I get it. OK. LeeB@fool.com. And Kara, The Motley Fool has a culture blog. Chambers: Yes. It's culture.fool.com, and all of our content, our job postings, anything we do here. How to get in touch with us. Gardner: We take pictures of ourselves on Halloween or silly, ridiculous stuff. Chambers: You would think all we did was dress up in costumes. Gardner: One would sometimes think. I do follow and I can follow it, by the way, on Twitter at Motley Fool Culture. Burbage: Instagram. Gardner: OK, good. So I do see some of those pictures. Chambers: Yes. Instagram. Motley Fool Culture. I'm TMFKara on Twitter, so I post a lot of stuff I read on there. Gardner: Awesome! Thank you both so much for your time! Thank you, Rule Breaker, whoever and wherever you are. And it's our hope, on behalf of Kara, Lee, and myself, that you find ways to make the place around you, where you go to work every day, better for you and those around you in the year ahead. Fool on!

Stratfor analysts,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 27, 2017 12:14 p.m. ET A war of words could escalate to a real war By The United States has declared war on North Korea, according to North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong. In a brief news conference in New York on Sept. 25, Ri said U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent statements to the U.N. General Assembly were tantamount to a declaration of war and that all of the members of the United Nations clearly heard that it was the United States that first declared war on North Korea. Therefore, Ri argued, Pyongyang has a right to self-defense under the U.N. charter and would be justified if it were to shoot down U.S. strategic bombers, even outside North Korean territory. Over the past week, the rhetoric between the United States and North Korea has rapidly escalated. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un responded to Trump’s Sept. 19 U.N. speech by saying that Pyongyang was seriously considering the “highest level of hard-line countermeasures in history.” The statement, accompanied by a picture of Kim sitting at a desk and looking intently into the camera — reminiscent of U.S. presidential addresses to the nation during times of crisis — was clarified later to suggest Pyongyang could carry out an atmospheric nuclear test in the Pacific Ocean. Though much of the escalation has been rhetorical rather than concrete, both North Korea and the United States are inching closer to backing up their words with action to demonstrate their positions. The United States is openly discussing shooting down North Korea’s next missile test, and North Korea has responded with what it considers to be an equivalent threat: the possibility of shooting down U.S. strategic bombers near the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang has long equated the U.S. strategic bombers patrolling the peninsula to its own missile program and has warned that it could launch missiles to the U.S. coastline in a parallel show of range and force. Trump’s comments to the United Nations and the additional sanctions his administration recently imposed against North Korea could be seen as one step along the traditional path to U.S. military action. This path involves the U.S. making a strong case to the international community before resorting to unilateral action justified by the inability or unwillingness of the world to act. Washington has yet to take concrete action to suggest that it is preparing to strike. It has not changed its force posture or made moves to evacuate the 125,000-140,000 American civilians living in South Korea. Neither does North Korea appear to be significantly altering the positions of its forces, though it is exploiting increased U.S. threats to rally the North Korean population around the embattled government in Pyongyang. Though neither the United States nor North Korea is making the formal movements that would suggest an imminent, purposeful military conflict, the fever pitch between the two and the increased shows of force do raise the likelihood that an accident or miscalculation could lead to conflict. North Korea and the United States have not agreed on basic rules of engagement for air encounters. So, should North Korea decide to scramble aircraft to intercept U.S. flights, even if it has no intent to engage, the potential for an accidental collision is high. In the region, aircraft have collided with U.S. aircraft in the past, last in 2001 off the Chinese coast, but military tension wasn’t nearly as high then. U.S actions could be just as risky: If Pyongyang follows through on its threat to test a nuclear device in the Pacific, Washington could try to shoot down the launch, particularly if the weapon is on a trajectory that could bring it near the U.S. coast. In each scenario, tit-for-tat responses could lead to a rapid escalation unintended by either side. Amid the intensifying standoff, signs of back-channel diplomatic efforts should be watched for, even if it appears that there is little space for a compromise that would satisfy both sides. Russia is working with North Korea diplomatically, and the North Korean Foreign Ministry official in charge of North America is in Russia this week, creating one such space for possible back-channel diplomacy. China’s actions should also be watched closely. China’s relationship with North Korea has been strained for the past several years, and many of the United States’ warnings of military action could be meant more to convince China to take a stronger stand rather than to directly convince North Korea to change its course of action. Any changes in military postures will, of course, also be significant. These include the possibility that the United States could change the way it conducts its strategic bomber missions, by switching to stealth aircraft or expanding fighter escorts, for example. The probability of intentional war is still relatively low without additional escalation, but the potential for accidental conflict is increasing. North Korea has threatened that in the near future it could test its missiles near the U.S. territory of Guam, test its missiles off the U.S mainland coast, intercept U.S. bombers near the Korean Peninsula and conduct an atmospheric nuclear test over the Pacific Ocean. The United States has been less specific in its threats, but it has increased its strategic bomber flights, has talked more openly about shooting down North Korean missiles and has discussed sending additional strategic assets to the region. And more physical action makes it more likely that accident and miscalculation could follow.

George Hobica, founder of flight booking site Airfarewatchdog.com, previously told MarketWatch that price increases following Hurricane Irma were likely not intentional. “I don’t think airlines would be callous or stupid enough to be consciously jacking up fares,” he said. “If there’s any gouge, it’s just the last minute walk-up airfares that are designed for desperate business fliers.” American Airlines resumed its flights to Puerto Rico on Monday, which had been suspended since Hurricane Irma.

Shawn Langlois,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 26, 2017 2:39 p.m. ET By The fact that the major cities in the United States are responsible for the lion’s share of the country’s economic output isn’t surprising. But what may be eye-opening is just how much they dominate. In this map from cost-estimating website HowMuch.net, the pink spikes — though some of them look more like small dots — represent the gross domestic product churned out by each of the 382 metro areas as defined by the Census Bureau.

Tim Mullaney,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 26, 2017 9:21 a.m. ET Trump’s real gripe with the NFL seems to be: Not enough brain damage By For a celebrity-obsessed president, Donald Trump sure had a bad week in the culture wars. First, he got schooled on health-care policy by Jimmy Kimmel — a more successful comedian than he is. Then he went to Alabama, where he ranted about, mostly, football. Short version: He liked it better in the old days. He dislikes uppity players kneeling for the national anthem to provoke conversation about race, and wants them fired. But his funniest, most revealing bit was about how new rules barring targeting of players’ heads — prompted by generations of players with life-shortening brain damage, and sadly highlighted by last week’s test results showing that murderous ex-New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez had late-stage chronic traumatic encephalopathy when he committed suicide in prison — were unmanly and taking the fun out of the National Football League. Donald Trump, in other words, is foursquare for brain damage. Yay! But you kneeeewww thaaat. Back at the White House, he picked a fight with the NBA champion Golden State Warriors and erstwhile Most Valuable Player Steph Curry, pulling the traditional White House invitation for major-sports champions because Curry said he wasn’t sure he wanted to go and honor Trump. He tweeted more — and markets know how much a Trump tweet matters, or doesn’t — about the NFL and sports, and it got worse and worse. Trump backer and Patriots quarterback Tom Brady called his comments “divisive.” Patriots CEO Robert Kraft, a pal who gave Trump a Super Bowl ring and claims Vladimir Putin stole another one, said ”our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork” that NFL players teach. Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan, a Pakistani immigrant whose $7 billion stack is way bigger than that of a president who measures himself by money, joined his players’ protest at a game in London. Even NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called Trump divisive. When you’re being lectured by a guy who didn’t give Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice a long suspension for beating his then-fiancee until video surfaced, you’re having a really bad week. Oh, and basketball legend LeBron James called Trump a bum. On Twitter yet. Here’s a guide to what really dishonors our patriotic totems, far more than exercise of free speech by football players. The presidency is dishonored when leading newspapers verify that the president personally lied every one of his first 40 days in office, among hundreds of whoppers in the first 100 days and beyond. The American flag is dishonored when the president of the United States describes violent neo-Confederate protesters who fly the Stars and Bars as “very fine people.” The vow of “liberty and justice for all” in the Pledge of Allegiance is dishonored when that president appoints an attorney general just this side of being a neo-Confederate sympathizer, one who was rejected by a Republican Senate for a judgeship in 1986 over his racial attitudes. The Constitution is dishonored when a president’s entire team demands the firing of people who disagree with him, from ESPN host Jemele Hill to whatever Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was thinking about when he said NFL players should have “free speech on their own time.” The hard work of 153 million employed Americans is dishonored when Trump can’t work hard enough to learn the contents of his own health-care bill — the latest version of which is still rattling around Capitol Hill even after GOP Arizona Sen. John McCain’s announcement last week that he will vote against it pretty much put a fork in it. Jimmy Kimmel, former host of “The Man Show,” is a harder-working citizen than the president now. And yes, the service of people like McCain is dishonored when a military-school brat who accepted four student deferments from the Vietnam-era draft, followed by a finding of physical impairment that mysteriously doesn’t keep Trump from golfing, disrespects soldiers who were captured as losers. It’s probably not a coincidence that McCain followed up his knifing of Trump’s bill by telling “60 Minutes” that Trump never apologized for saying that about him in 2015. Neither is it accidental that McCain chalked up Trump’s reticence to his ‘different upbringing.’’ All of Trump’s self-created myths exploded in his weekend of fantasizing that football fans would come to his rescue. But the most serendipitous part was watching him get buried by his own people -- those just as rich and successful as Trump imagines himself to be.

Morgan Stanley estimated Curry’s worth to Under Armour at $14 billion last year. And as Trump was braying, Infiniti was rolling out an ad campaign featuring Curry and his 5-year old daughter. He also just signed a five-year, $201 million contract extension, about twice as much as Trump reportedly made per year hosting NBC’s “The Apprentice.” Khan, who made a fortune in auto parts before buying the team, is twice as rich as Trump and Pakistani to boot, one of 16 immigrants Forbes says are richer than Trump. James has a lifetime contract with Nike with an estimated $1 billion value, three championship rings to Curry’s two, and has earned $200 million and counting on the court. In a move that will resonate with Trump’s creditors, he also has taken less money to leave more to pay teammates. He’ll be a billionaire in a dozen years or less, most likely. Kraft is richer than Trump, too, at $4.2 billion, and has built a state-of-the-art organization that has won five Super Bowls, not least because it plucked Brady from the remainder bin with a sixth-round draft pick. Trump hired Steve Bannon and Mike Flynn.. All of these guys save Khan are also champions, the best at what they do. Trump is trying to cut rich guys’ taxes, seize poor folks’ health insurance, and get his approval rate over 40% without starting a nuclear war with North Korea. Trump’s headache must be the dull pain you get when someone dunks on your head. The buzz he hears is the sports world talkin’ ‘bout his Mama. Mr. President, if you’d worn a helmet you might have avoided some of this. ",Trump gets sacked in the culture wars - MarketWatch
Alessandra Malito,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 28, 2017 9:43 a.m. ET Paradise sounds nice, if you’re not in a storm’s path By When John King decided to retire abroad, he took two exploratory trips and spent 18 months researching online before choosing Lake Chapala, Mexico. He had a list of criteria: climate, cost of living and community. They also took into consideration any potential natural disasters. As the Caribbean and other retirement dream destinations outside of the United States get hit with storm after storm, near-retirees must surely wonder: Just how much do they want to risk for a piece of paradise? King isn’t risking much, considering he lives in the central highlands of Mexico at an elevation of 5,000 feet. Hurricane Maria is the latest storm to hit the Caribbean, which was also affected by Hurricane Irma earlier this month, killing at least 24 people. Maria strengthened to a “potentially catastrophic” Category 5 on Monday evening, and by Friday it had hit a large portion of the Caribbean and caused enough damage on Puerto Rico to knock out its electrical grid. Islands also suffered by Hurricane Jose — almost all of Barbuda and St. Martin sustained damage or were completely destroyed, according to the Washington Post. Yet despite weather risk and vulnerable infrastructure, overseas retirement is growing in popularity — about 400,000 American retirees live abroad, according to the Social Security Administration, and that number has climbed 17% between 2010 and 2015. Some choose islands and Mexico, while others go to Germany, Japan and Canada. More baby boomers are expected to leave the workplace, and then the country, in the next 10 years. See: 10 of the best places to retire abroad There are benefits to retiring abroad — for starters, it’s an entirely new life, and perhaps one that is a bit slower-paced and more relaxing. It can also be cheaper, especially in places where the U.S. dollar dominates local currency. Japan, for example, which has a large U.S. military presence (such as on the island of Okinawa), has about 42% of American retirees. One former serviceman who retired in Japan said he paid $350 for the country’s national health insurance policy, which covers 70% of his costs, according to Benefits Pro. King, who blogged about his retired life, says another advantage is simply enjoying living in a different culture and having a like-minded expat community. “I believe anyone contemplating becoming an expat to do their research and be open minded,” he said. “Living in a foreign country is not for everyone and if one is doing it because it is less expensive they will probably fail.” That’s the problem — the imbalance between expectation and reality — and it could get a retiree in deep trouble should they move somewhere without proper planning. “People have a romantic notion of what it’s going to be like to live somewhere,” said Ken Moraif, a financial adviser at Money Matters, a financial advice seminar and podcast in Plano, Texas. Moraif suggests people planning to move abroad for retirement test it out first. He had one couple as clients who wanted to sell their home and move to Belize, where they could relax and deep-sea fish, but Moraif suggested they rent a place for six months to try it out. After three months, the clients came back, saying it was a great vacation spot, but not a place they could live. Another client decided to buy a vacation home in Mexico, and had trouble selling the home years ago when the local economy was not doing well. Health care options, cost and availability vary, depending on the location, so retirees should also take into consideration how they will fund health care and what income will sustain them in this new living arrangement. See also: If I retire abroad, what happens to my Social Security and Medicare? Still, it’s important for retirees planning to move abroad — especially to any islands — to check weather patterns and make a list of what they need to know, such as local laws, costs of medical care, taxes, crime, and participating in local and U.S. politics, the U.S. State Department suggests. They should already have an emergency savings and cash on hand, not gold, Moraif said. Moving back is often an option, and expats consider it, according to a survey of almost 400 people who retired abroad: 42% of the expats never planned to come back to the U.S. and 37% weren’t sure, while 16% do plan to return when they’re old or sick. Another 4% said they intended to move back as soon as possible and 3% said they would move back within five years. They may also want to consider flood insurance if they’re in an area that could flood (almost 80% of the homeowners affected by Hurricane Harvey in Houston did not have flood insurance). And retiring outside the U.S. to paradise isn’t for everyone — in the same survey of expats, about 71% said they were living a simpler, less stressful life, compared with the 82% who were hoping for it. Retirees should also visit their dream destinations during the low season. “All year round is completely different than taking a vacation there,” said Dan Prescher, senior editor of International Living, Internationalliving.com who lives in the south of Guadalajara in western Mexico, with his wife. During that time, go food shopping, see how the internet and phone connectivity is, and imagine actually living there every day, he said. Some people make the mistake of buying property in a place without really giving it a chance, and end up in a tough situation to sell and move again. “People in the states have been doing this for years,” Prescher said. “The only difference is you’re looking offshore, so you’re going a little farther and English may not be the language where you land.” ",After the hurricanes: What to know before retiring abroad - MarketWatch

Finally, right Paul? Not once have I thought, ""You know, I wonder what Steven Seagal thinks about any single issue in the world today."" At any rate, Seagal conveyed his thoughts with the signature flair he brought to such cinematic masterpieces as “The Patriot” and “The Foreigner.” Oh, but he wasn’t done. Not by a long shot. It’s probably best we let him finish. “I believe in free speech, I believe everyone’s entitled to their own opinion,” Seagal continued in an interview on ITV Wednesday. “But I don’t agree that they should hold the United States of America or the world hostage by taking a venue where people are tuning in to watch a football game and imposing their political views.” Seagal also took a flying side kick to face of the Deep State. “We have these Democrats that have this whole other agenda to kind of — when I say Democrats it’s not just the Democrats, but there are this whole group of left of Obama-ites and people that feel they should overthrow Trump,” he said. “And any decisions he makes, anything he tries to do, he gets blocked often from the enemies within, so it’s very difficult for him to do anything.” Watch the full clip here: It wasn’t so much the message, however, that made “Steven Seagal” one of the internet’s top trending topics on Wednesday morning.

Alessandra Malito,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 28, 2017 9:42 a.m. ET This is the average new retiree age around the world By Americans may wonder if they’ll ever retire in their 60s, but for in most other parts of the world, retirement age is closer to early to late 50s. The full retirement age for Americans is 66 years old, according to the Social Security Administration. The oldest official age of retirement is in Norway, where it’s 67.75 years old, and on the other side of the spectrum, Yemen’s official age of retirement is 53, according to an analysis of retirement ages around the world conducted by caregiving firm Aperion Care. Countries in South America range between mid to late 50s — Venezuelans are officially retired at 57.5 years old and for Brazilians, it’s 60. The official retirement age of most European countries hovers in the mid-60s. See: 10 of the greatest places in the world to retire if you’re not rich The face of retirement has changed drastically for Americans. At one point, workers could rely on defined benefit plans, also known as pensions, where employers’ were responsible for funding most if not all of a retiree’s life. Most Americans now, however, are on the hook for their retirement savings, either funding defined contribution plans, or employer-sponsored plans, and individual retirement accounts or other vehicles. Almost all Americans in a Transamerica survey on retirement felt “very or somewhat” personally responsible for making sure they had enough to survive in retirement, compared with 73% of respondents around the world. Does this mean Americans are the most prepared for retirement? Hardly, in contrast, many have barely saved for it. India came out on top of financial services firm Aegon’s Retirement Readiness Index, scored on personal responsibility, awareness, financial understanding, planning and financial preparations and income replacement. Indian workers said almost half of their retirement income came from their own savings, and they were also the most likely to have a backup plan for their later years. But Americans also aren’t the only ones anxious about retirement. Pre-retirees in four countries (the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Australia) are nervous about whether or not they’ll be OK in retirement, which makes them less satisfied about their finances than retirees, who are currently experiencing retired life, according to a research report by investment management giant Vanguard. In the U.S. and Canda, 65% of recent retirees felt highly satisfied with their financial situations, compared with 53% of pre-retirees in the U.S. and 46% in Canada. In the U.K., 78% of recent retirees were highly satisfied compared with 52% of pre-retirees, and in Australia, those numbers were 59% and 41%, respectively. In essence, sometimes the anxiety of transitioning into retirement could be worse than the reality of it for some retirees. See also: How we retired to a beautiful, inexpensive town in Italy And just because some countries have younger retirement ages, or are on a list of top retirement hot spots, doesn’t mean Americans should go flocking there immediately for their golden years (even though about 400,000 Americans are currently retired abroad). Along with the idea of relaxing through retirement, Americans might want to consider family, taxes, crime and health care if they were to live abroad. What’s more, a country’s “official” retirement age doesn’t always reflect reality. Just like many Americans work well into their late 60s because they didn’t save enough or simply don’t want to give up their jobs, Aperion’s map shows some people stop working before and after that official age.

,10052017,Reuters,09282017,"WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday expelled 15 Cuban diplomats to protest Cuba’s failure to protect staff at the U.S. embassy in Havana from a mysterious spate of health “attacks,” spurring new tensions between the former Cold War foes. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the expulsions from Cuba’s embassy in Washington were also intended to ensure “equity” in staffing levels, after he recalled more than half the U.S. diplomatic personnel in Havana on Friday. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez denounced the decision as “unjustified,” accused the United States of insufficient cooperation with Cuba’s investigation of the health incidents and urged Washington to stop politicizing the matter. The steps taken by Republican President Donald Trump’s administration delivers another blow to his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama’s policy of rapprochement, including actions likely to erode the normalization of a relationship dominated for decades by mutual hostility and suspicion. The latest U.S. move was communicated to Cuban Ambassador Jose Ramon Cabanas on Tuesday, and the diplomats were given seven days to leave, a State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Until the Government of Cuba can ensure the safety of our diplomats in Cuba, our embassy will be reduced to emergency personnel to minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm,” Tillerson said in a statement. “We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, and will continue to cooperate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks,” he added. The United States announced on Friday that it was sharply reducing its diplomatic presence in Cuba, as it warned U.S. citizens not to visit the Communist-ruled island because of the alleged attacks it says have caused hearing loss, dizziness and fatigue in 22 U.S. embassy personnel. The State Department had said the embassy was halting regular visa operations for Cubans seeking to visit the United States and would offer only emergency services to U.S. citizens. Cuba has denied involvement in any attacks and says it has reinforced security for U.S. diplomatic personnel. Rodriguez said lack of U.S. cooperation had stymied its own investigation into the matter. Authorities had not provided access to the injured people and the doctors who examined them, or to the homes where the attacks allegedly took place, he said, adding that evidence had been delivered late. Rodriguez urged the United States to cooperate more and said Cuba was also working with Canada on the investigation as Canadian diplomats have reported similar symptoms. So far, none of the probes have yielded any answers about how the alleged attacks were carried out or who was responsible. Several Cuban-American Republican lawmakers, including U.S Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, had urged that Cuban diplomats be kicked out in retaliation for the Cuban government’s failure to get to the bottom of the attacks. “I commend the U.S. State Department for expelling a number of Cuban operatives from the U.S.,” Rubio, an influential voice on Trump’s Cuba policy, said in a statement. But James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, a Washington-based pro-engagement lobbying group said: “This decision appears to be purely political, driven by the desire of a handful of individuals in Congress to halt progress between our two countries.” “It looks like we are returning the threats and tensions of the 1960s,” said Maria Fernandez, a 45-year-old office worker in Havana. “This is madness by Trump. It’s really sad, because we are so close, and yet so far away from a sincere rapprochement.” Trump, who in June vowed to partially roll back the detente with Cuba agreed by his Democratic predecessor Obama after five decades of hostility, called the Cuban government “corrupt and destabilizing” in his address to the United Nations last month. Cuba described his comments as “unacceptable and meddling.” Rodriguez urged the United States “not to continue politicizing this matter, which can provoke an undesirable escalation and could rarify and reverse even more bilateral relations.” In Havana, U.S. diplomats frantically selling off their belongings at garage sales and on social media, said they were disappointed to be ordered to leave. In a message on Facebook, the embassy’s top official, career diplomat Scott Hamilton, said he would also be leaving. “I am an optimist and hope we will return one day, before too long,” he wrote. “Hasta la proxima Cuba.” ","

,10052017,Reuters,09282017,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Businesses catering to U.S. tourists visiting Cuba have had a rude awakening in the last few months after enjoying a 2-1/2-year boom. First, U.S. President Donald Trump in June ordered tighter restrictions on travel to the Caribbean island. Then the U.S. State Department warned on Friday against going there after a spate of alleged attacks on its diplomats in Havana, stating until the cause was determined, it could not guarantee Americans’ safety. The new regulations have not yet been published, and the warning does not mean Americans cannot travel to Cuba. Still, the moves relegate the island back to the realm of “forbidden fruit” to be enjoyed at one’s peril. “Just as the re-establishment of Cuba-U.S. relations was a positive influence, now this will be very negative,” said Jose Enrique Montoto, who rents an apartment, often to American guests, through the online marketplace Airbnb. “They are creating a mood of insecurity for those who want to travel to Cuba.” Montoto, 57, said three U.S. citizens who were set to arrive in Havana on Saturday had canceled their reservation with him at the last minute without an explanation. He worried that more would do the same. To be sure, less than 10 percent of foreign visitors to the island are Americans, even though the number of those travelers tripled to 285,000 last year due to new exemptions to the travel ban in the wake of the 2014 U.S.-Cuban historic detente under former U.S. President Barack Obama. According to Cuban government statistics, that would place local revenues from Americans’ sojourns at about $300 million. Cuba has long catered largely to Canadian and European tourists, and some local business owners said recent events under Trump were a harsh reminder not to rely too much on one market. Still, others said Americans were particularly good clients who paid well. They also feared the U.S. travel warning would further tarnish Cuba’s image as a safe and idyllic destination after Hurricane Irma wreaked havoc there last month. A dip in tourism this year would be a further blow to Cuba’s economy, which already is struggling with a drop in cheap oil shipments from key ally Venezuela, lower exports and a cash crunch. However, business could suffer if fewer Americans visit there. Trump has said he wants to eliminate one of the most popular exemptions to the U.S. travel ban on Cuba, the self-directed “people-to-people” category. Confusion remains about what will be allowed. “I’m concerned about the impact (the warning) will have on our 2018 and 2019 business,” said Andrea Holbrook, owner of Gainesville, Florida-based Holbrook Travel, which runs tours to more than 30 countries. “Cuba certainly has been an emerging destination,” she said on Saturday at a Havana conference organized by the Responsible and Ethical Cuba Travel association (RESPECT), a U.S. group of more than 150 businesses and non-profits bringing Americans to the island. U.S. tour operators said the alleged attacks had not affected any U.S. tourists and that Cuba remained one of the safest destinations possible. “Our conclusion was this seems to be a political statement, not a warning because they are worried about peoples’ health,” said RESPECT Co-Coordinator Bob Guild. Cubans in the hospitality sector said that rather than wait for relations to improve under Trump, they should instead look to new markets. “He is trying to close the door to us ever more,” said Aimee Santos, 53, who rents out her flat, “but whenever a door closes, others open.” ","

,10052017,Reuters,09282017,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Refugees and migrants in Greece receive little or no medical care for most health problems they face and fewer than half of those pregnant had access to maternal care, aid group Doctors of the World said on Tuesday. About 60,000 migrants and refugees are stranded in Greece, most in overcrowded camps with unsanitary conditions. More than half of this year’s 20,000 arrivals were women and children, United Nations data shows. Doctors of the World interviewed over 14,000 women treated at its clinics in Greece over three years and found fewer than 47 percent had access to antenatal care before it intervened. It also found as many as 72 percent of the health problems refugees faced were treated “inadequately” or not at all. While most countries offer new arrivals some kind of medical screening, the quality was “questionable” and overlooked mental health problems, the charity said. Often, women did not seek medical care because they were unaware of their rights, they found the healthcare system too complex or they were afraid of being arrested or discriminated against. Limited resources and lack of access to services such as translators also posed practical obstacles. “Every mother deserves good care before, during and post pregnancy. Their residential status should not affect this basic right,” said Nikitas Kanakis, head of Doctors of the World Greece. The charity, together with healthcare company MSD, known in the United States as Merck, is implementing a two-year initiative aimed at providing maternal healthcare services to pregnant women and babies from vulnerable populations in Greece. Asylum seekers in Greece have free access to hospitals and medical care but the public health system, already battered by years of economic crisis, is struggling to cope with the numbers. Adult migrants without documents only have access to emergency care unless they are considered “vulnerable”. “Access to quality maternal healthcare can save lives, yet across Europe the most vulnerable pregnant women are still facing challenges in accessing this basic care,” said Mary-Ann Etiebet, director of MSD for Mothers. A lack of antenatal care to prevent and identify conditions that may harm the fetus or mother increases the risk of complications during childbirth or passing on diseases such as HIV or Hepatitis B, the World Health Organisation says. “We must work together this address this issue before it escalates further,” Etiebet said. (The story is refiled to clarify MSD name in paragraph 8) ","

,10052017,Reuters,09282017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Hurricane Irma lashed Orlando, Florida, last month, Amanda Leite needed a doctor for her 4-year-old daughter, who had a fever. Finding a pediatrician’s office with both electricity and a doctor on call was not an option. Neither was breaking curfew to get to an emergency room. Until then, Leite had never thought about telehealth, which is seeing a doctor via video chat. The service is now offered through most major health insurance systems with a copay equal to that of a traditional doctor’s office visit. It can also be obtained independently for per-use costs that vary by provider and locale. Teladoc Inc, the largest provider in the United States, says it sees about 5,000 patients a day, for an out-of-pocket fee of $45 or less. Leite then remembered a notice she had seen on Facebook from Nemours Children’s Hospital that its telehealth app, which is serviced through American Well, would be free for those affected by the storm. Within minutes, she had a doctor on her phone screen who had access to her daughter’s electronic health record. They did a basic exam, with Leite pressing on her daughter’s stomach, weighing her and holding her phone to the child’s mouth so the doctor could see her throat. The doctor determined that rushing to the hospital was not necessary, and that the girl could wait to see her regular doctor when the storm cleared. “It made me feel a lot better that I didn’t need to rush her to ER,” said Leite, 37. She is now sold on using a doctor online for future occasions when she is unable to travel or when the illness requires no immediate hands-on exam. OPEN-ENROLLMENT PUSH Employers hope this concept of gaining remote access to doctors catches on quickly, because it promises cost savings. As companies start the annual process of open enrollment for healthcare benefits for the coming year, expect a big push by Corporate America to promote the availability of telehealth. U.S. companies are facing a 4.3 percent increase in health benefit costs for 2018, the highest since 2011, according to benefit consultant Mercer, and are looking for options beyond raising deductibles or copays, which shifts the burden to employees. Five years ago, only 7 percent of companies covered telehealth visits through health insurance plans, but today, 96 percent of companies treat them like regular doctor’s visits,  according to a survey released in August by the National Business Group on Health, a nonpartisan research group. Usage rates are low, however, with only 2.5 percent of employees at companies surveyed actually using the service, because the availability is so new. “It’s becoming a more accepted practice now,” said Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health. Getting more people on board is a matter of effective communication - companies that are the most proactive about publicizing telehealth to their employees tend to obtain the best response rates. Craft retailer Michaels Companies Inc, which uses the Teladoc system for its employees, has a usage rate of about 4 percent among its full-time employees. Sharon Brown, director of benefits, is encouraging workers to use it because she thinks it saves money compared with going to an emergency room or urgent care facility. “We have shift workers, and they can’t always get to the doctor when it is open,” said Brown. “They are saving time, so there’s a productivity cost. It’s less money out of their pockets for travel or lost time at work.” To reach employees this year, Brown is sending out postcards and magnets. But her most effective messaging is something she calls the Porcelain Post - messages from human resources that get taped up in bathroom stalls across their 1,300 stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants. Staffing company Adecco Group AG uses the American Well system for telehealth, and the head of human resources walks around the North American headquarters in Jacksonville, Florida, handing out Starbucks gift cards to employees who have downloaded the telehealth app. It had 28 percent of U.S. employees sign up, and 55 percent used the service in its first year, for a cost savings to the employer of $130,000, said Michelle Gile, a senior vice president for American Well. Some independent research is a little less rosy. A March 2017 study in Health Affairs found that the costs of treating bronchitis and similar conditions increased by $45 per user when telehealth was involved - mostly because the availability of telehealth encouraged more doctor care, not less. Some of those seeking care did not have a regular doctor. Some were using telehealth as a precursor to an office visit, like triage, said Scott Ashwood, an associate policy researcher at the nonpartisan Rand Corporation, who led the study. The American Medical Association backs telehealth as “an ongoing evolution of new models for the delivery of care and patient-physician interactions.” But the organization also cautions that providers recognize the “limitations of the relevant technologies and take appropriate steps to overcome those limitations,” said AMA board member Jack Resneck in a 2016 statement. “It’s not for everything,” said NBGH’s Wojcik. “There are some times when you need to go see a physician in person. But for a lot of primary care situations, you can probably talk through telehealth. And I think financially, everyone wins.” ","

,10052017,Reuters,09282017,"DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Armed groups in Central African Republic are using rape and sexual slavery as weapons of war in an abuse that may amount to crimes against humanity, a rights group said on Thursday. Thousands have died and a fifth of Central Africans have been uprooted in a conflict that broke out after the mainly Muslim Seleka rebels ousted President Francois Bozize in early 2013, provoking a backlash from Christian anti-balaka militias. Both the Seleka and the anti-balaka have sexually assaulted, raped and enslaved civilians as revenge against those believed to be supporting the other side, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said. Yet not a single militant on either side of the conflict has been arrested or tried for sexual violence, HRW said. “Armed groups are using rape in a brutal, calculated way to punish and terrorise women and girls,” HRW researcher Hillary Margolis said following the release of a report documenting 305 cases of rape and sexual slavery against women and girls. “Under international law, these offences ... may be considered crimes against humanity and war crimes,” HRW said. Victims told HRW how militants often raped them in front of their children, and abused, attacked and killed their relatives. Many women and girls were whipped, tied up and burned, and gang-raped repeatedly while being held as sex slaves, HRW said. “Every day we could not rest – every day there was rape, by different fighters,” 30-year-old Jeanne, who was held captive by Seleka fighters for six months in 2014, told the rights group. Stigma, impunity for attackers and a dysfunctional justice system has prevented many victims from speaking out, HRW said. Only 11 of the 296 survivors interviewed by HRW said they had tried to seek justice, with some victims blamed for their ordeal and others told to present their attackers for arrest. Most victims said they had not received post-rape medical or mental health care - such as drugs to prevent HIV and unwanted pregnancy - due to a lack of health facilities, the cost of services or transport, and misconceptions about their options. “Every day, survivors live with the devastating aftermath of rape, and the knowledge that their attackers are walking free, perhaps holding positions of power, and to date facing no consequences whatsoever,” Margolis said in a statement. Widespread killings and rapes of civilians by militants in Central African Republic - where militia violence has risen this year - have also been documented by the United Nations and other rights groups, such as Amnesty International. The United Nations is helping the government to establish a Special Criminal Court, agreed to in 2015, to try the worst crimes committed in the landlocked nation. ","

 ,10052017,Reuters,09282017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When disaster hits the chemical plants in Port Arthur, Texas, triggering fires like those that flared in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Hilton Kelley is the man fielding panicked calls from neighbors unsure whether they should evacuate their homes. Kelley, 57, is a well-respected figure in his community but is not a government or plant safety official. For 18 years, he has led a non-profit group based in Port Arthur that advises residents on air safety and dispatches a crew in emergencies, helping people to safety in more than 30 major fires or explosions. More than 1,500 accidents at chemical plants have been reported in the United States since 2007, and amendments to the Clean Air Act issued in the last days of former President Barack Obama’s administration would have forced plants handling risky chemicals to coordinate emergency plans with local responders. Kelley says those changes would have made his job easier by, for example, obliging plant owners to tell first responders what chemicals were on site. That would help them decide what equipment and training would be needed to help people. President Donald Trump’s administration suspended the regulations, placing them in a two-year review. Trade associations argued the new rules were inconsistent with Trump’s pledges to cut regulations and with his executive order issued in January requiring federal agencies to offset each new regulation with two deregulatory actions. The full scope of the effects of the two-for-one requirement will begin to emerge in late November, when the White House is expected to publish a list of regulations and deregulatory actions each agency has taken under the rule. A Reuters examination of rules published in the Federal Register, a U.S. government journal, shows that so far in 2017, agencies have proposed or finalized 25 deregulatory measures under the two-for-one requirement - a broad easing of rules that will affect workers from miners and farmers to pilots and crane operators. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2x8aRl3) The rollbacks will delay deadlines for farmers to comply with water quality requirements, speed up the approval process for natural gas exports, make it easier for public transportation projects to attract private financiers, and lift a rule that requires employers to disclose when they hire consultants to defeat union-organizing campaigns. A few of these measures will have minimal effect, or were planned before Trump took office. But most of the deregulatory actions dismantle rules that took years to develop. Some former agency officials, mostly from the Obama administration, have decried the rollbacks, saying the measures being targeted were aimed at protecting the public against significant health and safety threats. Industry groups, however, say many of the measures were onerous and unnecessary, and they are now using Trump’s push to cut red tape to urge agencies to delay, modify or undo rules they have long opposed. The Plastics Industry Association, representing nearly a thousand companies, for example, pressed for the removal of the Clean Air Act amendments, arguing that they would force companies to divulge sensitive information, such as improvements made after a plant accident, that would not help mitigate a disaster but could attract the interest of terrorists, said Marie Gargas, the association’s senior technical director for regulatory affairs. The White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the agency that serves as a clearinghouse for federal regulations, did not respond to multiple requests from Reuters for comment. But in April, Marcus Peacock, then-special adviser to OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, defended Trump’s order at a roundtable event in Washington, saying, “A lot of the deregulatory actions that people will focus on first are those that simply make it easier for people to fill out paperwork or just fill out less paperwork, probably.” Under Trump’s two-for-one-push, the Department of Labor has proposed rolling back a rule protecting workers from beryllium, an industrial metal and known carcinogen. The department said the rollback would save the shipyard and construction sectors about $11 million annually. The Abrasive Blasting Manufacturers Alliance was among the trade groups welcoming the revocation of the rule, which would have required shipyard and construction companies to train and monitor workers to help them avoid dangerous levels of beryllium exposure. The rule “imposed complex and costly regulations on abrasive blasters, despite no evidence of any beryllium-related illness in the history of the industry,” it said in a statement to Reuters. Multiple studies by occupational health and toxic chemical experts reviewed by Reuters show that exposure to beryllium dust can lead to chronic beryllium disease, a debilitating and potentially fatal lung condition. When the Labor Department under Obama issued the rule in 2015, it said even the legal level of beryllium exposure posed a “significant risk” of the disease. In proposing to revoke the rule in June, the agency, now under new political leadership, said there was “uncertainty” over the efficacy of such a measure. Allen Harville, safety chairman of United Steelworkers Local 8888 in Newport News, Virginia, says he believes dozens of his colleagues have suffered from lung diseases associated with beryllium exposure. But blood tests to confirm the link cost hundreds of dollars and are not offered at most hospitals, so few can prove it, he said. Harville said beryllium exposure isn’t limited to workers: it leaves the worksite in clouds of blasting dust and the gritty coal slag that sticks to workers’ clothes and skin, which risks exposing others. The beryllium case is one example of how the deregulatory push has angered those who want more protections. “Two-for-one is a sledgehammer that could be used to smash progress in areas they don’t like,” said David Friedman, who helped lead road safety and energy efficiency efforts at the Transportation and Energy departments during the Obama administration. Public interest groups sued Trump in February over the two-for-one deregulatory requirement, arguing it arbitrarily forces agencies to repeal regulations already deemed necessary to protect consumers and workers. Federal attorneys countered that the measure was needed to address outmoded, ineffective or overly burdensome rules. The rollbacks reflect what experts on both sides of Washington’s political divide describe as the biggest deregulatory push by the U.S. government in a generation under Trump, who said during his presidential campaign that 70 percent of federal agency regulations could be eliminated. In August, the Interior Department rescinded Obama-era regulations that clarified how much oil, gas and coal companies should pay the federal government in royalties from mineral extraction on federal land. States receive a portion of those royalties. The rule was aimed at stopping the practice of coal companies selling coal at below-market prices to their affiliated companies as a way to reduce royalty payments the companies owed, according to former Interior Department officials who worked on the rule. Rescinding the rule could save industry between $60 million and $75 million annually, according to an economic analysis the department published in August. But New Mexico and California could lose a combined $18 million in annual royalties that have been used to support schools in the two states, according to statements by the attorneys general of both states, who sued the department over the issue in April. Federal attorneys said the law was defective and companies struggled to comply with it. The National Mining Association, which represents mining companies, said abolishing the rule was consistent with the two-for-one requirement. It had argued that disputes over how much coal companies should pay in royalties are increasingly rare, so the Obama-era rule was not needed.

 ,10052017,Reuters,09282017,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - At least five civilians were killed and 12 others wounded among dozens of casualties in recent fighting in the Libyan migrant smuggling hub of Sabratha, the United Nations said on Monday. Sabratha’s university hospital has twice been hit by shelling, rendering the emergency and surgery units unusable, the U.N. Libya mission said in a statement. The clashes have pitted the Anas al-Dabbashi brigade, a powerful armed group previously known for migrant smuggling, against the Operations Room to combat the Islamic State, a group formed last year to oust jihadists from Sabratha. The fighting broke out when a Dabbashi brigade member was shot dead at a checkpoint, but the brigade’s head has said the underlying cause was the group’s move to stop the departure of migrant boats to Italy following a deal with the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli. Sabratha had been the most common departure point for migrants setting off toward Italy from Libya, until a sudden drop in crossings from July. The health ministry in Tripoli said on Friday that, overall, at least 26 people including combatants had been killed and 170 wounded in nearly two weeks of fighting. ","

 ,10052017,Reuters,09282017,"DANDONG, China (Reuters) - Seated beneath tall windows and dressed simply in singlets and trousers, North Korean painters are hard at work. The artists staple canvases to frames or copy idyllic landscapes from laptop computers. One wears headphones as he brushes a group of running horses onto his canvas. The nine men have come to the Chinese border town of Dandong from Mansudae Art Studio, North Korea’s largest producer of art. There are many outlets like this along the border; they house some of the thousands of North Korean artists who cater to burgeoning demand for their work. “Chinese have begun collecting art, and North Korean art is much easier and cheaper for them to obtain,” says Park Young-jeong, a research fellow at the Korea Culture and Tourism Institute, a Seoul-based organization. In recent years as countries have responded to North Korea’s weapons tests with sanctions, Mansudae and other art studios have increasingly played a more controversial role – helping Pyongyang raise cash abroad. North Korea has long been punished for alleged underhand dealings in minerals, finance and arms; art was seen more as a channel for mutual understanding. That is changing. Mansudae is run by the North Korean state. Its output ranges from statues of global leaders to propaganda posters, embroidery and more. It has built monuments and statues in at least 15 African countries, according to independent United Nations sanctions experts. In a report in February, they said that a part of Mansudae called Mansudae Overseas Projects was a front for the North Korean state to cash in on military deals. As well as monumental statues, they found it built military installations such as a munitions factory and bases in Namibia. A diplomat at the North Korean mission to the U.N. in Geneva said Mansudae had nothing to do with funding weapons manufacturing. No one from Mansudae could be reached. The U.N. Security Council banned Mansudae’s statue business in 2016. On Aug. 5, after Pyongyang conducted more weapons tests, the Security Council blacklisted Mansudae Art Studio, subjecting it to a global asset freeze and travel ban. Diplomats say this will prevent Mansudae from conducting business. “With this listing, anything Mansudae produces - including paintings, other artwork, monuments, buildings, and other construction - cannot be bought and should be frozen per the asset freeze,” said a U.N. Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. In a further resolution on Sept. 11, the Security Council decided that all joint ventures with North Korean entities or individuals must be shut down within 120 days, or by mid-January. Exactly what the measures mean for existing Mansudae art has yet to become clear. In Beijing’s art district, a gallery called the Mansudae Art Gallery says it is the studio’s official overseas gallery. Its head insists the sanctions do not apply to it and says they have had no impact on his business. “Now more than ever we need avenues like art to create understanding between North Korea and the rest of the world,” said Ji Zhengtai. It is not possible to estimate the total value of Mansudae’s dealings, but the Security Council diplomat said the business had earned tens of millions of dollars globally. Mansudaeartsudio.com, a website in Italy which calls itself Mansudae’s “official website abroad,” says the studio is “probably the largest art production center in the world.” Mansudae’s Pyongyang studio covers 120,000 sq m (nearly 30 acres), employs about 4,000 people including around 1,000 artists, and is divided into 13 creative groups, seven manufacturing plants and more than 50 supply departments, the website says. The website is run by Pier Luigi Cecioni, who sells Mansudae works online and at fairs through what he calls an exclusive agreement with Mansudae Art Studio. He declined to say how much he sells, but in August after the sanctions on Mansudae Art Studio were announced, he told Reuters that the revenues go direct to the studio to pay for paints and equipment. Cecioni said he sells works from his personal collection, most of them bought several years ago - before sanctions on Mansudae were announced. His website makes clear that any online purchase is made with his Italian company, not Mansudae. U.N. sanctions are not retroactive. A panel of independent experts is charged with monitoring U.N. sanctions on North Korea. It reports violations and recommendations to the Security Council’s North Korea sanctions committee. Its reports are confidential, but the committee traditionally publishes annual reports. Hugh Griffiths, who heads the panel, declined to comment, saying “the matter is subject to an ongoing investigation.” Cecioni said, “the last thing I want is to have trouble with Italian or American authorities. I have strong contacts, especially with the Italian ones, and they help me to respect all the rules.” An Italian foreign ministry source said it is customary to keep contact with everyone who has ties to countries under sanctions, to ensure they respect Italy’s international commitments. In September, Cecioni said that he had no plans to shut down his operation. “I consider it very important to let people know that ... North Koreans do not make only bombs but also art and are common people,” he said. He postponed an exhibition of propaganda posters he had planned for September in Treviso, but said this was because Mansudae’s representatives told him they thought it unwise to showcase their anti-U.S. tone in the current climate. Word of the sanctions has been slower to reach China. A circular from its Commerce Ministry announcing the start date of the measures which included Mansudae Art Studio does not name Mansudae. Asked why not, the ministry did not respond. The Dandong center works in partnership with Mansudae, said its manager, Gai Longji. Asked on the day the sanctions took effect if they were affecting business, he did not answer directly. “We don’t do politics,” he said. “We do art.” Liaoning Sanyi, the firm behind the center, did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters spoke to at least 30 experts - collectors, art historians, academics and people who have sold North Korean art globally. Many said the market for paintings is niche and amounts to little in terms of revenue compared with the billion-plus dollars North Korea has raised every year selling coal and other minerals abroad. Even so, they say North Korean diplomats in Europe have been enthusiastic to promote art exhibitions with the simple aim of bringing in hard currency. In China, demand has really taken off. Dandong is a popular attraction for tourists who come to peep at North Koreans over the Yalu River border. Busloads of tourists show up every morning. Visitors sample a North Korean speciality of noodles in cold soup, watch North Korean women sing and dance, and buy North Korean paintings. Besides Mansudae, just about every ministry and almost all the local authorities in North Korea have an art studio, said Koen De Ceuster, a lecturer in Korean studies at Leiden University who has been studying North Korean art for over a decade. “There’s studios all across the country,” he said. Other prominent studio names include Paekho and the Central Arts Studio. Paekho, which means “white tiger” in Korean, is the biggest seller of popular paintings in Dandong, traders there said. Collectors who have dealt with Paekho say it is run by North Korea’s military - Reuters could not independently establish this. Paekho’s varied output includes propaganda posters calling for a nuclear-free world. The Dandong center that Reuters visited has hosted around 500 North Korean artists since 2014, manager Gai said. They stay for between six months and three years. Many Dandong galleries house North Korean painters. Staff there said they have sold North Korean paintings for as much as $100,000 to buyers around the world. Art experts agree the pieces can very occasionally fetch six-figure sums. Not all the proceeds go to Pyongyang. Mark-ups can reach four or five times the dealer’s purchase price, according to one Dandong dealer. While the Security Council’s Aug. 5 sanctions targeted only Mansudae, its September resolution on joint ventures also included restrictions on North Korean labor: This combination  could hurt everyone in the art business, Dandong traders say. But there are ways around the measures, they add. For instance, paintings from Mansudae could be sold under the name of an art studio that hasn’t been sanctioned. Artists come to China under cultural exchange visas, not as workers. And two businessmen said paintings have long been accepted instead of cash in the barter deals that fuel the region’s economy. At the other end of the border from Dandong in the city of Yanji, Chinese antiques dealer Zhao Xiangchen said people usually roll up a couple of paintings and carry them quietly across the border to him. His antiques stall was thick with dust as he camped in a vacant slot next door, selling the paintings online. Since the sanctions were announced, Zhao said, Chinese customs have become more vigilant. “But I’m playing the long game,” he said. “I still think there’s huge latent demand for North Korean art in the Chinese market, that’s only set to grow.” ","

With that in mind, a number of mid-cap and large-cap stocks are growing their payouts faster than the broader market, have hefty payout ratios, and have beaten the S&P 500 Index (SPX) in total returns over the past year, Barron's reports. Investing in such stocks is the focus of the $3 billion Nuveen Santa Barbara Dividend Growth Fund (NSBAX), which has delivered an annualized total return of 7.31% during the 10 years through October 2, versus 7.34% for the S&P 500 over the same period, and better than 77% of its peers in the large-cap blended category, per Morningstar Inc. The Nuveen fund holds about 40 stocks including these seven: computer and smartphone maker Apple Inc. (AAPL); software and cloud computing giant Microsoft Corp. (MSFT); banking giant JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM); health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH); oil exploration, refining, and marketing company Phillips 66 (PSX); nationwide banking institution Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC); and diversified industrial products company Honeywell International Inc. (HON). Barron's breaks down these and other stocks in the table below. Source: Barron's The seven stocks all have one-year total returns in excess of the 19.1% delivered by the S&P 500, per Morningstar. Their recent one-year total returns are, ranging upwards: 19.5% for Phillips 66, 23.4% for Honeywell, 23.8% for Wells Fargo, 30.5% for Microsoft, 38.8% for Apple, 40.3% for UnitedHealth, and 46.9% for JPMorgan Chase. These total returns partially result from high dividend yields and generous payout ratios. Referring again to the Barron's table above, and based their most recent fiscal years, the payout ratios for the seven stocks all exceed 26%, and Phillips 66 leads the field with a hefty payout ratio of 86.9%. Its recent yield of 3.1% also is the best in the group. Investopedia earlier this week noted one strategist's advice that it's time to move into defensive investments, including risk-averse, high-yielding energy stocks.

Apple is his leading holding at 4.51% of the portfolio, per Morningstar. Boothe is particularly upbeat about the new iPhone 8, for which he expects strong sales. Another reason for investor optimism: Apple is likely to be a big beneficiary of tax reform that facilitates repatriation of its massive overseas cash hoard, worth about $216 billion. Similarly, Microsoft has about $128 billion in cash held abroad. (For more, see also: 5 Stocks That May Win Big From Tax Reform.) JPM Total Return Price data by YCharts JPMorgan Chase's outlook for continued earnings growth and dividend increases is underpinned by a strong franchise, and thus being ""very well positioned to take market share from competitors,"" as he indicates to Barron's. He also notes that, as the Federal Reserve unwinds its balance sheet, interest rates will rise, boosting bank profits, also a plus for Wells Fargo. Boothe likes the diversified business model at UnitedHealth, which extends beyond health insurance to benefits management, consulting, and managed care. He projects double-digit earnings increases, both organic and from acquisitions. Already robust dividend payouts at Phillips 66 should get a further boost from reduced capital expenditures in 2018, per Boothe. He also expects increased cash flow as recently-completed projects start producing, allowing for future dividend hikes of about 10% per year. Honeywell is another holding whose future dividends should benefit from forecasted decreases in capital spending, he adds.  ",Investors Eye 7 Dividend Powerhouses Beating The S&P | Investopedia
Dan Mangan,10052017,CNBC,09282017,"The people who used to run Obamacare for the government are now trying to save Obamacare from the government — with a new private effort to get people to sign up for health insurance. Faced with continued hostility toward the Affordable Care Act by the Trump administration, a group of former health officials in the Obama administration on Wednesday unveiled a project called Get America Covered. The campaign will seek to build public awareness about the coming insurance enrollment season and affordability of health plans. The project comes after the Trump administration shortened the enrollment window for Obamacare plans, slashed budgets for promoting sign-ups and ordered federal officials not to participate in traditional partnerships with state-based health coverage campaigns. Get America Covered leaders are hoping to offset, at least somewhat, the potential drop-off in enrollment levels this season that could result from the Trump administration's actions. ""If the administration was committed to making sure people had the information they needed to sign up for health care, we wouldn't need to start Get America Covered,"" said campaign co-founder Lori Lodes. ""But people's lives are at stake so everyone has to step up and fill whatever gaps they can so people get the health care they need,"" said Lodes, a former communications director for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Lodes told CNBC that the campaign has an initial budget of ""six figures,"" with that funding coming from individuals, organizations and foundations, whom she declined to identify. Lodes said the campaign planned to raise additional funds from online donations. Her co-founder in Get America Covered is Joshua Peck, former chief marketing officer for HealthCare.gov. That federally run Obamacare exchange sells individual private health plans in most of the country, and funnels people in the remaining states to the state-run insurance marketplaces that serve their areas. Serving as national co-chairs of Get America Covered are former CMS chief Andy Slavitt, insurance industry executive Mario Molina, the actors Alyssa Milano and Bradley Whitford, and news commentator Van Jones. Tweet In addition to reminding people of the enrollment deadline, the group said it also will be highlighting the fact that most Obamacare customers who buy coverage through a government exchange qualify for financial aid that can reduce their coverage costs to between $50 and $100 per month, or even less in some cases. Get America Covered has a relatively short window in which to get its work done. Unlike past open enrollment seasons, which spanned over months, people who want to have health coverage from a private individual plan in 2018 have half as much time to sign up this year: Nov. 1 and Dec. 15. Only people who qualify for so-called special enrollment periods can sign up after that. People who have coverage through a job, Medicare and Medicaid have different sign-up periods. The Affordable Care Act was created as a result of President Barack Obama's desire to expand health-care coverage in the United States. Since Obama signed the ACA into law in 2010, about 20 million Americans have gained insurance coverage, and the uninsured rate has fallen to record lows. Until Obama left office in January, Slavitt, Lodes, Peck and other top federal health officials had been avid promoters of ACA enrollment efforts, highlighting sign-up deadlines and touting the advantages of having coverage. The ACA requires most Americans to have some form of health insurance or pay a fine. To facilitate compliance with that mandate, the ACA authorized the creation of government-run insurance exchanges, such as HealthCare.gov, which sell plans offered by private insurers. But since taking office, President Donald Trump has tried, unsuccessfully, to have Congress repeal and replace major parts of the ACA with new health-care legislation. At the same time, CMS and its parent, the Department of Health and Human Services, have gone from being the leading cheerleaders of the ACA to among its staunchest critics, issuing negative statements on the law and highlighting situations the agencies claim show Obamacare is failing. That change in tone has concerned Obamacare supporters, who fear that Americans will assume that the ACA is no longer the law, and that there is no legal obligation for them to have insurance coverage. ""We can't make up for what the [Trump] administration refuses to do,"" Peck said. But, Peck also said, ""We're taking everything we learned about how to reach people with the information they need about deadlines and financial help and are getting to work to helping more people enroll."" CMS declined to comment Wednesday when asked about the Get America Covered campaign. ",The people who used to run Obamacare are now trying to save Obamacare
"Joel Landau, founder of The Allure Group",10052017,CNBC,09282017,"What do you get when an abundant demographic cohort hits the 65-year mark? A wave of baby boomers retiring in excess, to the tune of 10,000 men and women a day. That may seem like a big number, but it's accurate, according to Pew Research and the Social Security Administration. The question is: Are Americans prepared to live comfortably post-retirement? And perhaps more importantly, is the health-care industry ready for the associated medical burden? Health-care news and the costs associated with it are obviously on everyone's mind, and for good reason. As health care continues to take up a larger part of the overall economy, structural changes — such as the push toward paying for value, greater emphasis on care management and increased cost sharing with consumers — are taking a stronger hold, pulling back against rapid health-care spending growth. Retiring baby boomers will more than double Medicare and Medicaid costs by 2020, according to industry data. As health-care costs increase faster than economic growth, Medicare taxes and the Trust Fund will cover less and less. By 2033, some pundits say, the Trust Fund will be bankrupt, and taxes will pay only for 48 percent of the costs. Americans are unique in that a vast majority feel personally responsible for retirement preparation — a survey by Transamerica found that 91 percent felt very or somewhat personally responsible for post-retirement income sufficiency, versus 73 percent of workers globally. But high health-care costs in the United States make it difficult to actually be prepared. According to some industry calculations, a person with a $40,000 annual income needs $1.5 million to comfortably retire (the higher your income, the more millions you need in order to maintain your lifestyle). If that weren't steep enough, this figure doesn't include health costs. More from Active/Passive: Indexing still on top, but active management plays role Why traditional investment strategies don't work I am a lazy, cheap investor. Here's why. Since health costs rise along with age, this equation gets more problematic. The average 65-year-old couple in retirement can expect to pay $275,000 in out-of-pocket expenses for health care, according to Fidelity Investments. But by some estimates, they only have a 50 percent chance of covering these costs. According to a report by AARP, ""the U.S. stands out for the high cost of health care and its failure to generate better health outcomes."" So no matter how personally responsible emerging seniors may feel, half are likely to fall short when medical costs are concerned. There's Social Security, sure, but the reserve is expected to be depleted by 2033. The limits of Medicare and Medicaid are being tested as well. According to the Congressional Budget Office, by 2035 spending for Medicare alone will reach 8 percent of gross domestic product; as of 2080, that figure may be 15 percent. And since emerging retirees will both live longer and experience higher rates of hypertension, higher cholesterol, obesity and diabetes, their strain on health and finances will be prolonged. There's no easy solution, but as an entrepreneur in the health-care industry that works with seniors, I feel it's my obligation — and ours in the field collectively — to come up with solutions that strive for patient affordability and ways to actually lower costs behind the scenes. If there is an upside, it's that exorbitant health spending by baby boomers has driven innovation in health care. Not all innovation leads to lowered costs, though; in fact, sometimes the opposite can occur. As new innovations, drugs and processes are created, demand for these services rise, increasing spending by an order of magnitude. I believe smart innovations can, and should, decrease costs, too. Take, for example, the cost of latencies in medication administration, or poor coordination and collaboration between health-care providers. When services aren't streamlined or they fail to account for long-term care, health deteriorates and emergencies arise. The private sector can help by developing services and software with this in mind, filling gaps to prevent costly readmissions and cut down on waste. To put it simply: Innovative treatment is important, absolutely, but if we want to decrease costs, we should focus on streamlining care to preempt the need for expensive treatments. There's another side of this to take into account. As baby boomers retire, they don't just enter a new chapter — they leave big gaps in the workforce, and one many businesses aren't prepared for. To address the health-care industry alone, nearly two-thirds of baby boomer nurses are already considering retiring. This begs the question: When retirees need someone to care for them, will there be enough millennials and Gen Xers employed to do so? Right now the health-care industry is decidedly not adequately prepared. According to The New York Times, ""we already lack sufficient numbers of geriatricians and other professionals — nurses, social workers, pharmacists, aides — trained to care for the elderly, and the shortage is projected to increase."" We need to provide incentives to more young people to get into eldercare and nursing by any means possible. Lastly, nursing homes in the private sector are already alleviating issues for seniors by providing better and more seamless care driven by innovation. In countries such as Japan, for-profit nursing homes are picking up government slack by investing in aging boomers instead of leaving them to the whim of federal funding. Seniors in the United States have the opportunity to benefit from private solutions, as well. In the end, scalable, independent solutions will be the most reliable way for the health-care industry to stay afloat. When that wave of retirees hits — and keeps on hitting — only preparation will soften the blow. Here are some investments that are fixed, keep up with inflation, don't have risk and are offered by insurance firms. By understanding how one investment performs compared to another, you make better decisions about what's right for you.

Dan Mangan,10052017,CNBC,09282017,"Slightly fewer than half of all Americans were vaccinated for the flu last season, a top federal health official warned Thursday, as he called for nearly every person to get a shot by October for the coming season. ""The science on flu vaccination is clear,"" said Dr. Tom Price, secretary of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. ""Vaccination can help prevent you or someone you love from becoming sick and missing school, or work, or worse, becoming severely ill or being hospitalized from or even dying from the flu."" The hospitalization rate last season for influenza was nearly double that of the 2015-2016 season, officials said. Price himself got vaccinated Thursday during a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington. Tweet He said that for this season, health officials are recommending only injectable vaccines, not nasal spray flu vaccine. ""I urge everyone 6 months and older to do the same as soon as vaccine is available in their community,"" said Price. He noted that next year is the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of Spanish flu, which infected a half billion people, and killed up to 5 percent of the world's population. Data released Thursday showed that while there were slight increases in the vaccination rates among people most vulnerable to the flu — adults over age 50 — there were ""mostly stagnant vaccination rates among all age groups,"" according to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. The flu vaccination rate among all Americans was 48.6 percent last season, up just 1.2 percentage points from the prior season. Among children age 6 months through 23 months, the vaccination rate was 76.3 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was the only age group that exceeded the public health goal of 70 percent vaccination coverage, according to NFID. Officials said that for the 2017-2018 season, vaccine manufacturers have estimated that as many as 166 million doses of flu vaccine will be available nationally. More than 73 million doses have already been delivered. The vaccines this season have been modified to protect against the flu viruses that research suggests will be most common in coming months. Price took no questions at the news conference. The health secretary in the past week has come under heavy criticism after the news site Politico revealed he had taken 26 flights on private jets since May, at a cost to taxpayers of more than $400,000. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he is ""not happy"" with Price's use of charter flights. Trump answered, ""We'll see,"" when asked if he would fire Price.

Elizabeth Gurdus,10052017,CNBC,09282017,"As the Dow Jones industrial average continues to reach intraday all-time highs, CNBC's Jim Cramer decided to look back at the stocks that drove the index's gains in the third quarter. The Dow increased by 4.9 percent in the third quarter as the stock market avoided a historically typical September downturn, so the ""Mad Money"" host examined the top 10 stocks responsible for the move. The aerospace giant contributed a massive 37.5 percent to the Dow's gain. Boeing's longer-than-expected order book, strong defense-oriented business and new Dreamliner aircraft model drove buyers to its shares, Cramer said. Caterpillar contributed 11.6 percent to the Dow last quarter. Together, Caterpillar and Boeing accounted for nearly half of the Dow's move. ""The source of CAT's strength? The company had a true blowout quarter thanks to a pickup in orders, very lean inventories and a very low table of employment. It's a big winner as China and Europe return to growth ... and you'd better believe they'll sell more equipment for the rebuild effort in the wake of the recent hurricanes here,"" Cramer said. The big bank's shares gave the Dow a 10.8 percent gain. While Goldman's management acknowledged that the bank's last quarter wasn't so great, the stock nevertheless got a boost from a softer regulatory environment and investor optimism about Goldman's future success. Chevron, an oil stock, accounted for 9 percent of the Dow's third-quarter move. Cramer attributed this to the company proving it wouldn't have a problem paying out its large dividend or surviving in a low-priced oil environment. The move in shares of this credit card giant gave the Dow a 7.8 percent boost last quarter as Visa continued riding the global shift from paper-to-plastic. ""I think what shocked people here is that the modern-day Visa was built by Charlie Scharf, who recently left that job, but his successor, Al Kelly, seems to be handling things perfectly well. I admit I was worried when Scharf left,"" Cramer said. ""I was wrong. Kelly's amazing. Visa's business is humming."" Few companies fared better than UnitedHealth when Congress failed to pass the Trump administration's plan to ""repeal and replace"" Obamacare, Cramer said. The health care giant contributed 7.5 percent to the Dow's gain as it pulled out of money-losing exchanges. ""Even after this run, UNH remains one of the cheapest stocks I follow and if it ever comes down, I'd love to add it to the trust,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. After hurricane season wreaked havoc on parts of the United States, investors rushed into Home Depot's stock as a way to play the rebuilding process. The stock's boost added 7.2 percent to the Dow. The consumer technology colossus added 7.1 percent to the Dow's third-quarter move after a better-than-expected quarter and resurgence of bullish sentiment among analysts on Apple's new iPhones. After a series of disappointing quarterly earnings reports, American Express bounced back with an uptick in profitability, pushing shares upward. The stock gave the Dow 4.4 percent of its gain. Contributing 3.9 percent to the Dow's third-quarter climb, Microsoft proved that Azure was a dominant cloud-based system that helped accelerate the company's growth. ""It's become a must-own tech name for big-time portfolio managers who like growth but also want to sleep at night,"" Cramer said. All in all, Cramer learned three key things from looking at the group in its entirety: ""Put simply, these names went higher largely because they were the only game in town, cash-heavy stocks of companies that are doing better than we thought that could grow in an era of slow growth,"" Cramer said.

"Mike Juang, special to CNBC.com",10052017,CNBC,09282017,"It is most definitely brain surgery. The skull is opened, and electrical leads are implanted directly into the tissue of the brain. These wires are connected to a small device that sends a small dose of electricity into the brain. The treatment, called deep brain stimulation, means patients suffering from neurological disorders like Parkinson's Disease can have the chance to live a normal life without constantly fighting their own bodies. Tremors, or involuntary shaking while a limb is at rest, can be noticeably reduced or even eliminated. Patients regain mobility and are able to walk and even talk normally. YouTube is filled with hundreds of videos demonstrating the ""life-changing"" effects of a DBS device when active, as well as what patient functionality returns to when the device is turned off. Popularly known as a ""brain pacemaker,"" deep brain stimulation works by blocking errant signals from damaged brain cells to ""reset"" the brain's natural rhythm, said Dr. Michael Okun, the medical director of the Parkinson's Foundation and chairman for the Department of Neurology at the University of Florida. During surgery a hole is inserted into the patient's skull and electrical leads are implanted directly into the brain's tissue. The leads are threaded out, and the skull is closed. These wires are threaded behind the ears, down the neck and to the front chest area, where they are connected to a watch-size device that emits a controlled amount of electricity. The entire unit, from wires to generator, are all buried just below the skin. The generator, a self-contained unit with a battery, sends pulses of electricity through the leads to stimulate areas of the brain, reducing or in some cases even eliminating the most debilitating parts of the disease. A small, cellphone-size remote control can be used to adjust the ""dosage"" of electricity and can turn the device on and off. One of the major manufacturers of the device is Medtronic, which has been active in the U.S. market the longest — it first received approval for use of its DBS system for advanced Parkinson's in 2002; the FDA approved it in 2016 for use with patients who have had Parkinson's for at least four years. Abbott Laboratories acquired the DBS business with its acquisition of St. Jude Medical last year; and Boston Scientific, which currently offers its DBS system in Europe, hopes to receive U.S. approval by year-end. The three companies' business lines focused on neurology had roughly $1 billion in combined sales in the most recent reported quarter. Medtronic's brain therapies group is the leader, with $522 million in sales in the most recent quarter, though it does not break out DBS sales specifically. Abbott's neuromodulation unit had $300 million in global sales, with approximately 10 percent coming from DBS sales, but it says DBS has been growing since launching in the United States last year. Each DBS surgery can cost between $35,000 and $50,000, and upward of $70,000 to $100,000 for bilateral procedures (both sides of the brain), according to the National Parkinson Foundation. These estimates include the cost of the surgery, devices, anesthesia, hospital fees and physician fees. Device costs can run to tens of thousands of dollars: The Medtronic DBS unit costs $23,000. Since DBS is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease, Medicare and most private insurance carriers will cover most, if not all, of the costs of the operation, according to NPF. Still, as with any surgery, there are risks. ""The main risk is bleeding,"" said Dr. Matthew Wodziak, a neurologist who specializes in Parkinson's Disease at Loyola Medicine. ""When we find the right place to put something inside the brain, you have the risk of bleeding [and] infection,"" he said. Properly implanted leads do not cause brain damage, and only create microlesions, or small cuts in the brain tissue, and a buildup of glial tissue, cells that support neurons, Okun said. In addition to the complications associated with surgery, DBS devices also require physical maintenance. Batteries in the devices are not rechargeable and need to be replaced, Wodziak said. The hardware can wear over time and may need maintenance. Medtronic says its devices are not susceptible to hacking, and include encrypted signal technology and proprietary algorithms to communicate with remote controllers. Despite progress, experts and doctors are trying to determine exactly how electrical stimulation alleviates the symptoms of brain-related disabilities, Okun said. Doctors are still debating if DBS directly affects the function of brain cells, if it simply introduces changes in the chemical composition and biology of the brain, or some combination of the two. What they do know, Okun said, is that introducing electricity blocks the signals of cells close to the lead while stimulating the ""pipes"" connecting neuron cells, called axons. It also alters the neurochemistry of the brain, the ""ocean"" of fluid in which neurons sit. ""We're using a tiny amount of electricity to influence a large circuit that is malfunctioning, and we're trying to reset the brain,"" Okun said. The electricity restores normal oscillations of the brain, improving the patient's symptoms, he said. In the case of tremors associated with Parkinson's disease, it can make it much more manageable or even stop the tremors completely. The treatment can be used to tackle additional neurological problems and other disorders, Wodziak said, including epilepsy, seizures and dystonia, which is the sustained, involuntary contraction of muscles and can lead to painful cramping of the feet or hands, curling toes, or turning and twisting of the neck. A version of the same technology can even be used on the spinal cord. This year, Dr. Andre Machado of the Cleveland Clinic performed the first DBS surgery for stroke recovery using the Boston Scientific Vercise system. It is also considered for depression and weight loss. Although the treatment has been around since the 90's, there have been some incremental advances to the technology, including leads capable of focusing electricity to increasingly specific parts of the brain and smaller generators capable of connecting to devices using Bluetooth. Abbott's DBS system was the first to be approved in the United States with a ""directional lead,"" which allows physicians to direct current more precisely than traditional DBS. It also allows for system control from an iPod Touch. Future deep brain stimulators may even include sensors that allow it to respond dynamically to changes in brain patterns, said Brett Wall, senior vice president of brain therapies at Medtronic. The company also hopes to reduce the size of devices, eventually making generators rechargeable or even small enough to embed directly on top of the skull, Wall said. Wodziak cautioned though that the surgery is only optimal for patients that will drastically benefit from it. Due to the nature of the surgery, patients opting for DBS it must undergo a bevy of tests from an army of specialists: A neurologist and neuropsychologist to screen patients. A neurosurgeon to perform the implant. A psychiatrist and rehab team including physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists to assist recovery. The best candidates for DBS Have had PD symptoms for at least five years. Have ""on/off"" fluctuations (when a person cycles between ""on"" time, when the medication is working to control symptoms, and ""off"" time, when medication has worn off and PD symptoms return), with or without dyskinesia. Dyskinesia is involuntary, irregular, writhing movement that can range from mild to violent and can sometimes be unpredictable. Continue to have a good response to PD medications, especially carbidopa/levodopa (though the duration of response may be insufficient). Have tried different combinations of carbidopa/levodopa and dopamineagonists under the supervision of a movement disorder neurologist or specialist. Have tried other PD medications – such as entacapone, tolcapone, selegiline,apomorphine or amantadine – without beneficial results. Have PD symptoms that interfere with daily activities. Parkinson's disease patients are also advised to consult with a movement disorders specialist, a neurologist who has completed specialized training in PD and movement disorders, or in the least with neurologists in practice who have become experts in this area through their experience caring for many patients and by taking continuing medical education courses. ""We don't put it in first,"" Okun said. ""We very carefully go through an interdisciplinary evaluation, we find out what's disabling to the patient, we have to make a conscious decision; can our technology tackle all the symptoms in our patient?"" The treatment is meant to be a supplement to, and not a replacement for, medication and other treatments. Patients also need to be aware that many post-operative visits for both DBS programming and medication adjustments will be required, most frequently during the first 6 months following implantation. Many medical centers that offer DBS also require monthly visits for the first six months. DBS is removable and reversible. It's not a cure for Parkinson's Disease. Michael J. Fox, the actor who has become synonymous with the fight to find a cure for Parkinson's and whose foundation offers guidance for those considering the procedure, has spoken in the past about the potential benefits of DBS, but also its limitations. He was first diagnosed in 1991 and in the late 1990s, Fox had a type of brain surgery to relieve his tremors, a thalamotomy — which destroys a small portion of brain tissue — before DBS became an option. Fox told CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta back in 2010 about his decision to not pursue DBS: ""The next time they go in my brain, I want them to get it done. … If there is something that they can do that will be curative or restorative … in a much more fundamental way than a mechanical stop gap, a kind of pacemaker. ... That's just my personal preference, but it's been tremendous in people's lives, hundreds I've met, and thousands that have had the procedure, deep brain stimulation. It's been huge, the improvement ... the people that couldn't walk, people that had a hard time functioning.""

The report from ADP and Moody's often serves as a preview to the government's employment situation report. The latest government read on jobs growth is set for release Friday morning. Other data released Wednesday included the ISM nonmanufacturing index, which hit 59.8 in September. Last month's print easily beat the expected number of 55.5. ""The data are strong and have been strong for a long time. But all these numbers have an asterisk because of the hurricane,"" said Michael Shaoul, chairman and CEO of Marketfield Asset Management. He added the numbers remain strong even after smoothing out the effects from the hurricane. ""What really matters is the [Federal Reserve] is moving away from the specific targeting of inflation.

Meg Tirrell,10052017,CNBC,09282017,"Kaitlyn Johnson, a 7-year-old from outside Dallas who loves cheerleading, her science classes, and the color pink, and Justin Pritikin, a 17-year-old high school senior in New Jersey looking forward to starting college, have never met. But they've got one important thing in common: they were both among the courageous participants in clinical trials of a completely new way to treat cancer.The medicine is called Kymriah, and is among a new wave of therapies that use a patient's own cells as medicine. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Aug. 30 and heralded as a historic event in the annals of cancer treatment. Kaitlyn's and Justin's are both stories of hope. But they also illustrate the early nature of understanding of this new technology, and of how society will pay for it. The technology is CAR-T, for chimeric antigen-receptor T-cell therapy. It uses viruses to deliver genetic material to patients' immune cells, equipping them with homing devices to track down markers on cancer cells.""That is, in this way, a living therapy,"" said Dr. Jay Bradner, president of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research. Novartis markets Kymriah. ""This growth of T-cells in the patient will allow these serial killers to take out millions of cancer cells.""The FDA cleared the medicine to treat patients up to 25 years old with acute lymphoblastic leukemia for whom other therapies have stopped working. It's a small number of patients, about 600 a year in the U.S., but a group with few other options.The agency called the approval a ""historic action… ushering in a new approach to the treatment of cancer and other serious and life-threatening diseases.""Earlier that same week, biotechnology giant Gilead spent $11.9 billion to acquire Novartis's CAR-T competitor, Kite Pharma. Shares of Juno Therapeutics, third in line with CAR-T therapies in development, soared on news of the deal. CAR-T is the new darling of the drug industry.It's a moment years in the making. Years that Kaitlyn and Justin contributed to. But here is where their stories diverge.For Kaitlyn, the journey to CAR-T started in late 2011. She was just 18 months old when her parents, James and Mandy, noticed she had strange bruises. Then a fever. A bewildering trip to the hospital revealed the worst.""I don't even remember the doctor's name,"" Mandy recalled last week. ""I was like, 'So, does my daughter have cancer?' And she was like 'Has nobody told you yet? Yes, she does.'""Then started the two and a half years of punishing chemotherapy that's the standard of care for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood cancer. For more than 80 percent of kids, that regimen — though grueling to get through — works. Kaitlyn was among the unlucky few for whom it didn't. Just a few months after she finished treatment, the cancer came back. ""I said, so whatever she wants to do this weekend, we're gonna do it,"" Mandy said. ""Because she's not going to be able to go back outside. She's not going to be able to play with her friends.""James said, ""We were going to return back to our old normal.""But another month of chemotherapy failed Kaitlyn too. It was then that her doctor suggested they try something very few people had: CAR-T, still in clinical trials. They were nervous, but, fueled by the hope of success stories before them, they said yes.""We were ready to throw that Hail Mary pass for treatment,"" James said. ""We had no other options."" Just weeks after Kaitlyn received her modified T-cells, James and Mandy got a late-night call from Kaitlyn's doctor. They assumed it was bad news. But it was just the opposite.""She says there's no detectable signs of cancer,"" James said. ""And I think we just cried, you know? … Within six months, our pendulum had swung from, 'We're going to lose our child, potentially,' to: 'We beat cancer.'""Three years later, Kaitlyn is still cancer free. For James and Mandy, seeing Kymriah approved was a joyful moment.It was ""very breathtaking for me,"" Mandy said. ""You know, just thinking, 'Wow, we are a part of this, you know: to help hundreds, thousands of other kids.' And I'm always thinking, 'I almost chose not to do this.'"" Fifteen hundred miles away, in New Egypt, New Jersey, Justin Pritikin was going through the same thing. For him, the journey to CAR-T started when he was 12. The years of chemotherapy — an extra year for boys, said his mother, Jill — gave him 14 months free from cancer and toxic treatment before it failed him, too. Justin enrolled in a clinical trial whose goal was to assess ways to tamp down a common, and potentially severe, side effect of CAR-T. Called cytokine release syndrome, it can result from overactivation of the immune system.It's an ""on-target risk,"" explained Dr. Gwen Nichols, chief medical officer of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, which supports research into CAR-T. ""Any time you activate the immune system, you activate a lot of chemicals in the body that help chew up the targets."" Cytokine release syndrome can lead to high fevers and organ damage, and can be life-threatening at its most serious. But researchers have found ways to control it using anti-inflammatory drugs, such as those used for rheumatoid arthritis.Justin, though, didn't experience those side effects, Jill said.""Just a little elevated temperature,"" she recalled in an interview this week.A month later, a check on Justin's bone marrow revealed the therapeutic T-cells were still active, and there were no B-cells, the target of the treatment.""This whole time he feels amazing, it was like he was back to normal,"" Jill said. ""After years of chemotherapy, it was nice to see.""But his three-month checkup wasn't as positive. The T-cells were nowhere in sight. And B-cells had started to return.It wasn't a relapse; the B-cells weren't leukemic, Jill said. But it appeared the CAR-T treatment had stopped working. The outcomes for Kaitlyn and Justin are part of the mysteries of medicine: why a cutting-edge therapy works for years for one person, and just months for another. Notably, this situation has been worked into Kymriah's pricing.  If the treatment is controlling patients' cancer after a month, its price tag is $475,000. ""The CAR-T therapy is administered to all patients who need it,"" Novartis' Bradner explained. ""If the medicine is working at a fixed period of time, then Novartis is compensated. And if it doesn't, then we feel good at having provided this chance for that patient."" Even so, the price has been a point of discussion in the industry. The cost ""definitively shattered oncology drug pricing norms,"" Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's Dr. Peter Bach, Dr. Sergio Giralt, and Dr. Leonard Saltz wrote in an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association last week.They point out, though, Kymriah's impressive response rate of 80 percent, with 25 percent of patients seeing their cancer recur within six months, and one-year survival of 80 percent.""Alternative treatments do not achieve these types of results,"" they wrote. Still, had Justin not been accessing the drug through a clinical trial, but after it was on the market, his insurance would be on the hook for $475,000, even though the therapy appeared to stop working three months in. ""While this is a welcome innovation in reimbursement, Novartis under this arrangement would still be expected to be paid for 83% of cases (if clinical experience parallels the trial),"" the Memorial Sloan-Kettering doctors wrote. ""Alternative strategies could be used.""Jill Pritikin, though, says she still considers Justin's CAR-T therapy a success. Before he entered the trial, he wasn't well enough to attempt a stem cell transplant, another last-resort option for patients with ALL. The CAR-T helped him get well enough to try.""The T-cells, in our minds, did exactly what we needed them to: got him into strong remission without chemotherapy. And still today he's technically in remission,"" Jill said. ""That's kind of the best way to go into transplant anyway.""Justin was preparing to receive his stem cell transplant on Thursday. It's still early days for understanding CAR-T, said the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's Dr. Nichols.""This is the tip of the iceberg,"" she said. ""This is just the beginning of a whole new era of thinking in the science of how we treat cancer.""Analysts at Cowen Research estimate the market for CAR-T therapies could reach $5 billion to $10 billion annually at its peak — if drug companies and researchers are successful in extending it to additional forms of cancer and more patients who, like Kaitlyn and Justin, run out of options among existing medicines.

Evelyn Cheng,10052017,CNBC,09282017,"Five Dow stocks tend to gain an average 8 to 10 percent in the fourth quarter, outperforming the overall market's gains, history shows. CNBC used Kensho, a quantitative tool used by hedge funds, to find the consistent winners in the Dow Jones industrial average between September 30 and December 31 over the last 25 years. The Dow outperformers are scattered across the health care, home improvement, technology, insurance and entertainment industries. UnitedHealth and Home Depot are the top performers, up nearly 10 percent on average, the Kensho analysis showed. Cisco Systems comes in third with an average gain of 9.76 percent in the fourth quarter. Disney gains an average 8.7 percent, while Travelers rises an average 8.1 percent. UnitedHealth, Home Depot and Disney were positive in the fourth-quarter during 80 percent or more of the last 25 years. These gains are better than the stock market's overall tendency to rise in the fourth quarter. The Dow climbs an average 5 percent, the S&P 500 gains an average of nearly 4.4 percent and the Nasdaq composite climbs more than 5 percent on average from October to December, according to Kensho analysis of the last 25 years. The small-cap Russell 2000 gains an average 5.1 percent in the fourth quarter, the study showed. To be sure, past performance is no predictor of future performance. Stocks' relentless march to all-time highs without a significant increase in economic growth raises some worries that a sharp pullback is due soon. According to CNBC's Market Strategist Survey, the median S&P 500 year-end target forecast on Wall Street is 2,480, about 1.6 percent below the S&P's record close Friday. The most optimistic strategist, Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson, expects the S&P to rise 7.1 percent from Friday's close to 2,700 early next year. But once the index hits that level, Wilson told CNBC that the cyclical bear market — implying a drop of 20 percent — ""could be imminent.""

Brian Withers,10052017,Fool,09282017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Fitness tracker company Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) announced its long-anticipated Ionic smartwatch at the end of August. While Fitbit's stock has seen a positive bump since the announcement, it is still down more than 50% over the past 12 months. FIT data by YCharts The smartwatch has an app gallery, enhanced coaching features, and a huge community of users that could be a catalyst for additional revenue growth. Read on to see how these features could benefit Fitbit investors. Image source: Fitbit In early August, Fitbit CEO James Park said that the  smartwatch would release with an app ""gallery"" with a ""select number"" of partners. Now that the smartwatch has been released, you will find it has popular functions and apps from companies including Pandora, Starbucks, Accuweather, and Strava, which is a social network for athletes. And this is just the start. In that early August call with analysts, Park talked about the Ionic's powerful software developer kit (SDK), which is a set of tools that enables programmers to create smartwatch apps. Park explained that when the company worked with UnitedHealth Group to create the Motion program for its members, it didn't have this SDK capability, and the effort to develop was considerable from both Fitbit and United Health. Having the app gallery and SDK will aid development of more health-focused apps in partnership with insurers or medical device manufacturers -- like the recently announced partnership with Dexcom -- and should drive incremental revenue. Fitbit's mission starts with, ""To empower and inspire you to live a healthier, more active life."" Fitbit reported in May 2017 that it had sold 63 million devices and had more than 50 million registered device users. Management has said that a smartwatch with coaching features could expand its user base by 40 million to 80 million people.  The Ionic is just this device. Fitstar, which is Fitbit's subscription-based fitness app, finally has a device that will make its features easier to use, be more accessible to more people, and have more specific coaching programs to attract users. The culmination of these benefits is rolled into a personalized app called Fitbit Coach and will be released in the fall. The Fitbit Coach personal training app will have introductory pricing of $7.99 per month or $39.99 per year. With Fitbit Coach, users will have workouts displayed on the device, running and walking audio coaching, and app-adjusted workouts based on their feedback. Coming in 2018, Ionic will allow you to access adidas coaching expertise. These coaching features should allow Fitbit to expand its addressable market and drive additional recurring subscription revenue through its premium apps. While the Ionic smartwatch doesn't enhance Fitbit's community features, it should attract new users and grow the overall Fitbit community. Having a large and active community attracts individual users and should also entice corporations hoping to reduce healthcare costs by giving employees Fitbits. Fitbit's corporate wellness programs accounted for less than 10% of overall revenue in 2016, but they could be a growth driver in the future and the Ionic community could be a selling point for corporations hoping to save money on healthcare. When someone buys a Fitbit device, access to the community and its features automatically comes along with it. Fitbit only releases its user community numbers annually, and at the end of 2016, the company had 23.2 million active users. This large user base makes it more likely that a friend or relative may already be on the platform, so the new Fitbit user may be able to engage with someone they know. Park said the community features benefit users by ""building healthy habits, [enabling] friendly competition and curating a supportive and positive environment.""  Fitbit Ionic smartwatch coaching features help Fitbit add incremental recurring revenue and expand its total addressable market. The app gallery and growing user community should boost partnerships with health-related companies. These are the new Ionic smartwatch features that investors should love. ","

Your issue isn’t time management (BUSINESS NEWS) Cult-favorite drink, Topo Chico, was just bought by Coca-Cola which is creating all sorts of mixed emotions. Published on By If you thought that sparkling water was a trend that would die soon, think again. On Monday, Coca-Cola purchased mineral water brand Topo Chico for $220 million dollars. Topo Chico currently is distributed in 35 states, with almost 70 percent of its total sales in the state of Texas alone. This acquisition marked a big investment into a trend that has soda consumption at its lowest point since 1985. Coca-Cola already has two sparkling water brands: Dasani Sparkling and Smartwater sparkling. This purchase is its latest acquisition that many think can compete with big rivals like Nestle’s Perrier and Sundance Beverage Company’s LaCroix. Topo Chico, the prized mineral water brand of Mexico and the Austin craft cocktail scene, has had a long relationship with Coca-Cola. The plant that still bottles and manufactures Topo Chico since its creation bottled the first ever bottle of Coca-Cola in 1920s. Coca-Cola says they have no plans to change the location of its manufacturing in Monterrey, Mexico, nor the brand’s existing image. “It’s important for us to maintain the relevance with the core Topo Chico fanbase while introducing the brand to new people,” VP of Emerging Brands Matt Hughes said. “We’ll continue to protect the prestige of the brand, which is authentic to its heritage and hip without being pretentious.” After the announcement of the acquisition, brand die hards took to Twitter to offer their two cents about the acquisition of Topo Chico by Coca-Cola. The most positive comments were about the opportunity to have Topo Chico distributed across the country so that those not located in its sales area could drink the sparkling beverage. Of course, the cult-like fan base that Topo Chico has was generally disturbed by the fact that their beverage of choice could be “corrupted” with high fructose corn syrup or the recipe changed. Plus, there’s a good old fashioned dose of twitter snarkiness at announcement of the news as well. I’m fair to partly excited about Coca Cola adding Topo Chico to the family.

Published on By Personality tests are some of the most popular posts on social media. At least once every day, I see “What Sauce Are You?” or “What Disney Princess Are You?” on my Facebook feed. Millions of people take the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test each year, a more professional personality test. When you take the MBTI, you’re presented with a personality type, based on four characteristics, extrovert-introvert (E/I); sensing -intuition (S/N); thinking-feeling (T-F); and judging – perceiving (J/P). Many organizations use the MBTI in the workplace to group people into teams or to select candidates for employment. After all, wouldn’t you want an extrovert over an introvert for a sales position? But using the MBTI to make serious business decisions may not be a good idea. Here’s why. It’s unethical to use the MBTI in certain cases. According to the creators of the MBTI, “It is unethical and in many cases illegal to require job applicants to take the Indicator if the results will be used to screen out applicants. The administrator should not counsel a person to, or away from, a particular career, personal relationship or activity based solely upon type information.” Personality type does not imply competence or preference. The creators of MBTI also state this in their ethical position on the personality test. I am an introvert. I will always be an introvert. But I just found out that some of my colleagues believe I am an extrovert. I can adapt to a social or business situation to get the job done. If a job used the MBTI to place me on a team, they may see that I don’t always behave like an introvert. Similarly, a job may overlook me for a position based on my MBTI type. Either way, it’s kind of unfair. How can you use the MBTI? The MBTI can be beneficial to help people understand their own tendencies. I remember one thing from the test, a question about whether you base your decisions on how they impact others. Years ago, I would have answered that totally in the positive. I always considered others in making my decisions, whether I should or shouldn’t have.  Today, I would answer that question much differently. My understanding of boundaries is much better. Your MBTI type can be a great communication starter, especially in teams. But it shouldn’t typecast you into a particular position on the team. Employers should not be using the MBTI to pigeonhole their employees.  (BUSINESS NEWS) Remote working is increasingly more common here are some tips on how to ask your boss for flexibility. Published on By To some people, “working remotely” sounds like a code word for sitting around in your PJs watching Netflix all day. But many professionals, managers and otherwise, recognize the value of the flexibility and independence that comes with working from home occasionally. Depending on your role, your commute, and your personal life, benefits of working from home could include:
Reallocating commute time into productivity. 45 minutes each way means an hour and a half of wasted time – and you’re probably already tired by the time you get to work.
Uninterrupted periods of focused work. Coworkers are a wonderful resource for collaboration, and even friendship, but even the most awesome people can be annoying when you really, really, really need to focus.
Energizing quiet time. Introverts often underestimate how much they mentally need this, and everyone can use a reset once in a while.
More time to spend with kids/spouse/friends. Again, you can save time on your commute, and often you can rearrange your schedule to work a few hours after the kids have gone to bed/the movie is over/etc. If you’ve already made that list of benefits in your head a thousand times while knocking your head against your office desk, a work arrangement that includes remote work days is definitely something you should try, if your organization and your manager will agree to it. But for many potential remote workers, getting the boss onboard seems like an unsurmountable barrier, and they may have even made the request in the past but been denied. This article is designed to help all those interested in remote work successfully navigate that daunting process. Before we get into the details of potential concerns your boss may have, you should establish a clear reason (or reasons) why you’d like to transition to a schedule that includes working from home. If you can’t articulate this fundamental point, your boss will be much more likely to suspect that your motives are less than pure. Both personal and professional reasons are totally valid, but being totally open is the only way to set yourself up for success. With these motivations in mind, develop a proposal for your boss that focuses on how working from home will benefit your organization, not you. Your boss knows that you’re asking for this flexibility for yourself, but a happier and more productive you is way better for the company than a miserable, exhausted you. Your proposal should include a schedule or plan, and you should probably start slow with the work from home days. If your goal is to work from home two days a week, suggest spending one day at home every two weeks for a set period, like two or three months, so that your boss will have a built in trial period to agree to. A couple of pro tips: aside from ensuring that you’re in the office on important regular meeting days, you should avoid Friday as your work from home day to be sure it doesn’t look like you’re after three day weekends. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are ideal, because they’re in the middle of the week, and you may often have a lot of tasks and projects coming to a head on these days that you’ll need to focus on for completion. You also need to go out of your way to make sure your boss understands that your flexible schedule would work both ways; that is, even if you’re scheduled to work from home this Wednesday, you’ll come into the office for an important meeting or check in. Go the extra mile without being asked and your boss will have no reason to worry about flexibility. Finally, the best way to prove the value of remote work is to actually work better remotely. That means you’re in regular contact with your team and your boss, whether you’re asking questions or just sending status updates on your projects a couple of times a day. Over-communicating is important here. It also means accomplishing a little more than you might at the office, or digging a little deeper. If you finish something early, ask coworkers over chat or phone if they could use your help for an hour. Make yourself available, just as you would in the office, and no one will be left wondering what you do all day. A dedicated workspace in your home can do wonders for your productivity – it’s hard for anyone to do hard, concentrated work on their sofa with a lap desk. As the end of the established trial period approaches, it would be prudent to present your boss with a summary of your remote accomplishments over the past few months. If you’re sending regular updates, this should be easy to determine. And no matter how sure you are that you’ll love working remotely, you should be mindful of any loneliness or feelings of isolation, and address them by staying in contact with coworker friends over chat, or scheduling lunches with them once in awhile, especially if you work from home the majority of the time. If, after careful preparation and thoughtful presentation, your boss still isn’t having it, don’t be afraid to ask again in a few months. And in the meantime, you could bolster your case by taking a day or two of unscheduled time off and just working from home unasked. If you can show your boss what the company gets out of it, they’ll be hard pressed to say no.  Published on By A new trend is emerging as more fast-food restaurants are turning toward senior citizens to join their workforce rather than teens, per Bloomberg. Walmart has been hiring older workers for years and taking a lot of scrutiny over it, but according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the labor force is changing. In the last 30 years of the 20th century, the number of workers aged 55 and older was the smallest segment of the workforce. Around 2003, this group was no longer the smallest share. Baby Boomers and Gen Xers are now living longer and working longer. The BLS estimates that the number of older Americans who will keep working after the age of 65 will grow by 4.5 percent through 2024. On the other hand, the number of teenagers expected to enter the workforce is expected to drop by 1.4 percent. Many workers in their prime are decreasing, due to the opioid epidemic, unaffordable childcare, and the incarceration rate, which some experts say is beginning to creating a labor shortage. In addition, seniors often have soft skills that teenagers just don’t have. After years in any industry, older Americans know how to be on time, deal with customers and navigate the ins and outs of working. Managers have to teach these skills to teenagers entering the job market. For seniors seeking work in fast food, they aren’t typically interested in moving up the corporate ladder. Financially, it can make sense for a business to hire an older worker over a teenager. A business gets the experience of age without having to pay any more for it. Would your business benefit? We recently reported on the litigation regarding the word “overqualified” being a code word for “too old to hire.” There’s also a concern that older Americans will carry a higher cost or not stay in a position for a long time, but it’s time to kick those stereotypes out. The labor force is changing and fast food chains are leading the charge. Will businesses keep up? Or will employers disregard candidates who will bring much more to the job than just being a body who shows up?

Asit Sharma,10052017,Fool,09282017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Tiffany & Company (NYSE:TIF) has a 180 year history as a luxury brand, and the stock has jumped 30% in the last year. They also look at the latest acquisitions from leading consumer brands this week, including Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) $220 million purchase of Topo Chico and Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) acquisition of a New York City start-up. A full transcript follows the video. Asit Sharma: Hey, Vince! Thanks as always for having me back! Shen: Sure. Fools, we're going to turn our attention to the high-end luxury corner of the consumer retail world for this episode. If we watch the clock and we have enough time, we'll also offer some quick updates on the back half of this show as well. The company states outright in its 10-K that the brand is its single most important asset, and it'll invest heavily to maintain it brand perception. That means premium customer service, paying for spots for its stores in high-end malls and luxury areas, selling lots of expensive diamonds and precious stones. Jewelry makes up 90% of the company's business, specifically products with diamonds make up almost 60% of annual revenue. Asit, the stock is up about 30% in the last year, handily outperforming the broad market. Can you tell us about some of the latest developments at the company? Sharma: Sure. The most important development begins with the top line. Sales have dropped about 6% over the last two years. In 2015, Tiffany & Company booked $4.25 billion in sales, and that's dropped over the last two years to about $4 billion in 2016. So as a result, Tiffany replaced its CEO Frederic Cumenal, who was only there for 22 months, with Alessandro Bogliolo in July. Shen: Good timing there. Sharma: Tiffany & Company, the next CEO you hire, can you please give us a name that's easier to pronounce? But having said that, Bogliolo is the former CEO of Italian jeans and fashion house Diesel Clothing Company, and he also had a long stint in Bulgari & Company, which, for those of you who love high-end fashion and maybe live in a big city, New York, Chicago, you've certainly seen these beautiful stores and their beautiful products, a worthy competitor to Tiffany & Company. So Bogliolo's mission is to expand Tiffany's cachet, as Vinyce mentioned, to a younger demographic, to millennials, to revitalize the brand without impacting that strong resonance it has as an aspirational brand, and a brand that, at the end of the day, stands the test of time. So those are the most recent developments for Tiffany & Company. Shen: I would say, the timing there, by the way, you mentioned, of the CEO was perfect, because his official start date happened to be yesterday. As we watch the progress the company makes, it's really starting day one right now. Some big opportunities that you see management mention and see them play out in the numbers a bit, there's this new leadership change, they talk about new product categories that are intended to appeal to some of those younger consumers that you mentioned, they talk about the growth of their online sales, which are still a small portion of the company's business at this point, I believe 6% as of the end of their physical 2016. Then, they also have their international footprint to lean on. You'll see that going back to some of the quarterly reports, you'll notice a trend in that the Asian markets, which the company breaks down into Japan and Asia Pacific. And for that Asia Pacific region, China makes up over half of that, those regions have tended to deliver strong results, either flat or positive growth compared to some of the declines in the company's biggest market, the Americas and the U.S. specifically, which makes up almost half of all revenue. I feel like a company like this will face some cyclical challenges in that economic downturns will often hurt luxury sales. The company struggled a bit during the financial crisis. But another long-term headwind that I want to focus on is something you mentioned, and it's kind of topic on people's minds right now, and that seems to be decreasing interest in diamonds, especially among younger consumers. With some of the controversies surrounding sourcing for precious stones, for example, with conflict diamonds, and in general, we've talked in other industries, whether it's with restaurants, consumer packaged goods, snacks, beverages, whatever it may be, people are worried about environmental concerns, sourcing, sustainability. And that seems to be flowing into this business as well. What is the company really facing here? Sharma: The company is facing a similar problem that we've seen in many industries that we talk about here where consumer goods stands. We'll talk about Coca-Cola a little bit later in this show, but that's a great analog. Coca-Cola has been impacted by changing consumer tastes, the fact that if you have small children and you've grown up in this society and have a more sustainable bent about you and are more health conscious, you're not necessarily going to give your kids as much of that beverage, Coca-Cola, as you drank when you were small. The same with Tiffany -- we have these mini cycles ... larger ways where consumers' perceptions of the brand and what's behind the brand evolve. And for Tiffany, it has to be careful about the sourcing of its diamonds, and it has to show the consumer that they can enjoy the products, that is the aesthetic quality of the product, the brand cachet, but also feel good about the provenance of that. Where did the diamond come from? Is it responsibly sourced? Is it a blood diamond? So that's a drag that Tiffany is going to have to meet and continue to have a brand perception that customers can feel good about. I think they can beat that challenge. What's interesting to me is, it's going all the way to the other extreme to deal with a little bit less high-margin revenue from the retail diamonds in that it's in the wholesale diamond business. This is something that I really wasn't as much aware of until I was doing prep for this segment. The company has a fast-growing business, particularly in Asia, in the wholesale diamond trade. Now, that's got a much smaller margin than the luxury jewelry, the pendant necklace that you buy at their flagship stores. However, in these last two quarters, the company has booked $61 million of revenue from wholesale diamond trade. Now, that's only 3% of Tiffany & Company's total revenue over the last two quarters, of that $1.8 billion I mentioned. But it's growing at a 50% clip year over year. So you can see how, within a few quarters, if it can maintain that focus, this low margin part of the diamond trade will be a bigger portion of the company's bottom line, a little bit of a drag on earnings but it's a smart way, just as Coca-Cola has moved away from only selling those sugary sodas, and as we'll talk about a little bit later, and is moving into some other types of products that customers can feel better about. Shen: Why don't we just jump right into that, Asit? I think this is going to be a focus for the new CEO as he heads up the operations for the company. Can you tell us a little bit about what the company is expanding into, but also trying to help, in terms of appealing to the young consumers that it wants to bring on board? Sharma: Sure. It's two big picture avenues that Tiffany & Company is taking. One, like other companies of its ilk in many industries, it's firming up its approach to e-commerce. And this is one industry which, you can see Amazon.com is not as much of a threat as it is with so many companies we talk about on this show. It almost seems that, whatever segment we have, Vince, Amazon looms large. Shen: Yeah, absolutely. Sharma: Tiffany & Company has a really nice e-commerce portal that tries to recreate the experience of being in the stores. It's difficult, let's be honest, to match the experience. If you've had the opportunity to walk into one of their larger stores, it's impossible to actually recreate that. But you can recreate some of the ambience, some of the desire around the product. And what I love about this is, Tiffany & Company has done a smart job of breaking its products into different pricing. Very quickly, when you visit the homepage after a click or two, it just flat-out gives you the choice -- here are products under $250, then it gradates up to $1,000, $2,500, and beyond, sort of like when you sort on Amazon, which, I'm somewhat cheap on some things, so I will often sort by price. You don't feel like you've lost luxury of experience, but you can quickly go to the price point that interests you, and I think that's a really good approach on their part and will increase the flow of millennial traffic. Millennials as a whole, I don't think they're cheap like me, I'm a bit older, but I think they're thrifty. They know what they want, and they know how much they're willing to pay for certain products, especially luxury items of the type that Tiffany sells. So that flow going through their portal to completing that, converting that customer, is pretty well done. The other thing that the company is also pragmatically undertaking is its product line. They're moving more into products like watches. This year, they will improve and expand their women's line of watches, which is a huge market. The current CEO has experience with that. For those of you who are into the fashion house of Diesel, you know that they have very attractive watch offerings. So not simply price points, but looking at what millennials buy, what's important to them. They may not be in the market for a beautiful diamond or heart-shaped brooch like your grandmother was, but they could use a watch because they're tired of staring into their phone for hours a day. Shen: Sure. I think that's a piece of the strategy the company will have going forward. At the same time, I'm a little bit skeptical, when we were doing research for this, I found a lot of headlines talking about how high-end jewelry, diamonds are on this strong downward trend in terms of popularity, like we mentioned, with millennials and younger consumers in general. But I feel like, with a company like Tiffany, with a very aspirational brand, they talk about how they will invest in their inventory to have lots of very pricey and extravagant diamonds and precious gemstones, because they want customers to go into the store and feel like there are things that they cannot afford. It's aspirational. And I feel like that's something for young consumers that they will grow into over time as their tastes change and mature, as they grow older. I think the long-term picture for this company, there are always going to be people who appreciate what Tiffany represents in terms of the luxury world. So it will always have that moat. Any final thoughts from you, Asit, in terms of this challenge the company faces, and thoughts on what the outlook might be? Sharma: I think the company will be able to meet the challenges we talked about earlier. And also, these declining trends of interest in diamonds. That's somewhat geographically based. In the United States, we have a very advanced society on the curve of industrial development. But again, in China, if you look at India, which has a burgeoning middle class, and they love to buy gold objects, diamonds are the next step up. There is a market out there. It depends on where their focus is, and the company avidly seeks locations in Southeast Asia to expand. So they know where their future customers, who will still be interested in diamonds, exist. And I think that's simply numbers for them, that's one way they'll be able to counteract the trends that we see in places like Europe and the United States, where that interest is somewhat declining. Shen: Perfect. Thank you, Asit. For our next update here, we have two stories. The first is with Coca-Cola. They opened the week with the news that the company would be acquiring Topo Chico for over $200 million. I've never had a chance to try its products myself, but Topo Chico is an imported sparkling water brand from Mexico that's very popular in selected regions of the country, especially Texas, which makes up about 70% of Topo Chico's sales. The brand has a long history dating back over 100 years to 1895, and it seems to be a big part of its allure and popularity with consumers. Asit, this deal is made as part of Coca-Cola's Venturing & Emerging Brands unit. We've talked about this unit before, it's a really interesting part of the company. Can you tell us about this unit within the Coca-Cola umbrella? Sharma: Sure. VEB, Venturing & Emerging Brands group, functions as a venture capital arm within Coca-Cola. Their mission is to go out into very far reaches of the soft drink or beverage world and find companies that are developing brand which Coca-Cola can buy. Now, for Coca-Cola to buy a brand, it really has to have $10 to $20 million in sales. Then, it can scale those sales up to $200 million and beyond. But VEB doesn't necessarily have to find companies that are selling that much from the outset. They really take an ear-to-the-ground approach and try to meet with small companies when they're just forming up in start-up phase, and keep in touch with them, as many venture capitalists do with technology companies, in the hopes that they find a brand or label just starting to gain traction, and they have the advantage of the first-mover, they have a relationship with the entrepreneurs and can write a big check, acquire the rights, and then scale. I think this group has been effective. Some of you drink Honest Tea, that was a transaction that the VEB Group consummated. And this week's transaction, also consummated by the VEB Group, they did it with the Mexican bottler ARCA Continental for $220 million. And this is interesting for those who are wondering how Coke will parlay the strategy of small, tuck-in acquisitions. Previously, Coca-Cola was buying up some small labels and manufacturing product. But the company has sold its bottling operations over the past year to bottling partners in North America and throughout the world. And by next year, Coca-Cola is going to exist more as a marketing company than an actual manufacturer. And this is one of the first transactions we see how great that business model is, because Coca-Cola actually acquired the rights to Topo Chico rather than buying all of the manufacturing and trying to go bottle this product itself. Shen: Yeah. I want to mention a few other aspects of how the Venturing & Emerging Brands unit approaches its investments, and kind of apply that to this latest purchase that they've made for about $220 million. So the unit was established in 2007, and they're looking for these potential billion-dollar brands. But the thing is, they're focused on products that are outside of Coca-Cola's traditional carbonated soda and sugary beverages, because the business unit claims to think five to 10 years ahead about where the beverage industry is going, and the signs of the leaves seem to point away from some of those traditional Coca-Cola sodas. And you mentioned Honest Tea, for example, this was a pretty early success for the company. They made an initial investment of over $40 million in 2008 when the company had less than 100 employees and just $30 million in revenue. Almost a decade later, Coca-Cola has totally taken over the Honest Tea brand, and the latest number from 2015 puts Honest Tea sales at almost $180 million. So the formula here is, they have Phase I, they identify the opportunities. Phase II, they take a venture capital role and make that initial investment. And that seems to be where we are here with Topo Chico. The next phase, then, is when they start taking a greater role and usually a bigger investment as the brand grows its reach. This seems to be a pretty standard formula for the company, in terms of what options they have for Topo Chico. It has 70% of its sales in Texas, it has really strong market share there, and management has actually spoken to this idea about recreating this success and building more ""Texases"", basically growing Coca-Cola's share of the still-growing sparkling water industry, which at this point is still dominated by private label store brands that you might see at the grocery store, for example. Estimates I found pinned Topo Chico revenue at less than $70 million for 2016. So we know this is not exactly moving the needle for a company this size. Coca-Cola, keep in mind, despite the fact that their revenue is going down because of this restructuring they've done, you mentioned in terms of the bottling operations, they still had almost $40 billion in sales in the last 12 months. I think, basically, you have to think about what the company is going to be able to leverage, and I think Coca-Cola is legendary in terms of its ability to leverage its marketing machine, and allow Topo Chico to ride that and scale. Even though it's only available in 35 states and regions of Northern Mexico already, the brand is not that familiar outside of Texas. And I'm sure Coca-Cola will be working a lot to remedy that. But if you are a Coca-Cola shareholder or you're considering a position in the company and you're trying to adopt a Foolish long-term perspective, I guess the question becomes, do these satellite brands and venture capital-like investments have the ability to eventually offset some of the major declines that are expected with traditional soda consumption? What do you think, Asit? Sharma: In this case, it certainly does. Very interestingly, as you mentioned, revenues for Topo Chico are 70% in Texas. You can visualize a small band on the map of the U.S. border, this drink is actually manufactured in Northern Mexico, and it's sold in Northern Mexico. South of Northern Mexico and north of Texas, there's tremendous potential. Some of our listeners may know, Mexico is the second largest market for Coca-Cola outside of the United States, and Coca-Cola has been hit hard by Mexican government tariffs on sugary soft drinks. So this is an excellent way for Coca-Cola not just to take an exciting brand and scale it but to make up for lost revenue. It's exactly what you want to see as a long-term shareholder. What's the strategy to replace the declining revenue? And that is such an opportunity that falls into Coke's hands. I don't how many of our listeners, maybe you can tweet to us if you've tried it, those of you who are down deep in the South -- I've tried it. I've got my hands on some several months ago from my local Latin American store. It's an interesting drink. It has a very colorful label. Effervescence is a little bit higher than sparkling waters you might buy here, at least to me. It's got a little bit of a salt taste to it. So it's something that offers a different segment opportunity for Coca-Cola, a new brand that they can push out there, and it's beloved by hipsters in Texas. So, there's that cachet that we talked about with Tiffany. They may have some hipster cachet that they can expand on. I think it absolutely does fulfill that problem that you mentioned, Vince. We'll watch this one to see how far they can scale it in the next few years, for sure. Shen: I think it's interesting, that popularity that it has in Texas, has a lot to do, I think, with the heritage of the brand itself, again, dating back over 100 years. The company, in the release, there's a Q&A with some executives from the Venturing & Emerging Brands unit talking about how important it is for them to maintain that heritage and tradition for this brand, despite the fact that they're going to be putting it into the machine and expanding its presence across the country. We'll be watching to see what kind of success they have, whether this can be a next Honest Tea for them. But ultimately, this unit within Coca-Cola has invested in over something like 40 different brands at this point. Not every single one is going to be a major success, but if we know anything about this company, they certainly have the resources and the experience in beverages to experiment and test and find these small labels and help turn them into enormous successes. For our last story, it's yet another recent development from Wal-Mart. I know we've been hitting a lot of Wal-Mart coverage on the show lately, so I'll tentatively promise that this will be the last bit for the king of retail for at least a few weeks, if not a few months. But I won't deny that it's been pretty fascinating to follow along with the various experiments and new initiatives that Marc Lore has rolled out as the head of the company's e-commerce efforts. That's not to mention what Wal-Mart has done with the Jet.com business itself. The company actually announced this morning that it would be acquiring a small start-up called Parcel. What's the story here, Asit? Sharma: Parcel is, like you say, a small company that focuses on last mile and same day delivery in New York City. The transaction size was not disclosed, but it is said to be about $10 million. So you can imagine, this is a very tiny company. What would Wal-Mart want to do with a company that it can purchase for $10 million that's located in New York City of all places, a very dense city? The answer is that last-mile services are the hardest part of the logistics supply chain, the most expensive part pound-for-pound. Amazon.com, a fierce competitor to Wal-Mart, has partnered up with the United States Postal Service to solve last mile problems. But what's so interesting is, in New York City, there's a lot of opportunity for Jet.com to basically be a test kitchen for different ventures. And Parcel helps Jet.com, which Wal-Mart acquired, listeners will remember, for $3 billion. Parcel helps Jet.com test delivery services within dense populations like New York City. So we should talk about Uniquely J, which is Jet.com's answer to the Whole Foods-Amazon.com partnership. Uniquely J is a service developed by Jet.com to offer high-end food products and also products such as cleaning supplies, bath tissues, to customers for delivery, probably within that same two-hour window that Amazon.com promises. Parcel lets Jet.com make that last mile delivery, and it gives this experimental template for Wal-Mart to go into big cities where it doesn't necessarily want to put a Supercenter -- places like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago -- and have a supplemental business model while also trying to kick Amazon.com in the shins. Shen: I think this is where everything comes together. We have this small start-up logistics company to help organize same-day deliveries for New York City. It has some of the infrastructure, the staff, and experience in the city to ramp up the potential same-day shipping efforts for Jet.com and Wal-Mart.com in that market. At the same time, I believe that Parcel is already handling some of the deliveries, for example, for Bonobos, which also happened to be acquired by Wal-Mart earlier this year. And that becomes part of this overall plan where everything is starting to come together a little bit for the company's e-commerce efforts. They talk about the Bonobos and Modcloth acquisitions, these are men's and women's apparel companies. Now, Wal-Mart has recently announced that they intend to make both those brands available on Jet.com. So Jet.com previously having more of a discount reputation, they're starting to offer those two brands on there, raising the cachet, again, another time that we're using that, the brand premium that's associated with the site. And with Uniquely J, they've also mentioned that this private label Jet.com brand that's going to roll out with consumer staples in the next couple of months, they want it to target some of these urban-based millennials. So they'll get a similar theme here, because these Uniquely J products are supposed to be higher-end to appeal to that target market. Again, as you mentioned, this really follows closely on the heels of Amazon, which has made its 365 by Whole Foods products available online, and the initial reports for that said it was met with great success, a lot of items selling out very quickly. So we've spoken previously about the solid growth Wal-Mart is enjoying in its digital business. I ultimately believe this is still a marathon. These are all small moves on the chessboard for the company. Ultimately, Wal-Mart wants to widen its appeal with the help of Jet.com, and its reputation as a younger, cooler brand while establishing the necessary infrastructure and logistics it will need to provide greater convenience to customers in these various urban markets, obviously starting first with this one Parcel deal right in New York City. Any other takeaways for you, Asit, in terms of what this spells for the future, in terms of this arms race between the big retailers? Sharma: Sure, one last point. And by the way, what a great example, because these are two grand masters that are playing a very long game of chess. I was really intrigued by this acquisition, because Wal-Mart is taking such a different approach than Amazon. Everyone knows Amazon builds fulfillment centers every year all across the U.S. from the ground up, supplies them with amazing automation and technology. Wal-Mart is picking up on something that I was actually reading about in Supply Chain Newsletter several months ago, that there's a ton of warehouse space in cities like New York, in Brooklyn, where I believe Parcel is based, in Chicago, in almost any big city you can think of. You've seen how urban drift has created this. It's space that's unleased, perfectly usable, and very capital-lite for a company like Wal-Mart. So it's developing a model where it can have its own quasi-fulfillment centers which are just in big cities to deliver that last mile much more cheaply than if it tried to compete with Amazon and think of itself as a company that's going to build a bunch of its own fulfillment centers. Of course, Wal-Mart thinks that its super stores themselves are quasi-fulfillment centers, and they have a point, because they're so large. But I'm intrigued from the real estate aspect of this. Again, if this is a chess move, to me, this is equal to a threat on the chessboard. It's like calling check, and the other opponent over time is going to have to make sure that his king is well-protected. So we'll follow that as well. Shen: Thank you very much, Asit, for joining me on the show today. Thank you, Fools, for listening. If you have any thoughts on Topo Chico, if you've tried it, we'd love to hear from you.

    What Does the Future Hold for Tiffany & Co.? -- The Motley Fool

  "
Sean Williams,10052017,Fool,09282017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's tough to say whether there's one piece of legislation on Donald Trump's ""to-do list"" that takes precedence over all others, but tax reform could be the centerpiece legislation that defines his presidency. During his campaign, Trump pounded the table on individual and corporate tax reforms. On the individual side, he suggested that he'd like to see the number of income-tax brackets narrowed from seven to three and said individual income taxes should be simplified by slashing the number of credits and deductions. In lieu of fewer credits and deductions, Trump proposed doubling, or more than doubling, the standard deduction. Image source: U.S. Department of Homeland Security via Flickr. But the foundation of Trump's tax reform plan has always involved a major cut to corporate income-tax rates from their current peak levels of 35% -- one of the highest in the world -- to 15%. This 15% rate is what the president referred to as ""ideal,"" but it was considered a major stretch by lawmakers. In fact, the initial details of Trump's tax plan released this past week suggest lawmakers may aim for a 20% corporate tax rate. The reason corporate income-tax cuts are so crucial is that corporations play a critical role in boosting long-term economic growth. The hypothesis is that cutting corporate income-tax rates will allow businesses to reinvest in new technology, hire new employees, and pay higher wages. A more business-friendly tax system could also encourage domestic companies not to move production overseas, and it might even spur more foreign investment in the United States. Hypothetically speaking, in order for Trump to balance out a corporate income-tax cut to 15%, he'd need to find a way to come up with $2 trillion over the next 10 years. That's the amount such a tax cut would reduce federal revenue over the following 10 years, according to the Tax Foundation. The reason Republicans need to make up this lost revenue is because they probably have no chance of passing tax reforms with a 60% majority in the Senate. Thus budget reconciliation, which only requires a majority vote, is the likeliest way to pass a tax-reform bill. Under reconciliation, the bill will have to be revenue-neutral. In short, the GOP would need to find a way to come up with, or save, $2 trillion over the next 10 years. Image source: Getty Images. If we break things down into their most basic components, the Trump administration could do two things: make serious cuts in order to reduce spending or raise additional revenue via higher tax rates in certain situations. Chances are we'd see a combination of the two. What might be cut? To begin with, Trump's budget proposal showed a marked decline in funding for a number of federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department, to name a few. But budget cuts to these agencies are peanuts when we're talking about an estimated $2 trillion revenue reduction. Further, healthcare reform is off the table for this year. Republicans and Trump had been counting on some $100 billion to $300 billion in 10-year savings from the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, but they're not going to get it -- at least not this year. The entities that would likely pay the most to achieve that 15% corporate tax rate are the corporations themselves and homeowners. First, the Trump administration could remove the subsidy corporations receive in the form of interest being treated as a deductible expense. According to the Tax Policy Center, eliminating the deductibility of interest on corporate debt could save the federal government about $700 billion over the next 10 years. That would pay for roughly 35% of the corporate tax cut right there, and it may even receive bipartisan support. Image source: Getty Images. In addition to cutting expenditures, the Trump administration could look to boost tax rates in certain situations in order to increase revenue for the federal government over the next decade. Working Americans and investors could be among those who are in line for tax hikes. According to a report from Politico, some lawmakers in Washington have considered an adjustment to how employer-sponsored 401(k)s are taxed. 401(ks) are tax-deferred retirement plans that are funded by pre-tax dollars, meaning workers only pay tax when they begin making withdrawals during retirement. It also means contributions can reduce current-year liability for some workers. Around 55 million workers had more than $5 trillion invested in 401(k)s as of March 2017. The rumor had been that the GOP was considering taxing 401(k) contributions up front instead of when workers begin taking withdrawals during retirement. Doing so would generate extra cash for the federal government now and potentially leave them shorthanded many years down the road. According to the details of this past week's tax plan, the tax treatment of 401(k)s wouldn't change, but the idea may still be on the table. Image source: Getty Images. The other possibility is that Republicans could consider lifting the tax rates on capital gains and dividend income, which might also find bipartisan support. Currently, long-term capital gains tax rates for the wealthiest Americans (20%) are nearly half of their peak ordinary income tax rate (39.6%). You see, the wealthy are the most likely to benefit by owning stocks and receiving dividend income, so increasing the taxes on capital gains or dividend income -- perhaps to the ordinary income-tax rate -- would be more likely to require the wealthy to pay more than lower- or middle-income Americans. It's worth remembering that this is merely a hypothetical look at what could happen with tax reform if the ""ideal"" corporate tax rate were targeted, and we're likely to see changes to Trump's outlined tax plan in the weeks and months to come. Therefore it's important to keep your eyes open and ears to the ground to understand best how tax reforms could impact you. ","
      
    Here's Where Trump Could Get the $2 Trillion Needed to Cut Corporate Tax Rates to 15% -- The Motley Fool

Motley Fool Staff,10052017,Fool,09282017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A full transcript follows the video. Lee Burbage: Oh, yes? Kara Chambers: I feel so honored. Thank you. Gardner: ... a third time. Burbage: My jacket fits perfectly. Thank you for that. Gardner: I think it's nice, Kara, that you said, ""honored."" I'm not sure it's even an honorable thing, but I appreciate that you would think that it is. I like to think in my better days that it is and thank you both for being with me this week. We're here to talk about culture and what it's like to work in the place that you work. And at The Motley Fool, when we started 24 years ago, what we had right, and the good news is, we were trying from the get-go to create a place that people would want to come to work each day. And why was that? Well, it's because there were two brothers and a friend of theirs. And they started the company. And when it came time to hire really their first non-founder employee, we didn't have a budget to go search. There was no LinkedIn. Actually, even the World Wide Web wasn't around quite yet. So who did we hire, right? We hired our fun friend from college. Or high school. We hired people we knew. And if you're going to hire people that you know at the start of your business, you're probably going to want to make it kind of a fun place to work. You're not probably going to count hours on them, or start counting vacation days. Some of the things that were very countercultural back then still are, as you both know, better than I do. Still countercultural today. It just came to us naturally because of the circumstance by which we started. So that's what we had right. What we didn't have right -- not that it was wrong -- but we didn't yet have the sense that culture was a thing. That that would be how these days people think about their workplace. There wouldn't be workshops, or keynote speeches about culture. There wouldn't be culture Fools. There weren't back then, but there are now, and I'm joined by them today, Kara Chambers and Lee Burbage, respectively. Kara, how long have you been at the Fool? Chambers: Almost 12 years. Gardner: Awesome. Lee? Burbage: Almost 19 years. Gardner: So that's 31, which is more than I've been at the Fool, and both of you are leaders and have helped steer The Motley Fool's culture to become one of the more acclaimed workplaces in America. A little bit of bragging -- I'm not reading from any brag sheet here -- but a couple of times in the last five years Glassdoor.com, the site that has employees rate their workplaces, has had The Motley Fool as the No. 1 place to work for small to medium-size companies in America, so there's a lot of competition. I'm imagining there's at least 10,000 other players out there. Chambers: We're going to talk about well-being. Overall well-being. We have a very highly engaged wellness program at the Fool, but that's part of a larger team. We call ourselves ""the thriving Fools."" We focus on the overall well-being of the individual and just thinking about growth and happiness at work. It's just -- many facets to well-being at work, so we're going to talk a little bit today about the different things we do. Gardner: Awesome! I was trying to establish a little bit of that humbly, because I'm trying to strike the right balance here. We put these ideas forward with humility, but I also want to say that we do put it forward with some authority as well. The Motley Fool, in the Washington, D.C. area, recently got an acclaim, Lee. Gardner: Did we receive an accolade as No. 1 for a certain thing in the last six weeks? Burbage: Yes, we did, David. The healthiest place to work. The most fun. What were the exact words, Kara? Chambers: I think we're the ""most athletic."" Burbage: The most athletic place to work in the D.C. area. Gardner: And I think it was funny, Lee, that you didn't even exactly remember that. Burbage: We win a lot of awards. Gardner: There are those of us who aren't that athletic, like, for example, me. I take great pride. Like I put up the strong-arm emoji on Twitter and say, ""We are the most athletic place to work in Washington, D.C. In the nation's capital."" Burbage: That's correct. Gardner: So whether or not Lee actually knew that, Kara, I'm glad that you did, and you and I similarly, unathletically, take great pride in that. So that's one form of well-being, but I know we're going to talk about others. Without further ado, let's get started. You both have brought some points, as you have in previous appearances. I think you have eight today, so we're going to bounce it back and forth. Who's up first? Chambers: I am. We're going to start with what we call our Bookie Monster program. We went through a very rigorous naming process for that program and just named it Bookie Monster. It's any business book you can request. We have a huge library here at the Fool just sitting there. That just opens up people to explore different topics. We'll talk about this more, but she focuses a lot on when your mind is in ""discover mode,"" when you're feeling good and you're happy, you're going to outperform. And the opposite, when you're stressed, when you're tired, when you're physically or emotionally drained, that's called ""defensive mode,"" and you're less able to learn, less able to solve complex problems. That book really helped to focus, at least me and my team, on this type of work. Gardner: So, Kara, the theme again is overall well-being. So while we did lead with the strong-arm emoji and the word ""athletic,"" you went right to books and reading and the life of the mind. The overall well-being of the Fool. How does the program work? Do people get books for free here? Chambers: They do. They just send an email to Bookie Monster and Bookie Monster will reply back and say, ""I have your book at the front desk."" It's magic. Gardner: Does that mean if I'm kind of a country wit -- I don't work at the Fool but I'm listening to this podcast -- I can just drop an email to bookiemonster@fool.com? Chambers: Oh, no, no! I'm going to check with our CFO first. Gardner: Ah! I thought I found a loophole. Chambers: You could try! Gardner: So is this a program that is well used? Chambers: It's very popular. And it's fun to walk past the front desk. You see the books waiting to be picked up by somebody. You can chat with them in the hallway and say, ""Hey, I just saw you pick that up. How is that one?"" It brings a culture of reading and learning to this office. Gardner: Out of curiosity, because I'm going to be playing the role of, occasionally this week, the small-business entrepreneur. Maybe I have five to 10 employees. Maybe I'm a Realtor and I have my team. We're not The Motley Fool with 300 employees and the kinds of resources that you might be talking about. What is the rough expense I should expect if I were to open up my own Bookie Monster? Per employee, let's say. Chambers: That's a good question. I want to say an Amazon book is maybe $15 and maybe the average person can read a book a month ... Gardner: That's way beyond the average American. Did you know that the average American has not read a book this year? Chambers: Oh, no! Gardner: And I'm not here to dump on my fellow Americans, because there are a lot of great ones, but studies that I've seen suggest that adults, most, don't actually read a full book in a year. Chambers: That's possible. Gardner: So it's possible that I, with my small business, might have a less active Bookie Monster, so it's even cheaper than what you're suggesting. But if I'm doing the math right, 12 times 15-ish is $180 a year ... Chambers: Yeah. Gardner: ... per employee. Burbage: Before I order a book, I go to our internal library and look on the shelf first, to see if it's there. And I'm going to say that fairly frequently I can find a book already. So we encourage people, when you order a book, after you read it, to put it in the library, and then others can use it, and that helps defer costs. Gardner: Awesome. And the last question before we move to Point No. 2. Kara, it's for business books, right? Chambers: Correct. It is broadly. Gardner: What is not a business book? How about that? Gardner: George R.R. Martin has not yet written, although he probably should, maybe has, a business book. Chambers: Business lessons in there that are terrifying. Gardner: OK, good. Lee? Point No. 2. Burbage: So another, it's along the lines of reading in terms of sort of opening up your mind. I think it's easy to get trapped in your day-to-day work and inside the walls of your company, and so we're encouraging people to sort of think outside. And so one way to do that is to bring outside speakers in. And so we encourage Fools at any level -- let's say you've read a book and you're interested in the author. We will reach out to that author and say, ""Hey, would you stop by and visit us?"" What we find is that people will often say yes. They're happy to come in and share their ideas and thoughts, and proud to talk. We had a recent example. I was out in our local community, and I heard a woman from a local school speaking about raising culturally conscious kids. I actually hadn't thought about that concept before. I thoroughly enjoyed hearing her speak and afterward said, ""Hey, would you mind stopping by my office and speaking to anyone in the office who has kids that I think would also enjoy your talk?"" And she said, ""Absolutely."" So we had Kiki come in. She spoke to our Fool parents. It was a chance to take a break from your normal day, think about something that normally you don't have mind space for, and just open up and learn. So we have a number of different speakers in. I'm going to say we have a speaker in at least every couple or few weeks. Again, it could be an author. It could be a business leader. It could be someone that you see in the community. Burbage: LeeB@fool.com. Gardner: LeeB@fool.com. We want to hear from you, and when you're coming through the Washington, D.C., area, if you'd like to come by and speak to our employees, we would treasure that. However, back to my small business. My team of 10 people. Maybe I can't get Elon Musk to come this fall, but it turns out I can get somebody that I met through school as a parent. Or somebody through a professional association that you can come in and have your people learn from. And if you do have a larger company, it doesn't have to be everybody. Maybe somebody like Elon Musk can fill the house. But I like the recent evolution, Lee, which is it feels like we have more speakers with smaller groups, with more diverse possibilities as a consequence. Burbage: Yes, and I think that actually feeds the program. You're going from someone like Elon Musk, who's incredible, but then also someone from your local community talking about a completely different topic. Just allowing your mind to stretch in those different ways is fun and exciting, and to your point exactly, Kiki just lives up the street, right, so it was great to have her in. I know I appreciated it, and so did other Fool parents. I think also what you're identifying is there are different groups and types of people in any company, and so the idea that you're going to bring in one speaker every time that's going to appeal to every person at your company is probably unrealistic. So I think what we find is anybody that you can bring in that 10 or more people are interested in, hey, you've hit a pocket of people -- in my case, Fool parents, people with small children -- who are thinking about ""Hey, how do I get out to these?"" Kara probably didn't come to that talk and was like, ""Hey, I'm not that interested."" But she probably came to the talk on keepers. We had a speaker come in about -- was it a Netflix series? Chambers: A documentary ... Burbage: ... that was super popular. Gardner: Ah, yes. Burbage: I didn't go to that one because that's not particularly interesting to me. I don't consider either one of those a failure. Gardner: And before we move to Point No. 3, have other businesses, maybe local, started to play the same game with us? Inviting either of you to come speak? Do you go out and speak, sometimes, to others? Burbage: Yes, I've been asked several times to come in and talk either to associations, groups, that sort of thing, or to local companies. I was speaking to MITRE, a consulting company here in D.C., on a panel that they had. It's a funny thing. When they asked me, I was like, ""Absolutely,"" because it makes you feel good. You're proud to go out and talk about yourself and the cool things we're doing. So people say yes. Gardner: Kara, I know that Lee really likes to speak. I don't know if either one of us likes to speak as much as Lee does. Do you like to speak? Chambers: It's not my favorite, but I keep trying. Burbage: She's super good at it. Chambers: No. I would say also just paying visits. A couple of years ago, one of my colleagues and I went to San Francisco to a conference, and then we had a day free, so we asked our colleagues for some networking. Zooming around. Visited a couple of companies and met with our counterparts there. Gardner: Great idea. Chambers: So it doesn't have to be a presentation. It can just be, ""Hey, can I talk to you about what you do here, and meet your counterpart?"" It's just, again, broadening the network. It doesn't necessarily have to be a talk. That's one way we connect as well. Gardner: Connecting. So Point No. 1 is reading. Point No. 2 is connecting. Kara, what's Point No. 3? Chambers: I have this as ""listening."" This is a project Lee and I work a lot on. We love our peer-coaching program. I put this in as listening because I read somewhere that one of the best gifts you can give somebody that's free is to just give them your undivided attention. What we do is have a peer-coaching program. You can pick and choose. There are different levels of leadership. Different departments. It's not as heavy-handed as a mentorship. It's kind of lightweight. It's maybe one or two meetings a year. They're the person who's delivering your 360 feedback. They're checking with you at least twice a year to talk about just how you are doing. Are you happy? Are you feeling good? What can we do to support you better? It just gives you another outlet with a slightly different agenda than your manager might have, or HR might have. I like doing a lot of coaching. I actually enjoy it. So I think for us, one aspect of well-being is just having someone to listen to you, and that's free. We've worked on it just to build out the logistics, but we find that valuable source internally. Gardner: Kara, you led with the phrase ""peer coach,"" and then you mentioned ""feedback."" Is that the way feedback happens at this company? Chambers: Yes. In a typical company when you would get your 360 feedback, it would get emailed to your manager, and they would have to deliver it to you. Gardner: So that's not The Motley Fool. This is Acme, Inc. Chambers: Yes. Gardner: Acme, Inc. has your manager giving you the feedback. Chambers: Yes. That's typical, and as a manager, you want to know what's going on with your employee. But we turned it around, and it took away the pressure. There's zero consequences to someone giving you constructive feedback, because no one else is going to see it but you and your coach, and you just talk about it. And it's mine, so if it comes to me as feedback, I figure out what to do with it with the help of my coach. It doesn't get passed along. It's not part of my record. It doesn't affect my compensation. That frees up my colleagues, who are my friends, who don't want to negatively impact my career, to give constructive feedback with zero consequence. What we found is that creates a much more open environment for that conversation. Gardner: I hope this is fair. I'm going to eavesdrop, briefly, with your help, on The Motley Fool's feedback system. We're conducting that this month at the Fool. I'm going to ask you a couple of things about it really quickly. First of all, does everybody get feedback? Chambers: You can opt in. Everything we do here is optional, so you can choose. Gardner: So you decide if you want feedback. And I have to admit. I'm a little bit of a slacker, because it's August and I'm doing enough, so I didn't request it this time. Chambers: That's OK. Gardner: And that's OK, too. So feedback is not compulsory. It is earned by being asked for. Chambers: Yes. Gardner: That's odd. I think that's cool, though. Chambers: Again, if you are driving your own career, and you want to develop, you're the best person to know where you want to develop and how to figure that out. We also leave it open all year, so you can choose any time. It's kind of confusing, but there's a deadline because one of my colleagues calls it ""social permission"" to ask everybody at the company, or ask a bunch of people to fill something out about you, because it's work. It's still work. But we try to make it easy. We keep the questions really simple. Gardner: And that's where I want to keep eavesdropping, because when I used the form and typed in some feedback for one of my peers, there were just three questions. Chambers: Yes. Gardner: Do you remember what they are right off the top? Because again, I'm listening to this podcast this week maybe because I am in business or an organization. I'm curious what you ask. Burbage: We do keep it simple, and we also keep it positive. So what we found is we want a situation that you're going to look forward to. Related to the manager, people don't normally look forward to a meeting with their boss where they're going to hear a bunch of negative things. Gardner: ""It's time for your annual review, Lee! Have a seat, please!"" Burbage: That sounds horrible, and there's been plenty of study in this area. So instead, you're having this meeting with this third-party sounding-board coach. Our questions change a little bit over time, but they tend to be around where are you awesome, and where can you be even more awesome. We're looking for places to double down, or where you're doing a really good job. And then we've added in a feature where you can ask for feedback in a specific area, so maybe you just completed a project, or there's a particular zone, listening or something that you think you're bad at. Gardner: Lee wants to know what you thought of his lemon meringue pie this month. And his new Lemon Meringue Pie Club. Burbage: Yes. So you may want something specific, and, again, we try to keep it positive. We're building systems here, I think, for all of these that we want people to want to use. Like the worst part of an HR job is running around trying to make people do things. We want to build programs that people are like, ""Oh, I can't wait for feedback to start. I'm looking forward to that, and I'm choosing to opt in."" As opposed to Kara and I having to run around telling you you have to do this thing that you don't want to. Gardner: So it sounds to me as if part of the culture is you've subverted yourself to the employee who is your customer, and you're trying to engage and please that person. Without compelling them or forcing them, you're working extra hard to figure out what they're going to like and want to use. But let me flip this back at you before we move to Point No. 4, because I can imagine some people are listening right now saying, ""You know what? There's a person on my team or at our company. They are not doing a good job, and it's very hard for me to be positive about them."" How do you be effective and negative or, I would say, corrective within such a -- to be unfair to you both -- happy-go-lucky, free love, lemon meringue pie environment? Burbage: I think it's actually a fairly straightforward answer, which is I think if you're waiting for some program to start, or a system to be kicked in for you to be able to give that person that negative feedback, you've probably waited too long, and it's probably not appropriate. I think, David, if you're having some problems with my performance ... Gardner: I'm a little uncomfortable with my performance, Lee. That's about me. Burbage: I'm uncomfortable here on the podcast. Gardner: I've picked some bad stocks in the last year. Burbage: Those are the situations where you shouldn't be relying on a program or system like this. You should be pulling that person aside and talk to them, giving them that kind of feedback. A system like this, or any feedback system, isn't designed to handle that super-heavy load. Chambers: It's about development. And we have one other thing we liked. It's another learning we've had, and that's in terms of language. We offer the option to say, ""I would like your advice on this."" We've heard this. Someone else had this concept. But instead of saying, ""I would like your feedback,"" saying, ""I would like your advice."" That's your takeaway tip. It's just easier. People will always want to give you advice. They don't want to give you feedback. They don't give you a grade. But they're like, ""Oh, you want my advice? OK."" And people will open right up. Gardner: Wow! Chambers: That's a thing that we learned recently this year. So we've added that in this round to see how that goes. Gardner: That's a great point. So that was No. 3, listening. Lee, No. 4. For instance, over the last few weeks Kara and I have been super-involved with a volunteer team of Fools that are investigating a potential new business line for our company, and we just need to do a little research work, so the call was put out. ""Hey, anybody interested in helping out?"" Maybe six Fools raised their hand and said they'd love to help out. So they're dedicating a few hours a week that they have free toward this new venture. And what happens over time is we're actually learning as a business if they're good in that area. And they're learning, as an individual, if that might be an area that they'd like to do even more. Sometimes people walk away and they'll be like, ""Ooh, boy. That was awful. I don't want to do that again."" Or we, as a business, might say, ""Ooh, you're actually not very good at that."" Or even better, we're like, ""Hey, you're great! You should do more of that,"" and it builds into more career development. So just getting people to use their extra bandwidth to get out and about the business and reach beyond what their normal day-to-day work may be. Gardner: I'm curious, Lee. You started that by saying we're a project culture. What does that mean, exactly? Burbage: I don't believe that we have a traditional hierarchy here. A traditional career ladder. People work here for many years and do lots of different things. Our favorite people are ones that are working on maybe six or seven different projects at one time. They may be diverse projects. Some may be leading. Some might be followers. Some might be just playing all kinds of different roles on a team. So you're getting your enjoyment here by working with people that you love on really challenging things that are driving toward our purpose, and that's how you're managing your career. It's moving from project to project, trying new things, getting involved in things that you're passionate about. Gardner: So it really is pretty subversive if you're thinking about a traditional org chart, and a title on your business card, and once I'm junior this, my next goal would be senior this, and I'll get that in three years. And there is a downside to not being that way, because sometimes we'll lose people here at the Fool who want that career path or a clearer sense of what's next, and sometimes they leave the Fool after a few years to go back to maybe a more traditional workplace where they can find that. So what we're describing here -- I don't know how idiosyncratic or not it is -- it's definitely how we roll, and we bet we're probably not the only organization that rolls that way. Burbage: Yes. I mean, I was not the first to say this. Gardner: The Greeks were. I don't even know what you're about to say, but it's very obvious, I think, that Socrates said this. Go ahead! Burbage: Socrates once said every company has a culture, but not every culture is right for everyone. So we have a pretty defined and unique culture that fits and is cool for a lot of people, but not for everybody. We're not a great resume builder or LinkedIn profile-builder company, although when people leave here, they do find some pretty great jobs, but it's nontraditional, sure. Gardner: OK, we're at halftime. Thank you for those first four points. You have four glowing points to come. And right after this brief ad break, I'm going to ask you to think about something in the last 12 months, since you last came on this podcast, that hasn't worked so well. It's natural for us to want to share out the things that have worked well, and I think best-practice sharing is much more valuable, but I know, I'm sure some of our listeners are curious about something that, you know, we're trying stuff all the time. What have we learned that we needed to tweak, or hasn't worked so well? So think about that. All right, Lee and Kara. I asked, before we go on to point No. 5, what's something that hasn't worked? Burbage: So one thing that's pretty easy to do is look at your budget and sort of circle those big items. It's probably healthy, right, to circle those in question, and one thing we did last year was to circle our holiday party and say, ""Wow, that's sort of an expensive event to take everyone and a guest."" And it's hard to get a venue during the holidays. Gardner: That's part of what makes it expensive, right, Lee? Because everybody else is trying to rent the same venues for the holidays, and so the rents go up. Burbage: Absolutely. And you know us. We like to do things different, better, special. And so we're like, ""Ha, ha, ha, we'll get them. We're going to do ours in April. We'll just combine it with some other events. And we won't do the plus one."" And so, essentially, we canceled our holiday party. And as it turns out people missed it. That wasn't such a great decision. And when we announced this year that we were bringing it back, we got a lot of notes and a lot of people that were super-excited. So it turns out I think the money is worth it. To bring people together. To bring their spouse. We sometimes only see that person once a year. To break a little bread and celebrate the year, the timing, the spirit. It works, and I think we made a mistake by canceling our holiday party, and I'm pretty stoked out about it. Gardner: And I was one of those people who wrote a note to you both thanking you. I thought I might be the only one who had written that note. Well, that's a good learning. Kara? Chambers: As we just talked about learning, one thing we're working on is we realized over the years that learning and development in an office has a temptation to bring everyone in and teach a class in a classroom. What you find is sometimes you have to bribe them with sandwiches, and maybe that's not in your budget, either, so you bring them in and you find your attendance starts dropping. So we said nothing is mandatory here. And we're noticing this kind of drop-off, and this is over years. Gardner: Because we have internal classes here at The Motley Fool. Now this is maybe not a normal thing for a lot of people. Kara, what would be a typical class that we might have taught over the years here at the Fool? Chambers: It could be an introduction to how a different department does their work. It could be leadership development for team leaders. The how-to. Gardner: How to fill out your 401(k), I can imagine. These kinds of things. Chambers: Yes, and again, those individually went well, and I'm only thinking of the good ones now. The memorable ones. I'm sure there were ones that were not memorable. But we found that their attendance was dwindling, and so we are spending our time thinking about how to create experiential learning. And you have to walk a line, because if you've got your best people working on your most valuable things, you have a hesitancy to take them off those valuable things to learn. So that constant push-pull is getting your best people and developing them even further, but it's a challenge. If you want something done, ask busy people. So just thinking about your really busy people and then you're like, ""Hey, can you teach this class? Can you do it?"" And what you find is it's hard to get that group. So we're trying to find ways. Maybe it's job swapping. We did a workshop with you not long ago on a project that was kind of fun. We're trying to think of other ways to bring people together to learn things without it being classroom-focused. Because, as we saw, the attendance was dropping, until at one point I remember seeing, ""This meeting is at noon and we don't get any food?"" OK, that's not why we're here. Gardner: Something can be fixed here. Chambers: That's not why we're here. That's something I learned. Gardner: Thank you both. Let's get back on our program, Point Nos. 5 to 8. Let's speed it up a little bit. I think my tendency to just enjoy this conversation too much has me asking too many questions. For our last four we're going to focus it a little bit more, and No. 5, Kara, I think I'm back to you. Chambers: I wouldn't be anywhere if I wasn't talking about an app you need to use. For those of you who are Slack users -- Slack is our internal instant-messaging program -- we use an app in there called Donut, and what that does is, it's an algorithm that pairs you with a random Fool for coffee every other Monday. It's optional. You can opt in. And you can drop out of the Slack channel if you don't want to have coffee the next Monday. They're using some kind of magic algorithm with people outside of your group. What I like about it is -- I'm an introvert. Parties or big happy hours I'll be shy at, but one on one I like talking to people. So once we installed it, I went around and I recruited all of my introverts, one by one, and said, ""Come on. It's so much easier to get to know people one on one with this."" Gardner: It's Donut! Donut! Chambers: Come on! Come on! So we have fun. It's really a nice, low-pressure way to build connections at the Fool. I've been in the position of giving and getting feedback of building your network, and for your more introverted people that can be difficult. So one at a time. At random. Chambers: Donut.ar. Gardner: And if you're not a Slack user, darn it, you probably can use pencil and paper and make a program like this, and pair random people who want to talk some. Burbage: Maybe dice. Chambers: Roll dice. Gardner: No, don't get me started. The gamer in me wants to talk about games. We're going to go back to Point No 6. Lee. So David, if you wanted to move your desk, which is just a table on wheels with two cords, you unplug your cords and you roll your desk over to wherever you want to go. You don't need to ask permission. You don't need to trade desks with somebody. There's no packing, or boxes, or anything. Literally just roll around. Our office is literally different every day, and it's because people are moving around and maybe like Kara, they need a few minutes to work by themselves, because they're more introverted, and they roll their desk over. Like, ""Hey, I'm on a team now. Let me roll that over to my team."" So just providing people that mobility and the autonomy to make their own decision about where and how they want to work has been a big thing for us, and I think people are happier and more productive. Gardner: We didn't force-rank these points, so we're not saying that Point No. 6 is the sixth most important thing. But for a lot of offices -- whether you are in a small or a large office -- that's very doable. Now, for some offices, maybe you have mahogany furniture or you have stuff built in. You have cubicles that are basically anchored to the wall. Maybe you can't do that. But at least your chair on wheels, at least being able to slide around and meet with people or hang out for four days in a workpod to get stuff done seems doable. It wasn't until year what of our company, Lee, that we finally figured out we could put stuff on wheels? Burbage: I think it was about eight years ago. Gardner: So year 16. It took us 16 years to figure that out. Burbage: When you were asking before about major mistakes that we made. I will say that when Bryan Tighe and Chad Wolfsheimer, two Fools that work here, came to me and talked to me about this, my first reaction was, ""That sounds crazy! No, no, no!"" And so it took them a little convincing of me. It's really part of the Scrum and Agile push. In your mahogany desk scenario, I would say we've also found a lot of success finding little spaces in hallways. Any little gap in the office where you can shove a couch or roll a few chairs into to just give people options of other places to sit and interact has been pretty powerful, too. So not being tethered to a mahogany desk in the corner, and instead being able to get out and move around and move about the cabin, we think, is a pretty big deal. Again, my idea from the beginning. Gardner: Kara, Point No. 7. Chambers: Caring. I do our engagement surveys, and for at least nine years a very popular engagement survey question is, ""My team leader, or someone at work, cares about me as a person."" And I enjoy, every time I open up the survey, and it goes up one more point. We're at 95%. That's a humble brag there, but I think it's important. It's part of our culture. A very family-oriented culture. And all the things we do, we want to help you feel like this is part of your family. People you see every day you spend a lot of time with, and so caring about each other is a part of your well-being, just knowing that people do. It's a high driver. It's something that we take pride in that's always been part of our culture. Even when other engagement scores go up and down, I see this go up and I say that makes a resilient culture. That tells me that we are all in it because we care about each other, and I would be a sad person if I had to get up in front of a company and present a score like 50. Gardner: And actually implicit in Point No. 7 -- caring, Kara -- is that we're measuring. And we're not really talking about that this time. I think we've talked about that in a prior podcast. By the way, I'm going to plug your two previous appearances at the end, shortly, so people can find more of such ideas. Chambers: Yeah, and what we say is every company is a great place to work in its own way, and for us that's a big one, and if you have that at your company, just building on it, right? It comes from starting with your founders and hiring your friends, but building from there. Starting with people who care about each other. Gardner: And to be maybe just a little bit soupy and sentimental, Kara and Lee, you're some of my good friends here at the Fool, and I didn't know you when we started The Motley Fool. So one of the things that happens, if you're in a good office, and you stay around for a while, and you've got a positive culture, regardless of what business you're in, is that some of your best friends end up being the people that you're working with every day and you didn't even know them when you graduated high school or college. Point No. 8, Lee. Burbage: So No. 8 builds a little bit on my holiday-party point. Just not forgetting the fun and building into the fun. It can be so easy and, again, to use your word, sappy. We're like, ""Hey, we should have another activity, or another fun event!"" So we do still try to have at least some sort of fun company event that's organized once a month. And the one I wanted to highlight was one that we had from last month, because I'm particularly excited. We tried to think about how could we do something fun that also draws in our remote workforce. So we have a decent number of Fools that are working from around the United States and around the world. All different sorts of time zones. And that can make having a fun event difficult to pull off and maybe even makes them sad. So here we're doing something fun at the headquarters, and we've got someone in Singapore who's saddened because they can't participate. So here's what we did -- a push-up challenge. We've come full circle to being the most athletic company here ... Gardner: Yeah. How could we not mention that in Washington, D.C., we are the reigning, most athletic company in the capital of maybe arguably the most powerful nation the world has ever known? Burbage: I think our hope is they never give that award again, and then we're only the only one ever. But we did a push-up challenge, and it was very simple. You can do this in your company. We had a Google doc where you go and put your name in. I know that you both participated. And just on a daily basis you marked down how many push-ups you're doing and you have a goal. And there's actually some banter talking inside the Google doc, and we had some prizes. Gardner: And some teams challenged some other teams with that. Burbage: Absolutely. So if you're in Singapore, you're in Australia, or you're here in Washington, D.C., you can get in that Google doc. You can participate. It happened all month long. We had a super-fun time. We did, I think, 150,000 push-ups as a company. So we found a way for us to have fun as a company, which I think is easy to forget, especially in the busy world that we live in today. So adding some fun into your company and finding ways for everybody to participate is something I'm particularly excited about. Gardner: OK, we're going to close this one up. I want to give a little bit of a plug to one or two resources that people who have enjoyed this podcast can access, but before I do that I want to ask you each one final question, and Kara, randomly I'll pick you for the first one and Lee, you for the second. Each of these comes from a different type of a listener. We're going to call them ""opposite listeners."" Kara, you're going to speak briefly to the person who has no budget. They're either at a smaller company than The Motley Fool -- and there are many smaller companies than The Motley Fool -- or they're a larger company but there's just no budget for things like wellness or fun. So I'm listening to you guys. You're talking about something that sounds great. I mean, I wish I had that kind of pie in the sky, but I don't. What can I learn from this podcast? What can I do? Chambers: Push-ups and Google docs. They're free, so I'll start with that. Talking about mistakes. Before we had a wellness person, we designed our own wellness challenge, and it was really ridiculously complicated, but we did it. Gardner: It's helpful to have senior people who understand what they're doing. Chambers: It's better in the hands of a professional. That's all I'll say. But nobody got hurt. So try. Loaning books among each other is free. Sitting down and listening to your colleagues -- I'd say the No. 1 takeaway, too, is if you're just starting out in a business, it's really easy to think of now I'm in management and I have to be the police for my employees. And for us it's always, come from a place of trust -- a place of positivity -- and it works. That's why I like to go out into the world and say you can have that with three people, and ideally I hope you do. Gardner: So, so much of what we just covered in these 45 minutes or so is free. It's just about making decisions, having frameworks, and having some internal commitment, or willingness to get there. Willingness to experiment. All right, Lee, you're going to come at this from the other angle. ""Hey, The Motley Fool is a cute company. I appreciate the podcast. I've followed some of your stock picks. You guys are just 300 employees. I work at a division that itself is 3,000 employees. We have tons of resources."" So, Fools listening to this hour, I'm wondering if you had twice the budget that you have, because this hypothetical person that you're going to be, for a sec, Lee, does. This person has twice the budget that we have for employees to focus on wholeness and well-being. If you had more, how would you be spending it? Burbage: I reject the question. The reason I say that is I don't think it's about money. I think what I would love in that scenario, if it were me, is I would have scale to do things that Kara and I can't do because we just don't have enough people. For instance, our coaching program, I think, would be even richer, because I would be leveraging all those people that exist at that company. So whether it's the coaching program or speakers, I don't necessarily need to go external to find speakers. I bet you with a large population inside my company, there are some pretty interesting people that could teach a class. Speak about something that they're doing. So just being able to leverage the human power of all the interesting folks in that scenario would be cool. The second thing I would say is killing systems or processes that are unpopular and not very powerful at scale is a big deal. Gardner: Very powerful. Burbage: Yes. To kill the performance appraisal at 300 was a big deal. To kill the performance appraisal at 3,000 or 6,000 -- they'll write a book about you. Gardner: Well, Kara Chambers and Lee Burbage, two world-class thinkers, and I'm going to say that again with my entrepreneurial pride on my sleeve because of The Motley Fool's renown as a place to work and a place that's constantly experimenting, sometimes with small budgets. I love Lee's point that it's not about money. That's what Kara said as well. So much of this is free. But willing to experiment and try and see what works, and try to make the workplace better for one of our key stakeholders that every organization -- for-profit and not-for-profit -- has, and that's your employees or, if you will, your human capital. I mentioned earlier that I've done two previous podcasts with Kara and Lee, and if you'd like to hear either one of them, I'm going to call them out right now. The very first one was their appearance on Dec. 2, 2015: ""10 Traits of a Great Company Culture."" So if you're on iTunes, you can just scroll down to 12/02/15. Listen to it yourself. Share it with your manager or the big boss at your organization -- whoever it is -- share it out! And then they came back in 2016. The day was May 11. And we imaginatively named that one ""10 More Traits of a Great Company Culture."" Not quite sure what we're going to call this one, because I don't make that call each week. More talented people here at the Fool name these, but maybe we'll have ""10 Even More Great Traits,"" or maybe we'll be more focused on wellness, which was the purpose of this podcast. Kara and Lee, sharing with you what they've learned about the overall well-being of your employees. Now Lee, if you're comfortable, let's say I've really enjoyed this podcast, or one of these, and I want to get in touch with this team at the Fool. How do I reach you? Burbage: I'm happy for people to email me. LeeB@fool.com. It's pretty fun, because it's ""Lee B A Fool."" Gardner: LeeB -- letter B ... Burbage: @fool.com. Gardner: Lee B A Fool. I get it. OK. LeeB@fool.com. And Kara, The Motley Fool has a culture blog. Chambers: Yes. It's culture.fool.com, and all of our content, our job postings, anything we do here. How to get in touch with us. Gardner: We take pictures of ourselves on Halloween or silly, ridiculous stuff. Chambers: You would think all we did was dress up in costumes. Gardner: One would sometimes think. I do follow and I can follow it, by the way, on Twitter at Motley Fool Culture. Burbage: Instagram. Gardner: OK, good. So I do see some of those pictures. Chambers: Yes. Instagram. Motley Fool Culture. I'm TMFKara on Twitter, so I post a lot of stuff I read on there. Gardner: Awesome! Thank you both so much for your time! Thank you, Rule Breaker, whoever and wherever you are. And it's our hope, on behalf of Kara, Lee, and myself, that you find ways to make the place around you, where you go to work every day, better for you and those around you in the year ahead. Fool on!

    8 Ways The Motley Fool Does Workplace Well-Being Right -- The Motley Fool

"Brian Stoffel, Matthew Frankel, CFP, and Rich Duprey",10052017,Fool,09282017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Where will you be in 2091? It's safe for most of us to assume we won't be around. So here's a better question: What companies that exist today will still be around in 2091? Image source: Getty Images. Here, three of our investors here at The Motley Fool will tell you why they think Welltower (NYSE:WELL), Boeing (NYSE:BA), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) are all worth buying and holding for the next 75 years. Matt Frankel (Welltower): Welltower is the largest real estate investment trust, or REIT, that specializes in healthcare properties. This could be an excellent way to invest in the aging U.S. population, while generating a rock-solid income stream at the same time. The company owns 1,384 healthcare properties, about 70% of which are senior housing facilities. Most of the properties are located in the United States, but the company has substantial investments in the U.K. and Canada as well. To make a long story short, because of the ongoing retirement of the baby boomer generation and longer life expectancies, the older age groups of the population are expected to grow rapidly in all three of Welltower's markets. The senior citizen population (ages 65 and up) is expected to roughly double between now and 2050, and the 85-and-above age group -- the group most likely to utilize senior housing -- is expected to grow significantly faster than that. Welltower has a 46-year track record of delivering strong results and dividend growth to its investors, with a 15.5% average annualized return since inception, and a nearly perfect history of increasing its dividend, which currently translates to a 4.6% yield. While a company's past performance is certainly not a guarantee of its future returns, with the favorable demographic trends, there's no reason to believe Welltower won't continue to outperform. Rich Duprey (Boeing): Aerospace and defense contracting giant Boeing  is going to be around for a long, long time to come. While it is a cyclical business and it's been flying high since the recession, Boeing could still have plenty of altitude left in its stock, particularly over the next 75 years. Arguably best known for its hugely popular 737, as well as the 747, a plane Boeing first introduced in 1970, the 787 Dreamliner widebody has garnered much of the attention because of its audaciousness -- though it ultimately serves a limited market. But there's also a new 400-seat aircraft -- the 777X -- that's still on the drawing board, and it could become the biggest-selling airplane in the market after its first delivery in 2020. Currently the sweet spot for aircraft manufacturing remains the 737, where Boeing has a backlog of over 4,500 plane orders. Even as it builds them at a rate of 42 per month, it expects to incrementally increase that number to 57 per month by the end of the decade. As important as the commercial-aircraft market is, let's not forget the defense-contracting side of the ledger, where Boeing continues to add new contracts for military aircraft, both here and abroad. From fighter jets to maritime observation craft, Boeing goes hand in hand with the country's military budget, which, particularly these days, may see significant increases. That's not likely to change of the coming decades, and where companies such as Lockheed Martin  will be both competitor and partner at times, and upstarts such as SpaceX will also enter the picture, investors can rest assured that Boeing will remain a constant. With a dividend that's currently yielding 2.2% because of its price, 75 years from now, Boeing stock will be looking back at us from the stratosphere. While Amazon hasn't been around as long as a lot of other companies out there, there's something that gives me confidence about its survival: It focuses on the things that don't change. Here's what CEO Jeff Bezos has to say: We know that customers want low prices, and I know that's going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast delivery; they want vast selection. It's impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, ""Jeff I love Amazon; I just wish the prices were a little higher,"" [or] ""I love Amazon; I just wish you'd deliver a little more slowly."" The basis for that viewpoint comes from the company's simple mission statement: ""to be the earth's most customer-centric company."" I believe customer service will always be in demand. As long as Amazon can keep this point front and center, I believe it will thrive for decades. ","
      
    3 Stocks to Buy for the Next 75 Years -- The Motley Fool

,10052017,MarketWatch,09282017,"Analysis  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: The horror in Las Vegas may not dramatically change the debate about guns. But the response to the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, which has left at least 59 dead and hundreds more wounded, reveals a great deal about our politics. Here are 10 takeaways: 1. No new gun laws will pass. The National Rifle Association deserves more credit than any other outside group for Donald Trump’s victory, and the president knows it. “You came through big for me, and I am going to come through for you,” he said at the NRA’s April convention in Atlanta. Virtually no Republican in Congress, and certainly no one in leadership, is willing to cross the powerful gun lobby. Even if Trump decided he wanted to act, which he will not, his party would block him. 2. But Vegas makes it much harder for Republicans to roll back existing gun laws. In the wake of the attack, House Republican leaders have decided to table a bill that would loosen restrictions on purchasing gun silencers. At least for now. “That bill, introduced by Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), has been approved by the Natural Resources Committee and was expected to be on the House floor soon, though it had not yet been scheduled for a vote,” Politico reports. “Consideration of the bill was (already) postponed earlier this year after Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) was shot in June at a congressional baseball practice.” “Rep. Richard Hudson's (R-N.C.) proposal to allow concealed-carry permit holders to take their guns with them across state lines also faces new political problems,” per John Bresnahan, Heather Caygle and Burgess Everett. “The Duncan legislation includes a provision revising federal regulations on silencers, which currently have tougher purchasing requirements than other guns. A different provision in the Duncan bill makes it more difficult for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to classify certain ammunition as ‘armor piercing.’ Regulations on interstate transportation weapons would be revised as well.” 3. There will be at least some new converts for gun control. After spending the night fearing for his life, the lead guitarist for the Josh Abbot Band — a Texas-based country group — announced that he has changed his position. “I’ve been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life. Until the events of last night. I cannot express how wrong I was. We actually have members of our crew with [Concealed Handgun Licenses], and legal firearms on the bus,” Caleb Keeter wrote in a statement. “They were useless. … We need gun control RIGHT. NOW.” 4. Gun control will be a litmus test for Democrats in 2020. It is inconceivable that Democrats will nominate someone for president who is not an outspoken proponent of tough new gun laws. Bernie Sanders was on the defensive throughout the 2016 Democratic primaries over his moderate record on guns, which reflects the culture of his home state of Vermont. Hillary Clinton successfully used this as a wedge issue to squeeze him from the left. Many presidential aspirants, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), quickly moved past the normal niceties after a tragedy and were agitating for tough laws within hours of Vegas. They know nothing will pass, but they are laying a marker. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who represents Newtown, has become the most forceful advocate for action in the 2020 field. “It's time for Congress to get off its ass and do something,” he said. (Read Murphy’s op-ed in today’s Post.) Many rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers are beginning to boycott “the predictable moments of unification that commonly occur in the hours after mass shootings — hoping their refusal to participate will call attention to the inaction,” the Boston Globe’s Annie Linskey reports. “To have only a moment of silence where there never is action taken, tragedy after tragedy, that is not something I want to be a part of,” said Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), who led the sit-in on the House floor after the shooting in Orlando. 5. The Vegas attack has pushed gun control to the front burner of the neck-and-neck race for Virginia governor. “At a previously scheduled forum in Vienna … Democrat Ralph Northam and Republican Ed Gillespie offered condolences. But the partisan divide over guns in Virginia, a Southern state with a strong gun tradition that was shaken by the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, was immediately evident,” Fenit Nirappil reports. “Northam, a former Army doctor who has an F rating from the National Rifle Association, decried what he called ‘a proliferation of guns’ in society and urged gun-control measures. Gillespie, who has an A rating and an endorsement from the NRA, asked for a moment of silence, later telling reporters that it was too soon to discuss policy. … Gillespie is opposed to further restrictions on guns and promised to reverse an executive order signed by Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) that bans guns in state government buildings.” The debate about guns could help Gillespie bring home Trump supporters who backed his rival, Corey Stewart, in the June Republican primary. Conservatives who may not like the former RNC chairman will vote for him if they believe Northam wants to restrict their rights. The back-and-forth might also nationalize the race, which works against Gillespie in an environment where Trump remains unpopular. -- Sneak peek: Speaking of the Trump dynamic, Northam will unveil a new ad today that touts his willingness to stand up to the president. “As a doctor, nobody ever asks if I’m a Democrat or a Republican. They just want my help,” the lieutenant governor says to camera. “So if Donald Trump is helping Virginia, I’ll work with him. But Donald Trump proposed cutting Virginia’s school funding, rolling back our clean air and water protections, and taking away healthcare from thousands of Virginians. … I’ve stood up to Donald Trump on all of it. Ed Gillespie refuses to stand up to him at all.” 6. The paranoid style in American politics is alive and well. Televangelist Pat Robertson suggested yesterday that disrespect for Trump was a factor behind the shooting. “Violence in the streets, ladies and gentlemen,” he said on the Christian Broadcasting Network’s “700 Club.” “Why is it happening? . . . The fact that we have disrespect for authority. There is profound disrespect of our president. All across this nation, they say terrible things about him. It’s in the news. It’s in other places. There is disrespect now for our national anthem, disrespect for our veterans, disrespect for the institutions of our government, disrespect for the court system. All the way up and down the line: disrespect. … Until there is Biblical authority, there has to be some controlling authority in our society and there is none. … When there is no vision of God, the people run amok. We have taken from the American people the vision of God.” Wayne Allyn Root, a columnist for the Sheldon Adelson-owned Las Vegas Review-Journal who warmed up crowds during Trump rallies in 2016, pushed the theory on Twitter that the shooter must be Muslim. After police announced that he was not, Root refused to back down or apologize. “[G]overnment restrictions will not stop psychopaths from harming people. They will find a way,” former Fox News anchor Bill O’Reilly wrote on his blog. “This is the price of freedom. Violent nuts are allowed to roam free until they do damage, no matter how threatening they are. The Second Amendment is clear that Americans have a right to arm themselves for protection. Even the loons.” -- To be sure, there are extreme views on both sides. CBS announced that it fired a company lawyer who wrote on Facebook yesterday that she was “actually not even sympathetic” to the shooting victims because “country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” “If they wouldn’t do anything when children were murdered I have no hope that Repugs will ever do the right thing,” she wrote. 7. The fever swamps of the Internet have powerful megaphones, even when what’s being yelled is false. “Geary Danley was not the gunman … But for hours on the far-right Internet, would-be sleuths scoured Danley’s Facebook likes, family photographs and marital history to try to ‘prove’ that he was,” Abby Ohlheiser reports. “Danley, according to an archived version of a Facebook page bearing that name, might have been married to a Marilou Danley. Police were looking for a woman by that name in the hours after the shooting, but later said they did not think she was involved. The briefest look at the viral threads and tweets falsely naming Geary Danley as the attacker makes it easy to guess why a bunch of right-wing trolls latched on to him: His Facebook profile indicated that he might be a liberal … “That phony story quickly embedded itself into the algorithms of Google and Facebook, where sites promoting the rumor remained at the top of the results for anyone searching for Danley’s name. … For a time on Monday morning, one of those 4chan threads falsely naming Danley as the shooter was promoted by Google as a ‘top story’ for searches for his name … The right-wing news site Gateway Pundit [which the White House has given press credentials to] also picked up these rumors as fact in a now-deleted article. … And on Facebook, a search for articles about Geary Danley promoted seven links leading to inaccurate stories about him. The eighth result is a debunking.” (BuzzFeed debunks 19 other hoaxes that spread online after the shooting.) These are many of the same people that promoted Pizzagate, and the fact that the fake stories got as much visibility and traction as they did suggests that search giants and social media platforms still have a lot of work to do before they can be considered responsible corporate actors. 8. More than ever, in a polarized and fragmented country, comedians are emerging as prominent voices of moral authority. Every late-night TV comedian except Jimmy Fallon opened his show last night with a serious monologue about what transpired in Vegas. Emily Yahr writes up what each of them said: “Trevor Noah and James Corden were in disbelief over American gun culture. Conan O’Brien was devastated to realize how many times he’s had to talk about mass shootings. Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers urged Congress to take action on gun control.” Jimmy Kimmel has clearly been emboldened by the role he played in stopping the Cassidy-Graham health-care bill from passing last week. The ABC host was in tears on his show last night as he spoke about the “terrible, inexplicable, shocking and painful tragedy” in his hometown of Las Vegas. Kimmel choked up several times during a 10-minute speech. He called out Trump, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan by name. “They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country, because it’s so crazy,” he said. (Read a full transcript of the monologue here.) Click below to watch: Watch Conan: Watch Noah: Watch Meyers: Watch Corden: 9. The polling on guns is much more complicated and nuanced than most of the mainstream media’s coverage might lead you to believe. “Democrats are fond of pointing out that 8 in 10 or 9 in 10 Americans favor expanded background checks for gun purchases. That's true, but it also masks another important reality: Republicans just don't think legislation is the answer, period,” Aaron Blake writes on The Fix. “In June 2016, Quinnipiac University asked whether people supported a ban on ‘assault weapons’ — a.k.a. semiautomatic ones. About 6 in 10 Americans (59 percent) supported it, including 4 in 10 Republicans (40 percent). But when the pollster asked whether such a ban would be effective in reducing gun violence, Americans actually disagreed by a small margin, 49-47. Just 24 percent of Republicans thought it would be effective, while 70 percent said it wouldn't. “The story was similar on background checks: While 93 percent of all people and 90 percent of Republicans said they supported background checks for all gun purchases, only 62 percent overall and 42 percent of Republicans thought it would actually reduce gun violence. A majority of Republicans (53 percent) again felt it wouldn't help at all. … And if you don't think these address the problem, you're more likely to believe specific proposals overreach into ‘gun grabs.’” “And in fact, multiple polls have shown a large percentage of Americans think the answer is more guns, not fewer. A Washington Post-ABC News poll that same month showed that 54 percent would encourage more people to carry guns legally for self-defense. Just 42 percent discouraged it.” 10. Regardless of the polling, the truth is that America’s deadliest shooting incidents are getting much deadlier. Philip Bump charts how the death toll of these massacres has grown over time: WHAT HAPPENED: -- “Under the neon glow and glitz of the Vegas Strip, thousands of concertgoers who had gathered for a three-day music festival dove for cover or raced toward shelter when the gunfire began at about 10 p.m. Sunday,” Heather Long, Mark Berman and Derek Hawkins report. “Police said more than 22,000 people were at the concert when Paddock began firing round after round, shooting from an elevated position that left those on the ground effectively helpless. The typical advice for reacting to an active shooter — ‘run, hide or fight’ — was rendered moot, as many in the packed crowd could not easily run or hide, nor were they able to fight back at someone firing from so far away.” -- “Outside, The Strip, always a blizzard of dazzling lights and honking horns, almost instantly turned into a frenzied hive of pulsing police lights and sirens,” Michael Lyle, Heather Long and Marc Fisher report. “People fled every which way, many taking cellphone video of their run to safety. [Former minor league baseball player Todd Blyleven, who traveled from Dallas for the concert with his wife and friends], helped carry out the lifeless body of a young woman. He saw a police officer who looked like he had taken a bullet in the neck. ‘Young girls and guys, older folks, just people walking out of a country concert with bullet holes,’ Blyleven said.” -- “Aldean was barely five measures into ‘When She Says Baby,’ when the shots started,” Avi Selk and Amy B Wang report. “’Is that gunfire?’ [Singer Jason] Owen remembered thinking[.] The gunfire continued, steady against the beat of the song … Shot after shot, faster and faster. Aldean sprinted off the stage. Owen ran, too. So did other singers, workers and all the thousands of spectators — fleeing and screaming, falling and dying.” -- A fire alarm triggered by gun smoke let first responders zero in on the shooter’s location. SWAT team members then used explosives to get inside, where they found [Paddock] dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. “We believe the individual killed himself prior to our entry,” the sheriff said. (Cleve R. Wootson Jr.) -- “I realized people were dying"": Photographer David Becker spoke to The Post's photo editor MaryAnne Golon about witnessing the attack and capturing some of the most haunting images from the night: “ It had been so dark outside I couldn’t see the details. I just saw a lot of people laying on the ground thinking they were playing possum, but now I could see people covered in blood and I thought, this is real. When I saw the image of the woman lying on the ground covered in blood, that was when the impact of what I was experiencing hit — when I realized people were dying.” Jessica Klymchuk was among the victims. (Social media/Reuters) THE VICTIMS: -- Only a handful of the 59 victims so far have been identified. They range in age from 20 to nearly 60 and came from across the country for the music festival. They included a single mother of four, a registered nurse and a Las Vegas police officer. The Post will keep updating this running list as more names are released. Sandy Casey, a special-education teacher, had recently gotten engaged. She was attending the concert with her fiance, Christopher Willemse, and friends when she was struck in her lower back. She died in Willemse’s arms as he attempted to carry her to safety. Angie Gomez was just 20 and went to the festival to celebrate her new job as a certified nursing assistant. Her boyfriend of five years and several strangers attempted to get her to a hospital, but she died before receiving medical attention. John Phippen, 57, traveled to Las Vegas from California with his son Travis. As the gunshots first rang out, Phippen jumped on top of his son and saved his life. Travis, who has experience as a medic, went on to treat more than a dozen of the injured, despite taking a bullet to the arm. Jonathan Smith, 30, saved ~30 people last night before he was shot in the neck. He might live w/the bullet for rest of his life. #vegasstrip pic.twitter.com/6hLujXWe51 THE HEROES: -- Jonathan Smith was shot in the neck while helping dozens to safety. Heather Long reports: “Smith was focused on saving his young nieces, but they separated in the crowd. … He grabbed people and told them to follow him toward a handicapped parking area in the direction of the airport, away from Las Vegas Boulevard. It was a large field with several rows of vehicles. Smith and the others crouched down behind one of the last rows of cars. … A few young girls weren’t fully hidden. He stood up and moved toward them to urge them to get on the ground. That’s when a bullet struck him in the neck. … ‘I don’t see myself [as a hero],’ he said. ‘I would want someone to do the same for me. No one deserves to lose a life coming to a country festival.’” “He’s just a guy who lived in Mesquite who liked burritos,” is how Eric Paddock described his brother, Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock pic.twitter.com/q3MUgIa2Ws THE SHOOTER: -- Stephen Paddock, 64, was described as a high-stakes gambler who mostly kept to himself at a quiet retirement community outside Las Vegas. Neighbors said he would disappear for “days at a time,” frequenting casinos with his longtime girlfriend, Marilou Danley. William Wan, Sandhya Somashekhar, Aaron C. Davis and Barbara Liston have more: Relatives expressed bewilderment and told authorities they were not aware of any mental illness or substance abuse problems: “Eric Paddock said he knew of five guns his brother kept in his safe but was shocked that a rapid-fire weapon was used in Sunday’s shooting. He said his brother didn’t hunt, barely shot his guns and once took Eric Paddock’s children on a skeet-shooting trip paid for by the casinos.” He liked to wager tens of thousands of dollars in a single sitting: “He owned homes in four states but preferred staying in casino hotels, sometimes for weeks at a time . . . He was worth more than $2 million, relatives said. At various points of his life, Stephen Paddock worked for defense contractor Lockheed Martin and as an accountant and property manager. As a retiree, he had no children and plenty of money to play with. So he took up gambling. ‘It’s like a job for him. It’s a job where you make money,’ said Eric Paddock, adding that his brother could lose $1 million and still have enough to live on.’” For several years, the gunman lived with his girlfriend, Marilou Danley, in a retirement community in Reno: “[Neighbors] said they interacted with Danley but not with Paddock, whom they described as extremely standoffish. . . . Harold Allred, who lives up the street from the couple, said his wife often ran into Danley in exercise classes or social gatherings. Allred said he and his wife found Danley unremarkable, though perhaps a little odd, and didn’t know Paddock. ‘He was reclusive,’ said Allred, 66. ‘We never met him.’” “Paddock’s father, Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, was on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list, described on a 1969 wanted poster as ‘psychopathic’ with suicidal tendencies. He escaped from prison that year and, according to news accounts, was not captured until 1978, when he was nabbed while running a bingo parlor in Oregon.” THE WEAPONS: -- Even after searching his home, investigators are still trying to figure out Paddock’s motive. ""[Authorities] said hotel staff had been in and out of the two-room suite, which Paddock had stayed in since Sept. 28, and spotted nothing ‘nefarious,’ though he had more than 10 suitcases,” Matt Zapotosky, Devlin Barrett and Mark Berman report. -- Authorities said Paddock had a cache of 23 firearms in his possession. Michael S. Rosenwald, Devlin Barrett and Alex Horton report: “One of the weapons Paddock apparently [used] was an AK-47 type rifle, with a stand to steady it for firing[.] … Investigators believe at least one of the guns functioned as if it were fully automatic and are now working to determine whether he modified it or others to be capable of spitting out a high volume of fire just by holding down the trigger[.] But video from the attack suggests Paddock may have used at least one fully automatic rifle, marking the first time such a weapon has been wielded by a public mass shooter in the United States.” THE TRUMP RESPONSE: -- The White House repeatedly insisted yesterday that it was not appropriate to talk about policy on the day of a tragedy. “There will certainly be a time for that policy discussion to take place, but that’s not the place that we’re in at this moment,”  said press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. -- But Trump selectively politicizes events, whenever they work to his advantage. “Time and time again, he has capitalized on terror to advance his agenda,” write Michael Scherer and Philip Rucker. “After a bomb attack on a train in London in September, Trump called for a ‘far larger, tougher and more specific’ travel ban … well before London authorities had declared that terrorism was the cause. When an indebted gambler assaulted a Manila casino in June, killing dozens by starting a fire, Trump called the event ‘terrorism’ at the White House, even though local police later said the attack was a robbery attempt unconnected to terrorism. During his campaign, Trump made the shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. … a centerpiece of his proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. And Trump reacted to the shooting at an Orlando nightclub with self-praise, suggesting that the incident was a symptom of weak Democratic policies. “The Las Vegas massacre was different, both because investigators have found no evidence linking the shooter to a terrorist organization and because he was a white American, as opposed to a Muslim immigrant,” Scherer and Rucker write. “The emerging facts prevented Trump from following his typical playbook — to rally his supporters against Islamic extremism while speaking and tweeting in a combative, even belligerent tone to try to project strength and resolve. Rather, Trump uttered just 574 words on Monday and tried to play the role of uniter.” -- “Mass shootings are so frequent in America that the political responses to them have become ritualized to the point of parody,” Ryan Lizza writes in the New Yorker. “Trump … read haltingly from a teleprompter in the Diplomatic Reception Room, where F.D.R. once calmed Depression- and Second World War-era America with his fireside chats. It was not Trump’s worst public performance. He stayed on script, and read a short and well-crafted statement without making any bizarre Trumpian asides. But it was a classic of the ‘thoughts and prayers’ model in that it offered no promise of a policy response whatsoever. … Near the end of his speech, Trump said that ‘even the most terrible despair can be illuminated by a single ray of hope.’ If your hope was that Washington would start to grapple with a response to the crisis of mass shootings, the President didn’t offer a single ray.” -- David Frum, who was a speechwriter in George W. Bush’s White House, says Trump’s comments were “steeped in hypocrisy”: “He is the least outwardly religious president of modern times, the president least steeped in scripture. For him to offer the consolations of God and faith after mass bloodletting is to invite derision. ‘It is love that defines us,’ said President Trump, and if we weren’t heartbroken, we would laugh. Those who praised the speech, as CNN’s John King did, are reacting on reflex. This is the kind of thing we are used to hearing from Republican politicians; Trump is a Republican politician; therefore this is what he should say… “But whereas Vice President Pence could have pronounced those words with sincerity, or a convincing simulacrum thereof, Donald Trump looked shifty, nervous, and false,” Frum writes in The Atlantic. Speeches are watched as well as heard, and the viewer saw a president who wished he were somewhere else because he had been compelled to pretend something so radically false to his own nature. For once, Trump read the speech exactly as written. Perhaps his aides talked him into it. Because Trump is not a good reader, he read the speech wrong. And because it sounded wrong, he looked bad.” -- POSTPONED: The Daily 202 Live with Mick Mulvaney. My sit-down with the OMB director, which was set for tomorrow, has been postponed.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) GET SMART FAST:​​ Paul Manafort talks to reporters on the floor of the Republican National Convention. (Matt Rourke/AP) THERE’S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Trump associates have given investigators documents showing two previously unreported contacts with Russia during the 2016 campaign. Tom Hamburger, Rosalind S. Helderman and Adam Entous report: “In one case, Trump’s personal attorney and a business associate exchanged emails weeks before the Republican National Convention about traveling to an economic conference in Russia that would be attended by top Russian financial and government leaders, including [Vladimir Putin] … In the other case, the same Trump attorney, Michael Cohen, received a proposal in late 2015 for a Moscow residential project from a company founded by a billionaire who once served in the Russian Senate[.]” -- The Atlantic’s Julia Ioffe and Franklin Foer obtained the full emails exchanged between Manafort and an international intermediary to get a message to Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, which were first reported by The Post. “[T]he full text of these exchanges … shows that Manafort attempted to leverage his leadership role in the Trump campaign to curry favor with a Russian oligarch close to [Putin]. Manafort was deeply in debt, and did not earn a salary from the Trump campaign. There is no evidence that Deripaska met with Manafort in 2016, or knew about Manafort’s attempts to reach him. Yet the extended correspondence between Manafort and [the intermediary] paints a more complete portrait of Manafort’s willingness to trade on his campaign position.” -- The top legal counsel on Robert Mueller’s team, Michael Dreeben, has reportedly been researching the limits of presidential pardons. Bloomberg’s Greg Farrell reports: “Pre-emptive pardons are a distinct possibility now that current and former Trump advisers are under Mueller’s scrutiny. Trump himself has tweeted that everyone agrees the U.S. president has ‘complete power to pardon.’ … [T]he legal territory is largely uncharted over pardons of a president’s own campaign workers, family members or even himself -- and how prosecutors’ work would then be affected. What Dreeben brings to the question, say those who know him, is a credibility that comes from parsing how criminal prosecutions have played out across the country.” -- Freshman Rep. Ron Estes (R-Kan.) booked a basement room in the Capitol for former congressman Connie Mack (R-Fla.) to hold a sham hearing for his Ukrainian lobbying client. The Daily Beast’s Betsy Woodruff and Andrew Desiderio report: “[T]he fake ‘hearing’ was broadcast in full on Ukraine’s NewsOne and described to viewers as the ‘U.S. Congressional Committee on Financial Issues.’ But not a single member of Congress attended. The network teased the ‘shocking details’ about the ‘highest levels of corruption in the NBU,’ referring to the National Bank of Ukraine. … A pamphlet handed out to attendees was evaluated by a Ukrainian fact-checking website as having ‘mostly correct’ data about the NBU but ‘manipulated in almost all occasions.’” Mack lobbies on behalf of Interconnection Commerce — which was implicated in the Pentagon Papers — as well as Hungary’s Putin-allied political party. -- The Senate Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), said that the CIA denied the committee’s request to review information about Russian meddling that has already been seen by the chamber’s intelligence committee.

(European Pressphoto Agency/Nikolsky/Sputnik) MOSCOW IS USING OUR OWN TECH TOOLS  AGAINST US: -- By using Facebook’s powerful “Custom Audience” tool to identify American voters susceptible to propaganda — and then targeting them with messages designed to influence their voting behavior — Russian operatives exploited a system used frequently by U.S. corporations. Elizabeth Dwoskin, Craig Timberg and Adam Entous report: “The Web sites and Facebook pages displayed ads or other messages focused on such hot-button issues as illegal immigration, African American political activism and the rising prominence of Muslims in the United States. The Russian operatives then used a Facebook ‘retargeting’ tool, called Custom Audiences, to send specific ads and messages to voters who had visited those sites.” -- Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said he hopes to make public a sampling of Russia-linked Facebook ads that were turned over to Congress on Monday “as soon as possible.” “The American people deserve to see the ways that the Russian intelligence services manipulated and took advantage of online platforms to stoke and amplify social and political tensions, which remains a tactic we see the Russian government rely on today,” said Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. -- HP Enterprise allowed a Russian defense agency to scrutinize the cyberdefense system used by the Pentagon to guard its computer networks, potentially helping Moscow identify weaknesses in the software. Reuters’s Joel Schectman, Dustin Volz and Jack Stubbs report: “The HPE system, called ArcSight, serves as a cybersecurity nerve center for much of the U.S. military, alerting analysts when it detects that computer systems may have come under attack. ArcSight is also widely used in the private sector. The Russian review of ArcSight’s source code, the closely guarded internal instructions of the software, was part of HPE’s effort to win the certification required to sell the product to Russia’s public sector, according to the regulatory records … Six former U.S. intelligence officials, as well as former ArcSight employees and independent security experts, said the source code review could help Moscow discover weaknesses in the software, potentially helping attackers to blind the U.S. military to a cyber attack.” Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner talk before a joint news conference with Donald Trump and the Lebanese prime minister.

HURRICANE MARIA FALLOUT: -- Trump will visit Puerto Rico today. Arelis Hernández, Dan Lamothe and Joel Achenbach report on how the island’s situation became desperate: “When things went bad during Hurricane Maria, they went bad all at once, across this entire island. Suddenly, everything was dysfunctional, including the power grid, the cellphone towers, the banking system. … The difficulty in responding to Maria has revealed how unique each disaster is — and how resistant to a one-size-fits-all approach. … For Maria, numerous Coast Guard and FEMA urban-search-and-rescue teams were on hand or arrived quickly. But it soon became clear that what people needed most were life-sustaining provisions — including water, food and diesel fuel for generators — that the search-and-rescue teams didn’t have.” -- During his visit, Trump may see San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, his most recent Twitter target. Abby Phillip reports: “[T]he White House seemed to be downplaying his harsh criticism of Cruz, saying she had been invited to participate in the official visit. ‘Look, right now our focus is to bring the mayor into the coordination efforts,’ said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. ‘This administration, as well as other members on the ground, have reached out to her.’ ‘We hope that she will join with us in those efforts and be part of things,’ she added.” -- Meanwhile, the Trump administration is planning to ask Congress for another $10 billion in relief funding. Ed O’Keefe reports: “[O]fficials [in Puerto Rico] and some lawmakers on the mainland are clamoring for legislation that would provide tens of billions of dollars in relief and address Puerto Rico’s long-simmering fiscal crisis, shore up its bankrupt electric company and plug a shortfall in Medicaid funding. … [Carmelo] Ríos, the Puerto Rico Senate’s majority leader, warned that Congress should act quickly. If it doesn’t, he expects 100,000 to 200,000 island residents to relocate, at least temporarily, to the mainland United States in the coming weeks.” -- Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee are proposing to combine $1 billion in extra Medicaid funding to Puerto Rico with the renewal of the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Paige Winfield Cunningham reports: “[The proposal] would be paid for with a bucket of items, including raising Medicare rates for wealthier seniors, redirecting dollars from the Affordable Care Act’s prevention fund and shortening a grace period for enrollees who don’t pay their premiums. … The funding, which would be provided to Puerto Rico over a two-year period, would be part of a package to fund [CHIP], community health centers and other health-care extenders.” -- School districts along the entire East Coast are preparing to take on an influx of new Puerto Rican students as some families leave the island. The Wall Street Journal’s Joseph De Avila and  Arian Campo-Flores report: “The Miami-Dade County school district has enrolled about a dozen Puerto Rican children. ‘I think that number will grow exponentially,’ said Alberto Carvalho, superintendent of Miami-Dade Public Schools. … Boston schools, which have a 42% Hispanic population out of about 57,000 students, are setting up one-stop centers with nonprofit groups where families will be able to enroll students, get language assessments and obtain winter clothing[.] … Officials with New York City schools, the largest district in the U.S., with 1.1 million students, have been meeting regularly to prepare for the arrival of Puerto Rican evacuees[.]” This is a GOP tax plan?

Rand Paul (Ky.) and Bob Corker (Tenn.). Kelsey Snell reports: “Neither Paul nor Corker said he was firmly against the bill, but any GOP split over the tax framework creates a potentially perilous negotiation in the Senate[.] … Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said plans to finance tax cuts by adding to the deficit could be a problem for some Republicans but he is confident that economic growth will more than compensate for short-term losses.” -- Trump is considering an executive order that would trigger a review of the American welfare system. Politico’s Andrew Restuccia reports: “[T]he draft order calls on agencies to review existing regulations and propose new rules that conform to a set of broad welfare principles, including tighter work requirements that encourage recipients to shift back into the labor force … Administration backers of the welfare executive order hope he signs it before Thanksgiving, one of the officials said.

The New York Times’s Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns report: “Democrats here and in Washington believe that their nominee … is the most formidable candidate they have fielded for the Senate in this state in over two decades. … Some in the party believe that they simply cannot write off the South if they expect to regain control of Congress — and that they will never recover here if they abandon high-quality candidates such as Mr. Jones. But the Democratic brand has become so toxic in states such as Alabama that if the national party rallies behind Mr. Jones and turns his candidacy into a liberal cause célèbre, it could only doom him by pushing Republicans reluctant to support Mr. Moore back to their partisan corner. … “But in the eyes of many Democrats, opposing Mr. Moore is as much a moral imperative as a political one. As [David] Axelrod put it, [Moore], who has a decades-long record of making incendiary comments about gays, African-Americans and Muslims, is so offensive to Democrats that it makes him ‘hard to ignore.’ … [James] Carville added, ‘if you can’t run against Roy Moore, then what kind of party you got?’” -- A group of pro-Trump figures is launching a new super PAC seeking to take aim at the Republican establishment.

For every sophisticated operator like Paul Manafort, who has spent a lifetime in the trenches of political warfare … there's also a guy like Mike Flynn Jr. — a pretty average dude swept into a roiling case of monumental importance.

Now the question is whether Rauner can make it through a Republican primary.

Frederic Lemieux,10052017,MarketWatch,09282017,"Published: Oct 3, 2017 3:28 a.m. ET Studies show more guns don’t make you safer and, yes, shootings have become more frequent By America has experienced yet another mass shooting, this time at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on the strip in Las Vegas, Nev. It is reportedly the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. As a criminologist, I have reviewed recent research in hopes of debunking some of the common misconceptions I hear creeping into discussions that spring up whenever a mass shooting occurs. A study I conducted on mass shootings indicated that this phenomenon is not limited to the United States. Mass shootings also took place in 25 other wealthy nations between 1983 and 2013, but the number of mass shootings in the United States far surpasses that of any other country included in the study during the same period of time. The U.S. had 78 mass shootings during that 30-year period. The highest number of mass shootings experienced outside the United States was in Germany — where seven shootings occurred. In the other 24 industrialized countries taken together, 41 mass shootings took place. In other words, the U.S. had nearly double the number of mass shootings than all other 24 countries combined in the same 30-year period. Another significant finding is that mass shootings and gun ownership rates are highly correlated. The higher the gun ownership rate, the more a country is susceptible to experiencing mass shooting incidents. This association remains high even when the number of incidents from the United States is withdrawn from the analysis. Similar results have been found by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime, which states that countries with higher levels of firearm ownership also have higher firearm homicide rates. My study also shows a strong correlation between mass shooting casualties and overall death by firearms rates. However, in this last analysis, the relation seems to be mainly driven by the very high number of deaths by firearms in the United States. The relation disappears when the United States is withdrawn from the analysis. A recent study published by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center shows that the frequency of mass shooting is increasing over time. The researchers measured the increase by calculating the time between the occurrence of mass shootings. According to the research, the days separating mass shooting occurrence went from on average 200 days during the period of 1983 to 2011 to 64 days since 2011. What is most alarming with mass shootings is the fact that this increasing trend is moving in the opposite direction of overall intentional homicide rates in the U.S., which decreased by almost 50% since 1993 and in Europe where intentional homicides decreased by 40% between 2003 and 2013. Read: These are the 10 deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history Due to the Second Amendment, the United States has permissive gun licensing laws. This is in contrast to most developed countries, which have restrictive laws. According to a seminal work by criminologists George Newton and Franklin Zimring, permissive gun licensing laws refer to a system in which all but specially prohibited groups of persons can purchase a firearm. In such a system, an individual does not have to justify purchasing a weapon; rather, the licensing authority has the burden of proof to deny gun acquisition. By contrast, restrictive gun licensing laws refer to a system in which individuals who want to purchase firearms must demonstrate to a licensing authority that they have valid reasons to get a gun — like using it on a shooting range or going hunting — and that they demonstrate “good character.” The type of gun law adopted has important impacts. Countries with more restrictive gun licensing laws show fewer deaths by firearms and a lower gun ownership rate. Read: Country guitarist, lifelong 2nd Amendment supporter: ‘I can’t express how wrong I was’ In most restrictive background checks performed in developed countries, citizens are required to train for gun handling, obtain a license for hunting or provide proof of membership to a shooting range. Individuals must prove that they do not belong to any “prohibited group,” such as the mentally ill, criminals, children or those at high risk of committing violent crime, such as individuals with a police record of threatening the life of another. Here’s the bottom line. With these provisions, most U.S. active shooters would have been denied the purchase of a firearm. Read: After Las Vegas shooting, here are 5 things harder to buy than guns Journalists sometimes describe mass shooting as a form of domestic terrorism. This connection may be misleading. There is no doubt that mass shootings are “terrifying” and “terrorize” the community where they have happened. However, not all active shooters involved in mass shooting have a political message or cause. For example, the church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina in June 2015 was a hate crime but was not judged by the federal government to be a terrorist act. The majority of active shooters are linked to mental health issues, bullying and disgruntled employees. Active shooters may be motivated by a variety of personal or political motivations, usually not aimed at weakening government legitimacy. Frequent motivations are revenge or a quest for power. Beginning in 2008, the FBI used a narrow definition of mass shootings. They limited mass shootings to incidents where an individual — or in rare circumstances, more than one — “kills four or more people in a single incident (not including the shooter), typically in a single location.” In 2013, the FBI changed its definition, moving away from “mass shootings” toward identifying an “active shooter” as “an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area.” This change means the agency now includes incidents in which fewer than four people die, but in which several are injured, like this 2014 shooting in New Orleans. This change in definition impacted directly the number of cases included in studies and affected the comparability of studies conducted before and after 2013. Some researchers on mass shooting, like Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox, have even incorporated in their studies several types of multiple homicides that cannot be defined as mass shooting: for instance, familicide (a form of domestic violence) and gang murders. In the case of familicide, victims are exclusively family members and not random bystanders. Gang murders are usually crime for profit or a punishment for rival gangs or a member of the gang who is an informer. Such homicides don’t belong in the analysis of mass shootings.

After a House vote, the Senate approved a budget bill on Thursday. Republicans passed tax cuts through what is known as budget reconciliation, which requires just a simple majority in the Senate. Republicans currently control the Senate with 52 seats. A persistent uptrend for stocks have been partially underpinned by the hope of tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump, with a likelihood of the passage of a pro-business tax policy often propelling buying in assets perceived as risky. What are strategists saying? • “Up until a week ago there has been a lot of pessimism among investors that the Trump administration cannot pass any tax reforms, especially after the failure to repeal the [Affordable Healthcare Act]. But that seems to have changed last week, when the [Big Six] outlined their tax plan and more people now believe companies’ earnings will be boosted by lower tax rates,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated investors. The so-called Big Six includes the leaders of the House and Senate, national economic director Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. • “The path of least resistance for markets seems to be higher. Revisions on the earnings front have been positive, the global growth theme is continuing, and I think valuations are fine, given where we are in terms of inflation,” said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. “There are no classic signs of exuberance that would derail the market’s trajectory, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see multiples and earnings go higher, absent some crazy macro shock that no one can forecast.” See: Some investors see signs stock market ‘on verge’ of a melt-up Which stocks are in focus?

 ,10052017,MarketWatch,09282017,"Keep Me Logged In Oil prices were in retreat on Monday following a big surge into the end of the third quarter, but Citigroup's Ed Morse still has faith the market can keep rallying. ""We think it's for real,"" the global head of commodities research told CNBC on Monday. ""We're in the middle of a bit of a sell-off, maybe even testing the $50 level for WTI, but the sell-off is profit-taking more than anything else, and the momentum in the physical markets, joined by the momentum in the financial markets, really point to a higher price between now and the end of the year."" On Monday, WTI fell towards $50 a barrel, while Brent slipped below $56. Citigroup's forecasts call for U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude of $54 a barrel for the fourth quarter, and $58 a barrel for Brent crude, the international benchmark. That would mark a divergence from the historical trend. U.S. crude oil more often than not falls in the final three months of the year, according to a study performed by CNBC using hedge fund analytics tool Kensho. U.S. WTI year-to-date performance, source: FactSet Energy markets are going to be ""in the driver's seat"" for the rest of the year after metals and other commodities led the rally in the first two months of the third quarter, Morse said. Commodities closely linked to China's economy are now ceding the way to the oil market, where the market is tightening after three years of oversupply, he said.Crude stockpiles in the OECD, a group of mostly developed countries, have recently fallen toward the five-year average as OPEC, Russia and other oil producers cut production to drain a global glut. They stood about 190 million barrels above that level in July, according to the International Energy Agency.""We're seeing inventories draw,"" Morse said. ""Finally, the market is recognizing that these draws in inventories of products and crude oil combined are for real and they're going to last through the end of the year. Maybe next year is a different story, but this year looks quite positive from now until the end of December.""As for natural gas, Morse said Citigroup would not be surprised to see prices at $3.70 per million British thermal unit by the end of winter. The current price is $2.91 per mmBtu. Natural gas prices rise in the winter as heating demand rises.Henry Hub natural gas 1-year performance, source: FactSetAfter that, it depends on when pipelines are completed to alleviate takeaway constraints in key producing regions like Appalachia's Marcellus Shale and the Permian Basin in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico.""We don't see much in the way of incremental pipeline, particularly from the northeast, coming into the market until late in 2018, so we think we're in a relatively tight position until then,"" he said.

A recent Reuters poll revealed that output among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries rose by 50,000 barrels a day in September as the cartel’s overall compliance with its supply-cut deal fell to 86%. Several countries such as Saudi Arabia and Angola bore the brunt of the cuts while other countries such as United Arab Emirates, Ecuador and Iraq engaged in a bit of free riding, only complying by 30%, say analysts. “Weak production discipline within OPEC and the cut exemptions for Libya and Nigeria should mean in our view that closely observed OECD stocks will not fall quite as quickly as expected,” said Commerzbank analysts in a recent report. A resurgent dollar also took a toll, with the ICE U.S. Dollar Index

As oil is priced in dollars, it becomes more expensive for holders of other currencies as the greenback strengthens. “It is not surprising to see some investors taking the chips off the table especially given the stronger dollar and possible higher U.S. oil production going forward and definitely OPEC’s production increases as well,” said Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank. Recently oil had been gaining based on newfound optimism about OPEC’s ongoing effort to rebalance the market and eliminate about 2% of global supply with the help of external producers such as Russia. Oil producers at an OPEC-led meeting last month said the countries participating in the production-cut agreement, which include members as well as nonmembers of OPEC, reached record monthly compliance of 116% with the pact in August. However, on Friday in the U.S., which isn’t part of the agreement, Baker Hughes

Alessandra Malito,10052017,MarketWatch,09282017,"Published: Oct 2, 2017 1:13 p.m. ET There are 7,000 flavors available for e-cigarettes, but all but one are banned for traditional cigarettes By E-cigarettes come in more than 7,000 flavors. By comparison, traditional cigarettes only come in one of those — menthol. What would happen if regulators were to ban flavors in e-cigarettes? • If the Food and Drug Administration banned the flavors in e-cigarettes but allowed them in traditional, or combustible, cigarettes, e-cigarette use would decline by more than 10% • If menthol in traditional cigarettes were banned, there would be a 4.8% reduction and most smokers would shift to e-cigarettes, while others said they would quit smoking altogether • Banning e-cigarette flavors could turn smokers toward traditional cigarettes, an adverse public health effect given that their use has been shown to cause cancer That’s according to new research by from Yale School of Public Health and the Centre for Health Policy at the Imperial College in London, and distributed by the National Bureau of Economic Research. They conducted an experiment with more than 2,000 adult smokers and recent quitters. “Our results are timely and policy-relevant, suggesting which flavor bans are likely to be most effective in protecting public health,” the researchers wrote. Also see: Americans in this state are the biggest users of e-cigarettes What are the effects of e-cigarettes on smokers? E-cigarettes are considered less harmful than traditional cigarettes, though there are still risks associated with them. They have less nicotine (about 5% the amount of a traditional cigarette), but could still lead to addiction, mood swings and lack of attention, according to the U.S. Surgeon General. In May 2016, the FDA requested a ban on e-cigarette flavors until it could review their impact, but the White House Office of Management and Budget denied it. See also:  Are e-cigarettes a healthy way to quit smoking? Who are the people smoking e-cigarettes? Still, young smokers may be attracted to flavored e-cigarettes, which could become a gateway to traditional cigarettes.That’s one reason they’re being looked at closely by regulators. In some instances, an increase in e-cigarette laws has pushed young people to smoke traditional cigarettes, because they’re unable to obtain electronic ones. Most states have a minimum age of 18 for tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, but in some localities, it is 21. Beginning in 2010, when states began instating e-cigarette laws, youth participation in traditional cigarette smoking jumped 1.4 percentage points, up from 0.7, according to another research report. What is the current regulation for e-cigarettes? Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration announced a proposal to lower nicotine levels to non-addictive levels in traditional cigarettes and examine the effect of flavors, including menthol, on attracting smokers to such tobacco products. Some cities already have bans on flavors for e-cigarettes and combustibles, including Berkeley, Calif., Chicago, New York, Boston and Minneapolis.

On a headline basis, each of the big three benchmarks has taken flight — reaching uncharted territory — while even the formerly lagging small- and mid-cap benchmarks have concurrently registered all-time highs.

                                    hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has taken flight, extending its break to record territory. Tactically, last week’s close (2,519) marks an inflection point — matching the third-quarter close — and is followed by a firmer floor matching the 2,508 breakout point. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has broken out. Consider that it concluded the third quarter (Friday) just seven points under a record close, and has taken flight to start the fourth quarter. The breakout point, circa 22,420, pivots to first support. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has also reached uncharted territory, notching its first close atop the 6,500 mark. Tactically, near-term support (6,477) is followed by a firmer floor matching the July peak, an area also illustrated below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has extended its break to record territory. Recent strength comes from a tight one-month range, and punctuates a successful test of major support. (The late-September low held at 6,343.9.) A near- to intermediate-term target continues to project to the 6,580 area, as detailed last week. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has also reached record territory, notching its first close atop the 22,500 mark. Near-term support matches the breakout point (22,419) and is followed by the former range bottom, circa 22,220. Both areas are better illustrated on the hourly chart. Conversely, a near-term target projects to the 22,620-to-22,636 area. (Take the Dow’s former record close minus the August low: 22,118 - 21,600 = 518 points. Then, add to the breakout point: 22,118 + 518 = 22,636.) Similarly, the S&P 500 has extended its strong 2017 uptrend. The prevailing upturn punctuates a bull flag pinned to the early-September breakout. Broadly speaking, U.S. stocks are off to a strong fourth-quarter start. Each widely-tracked U.S. benchmark has reached all-time highs — also known as uncharted territory, capped by limited resistance — on the fourth quarter’s first session. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF

                                   has truly taken flight. Consider that the small-cap benchmark has notched seven straight record closes, though the breakout has accelerated across the prior four sessions. In the process, the IWM is near-term extended, and due to consolidate, though the directionally steep spike is longer-term bullish. The prevailing upturn constitutes follow-through on the late-2016 rally, illustrated on the three-year chart. Tactically, near-term support is poorly-defined, until established, though the breakout point, circa 145.25, remains the first notable floor. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has belatedly broken out, reaching record territory this week. Here again, the breakout point, circa 326.40, pivots to first support. Against this backdrop, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 has extended its uptrend, reaching record territory to conclude the third quarter (Friday) and to start the fourth quarter (Monday). The prevailing leg higher punctuates a successful test of the 248 breakout point, nearly to the decimal. Collectively, an already firmly-grounded bull trend continues to broaden. Each widely-tracked U.S. benchmark has reached all-time highs against a persistently rotational sub-sector backdrop, partly detailed last week. In a related vein, the Russell 2000’s decisive breakout, and subsequent mid-cap follow-through, this week, strengthen the bull case. Tactically, an intermediate-term S&P 500 target continues to project to the 2,550 area. Conversely, the former range top (2,508) pivots to near-term support, and is followed by a firmer floor matching the 2,480 breakout point, and the 50-day moving average, currently 2,475. The S&P’s intermediate-term uptrend is firmly intact barring a violation. See also: Nasdaq’s FAANG-fueled downturn masks otherwise healthy sector rotation. The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names — sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. Initially profiled Sept. 13, and revisited last week, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF is acting well technically. As illustrated, the group is challenging a four-month range top closely matching the 200-day moving average, currently 41.75. Recent strength punctuates a successful test of trendline support. Underlying the upturn, the group’s relative strength index (not illustrated) has recently registered a year-to-date peak, improving the chances of eventual follow-through. Separately, the recent price action — the tight four-session range, matching resistance — is constructive, laying the groundwork for a potential breakout. (Notice the 50-day moving average has also ticked higher, consistent with an intermediate-term trend shift.)

The rally places the shares at 16-year highs, their best level since November 2000. Though near-term extended, the former range top matched major resistance — illustrated on the five-year chart — opening the path to potentially material longer-term follow-through.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s government responded by calling on Catalonia to “return to the path of law” first before any negotiations. Mireia Boya, a Catalan lawmaker from the pro-independence Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP) party, said a declaration of independence would follow a parliamentary session on Monday to evaluate the results of the Oct. 1 vote to break away. “We know that there may be disbarments, arrests … But we are prepared, and in no case will it be stopped,” she said on Twitter. Puigdemont told the BBC he would ask the region’s parliament to declare independence following the referendum, which Spain’s government and constitutional court say was illegal and in which only a minority of Catalans voted. In a televised address on Wednesday night, Puigdemont said: “This moment calls for mediation. We have received various offers in the last hours and we will receive more.” Without specifically mentioning plans for an independence declaration, he added: ”I am sure that in the next few days we will show the best of our country when the institutions of Catalonia will have to apply the results of the referendum. “Today we are closer than yesterday to our historic wish.” Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s government replied that Puigdemont had wasted an opportunity to put Catalonia back on a legal course. “If Mr. Puigdemont wants to talk or negotiate, or wants to send mediators, he knows perfectly well what he must do first: Return to the path of the law,” it said in a statement. Participants in the referendum opted overwhelmingly for independence, but turnout was only about 43 percent as Catalans who favor remaining part of Spain mainly boycotted the ballot. Spain was only restored to democracy following the death in 1975 of military dictator Francisco Franco, under whom the Catalan language and traditions were suppressed.

Barbara Kollmeyer,10052017,MarketWatch,09282017,"Published: Oct 1, 2017 7:22 p.m. ET Early results show 90% support for independence in contested referendum By MADRID (MarketWatch) — Battle lines were being drawn on Sunday in Spain, as chaotic scenes emerged with hundreds reported injured after a banned independence vote in a wealthy northeastern region of the country whose heart is the city of Barcelona. Some in Catalonia, or Catalunya in the Catalan language, had spent Saturday night at one of the more than 2,000 schools that had been set up as polling stations in the region. But by early Sunday, it was clear that the Spanish government was as determined to stop the voting as those voters were to follow through with the referendum. Clashes persisted throughout the day. Late Sunday, Catalan officials said preliminary results showed 90% of voters approved independence. Read:  Catalonia leader: With 90% approval, ‘we have the right’ to be independent In recent days the government has sent in thousands of extra police, seized ballot boxes, arrested officials and shut down relevant websites. The defiant Catalan government on Sunday attempted to facilitate voting by allowing a ballot to be cast at any available polling station, using even blank pieces of paper instead of preprinted ballots. The regional government has said it will declare independence if a “yes” majority emerges from the 5.4 million eligible voters. About 2.3 million people cast ballots, the Catalan government said late Sunday, about a 42% turnout.

Hundreds injured, angry local politicians speak out By Sunday evening the number of reported injured had climbed to 844 as a result of clashes with the police, according to the region’s Health Department. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau called for an immediate halt to police operations in the region, saying it was “completely unacceptable for the police to be thrown at a populace,” in an interview posted on her Twitter account. She added that Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy was a “coward” who was “hiding behind thousands of police,” and called for him to resign immediately.

There were reports that the national police had taken over in some places from the regional police, amid complaints that the latter weren’t doing enough to uphold order and stop the vote, which had been formally suspended by the Spanish Constitutional Court.

Today everything changed and I voted in fear :_( #CatalanReferendum Spanish government defends actions, as pro-unity protestors shout ‘Spain never divided’ For its part, Spain’s Interior Ministry reported nine police officers injured and two Civil Guard — a military force that is charged with police duties — officers injured. The ministry tweeted several images, such as this one of rocks being hurled at the Civil Guard: Continúa la violencia contra los agentes. @guardiacivil se retira expeditivamente bajo una lluvia de piedras lanzadas en grupo#EstamosporTI pic.twitter.com/wQsL5hMsL1 Encapuchados lanzan objetos a la @policia en Barcelona. Los agentes se retiran tras haber cumplido la orden judicial#EstamosporTI pic.twitter.com/7iswuhRNpS In a televised address, Rajoy blamed the Catalan government for not obeying the law that said the vote should not take place “I understand that some Catalans may feel frustrated and I regret that. The Catalan government tricked them into taking part” in the vote, he said on his Twitter account.: Ferits durant el #referèndum de #1OCT  a Catalunya (19.30h) #CatalanReferendum pic.twitter.com/slGsQGQMuW Rajoy reportedly fielded one call from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, amid reports of rising injuries as other politicians across Europe made pleas for the violence to stop: German Chancellor Merkel holds phone call with Spanish PM Rajoy as Catalan govt says 465 people injured by police forces. Police violence against citizens in #Catalonia is shocking. The Spanish government must act to end it now. The euro moved lower as Asian trading got under way, falling against the dollar to $1.1791 from $1.1814’s closing level on Friday in New York, but recovered somewhat to $1.1801. Meanwhile in Madrid, home of the central government, Spanish-flag-waving residents gathered to protest the vote early in the day and support Spanish unity, massing in Plaza Mayor and then in the nearby square Puerta del Sol, blocking the street leading up to the plaza, chanting “Spain, united, never divided” and “Viva España” (long live Spain), and cheering passing police vans. ‘Yo soy español ‘ ‘espana unida nunca divida’ in Puerta Sol Madrid now #cataloniareferendum pic.twitter.com/k7Xk4bpThY “We are fed up,” said Maria Dolores Mateo, 68, a native of the Canary Islands, told MarketWatch. “Rajoy is right to do what he’s doing, but he can’t do it with force. He has to do with law, because if something happens the independents are the victims, and that’s what they want,” she said referring to the Catalans seeking the vote. As for the scenes up north, Mateo said she has been watching media reports and saw things getting “completely crazy and out of hand.” And that, she said, serves no purpose for anyone. Echoes of the past For some, the scenes in Barcelona and elsewhere brought up memories of repression in the region under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. The Catalan region was for the Republic during the Civil War, which was defeated in the late 1930s by Franco’s Falangist forces. Franco banned the Catalan language from public places and from being taught in schools, and there was no separate Catalan government. The police action Sunday appeared to open some old wounds. Emotional scenes. Older people weeping because they say they are reminded of the days of Franco #catalanreferendum https://t.co/oMxsWy0TH4 As an American who loves Spain with all her heart, I'm really concerned. Has Franco returned? Wtf? One of those present at the demonstrations earlier in Madrid, José Sánchez, 68, from the nearby town of Guadalajara, said he had turned up to “defend Spain and defend my country. They are cowards. They have used children as human shields,” he said of those seeking independence in Catalonia. There were reports of entire families, including children, sleeping at polling stations the night before the vote to prevent closures by the police. “I have friends in Catalonia, many who defend Spanish unity,” Sánchez said. “I hope that everything gets fixed peacefully.” Later in the evening, a very different protest took place in Madrid’s Sol plaza, where hundreds gathered, sang and chanted in protest of events that took place in Catalonia and in support of the region’s right to hold a referendum. It was a more tense affair with significantly more riot police presence, and cars, buses and taxis forcing their way through the crowds. At one point the crowd vented their fury at the police, who created a wide space in the plaza to prevent a separate crowd of anti-independence protestors from moving forward. Among those present was 31-year-old Juan Carlos of Segovia, but who lives in Madrid. He explained that half his family is in Catalonia and half were for the vote and half against. “The reason we are all here filling the Sol plaza is because we want to show the world and the Catalan people that we are in support of the right to vote,” he said.

 ,10052017,MarketWatch,09282017,"Keep Me Logged In U.S. stocks closed mostly lower on Friday after data showed the labor market experienced its first contraction in seven years. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.72 points to close at 22,773.67, with Chevron and Boeing contributing the most to the losses. The index also snapped a seven-day winning streak. The S&P 500 declined 0.1 percent to 2,549.33, with consumer staples and telecommunications leading decliners. The index also snapped an eight-day winning streak — its longest in four years — and also ended a streak of six straigh record closes, the longest such streak since 1997. The Nasdaq composite eked out a record high, rising 0.07 percent to 6,590.18. The U.S. lost 33,000 jobs September due in large part to two major hurricanes hitting the country. Last month markets the first time the U.S. labor market contracted since 2010. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a gain of 90,000 jobs. Despite the weak headline number, average hourly earnings rose to an annualized rate of 2.9 percent. Hourly earnings are closely watched by investors looking for indications on inflation. The unemployment rate also fell to a 16-year low of 4.2 percent. ""Trying to guess the headline number on this one was a fool's game,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. The report ""looks pretty sloppy from the top, but there's more good news than bad."" Treasury yields jumped after the report's release. The benchmark 10-year yield advanced to 2.362 percent, while the two-year yield rose to 1.51 percent, notching its highest level since 2008. ""Everyone knew the report would be confusing because of the distortions from [hurricanes] Harvey and Irma,"" said Richard Piccirillo, managing director at PGIM Fixed Income. ""But despite the distortions, average hourly earnings went down and unemployment went down. I think the bond market is reacting a bit to that."" The strong wages data also increases the chances of a Federal Reserve rate hike by December, according to Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank. ""Over the past few months, they've reopened the path for another rate hike,"" he said. From before the central bank's previous meeting [to today], the odds of a rate hike have risen from about 30 percent to 80 percent."" Stocks were coming off yet another record-setting session. The S&P 500 posted its sixth straight all-time closing high on Thursday, marking its longest streak of record closes since 1997. The Dow and Nasdaq also notched record highs. The major indexes also posted strong weekly gains, rising more than 1 percent. Sentiment on Wall Street has been lifted lately by strong economic data and renewed hope of tax reform. The ISM manufacturing and nonmanufacturing numbers released earlier this week hit multi-year highs. Meanwhile, the House passed a $4.1 trillion budget on Thursday, which marked the first concrete step toward enacting tax reform.""We've seen this reflation trade and that's correlated with tax reform,"" said Jeff Zipper, managing director of investments at the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank.

 ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"A federal judge has tossed out a U.S. government lawsuit accusing UnitedHealth Group of overcharging Medicare. The case is one of two whistleblower lawsuits alleging similar conduct. In one, the government says wrongful payments to UnitedHealth exceed $1 billion. The U.S. Department of Justice contends the big health insurer violated the federal False Claims Act so it could collect more money in Medicare reimbursements. The Medicare Advantage program pays insurers based on a person's health status: less for healthy enrollees, but more for people who are less well. The goal is to ensure insurers accept people who are sicker and likely to incur greater medical costs. The government accuses UnitedHealth of gaming the system and overstating patients' health risks. ""United violated the FCA by conducting biased, one-sided medical record reviews, thereby distorting the information it provided to the Medicare Program about the health status of Medicare beneficiaries in order to obtain payments to which it was not entitled from the Medicare Program."" But a federal judge in California overseeing one case says the government fell short on several points. Judge John F. Walter said the Justice Department failed to identify corporate officers who had vouched for the data's accuracy, or that corporate officers knew or should have known the records were false. The judge also said prosecutors had not shown the government would have denied payments if it had been aware of the purported misconduct. However Walter ruled the department can amend its complaint.

 ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"(Reuters) - A federal judge has tossed a lawsuit by the U.S. government claiming UnitedHealth Group Inc obtained inflated payments from the government based on inaccurate information about the health status of patients enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. But Thursday’s ruling by U.S. District Judge John Walter in Los Angeles said the Department of Justice (DOJ) could try to amend its allegations to shore up some of the failings contained in a complaint filed in May against the insurer. Walter said the lawsuit had failed to identify any corporate officers who signed documents stating that data submitted to the Medicare program was accurate or allege any of those individuals knew the information was false. He also said the lawsuit claimed the alleged violations were material only in a “conclusory” manner and had not shown the government would have refused to make payments to UnitedHealth had it known about the conduct. UnitedHealth declined to comment on the lawsuit on Friday. The DOJ, which has until Oct. 13 to amend its complaint, had no immediate comment. The ruling marked a setback for the DOJ after it earlier this year intervened in two separate whistleblower lawsuits against UnitedHealth involving Medicare Advantage filed under the False Claims Act. Medicare Advantage, an alternative to the standard fee-for-service Medicare in which private insurers manage health benefits, is the fastest growing form of government healthcare, with enrollment of 18 million people last year. The lawsuit said that since at least 2005, UnitedHealth knew many of the diagnosis codes it submitted to the Medicare program for increased payments based on “risk” factors like health status were not supported by patients’ medical records. But the company turned a blind eye, the lawsuit said, funding and encouraging one-sided chart reviews of patients of HealthCare Partners, which provided services to UnitedHealth beneficiaries in California. As a result, UnitedHealth was able to wrongfully retain risk adjustment payments it received from the government, the lawsuit said. The complaint was filed in May after the DOJ partially intervened in a whistleblower lawsuit brought by James Swoben, a former employee of Senior Care Action Network Health Plan and a consultant to the risk adjustment industry. The DOJ later that month filed a second lawsuit accusing UnitedHealth of obtaining over $1 billion from Medicare to which it was not entitled. The case is U.S. ex rel Swoben v.

 ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he likely will sign an order this week that is expected to allow Americans to buy stripped-down health insurance policies, a step some experts say would further undermine the Obamacare law that Trump opposes. Unable to win passage of legislation to dismantle the 2010 law in a Congress led by his own party, Trump indicated he would take unilateral action. He offered few specifics beyond saying his action would let people cross state lines to obtain “great, competitive healthcare” costing the United States “nothing.” The expected order would allow small businesses and individuals to band together as associations to buy health insurance plans that would be exempt from some Obamacare requirements. These include mandatory coverage for 10 essential health benefits such as maternity and newborn care, prescription drugs and mental health treatment. It would also expand the amount of time people can use short-term medical insurance plans, which are cheaper than traditional plans but cover a limited set of benefits. People could use those plans for up to a year, compared to three months under current law. “I’ll also be signing something, probably this week, which is going to go a long way to take care of many of the people that have been so badly hurt on healthcare,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “With Congress the way it is, I decided to take it upon myself,” Trump added, saying the plan is “largely worked out.” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump will make his announcement “by the end of Friday.” Trump said his action would let insurers sell across state lines. The association health plans, for instance, could be sold from a state with fewer benefit requirements. Such insurance policies could be cheaper than those that provide the full range of medical coverage required under Obamacare, potentially making them attractive to people in other states. It is unclear when these plans would become available. It is unlikely consumers could sign up for these plans during the 2018 open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1. Experts questioned Trump’s authority to issue such an order that would exempt some plans but not others from Obamacare rules rather than pursuing the changes through legislation. The action could open Trump to legal challenges from Democratic state attorneys general, who have said they will sue Trump if he tries to destroy Obamacare. The plans allowed under the order could lure young and healthy people away from the individual insurance markets created by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare. That could further destabilize those markets, where insurers have already exited the markets altogether, pared back offerings or hiked premiums because of uncertainty caused by the Trump administration. Experts said Trump’s plan could leave behind only the sickest people in the Obamacare markets, raising premiums and effectively eroding the law’s protection that people with pre-existing medical conditions cannot be charged more. “There’s a general belief that at every turn the federal government is going to create regulations to hurt rather than help the markets,” said Craig Garthwaite, director of the healthcare program at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, referring to the Trump administration. “It unwinds the ability of people with pre-existing conditions to get insurance under the ACA,” Garthwaite said. Republicans have failed to make good on their seven-year promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, the signature domestic policy achievement of Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. Gutting Obamacare was a top Trump campaign promise. Trump, who has called the law a failure and vowed to let it “implode,” has undermined Obamacare through regulatory and administrative actions. Last week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a rule that will let businesses and non-profit organizations lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law’s mandate that employers provide birth control for women in health insurance with no co-payment. Trump has declined to commit to making payments guaranteed to insurers under Obamacare. The payments are estimated to be about $7 billion this year and help lower out-of-pocket medical costs for low-income consumers. Insurers have cited that uncertainty in exiting insurance markets or hiking premiums. His administration has slashed the Obamacare advertising budget, halved the open enrollment period and cut funding to groups that help sign people up for insurance under the law. ","

 ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran promised on Monday to give a “crushing” response if the United States designated its elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group. The pledge came a week before President Donald Trump announces a final decision on how he wants to contain the Islamic Republic. He is expected on Oct. 15 to “decertify” a landmark 2015 international deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program, a step that by itself stops short of pulling out of the agreement but gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, as he rolls out a broader, more hawkish U.S. strategy on Iran. “We are hopeful that the United States does not make this strategic mistake,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA. “If they do, Iran’s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing and the United States should bear all its consequences,” he told a news conference reported by IRNA. Individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are already on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not. IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Sunday, “If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.” Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end chances for future dialogue with the United States and that the Americans would have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km (1,250 mile) range of IRGC’s missiles. U.S. sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington both support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group (IS). France said on Monday it was worried that classifying the IRGC as a terrorist group could exacerbate tensions in the region. Germany said it was worried Trump would decide Iran is not respecting the nuclear deal, negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and fears such a step will worsen insecurity in the Middle East. A U.S. pullout could unravel an accord seen by supporters as vital to preventing a Middle East arms race and tamping down regional tensions, since it limits Iran’s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear fuel in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that damaged its oil-based economy. The U.N. nuclear watchdog’s inspectors have repeatedly declared Iran in compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal. Trump called Iran “a corrupt dictatorship” during his first speech to the U.N. General Assembly and said the nuclear deal was “the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into”. The other five world powers in the deal were Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. The prospect of the United States reneging on the agreement has worried other partners that helped negotiate it. The Kremlin said that any U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal would have “negative consequences.” British Prime Minister Theresa May, who supports the nuclear pact, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes it, agreed in a phone call on Monday that they need to be “clear-eyed” about the threat Iran poses to the Middle East. “They agreed that ... the international community should continue working together to push back against Iran’s destabilizing regional activity,” May’s spokesman said. Despite the nuclear deal, Washington still maintains its own more limited sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and over accusations Tehran supports terrorism. Iran says it is developing missiles solely for defensive purposes and denies involvement in terrorism. The Trump administration aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over recent missile tests and what Washington has called its “malign activities” across the Middle East. The U.S. government imposed sanctions in July on 18 entities and people for supporting the IRGC in developing drones and military equipment. In August, Congress overwhelmingly approved the “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” which imposed new sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program, as well as sanctions on Russia and North Korea. In an interview aired on Saturday night, Trump accused Iran of “funding North Korea” and “doing things with North Korea that are totally inappropriate”. Qasemi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, said the U.S. accusations were “baseless”. He added, “Israel and some specific countries are raising these accusations to create Iranophobia.” ","

 ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday undermined requirements under the Obamacare law that employers provide insurance to cover women’s birth control, keeping a campaign pledge that pleased his conservative Christian supporters. New rules from the Department of Health and Human Services will let businesses or non-profit organizations lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law’s mandate that employers provide contraceptives coverage in health insurance with no co-payment. Conservative Christian activists and congressional Republicans praised the move, while reproductive rights advocates and Democrats criticized it. It was unclear how many employers would actually drop birth control coverage on religious grounds, and there were significant doubts that many big ones would. Within hours, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the administration in federal court in San Francisco to try to halt the rule, claiming among other things that it violated the U.S. Constitution’s requirement for separation of church and state. The states of Massachusetts and California also sued, and Democratic state attorneys general in another 16 states threatened legal action. “This is a landmark day for religious liberty. Under the Obama administration, this constitutional right was seriously eroded,” Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said. “The Trump administration just took direct aim at birth control coverage for 62 million women,” Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards said. “With this rule in place, any employer could decide that their employees no longer have health insurance coverage for birth control,” Richards added. Trump, who criticized the birth control mandate in last year’s election campaign, won strong support from conservative Christian voters. The Republican president signed an executive order in May asking for rules that would allow faith-based groups to deny insurance coverage for services they oppose on religious grounds. The contraception mandate was implemented as part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement. Trump and Republicans in Congress campaigned against Obamacare, as the law is known, but could not get enough votes to repeal it as they had promised. In its reasoning for the move, the administration said among other things that mandating birth control coverage could foster “risky sexual behavior” among teens and young adults. It overturned the Obama administration’s view that the birth control requirement was necessary to meet the government’s “compelling interest” to protect women’s health. “This administration’s contempt for women reaches a new low with this appalling decision,” top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi said. The administration broadened narrow existing religious exemptions to include an exception “on the basis of moral conviction” for non-profit and for-profit companies. Federal rules implemented under Obamacare required employers to provide health insurance that covers birth control, but religious houses of worship were exempted. Some private businesses sued regarding their rights to circumvent such coverage, and the Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that they could object on religious grounds. Case Western Reserve University School of Law professor Jonathan Adler said it was unlikely publicly traded companies would seek exemptions. “Why would a publicly traded company risk alienating potential shareholders by taking such a step?” Adler said. Ellen Kelsay, chief strategy officer at the National Business Group on Health, a lobbying group for large companies, said, “Most large employers have provided coverage for birth control prior to any mandates and we expect most will continue to do so irrespective of any exemptions that may become available.” According to one estimate, only 3 percent of nonprofit groups offering health benefits have objected to contraceptives coverage. “HHS has issued a balanced rule that respects all sides - it keeps the contraceptive mandate in place for most employers and now provides a religious exemption,” said Mark Rienzi, one of the lawyers for the Little Sisters of the Poor. The order of Roman Catholic nuns, which runs care homes for the elderly, had challenged the mandate in court. The Little Sisters and other Christian nonprofit employers objected to a 2013 compromise offered by the Obama administration that allowed entities opposed to providing contraception insurance coverage to comply with the law without actually paying for the required coverage. The Justice Department released two memos that will serve as the government’s legal basis for justifying the rule and laying out a framework for how apply religious liberty issues in legal opinions, federal rules and grant making. In another decision popular with Trump’s evangelical supporters, the Justice Department on Wednesday reversed federal policy and declared that federal law banning sex discrimination in the workplace does not protect transgender employees. Trump also has removed protections for transgender students and moved to ban transgender people from the military. Trump’s support among evangelical voters, a major force in his 2016 election victory, remains strong, but has been slipping in line with his overall approval ratings, according to recent Reuters/Ipsos poll results.

 ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The United States needs its own set of long-term goals for addressing such issues as climate change and hunger like those enacted by the United Nations, said a group on Monday as it launched a bid to elect candidates who back such an agenda. The group Future Now will solicit and support state-level legislative candidates to sign onto its list of goals to be achieved by 2030, the group told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The list is a tailored U.S.-version of the 17 U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a global “to-do” list approved in 2015 by the 193 U.N. members. Among the SDGs for 2030 are reducing conflict, promoting gender equality and sustainable energy and tackling climate change, education, hunger, joblessness and other issues. America’s Goals are meant to be a non-partisan guiding framework to right the course in U.S. politics, said Jeffrey Sachs, a leading economist and a Future Now founder. “We’ve become remarkably polarized, remarkably short-sighted and short-term and remarkably non-goal-oriented in American politics right now,” Sachs told the Foundation in an interview. “We’re on the wrong track. Politics does not work right now.” Sachs is director of the Center for Sustainable Development at New York’s Columbia University. The other two founding members of Future Now are Adam Pritzker, chairman of Assembled Brands, a brand-building company, and Daniel Squadron, a former New York state Senator. The nation is failing to deal with issues from environmental threats to sky-rocketing health care costs, while politics in Washington is broken with a Congress that gets nothing accomplished and Donald Trump as president, Sachs said. “It’s not about Trump per se, though I think that Trump exemplifies just about everything wrong with our politics right now and actually poses a lot of dangers for our politics,” he said. The U.S. goals include paid family and sick leave, universal and affordable healthcare, ending hunger, limiting corporate special interest spending in politics, keeping the infrastructure in good repair, making communities resilient to natural disasters and investing in clean, safe energy. “What we need in the U.S. is different from what Spain needs or what Ghana needs or what China needs, but the broad idea that we’re aiming for prosperity, that we’re aiming for fairness and that we’re aiming for environmental safety is global,” Sachs said. The campaign launched with 10 candidates in the state of Virginia, who have received $160,000 in donations from Future Now affiliated donors, the group said. Candidates who sign on to the goals have access to a donor pool as well as support such as data, background and policy briefs, it said. ","

 ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s expected move to “de-certify” the international nuclear deal with Iran is driving a wedge between Europe and the United States and bringing Europeans closer to Russia and China, Germany said on Thursday. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has spoken out repeatedly against Trump’s likely step, but his latest comments aimed to spell out the impact it would have in starker terms. “It’s imperative that Europe sticks together on this issue,” Gabriel, a Social Democrat, told the RND German newspaper group. “We also have to tell the Americans that their behaviour on the Iran issue will drive us Europeans into a common position with Russia and China against the USA.” Trump is seen unveiling a broad strategy on confronting Iran this week, likely on Friday, including a move to de-certify Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord, which he has called an “embarrassment” and the “worst deal ever negotiated.” Senior U.S. officials, European allies and prominent U.S. lawmakers have told Trump that refusing to certify the deal would leave the U.S. isolated, concede the diplomatic high ground to Tehran, and ultimately risk the unravelling of the agreement. The U.N. nuclear watchdog has repeatedly certified that Iran is adhering to restrictions on its nuclear energy programme mandated by the deal to help ensure it cannot be put to developing atomic bombs. Signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, the deal lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear work. Germany has close economic and business ties with Russia, although relations have soured since Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region. Berlin is also working to expand ties with China. Gabriel is expected to leave his post in coming months since his Social Democrats have vowed to go into opposition after slumping badly in the Sept. 24 election, opting not to reprise an awkward “grand coalition” with Merkel’s conservatives. Gabriel on Monday urged the White House not to jeopardise the nuclear agreement, saying such a move would worsen instability in the Middle East and could make it more difficult to halt nuclear arms programmes in other countries. In the interview released on Thursday, he said the nuclear agreement was being treated “like a football” in U.S. domestic politics, but the issue could have serious consequences. He said Russia was watching developments closely, including the divisions between Europe and the United States. “That doesn’t exactly strengthen our position in Europe.” Ultimately, Gabriel told the newspaper group, there were only three countries - the United States, Russia and China - that could avert a new nuclear arms race. “But those countries mistrust each other so much at the moment that they are not working together sufficiently. It must be in our interest to press for more trust.” ","

 ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"HAVANA (Reuters) - The Cuban diplomats expelled from the United States this week included all those dealing with U.S. businesses, Cuba’s embassy in Washington told Reuters on Thursday, dealing another blow to bilateral commercial ties. In an escalating crisis between the Cold War foes, the Trump administration on Tuesday expelled 15 diplomats to protest Communist-run Cuba’s failure to protect U.S. embassy staff in Havana from a mysterious spate of alleged health attacks. “Due to this decision, the activities developed by the Economic and Trade Office of the Embassy of Cuba to the United States ... will be seriously affected,” one Cuban diplomat said in a farewell message to a U.S. group that takes investors to the Caribbean’s largest island. The Cuban embassy is often the first step in the process for U.S. companies to explore opportunities and make a pitch. Officials help them submit a trip proposal, seek out counterparts at state-owned enterprises in the centralized economy, and receive a business visa to travel to Havana. Whether the embassy will still be issuing such visas remains unclear, given one diplomat will remain in the consular section. On the American side, the downgrade of the U.S. embassy - Washington last Friday ordered the departure of all non-emergency staff - will likely make it harder for U.S. companies to find their way in Cuba. “It’s the chilling effect of a diplomatic crisis,” said Pedro Freyre, a Cuban-born attorney who heads the international practice at law firm Akerman. Some U.S. companies may choose to stay on the sidelines until relations improve, he said, adding that his clients already pursuing opportunities in Cuba were staying the course as they saw it as a long-term play. U.S. companies flocked to Cuba in the wake of the detente former Democratic President Barack Obama agreed in 2014. The original frenzy in U.S. commercial interest in Cuba was tempered by the realization that doing business in cash-strapped Cuba was difficult and even harder with a trade embargo in place. Businesses now face a hostile stance from Republican U.S. President Donald Trump, who in June ordered tighter restrictions on travel and trade that have yet to be unveiled. Last Friday, his administration issued a warning on travel to the island. ","

 ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - President Xi Jinping’s closer embrace is bad news for Big Tech. China’s government wants stakes and board seats at web giants like Tencent, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Beijing is already influential behind the scenes in technology, and given its tightening grip elsewhere, a power grab in this vital sector was all but inevitable. This will nonetheless cost investors. China’s bureaucrats have held discussions with Tencent, microblog-operator Weibo, and a video-streaming platform owned by e-commerce group Alibaba, according to the Journal, which cited people close to the companies. State-backed funds would buy a 1 percent stake via “special management shares” allowing them to put a government official on the board. The powerful internet watchdog has already trialled this arrangement with two startups, the newspaper said. Xi’s government is increasing its control on everything from traditional media to private conglomerates like Dalian Wanda and Anbang. So, Beijing’s latest focus on social media and internet companies was to be expected. To be sure, too, the government already exerts substantial sway over the sector. Tough censorship and capital controls mean bosses like Tencent’s Pony Ma need good relations with regulators. He and rivals like Jack Ma of Alibaba are also increasingly pushing into sensitive sectors like cloud computing and finance. That said, government intervention in decision-making will have far more impact. Recently tech groups including Alibaba, Baidu, and JD.com injected $12 billion into state-owned telecom Unicom, as part of the government’s “mixed-ownership” reform. That could be the first of a series of politically motivated investments. So capital allocation could get worse. Foreign scrutiny of Chinese takeovers is already increasing, and politicians in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are pushing for even tighter controls based on national security concerns. The $1 billion acquisition of U.S.-based MoneyGram by Ant Financial, Jack Ma’s financial-technology group, has been delayed, with the buyer having to refile an application, Reuters reported last month. Having direct state backing will make it much harder for these groups to argue they are independent actors. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

In particular, he believes that financials and health care stocks are likely to maintain value even amid a general selloff, given that both sectors are trading at relative discounts to the broader market. While Pouey did not mention any specific stocks in his remarks to CNBC, one may look at the largest by market cap as reasonable proxies for each sector. Within financials, these are: JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), $349 billion; Bank of America Corp. (BAC), $284 billion; and Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), $280 billion. Among health care stocks, they are: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), $365 billion; Pfizer Inc. (PFE), $218 billion; Novartis AG (NVS), $206 billion; and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), $195 billion. Merrill Lynch's Pouey likes financials based on strong dividend growth, at about 10% per year, and share repurchase programs that are proceeding ""very, very aggressively,"" as quoted by CNBC. Meanwhile, technical analysts at Strategas Research Partners are bullish on financial stocks right now. ""The relative performance of the financials sector has also re-accelerated over recent weeks and is on the cusp of making new highs,"" as Chris Verrone of Strategas indicates in another CNBC report. For the year-to-date through October 6, the S&P 500 Financials Select Sector Index (IXM) is up by 13%, per S&P Dow Jones Indices. For the same period, per Investopedia data, shares of the three big banks are up by: JPMorgan Chase, 15%; Bank of America, 20%; and Wells Fargo, 3%. Regarding valuation, Pouey tells CNBC that the S&P 500 currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of 17.8. By comparison, the forward P/Es on these three bank stocks are 12.8, 12.0, and 12.5, respectively, per Thomson Reuters data reported by Yahoo Finance. In nearly every quarter during the last three years, health care stocks consistently have beaten analysts' estimates for revenues and earnings, Pouey tells Barron's. Within health care, he singles out biotech as a ""shining area,"" Barron's adds. (For more, see also: Why Biotech's Rally May Push These 8 Stocks Higher.)

Dan Mangan,10122017,CNBC,10052017,"President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a new executive order aimed at expanding health-coverage options and reducing costs for millions of Americans — an order that Obamacare defenders fear will damage gains made under that health-care law. The executive order eyes loosening rules surrounding the offering of health plans by small businesses, as well as rules about enrollment in short-term health insurance plans. Those short-term plans are less expensive and less comprehensive than Obamacare health plans. Trump, who has been stung in recent months with his inability to get Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with a new law, said the order is ""taking the first steps to providing millions of Americans with Obamacare relief."" ""With these actions, we are moving toward lower costs and more options in the health-care market, and taking crucial steps toward saving the American people from the nightmare of Obamacare,"" Trump said during the signing ceremony in the Roosevelt Room in the White House. ""This is something that millions and millions of people will be signing up for, and they're going to be very happy. This will be great health care,"" the president predicted. But the order will not necessarily have any significant practical impact on the nation's health insurance system by the time Obamacare's next open enrollment season starts next month. That's because of the time it takes to propose and take public comment on the potential changes. And the order does not lift the Obamacare rule that most Americans have some form of health insurance for the year or face a tax penalty. As a result of that omission, and other factors, it is not clear if the order will have a negative effect on enrollment in individual health plans sold on Obamacare plans that go into effect in 2018. Nor is it clear that enrollment in other health plans will increase significantly. ""I don't know that it accomplishes all that much"" in the short-term, said Gary Claxton, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading health-care policy research group, when asked about the order's impacts. But Trump said, ""Today is only the beginning."" ""In the coming months we plan to take new measures to provide our people with even more relief and more freedom,"" Trump said, referring to other executive actions to reform rules related to the Affordable Care Act. Claxton said if the administration ends up loosening enforcement of the Obamacare coverage mandate, ""it could be disruptive, and it could happen very quickly."" Trump noted that in 2017, one-third of all counties in the United States had just one insurer offering Obamacare plans. ""Next year, it looks like nearly half of all counties in our country — think of that — one-half of our counties will have one insurer,"" Trump said. Trump also pointed to ""skyrocketing"" health-care premium prices for Obamacare plans in a number of states in 2017 as evidence of the ""Obamacare nightmare."" The order comes after months of failed efforts by Trump and Republican leaders to get Congress to pass legislation that would repeal and replace Obamacare. Trump, who still wants such legislation to happen, on Thursday blamed congressional Democrats for universally opposing repeal-and-replace bills. But the president also noted that it was a ""small handful"" of Republican senators whose opposition to those bills doomed them in recent months. One of those senators was Rand Paul of Kentucky, who attended Thursday's signing session because he has advocated for making it easier for small businesses to form associations that can buy health insurance collectively. That idea is a key point in Trump's order. The order directs the Labor Department to ""consider expanding access to Association Health Plans"" for American businesses, so small businesses can easier band together to offer health coverage. The order contemplates AHPs being formed across state lines. The president said that by banding together, companies will be able to ""buy affordable and competitive health coverage."" That, and allowing AHPs to buy coverage across state lines, will result in ""staggering"" competition for their business among insurers, Trump said. ""Insurers will be fighting to get every single person signed up,"" he said. However, it is not clear if the Labor Department will end up allowing people who are not employed by companies in such AHPs to get health insurance coverage through them. Obamacare advocates fear that if that were to be allowed, it could reduce the number of healthy people buying individual health plans on Obamacare exchanges. That, in turn, would lead to greater price hikes than have already been seen. Advocates also worry that the AHP plans will not be as comprehensive in terms of covered benefits as Obamacare plans. The order also directs several federal agencies to consider reversing an Obama administration directive that limited enrollment in short-term insurance plans to just three months. Short-term health insurance currently does not satisfy Obamacare's coverage mandate, which means that someone enrolled in only those plans is subject to a tax penalty. Claxton said that if the administration only ends up increasing the amount of time a person can be enrolled in a short-term insurance plan, ""it would not have a big effect on undermining the [Obamacare] marketplaces,"" which sell more comprehensive, and more expensive, health coverage. Claxton said that because individuals would still be subject to the penalty, there would not be a big influx of people into short-term plans and exodus out of Obamacare marketplace plans. But ""the issue would be, what comes next?"" Claxton said. If the administration liberalizes rules about the duration of short-term health plans, and then also makes it easier for people to get hardship exemptions from Obamacare's mandate, it could lead healthy people who don't need comprehensive benefits to sign up in large numbers for short-term coverage. Dave Dillon, a fellow of the Society of Actuaries, said of Trump's order, ""Overall, the proposal has potential to bring increased instability and volatility to the health insurance markets by separating the market into two smaller pools."" ""Longer length short-term plans may further segment the market,"" Dillon said in emailed comments. ""The proposal offers more choice to consumers in terms of coverage options,"" Dillon said. ""Healthier consumers will likely be able to enroll in plans with lower insurance rates, while more medically complex consumers may be subject to significant rate increases."" Trump's order also will direct federal agencies to consider making changes to rules around health-reimbursement arrangements, which allow employers to set aside tax-advantaged money that workers can use for out-of-pocket health costs. And the order directs multiple agencies to review the level of competition among health-care providers and insurers nationally, with an eye toward identifying actions that could increase competition. Officials said the administration is concerned about the large volume consolidation in the health-care sector since the adoption of the ACA, which they said has had the effect of increasing prices and potentially affecting the quality of health care.

Elizabeth Gurdus,10122017,CNBC,10052017,"As the Dow Jones industrial average continues to reach intraday all-time highs, CNBC's Jim Cramer decided to look back at the stocks that drove the index's gains in the third quarter. The Dow increased by 4.9 percent in the third quarter as the stock market avoided a historically typical September downturn, so the ""Mad Money"" host examined the top 10 stocks responsible for the move. The aerospace giant contributed a massive 37.5 percent to the Dow's gain. Boeing's longer-than-expected order book, strong defense-oriented business and new Dreamliner aircraft model drove buyers to its shares, Cramer said. Caterpillar contributed 11.6 percent to the Dow last quarter. Together, Caterpillar and Boeing accounted for nearly half of the Dow's move. ""The source of CAT's strength? The company had a true blowout quarter thanks to a pickup in orders, very lean inventories and a very low table of employment. It's a big winner as China and Europe return to growth ... and you'd better believe they'll sell more equipment for the rebuild effort in the wake of the recent hurricanes here,"" Cramer said. The big bank's shares gave the Dow a 10.8 percent gain. While Goldman's management acknowledged that the bank's last quarter wasn't so great, the stock nevertheless got a boost from a softer regulatory environment and investor optimism about Goldman's future success. Chevron, an oil stock, accounted for 9 percent of the Dow's third-quarter move. Cramer attributed this to the company proving it wouldn't have a problem paying out its large dividend or surviving in a low-priced oil environment. The move in shares of this credit card giant gave the Dow a 7.8 percent boost last quarter as Visa continued riding the global shift from paper-to-plastic. ""I think what shocked people here is that the modern-day Visa was built by Charlie Scharf, who recently left that job, but his successor, Al Kelly, seems to be handling things perfectly well. I admit I was worried when Scharf left,"" Cramer said. ""I was wrong. Kelly's amazing. Visa's business is humming."" Few companies fared better than UnitedHealth when Congress failed to pass the Trump administration's plan to ""repeal and replace"" Obamacare, Cramer said. The health care giant contributed 7.5 percent to the Dow's gain as it pulled out of money-losing exchanges. ""Even after this run, UNH remains one of the cheapest stocks I follow and if it ever comes down, I'd love to add it to the trust,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. After hurricane season wreaked havoc on parts of the United States, investors rushed into Home Depot's stock as a way to play the rebuilding process. The stock's boost added 7.2 percent to the Dow. The consumer technology colossus added 7.1 percent to the Dow's third-quarter move after a better-than-expected quarter and resurgence of bullish sentiment among analysts on Apple's new iPhones. After a series of disappointing quarterly earnings reports, American Express bounced back with an uptick in profitability, pushing shares upward. The stock gave the Dow 4.4 percent of its gain. Contributing 3.9 percent to the Dow's third-quarter climb, Microsoft proved that Azure was a dominant cloud-based system that helped accelerate the company's growth. ""It's become a must-own tech name for big-time portfolio managers who like growth but also want to sleep at night,"" Cramer said. All in all, Cramer learned three key things from looking at the group in its entirety: ""Put simply, these names went higher largely because they were the only game in town, cash-heavy stocks of companies that are doing better than we thought that could grow in an era of slow growth,"" Cramer said.

Christina Farr,10122017,CNBC,10052017,"Amazon is in the final stages of figuring out its strategy to get into the multibillion-dollar prescription drug market. The company will decide before Thanksgiving whether to move into selling prescription drugs online, according to an email from Amazon viewed by CNBC and a source familiar with the situation. If it decides to make that move, it will start expanding its senior team with drug supply chain experts. Amazon typically spends years researching opportunities before it telegraphs its intentions. The opportunity to sell drugs online is alluring given its market size -- analysts have estimated the U.S. prescription drug market at $560 billion per year. Amazon is well aware of the complexities, say sources familiar with the company's thinking. Amazon declined to comment. In the past year, Amazon has ramped up its hiring and consulted with dozens of people about a potential move into the pharmacy market. The consumables team, which includes groceries, kicked off the research, with the division's vice president, Eric French, taking the lead. It brought on Mark Lyons from Premera Blue Cross to build an internal pharmacy benefits manager for its own employees, say multiple people familiar. According to one of the people, it's possible that the push into the broader drug supply chain hinges on its success with this effort. In May, the company kicked off its search for a general manager to lead its pharmacy push, externally dubbed ""healthcare."" Analyst firm Leerink has separately reported that Amazon will get into the pharmacy management space and expects an announcement within the next year or two. Goldman Sachs published a report on the topic in August of this year, speculating that Amazon will ultimately look to improve price transparency for consumers and reduce out-of-pocket costs. Amazon already has a business selling medical supplies online, such as gauze and thermometers. It also has a health team called 1492, which is focused on both hardware and software projects, like developing health applications for the Echo and Dash Wand. Its cloud service, Amazon Web Services, continues to dominate the health and life sciences market. ","Amazon considering selling online prescriptions, decision coming soon"
 ,10122017,CNBC,10052017,"BARCELONA, Spain -- A senior European Union official has pleaded with the Catalan leadership to step away from the brink of a divisive call for independence and resort to dialogue with Spain's government instead. European Council President Donald Tusk addressed Catalonia's president directly, hours before Carles Puigdemont is expected to make an announcement on the region's bid for secession. Tusk said in Brussels that ""I ask you to respect in your intentions the constitutional order and not to announce a decision that would make such a dialogue impossible."" Tusk added that ""diversity should not and need not lead to conflict whose consequences would obviously be bad for the Catalans, for Spain and for the whole of Europe."" Before a meeting of the EU's Committee of the Regions, Tusk said that ""let us always look for what unites us and not for what divides us. This is what will decide the future of our continent."" Catalonia's regional leader was addressing parliament Tuesday in a highly anticipated session that could spell the birth of a new republic, marking a critical point in a decade-long standoff between Catalan separatists and Spain's central authorities. Security was tight in Barcelona and police cordoned a park surrounding the legislative building, where the Catalan President Carles Puigdemont is expected to walk a fine line when he addresses regional lawmakers. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont presides over a cabinet meeting at the regional government headquarters, the Generalitat, in Barcelona, Spain October 10, 2017. The speech will need to appease the most radical separatist-minded supporters of his ruling coalition - but Puigdemont faces shutting down any possibility of negotiating with Spain if he adopts a hard line. The Catalan leader hasn't revealed the precise message he will deliver in the address at 6 p.m. (1600GMT), but separatist lawmakers and activists have said they won't be satisfied with anything short of an independence declaration. A full declaration of secession -or an outright proclamation of a new Catalan Republic - would certainly be met with fierce opposition by central Spanish authorities, who could take the unprecedented step of suspending the self-government of Catalonia and taking over some or all powers in the region. Puigdemont himself could end up in prison. Some 2.3 million Catalans - or 43 percent of the electorate in the north-eastern region - turned out to vote in the Oct. 1 independence referendum, which the Spanish government said was illegal. Regional authorities say 90 percent who voted were in favour and declared the results of the vote valid. The ballot was marred by violence as riot police tasked with stopping the voting clashed with voters, leaving hundreds injured. The political deadlock has been compared in Spain to a ""train collision"" and has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis in more than four decades, since democratic rule was restored following the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco. In the streets of Barcelona, expectations were divided between those who want to see the birth of a new nation and others opposed to the idea. Some feared a drastic backlash from the Spanish central authorities. ""I am thrilled,"" said Maria Redon, a 51-year-old office worker. ""I've been waiting for this all my life. We have fought a lot to see an independent Catalonia."" But Carlos Gabriel, a 36-year-old waiter, said that is ""impossible."" ""He won't do it. By doing so he would be diving into an empty pool,"" he said referring to Puigdemont's parliamentary address. ""These people know it's just a dream. Something very complicated. Something that will carry many negative consequences for all of us."" In Catalonia and elsewhere in Spain, people were reading between the lines of politicians' statements to try to figure out what's next. Regional government spokesman Jordi Turull refused to comment on what Puigdemont's address would be about during a press conference on Tuesday. The Catalan parliament's governing board acknowledged Tuesday morning it had received the results in last week's disputed independence referendum. But a parliamentary official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the board refrained from putting the results through normal parliamentary procedures to elude any legal problems, because the referendum and its legal framework have been suspended by the national Constitutional Court. Assemblea Nacional Catalan and Omnium Cultural, two of the main civil society organizations driving the secession bid, have called for people to gather near Barcelona's parliament building to back the regional government in ""welcoming the republic."" Hundreds of thousands have turned out for street protests in Barcelona and other towns in the past month to back Catalan independence and protest against alleged police violence during the vote. Those committed to national unity have also staged separate, large-scale rallies. The tension has impacted the economy, with dozens of companies already relocating their corporate address away from the troubled region to remain under Spanish and European laws if Catalonia manages to secede. The moves of the firms' bases do not so far affect jobs or investments - but they don't send a message of confidence in the Puigdemont government. Spain's Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said on Tuesday he hoped ""common sense"" would prevail and blamed Puigemont's ""radical"" and ""irresponsible"" government for the current standoff. ""This is not about independence, yes or no. This is about a rebellion against the rule of law,"" de Guindos told reporters in Luxembourg, where he was meeting with European Union ministers. ""And the rule of law is the foundation of coexistence, not only in Spain but in Europe."" Instead of a paintbrush, Alexandre Farto uses drills and jackhammers to create large-scale public art that exposes layers of a city's history.

Holly Ellyatt,10122017,CNBC,10052017,"The potential constitutional crisis facing Madrid has not gone away and could reach a decisive point this week, despite a mass protest in favor of a united Spain on Sunday. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in Catalonia Sunday to call for unity, voicing their opposition to last week's non-binding and referendum on independence on October 1 that was declared illegal by the Spanish government and constitutional court. Police in Barcelona estimated that 350,000 people had attended the march while Societat Civil Catalana, an anti-independence group that organized the protest, put the number of demonstrators at 930,000. Waving both Spanish and Catalan flags, demonstrators on Sunday praised the actions taken by the Spanish government to prevent the symbolic referendum vote, and criticized local politicians who have encouraged secession from Spain. Responding to the latest pro-unionist march in Catalonia, Raul Romeva, the region's foreign affairs minister, told CNBC on Sunday that there had been a larger pro-independence response from the Catalan people and that needed to be addressed by Madrid. ""For six to seven years in a row we have seen millions of people on the street. I'm not talking about governing, I'm talking about society. We have seen millions of people on the street demanding to approach, politically, that issue. I think that the people deserves, they have earned the right to be listened (to),"" he said. ""Obviously from that perspective we have been trying to have that dialogue to engage with the Spanish government, unfortunately we are alone at the table. So in order to have a negotiation or dialogue you need a counterpart and so far we are alone at the table and you need two to tango,"" he added. Sunday's protest centered in the regional capital Barcelona and will likely put more pressure on the regional government to drop its claims to independence. The vote saw 90 percent of the 2.28 million people who voted choose independence. Voter turnout was low at 43 percent, however, although the regional government said 770,000 potential voters were not able to vote following the Spanish police's crackdown on voters and polling stations. Spanish Health Minister Dolors Montserrat, who originates from Catalonia, delivered a brief statement at the rally on Sunday: ""Today is a very important day for all the Catalans and today we are going to put a stop to the independence, and we will … And we want to build for the Catalans and with all the rest of the Spanish people, this grand nation and this great democracy all together."" The government in Madrid has urged its counterpart in Barcelona to resist declaring independence although Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has rejected calls for mediation to resolve the impasse with the Catalan government. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont has said he will address the regional parliament on Tuesday evening and it's still uncertain whether he will go ahead with declaring independence — as he stated last week — particularly after a strong show of support in favor of unity with Spain. Rajoy said Madrid could use its constitutional powers to suspend Catalonia's autonomy and prevent it from declaring independence. In an interview with the El Pais newspaper published on Sunday, the Spanish leader suggested he could trigger article 155 of the constitution, which would allow him to dismiss the regional government and call fresh local elections. He said he would not ""rule out anything that is within the law."" Amid the uncertainty, a number of Spanish companies headquartered in Catalonia, including banks Sabadell and Caixabank, have opted to relocate due to fears over secession. Meanwhile, Spanish energy company Gas Natural and water firm Agbar have announced moves to Madrid. The decisions to relocate likely dealt a blow for the Catalan government and comes after ratings agency Moody's said in a report Friday that Catalan independence would have ""broad negative, albeit highly uncertain, credit implications for a wide range of bond issuers in Spain and the region."" Xavier García Albiol, the president of Catalonia's Partido Popular (People's Party - the governing party of Prime Minister Rajoy), told CNBC on Sunday that the relocations were worrying. ""It's obvious that we are very worried about businesses fleeing Catalonia due to the political instability. The only thing I ask for is patience, and most importantly, that the President of the Generalitat (Puigdemont) and his colleagues urgently denounce the movement for independence in public to give the Catalan people and businesses peace and security,"" he said.

"Mike Juang, special to CNBC.com",10122017,CNBC,10052017,"It is most definitely brain surgery. The skull is opened, and electrical leads are implanted directly into the tissue of the brain. These wires are connected to a small device that sends a small dose of electricity into the brain. The treatment, called deep brain stimulation, means patients suffering from neurological disorders like Parkinson's Disease can have the chance to live a normal life without constantly fighting their own bodies. Tremors, or involuntary shaking while a limb is at rest, can be noticeably reduced or even eliminated. Patients regain mobility and are able to walk and even talk normally. YouTube is filled with hundreds of videos demonstrating the ""life-changing"" effects of a DBS device when active, as well as what patient functionality returns to when the device is turned off. Popularly known as a ""brain pacemaker,"" deep brain stimulation works by blocking errant signals from damaged brain cells to ""reset"" the brain's natural rhythm, said Dr. Michael Okun, the medical director of the Parkinson's Foundation and chairman for the Department of Neurology at the University of Florida. During surgery a hole is inserted into the patient's skull and electrical leads are implanted directly into the brain's tissue. The leads are threaded out, and the skull is closed. These wires are threaded behind the ears, down the neck and to the front chest area, where they are connected to a watch-size device that emits a controlled amount of electricity. The entire unit, from wires to generator, are all buried just below the skin. The generator, a self-contained unit with a battery, sends pulses of electricity through the leads to stimulate areas of the brain, reducing or in some cases even eliminating the most debilitating parts of the disease. A small, cellphone-size remote control can be used to adjust the ""dosage"" of electricity and can turn the device on and off. One of the major manufacturers of the device is Medtronic, which has been active in the U.S. market the longest — it first received approval for use of its DBS system for advanced Parkinson's in 2002; the FDA approved it in 2016 for use with patients who have had Parkinson's for at least four years. Abbott Laboratories acquired the DBS business with its acquisition of St. Jude Medical last year; and Boston Scientific, which currently offers its DBS system in Europe, hopes to receive U.S. approval by year-end. The three companies' business lines focused on neurology had roughly $1 billion in combined sales in the most recent reported quarter. Medtronic's brain therapies group is the leader, with $522 million in sales in the most recent quarter, though it does not break out DBS sales specifically. Abbott's neuromodulation unit had $300 million in global sales, with approximately 10 percent coming from DBS sales, but it says DBS has been growing since launching in the United States last year. Each DBS surgery can cost between $35,000 and $50,000, and upward of $70,000 to $100,000 for bilateral procedures (both sides of the brain), according to the National Parkinson Foundation. These estimates include the cost of the surgery, devices, anesthesia, hospital fees and physician fees. Device costs can run to tens of thousands of dollars: The Medtronic DBS unit costs $23,000. Since DBS is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease, Medicare and most private insurance carriers will cover most, if not all, of the costs of the operation, according to NPF. Still, as with any surgery, there are risks. ""The main risk is bleeding,"" said Dr. Matthew Wodziak, a neurologist who specializes in Parkinson's Disease at Loyola Medicine. ""When we find the right place to put something inside the brain, you have the risk of bleeding [and] infection,"" he said. Properly implanted leads do not cause brain damage, and only create microlesions, or small cuts in the brain tissue, and a buildup of glial tissue, cells that support neurons, Okun said. In addition to the complications associated with surgery, DBS devices also require physical maintenance. Batteries in the devices are not rechargeable and need to be replaced, Wodziak said. The hardware can wear over time and may need maintenance. Medtronic says its devices are not susceptible to hacking, and include encrypted signal technology and proprietary algorithms to communicate with remote controllers. Despite progress, experts and doctors are trying to determine exactly how electrical stimulation alleviates the symptoms of brain-related disabilities, Okun said. Doctors are still debating if DBS directly affects the function of brain cells, if it simply introduces changes in the chemical composition and biology of the brain, or some combination of the two. What they do know, Okun said, is that introducing electricity blocks the signals of cells close to the lead while stimulating the ""pipes"" connecting neuron cells, called axons. It also alters the neurochemistry of the brain, the ""ocean"" of fluid in which neurons sit. ""We're using a tiny amount of electricity to influence a large circuit that is malfunctioning, and we're trying to reset the brain,"" Okun said. The electricity restores normal oscillations of the brain, improving the patient's symptoms, he said. In the case of tremors associated with Parkinson's disease, it can make it much more manageable or even stop the tremors completely. The treatment can be used to tackle additional neurological problems and other disorders, Wodziak said, including epilepsy, seizures and dystonia, which is the sustained, involuntary contraction of muscles and can lead to painful cramping of the feet or hands, curling toes, or turning and twisting of the neck. A version of the same technology can even be used on the spinal cord. This year, Dr. Andre Machado of the Cleveland Clinic performed the first DBS surgery for stroke recovery using the Boston Scientific Vercise system. It is also considered for depression and weight loss. Although the treatment has been around since the 90's, there have been some incremental advances to the technology, including leads capable of focusing electricity to increasingly specific parts of the brain and smaller generators capable of connecting to devices using Bluetooth. Abbott's DBS system was the first to be approved in the United States with a ""directional lead,"" which allows physicians to direct current more precisely than traditional DBS. It also allows for system control from an iPod Touch. Future deep brain stimulators may even include sensors that allow it to respond dynamically to changes in brain patterns, said Brett Wall, senior vice president of brain therapies at Medtronic. The company also hopes to reduce the size of devices, eventually making generators rechargeable or even small enough to embed directly on top of the skull, Wall said. Wodziak cautioned though that the surgery is only optimal for patients that will drastically benefit from it. Due to the nature of the surgery, patients opting for DBS it must undergo a bevy of tests from an army of specialists: A neurologist and neuropsychologist to screen patients. A neurosurgeon to perform the implant. A psychiatrist and rehab team including physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists to assist recovery. The best candidates for DBS Have had PD symptoms for at least five years. Have ""on/off"" fluctuations (when a person cycles between ""on"" time, when the medication is working to control symptoms, and ""off"" time, when medication has worn off and PD symptoms return), with or without dyskinesia. Dyskinesia is involuntary, irregular, writhing movement that can range from mild to violent and can sometimes be unpredictable. Continue to have a good response to PD medications, especially carbidopa/levodopa (though the duration of response may be insufficient). Have tried different combinations of carbidopa/levodopa and dopamineagonists under the supervision of a movement disorder neurologist or specialist. Have tried other PD medications – such as entacapone, tolcapone, selegiline,apomorphine or amantadine – without beneficial results. Have PD symptoms that interfere with daily activities. Parkinson's disease patients are also advised to consult with a movement disorders specialist, a neurologist who has completed specialized training in PD and movement disorders, or in the least with neurologists in practice who have become experts in this area through their experience caring for many patients and by taking continuing medical education courses. ""We don't put it in first,"" Okun said. ""We very carefully go through an interdisciplinary evaluation, we find out what's disabling to the patient, we have to make a conscious decision; can our technology tackle all the symptoms in our patient?"" The treatment is meant to be a supplement to, and not a replacement for, medication and other treatments. Patients also need to be aware that many post-operative visits for both DBS programming and medication adjustments will be required, most frequently during the first 6 months following implantation. Many medical centers that offer DBS also require monthly visits for the first six months. DBS is removable and reversible. It's not a cure for Parkinson's Disease. Michael J. Fox, the actor who has become synonymous with the fight to find a cure for Parkinson's and whose foundation offers guidance for those considering the procedure, has spoken in the past about the potential benefits of DBS, but also its limitations. He was first diagnosed in 1991 and in the late 1990s, Fox had a type of brain surgery to relieve his tremors, a thalamotomy — which destroys a small portion of brain tissue — before DBS became an option. Fox told CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta back in 2010 about his decision to not pursue DBS: ""The next time they go in my brain, I want them to get it done. … If there is something that they can do that will be curative or restorative … in a much more fundamental way than a mechanical stop gap, a kind of pacemaker. ... That's just my personal preference, but it's been tremendous in people's lives, hundreds I've met, and thousands that have had the procedure, deep brain stimulation. It's been huge, the improvement ... the people that couldn't walk, people that had a hard time functioning.""

Evelyn Cheng,10122017,CNBC,10052017,"The head of the largest U.S. bank said Thursday that if tax reform does get passed, the company will hire more workers. Over time, JPMorgan Chase will be ""boosting jobs and wages more than we otherwise would have"" if corporate taxes are cut, the bank's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, said during a post-earnings release conference call with media. ""Had we done it right five years ago, we would have grown much faster,"" Dimon said. JPMorgan said in its 2016 annual report that the company has more than 243,000 employees worldwide, with more than 167,000 in the United States. CFO Marianne Lake added on the call that ""the tax rate is only one piece of the equation"" when considering whether to hire more workers or raise wages. Dimon is chairman of the Business Roundtable, a group of more than 200 chief executive officers of major U.S. companies, and has spoken strongly about the need for more business-friendly legislation in the United States. This week, Dimon said in a commentary piece on NBC News' THINK website that American workers will be the real beneficiaries of corporate tax reform. The piece cites estimates from accounting firm EY that showed ""a competitive 20% corporate tax reduction could support the creation of as many as 2 million new jobs if the tax savings went to new job creation."" The article also pointed to an April survey from Business Roundtable that said 76 percent of 123 responding chief executive officers would increase hiring if tax reform is successful. The GOP released a tax framework last month that proposed cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. However, many remain skeptical on whether tax reform will be passed soon, if at all. Congress has struggled to pass legislation on health care this year despite a Republican majority.

Sophie Bearman,10122017,CNBC,10052017,"Cyndi and Cameron Dieterich never imagined they'd be spending the bulk of their newlywed years in Cave Springs, Arkansas. Yet that's exactly what happened. It all started with a job offer. Cyndi, 36, was working in Seattle for a major wine production company when an executive called to offer her a promotion. A sales director position had opened up, servicing the company's biggest buyer, Wal-Mart. The position came with a big title change and a raise, but there was a catch: The job was in northwest Arkansas, where Wal-Mart is headquartered. ""He said to me, 'I'm pretty sure I know the answer to the question, and I think it's going to be no,'"" she recalled. But for Cyndi and Cameron, 37, the decision wasn't so obvious. The couple had $60,000 in combined consumer debt. With an additional $76,000 in student loans and a mortgage, their net worth was negative. On one hand, Arkansas would offer a fast financial recovery due to its low cost of living and affordable housing. It ranked as the fourth-least expensive state to live in 2017, according to CNBC's annual Top States for Business study. A downside, though, was that access to the arts and culture would be more difficult, and Cyndi and Cameron would be giving up on the quality of life they'd become accustomed to in a major metropolitan area. Ultimately, the appeal of Arkansas outweighed the negatives. Cyndi called her company back. ""The answer's not 'no,'"" she said. Cyndi and Cameron met in Los Angeles in 2011. They'd each found their way to the city many years earlier. For Cameron, a television producer, Hollywood called to him right out of college. ""I had the itch to go work in the entertainment industry. So as soon as I graduated, I packed up my Nissan Sentra and my dad and I drove to Burbank, California,"" he said. Cyndi's path was less direct. She'd lived in Minnesota, Colorado and Oregon before moving to Los Angeles in 2010. Once there, each fell in love with the city despite its high cost of living. When rent was tight one month, they'd use a credit card to pay for food. If they needed to fly home for Thanksgiving, the plane ticket would get bought on credit. ""It was just kind of survival,"" Cyndi said. It wasn't until the pair got married in 2013 that they decided to get serious about their finances. They hired Sophia Bera, a certified financial planner who specializes in advising clients in their 20s and 30s. Bera set the couple straight. ""I think what Sophia said to us after she looked at our finances initially was, 'You have some work to do.' Which we knew,"" said Cyndi. Arkansas would help them get that work done, but money wasn't the only impetus for the move. Cyndi and Cameron were hoping to grow their family, and they felt Arkansas would be a good place to raise a baby. Moving had financial risks, too. Cameron would have to quit his job. The couple's Seattle home became key to quelling any financial concerns they had about the move. Even though Cyndi and Cameron had lived there only for 1½ years, the house had appreciated significantly. They were able to close on the home and walk away with some cash. ""We would have thought, 'Hey, let's put that money into the new house so we have a lower payment,'"" said Cameron. Bera encouraged them to only put down 5 percent on the Arkansas house and aggressively pay down their high-interest consumer debt instead. Following her advice, the couple paid off $50,000 of their debt and refinanced one of their car loans to 2.99 percent from 6 percent. Things got more complicated when Cyndi gave birth to Oliver. The baby was born with a congenital heart condition called Tetralogy of Fallot and would need heart surgery at age 6 months. Cameron postponed his job search to focus on caring for Oliver. ""Having a child with a congenital heart defect, there's inherently expense there. We were able to get through the first year with him and focus solely on getting him where he needed to be from a health perspective and just pay the bills that we needed to pay to take care of him,"" said Cyndi. Oliver's health costs wouldn't have been any different had the couple stayed in Seattle. More from My Success Story The couple turned $10,000 into am $800,000 a year clothing business  From political refugee to C-suite success Because they have insurance through Cyndi's company, the couple had the luxury of choosing where Oliver's heart surgery would be performed — and they could have chosen anywhere in the United States. Ultimately, they selected a surgeon in Houston. But they say that overall child-care costs, like day care, clothes, and food, are much less expensive in Arkansas and helped offset some of the out-of-pocket health costs. Despite the challenges of a move, heath-care costs, unemployment and child expenses, Cameron and Cyndi still managed to increase their net worth that first year in Arkansas. Today, their finances are even stronger. The Dieterichs have eliminated all $60,000 of their consumer debt and are steadily decreasing their outstanding student loans. On top of that, Oliver is healthy and Cameron is working at a creative agency as a producer. In many ways, Arkansas' affordability is to thank for their swift financial success. Still, the Dieterichs say they may not live in Arkansas forever. But they do see the state as a key player in allowing them to triple their savings account and grow their family. And for now, they're enjoying it. ""I think overall we are still pleasantly surprised that we like it here,"" said Cameron. ""It's where our family started, where our child was born and no matter where we end up as we go through life, we're going to have very fond memories of our time here.""

Brian Withers,10122017,Fool,10052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Fitness tracker company Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) announced its long-anticipated Ionic smartwatch at the end of August. While Fitbit's stock has seen a positive bump since the announcement, it is still down more than 50% over the past 12 months. FIT data by YCharts The smartwatch has an app gallery, enhanced coaching features, and a huge community of users that could be a catalyst for additional revenue growth. Read on to see how these features could benefit Fitbit investors. Image source: Fitbit In early August, Fitbit CEO James Park said that the  smartwatch would release with an app ""gallery"" with a ""select number"" of partners. Now that the smartwatch has been released, you will find it has popular functions and apps from companies including Pandora, Starbucks, Accuweather, and Strava, which is a social network for athletes. And this is just the start. In that early August call with analysts, Park talked about the Ionic's powerful software developer kit (SDK), which is a set of tools that enables programmers to create smartwatch apps. Park explained that when the company worked with UnitedHealth Group to create the Motion program for its members, it didn't have this SDK capability, and the effort to develop was considerable from both Fitbit and United Health. Having the app gallery and SDK will aid development of more health-focused apps in partnership with insurers or medical device manufacturers -- like the recently announced partnership with Dexcom -- and should drive incremental revenue. Fitbit's mission starts with, ""To empower and inspire you to live a healthier, more active life."" Fitbit reported in May 2017 that it had sold 63 million devices and had more than 50 million registered device users. Management has said that a smartwatch with coaching features could expand its user base by 40 million to 80 million people.  The Ionic is just this device. Fitstar, which is Fitbit's subscription-based fitness app, finally has a device that will make its features easier to use, be more accessible to more people, and have more specific coaching programs to attract users. The culmination of these benefits is rolled into a personalized app called Fitbit Coach and will be released in the fall. The Fitbit Coach personal training app will have introductory pricing of $7.99 per month or $39.99 per year. With Fitbit Coach, users will have workouts displayed on the device, running and walking audio coaching, and app-adjusted workouts based on their feedback. Coming in 2018, Ionic will allow you to access adidas coaching expertise. These coaching features should allow Fitbit to expand its addressable market and drive additional recurring subscription revenue through its premium apps. While the Ionic smartwatch doesn't enhance Fitbit's community features, it should attract new users and grow the overall Fitbit community. Having a large and active community attracts individual users and should also entice corporations hoping to reduce healthcare costs by giving employees Fitbits. Fitbit's corporate wellness programs accounted for less than 10% of overall revenue in 2016, but they could be a growth driver in the future and the Ionic community could be a selling point for corporations hoping to save money on healthcare. When someone buys a Fitbit device, access to the community and its features automatically comes along with it. Fitbit only releases its user community numbers annually, and at the end of 2016, the company had 23.2 million active users. This large user base makes it more likely that a friend or relative may already be on the platform, so the new Fitbit user may be able to engage with someone they know. Park said the community features benefit users by ""building healthy habits, [enabling] friendly competition and curating a supportive and positive environment.""  Fitbit Ionic smartwatch coaching features help Fitbit add incremental recurring revenue and expand its total addressable market. The app gallery and growing user community should boost partnerships with health-related companies. These are the new Ionic smartwatch features that investors should love. ","

Published on By If you thought that sparkling water was a trend that would die soon, think again. On Monday, Coca-Cola purchased mineral water brand Topo Chico for $220 million dollars. Topo Chico currently is distributed in 35 states, with almost 70 percent of its total sales in the state of Texas alone. This acquisition marked a big investment into a trend that has soda consumption at its lowest point since 1985. Coca-Cola already has two sparkling water brands: Dasani Sparkling and Smartwater sparkling. This purchase is its latest acquisition that many think can compete with big rivals like Nestle’s Perrier and Sundance Beverage Company’s LaCroix. Topo Chico, the prized mineral water brand of Mexico and the Austin craft cocktail scene, has had a long relationship with Coca-Cola. The plant that still bottles and manufactures Topo Chico since its creation bottled the first ever bottle of Coca-Cola in 1920s. Coca-Cola says they have no plans to change the location of its manufacturing in Monterrey, Mexico, nor the brand’s existing image. “It’s important for us to maintain the relevance with the core Topo Chico fanbase while introducing the brand to new people,” VP of Emerging Brands Matt Hughes said. “We’ll continue to protect the prestige of the brand, which is authentic to its heritage and hip without being pretentious.” After the announcement of the acquisition, brand die hards took to Twitter to offer their two cents about the acquisition of Topo Chico by Coca-Cola. The most positive comments were about the opportunity to have Topo Chico distributed across the country so that those not located in its sales area could drink the sparkling beverage. Of course, the cult-like fan base that Topo Chico has was generally disturbed by the fact that their beverage of choice could be “corrupted” with high fructose corn syrup or the recipe changed. Plus, there’s a good old fashioned dose of twitter snarkiness at announcement of the news as well. I’m fair to partly excited about Coca Cola adding Topo Chico to the family.

Published on By Personality tests are some of the most popular posts on social media. At least once every day, I see “What Sauce Are You?” or “What Disney Princess Are You?” on my Facebook feed. Millions of people take the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test each year, a more professional personality test. When you take the MBTI, you’re presented with a personality type, based on four characteristics, extrovert-introvert (E/I); sensing -intuition (S/N); thinking-feeling (T-F); and judging – perceiving (J/P). Many organizations use the MBTI in the workplace to group people into teams or to select candidates for employment. After all, wouldn’t you want an extrovert over an introvert for a sales position? But using the MBTI to make serious business decisions may not be a good idea. Here’s why. It’s unethical to use the MBTI in certain cases. According to the creators of the MBTI, “It is unethical and in many cases illegal to require job applicants to take the Indicator if the results will be used to screen out applicants. The administrator should not counsel a person to, or away from, a particular career, personal relationship or activity based solely upon type information.” Personality type does not imply competence or preference. The creators of MBTI also state this in their ethical position on the personality test. I am an introvert. I will always be an introvert. But I just found out that some of my colleagues believe I am an extrovert. I can adapt to a social or business situation to get the job done. If a job used the MBTI to place me on a team, they may see that I don’t always behave like an introvert. Similarly, a job may overlook me for a position based on my MBTI type. Either way, it’s kind of unfair. How can you use the MBTI? The MBTI can be beneficial to help people understand their own tendencies. I remember one thing from the test, a question about whether you base your decisions on how they impact others. Years ago, I would have answered that totally in the positive. I always considered others in making my decisions, whether I should or shouldn’t have.  Today, I would answer that question much differently. My understanding of boundaries is much better. Your MBTI type can be a great communication starter, especially in teams. But it shouldn’t typecast you into a particular position on the team. Employers should not be using the MBTI to pigeonhole their employees.  (BUSINESS NEWS) Remote working is increasingly more common here are some tips on how to ask your boss for flexibility. Published on By To some people, “working remotely” sounds like a code word for sitting around in your PJs watching Netflix all day. But many professionals, managers and otherwise, recognize the value of the flexibility and independence that comes with working from home occasionally. Depending on your role, your commute, and your personal life, benefits of working from home could include:
Reallocating commute time into productivity. 45 minutes each way means an hour and a half of wasted time – and you’re probably already tired by the time you get to work.
Uninterrupted periods of focused work. Coworkers are a wonderful resource for collaboration, and even friendship, but even the most awesome people can be annoying when you really, really, really need to focus.
Energizing quiet time. Introverts often underestimate how much they mentally need this, and everyone can use a reset once in a while.
More time to spend with kids/spouse/friends. Again, you can save time on your commute, and often you can rearrange your schedule to work a few hours after the kids have gone to bed/the movie is over/etc. If you’ve already made that list of benefits in your head a thousand times while knocking your head against your office desk, a work arrangement that includes remote work days is definitely something you should try, if your organization and your manager will agree to it. But for many potential remote workers, getting the boss onboard seems like an unsurmountable barrier, and they may have even made the request in the past but been denied. This article is designed to help all those interested in remote work successfully navigate that daunting process. Before we get into the details of potential concerns your boss may have, you should establish a clear reason (or reasons) why you’d like to transition to a schedule that includes working from home. If you can’t articulate this fundamental point, your boss will be much more likely to suspect that your motives are less than pure. Both personal and professional reasons are totally valid, but being totally open is the only way to set yourself up for success. With these motivations in mind, develop a proposal for your boss that focuses on how working from home will benefit your organization, not you. Your boss knows that you’re asking for this flexibility for yourself, but a happier and more productive you is way better for the company than a miserable, exhausted you. Your proposal should include a schedule or plan, and you should probably start slow with the work from home days. If your goal is to work from home two days a week, suggest spending one day at home every two weeks for a set period, like two or three months, so that your boss will have a built in trial period to agree to. A couple of pro tips: aside from ensuring that you’re in the office on important regular meeting days, you should avoid Friday as your work from home day to be sure it doesn’t look like you’re after three day weekends. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are ideal, because they’re in the middle of the week, and you may often have a lot of tasks and projects coming to a head on these days that you’ll need to focus on for completion. You also need to go out of your way to make sure your boss understands that your flexible schedule would work both ways; that is, even if you’re scheduled to work from home this Wednesday, you’ll come into the office for an important meeting or check in. Go the extra mile without being asked and your boss will have no reason to worry about flexibility. Finally, the best way to prove the value of remote work is to actually work better remotely. That means you’re in regular contact with your team and your boss, whether you’re asking questions or just sending status updates on your projects a couple of times a day. Over-communicating is important here. It also means accomplishing a little more than you might at the office, or digging a little deeper. If you finish something early, ask coworkers over chat or phone if they could use your help for an hour. Make yourself available, just as you would in the office, and no one will be left wondering what you do all day. A dedicated workspace in your home can do wonders for your productivity – it’s hard for anyone to do hard, concentrated work on their sofa with a lap desk. As the end of the established trial period approaches, it would be prudent to present your boss with a summary of your remote accomplishments over the past few months. If you’re sending regular updates, this should be easy to determine. And no matter how sure you are that you’ll love working remotely, you should be mindful of any loneliness or feelings of isolation, and address them by staying in contact with coworker friends over chat, or scheduling lunches with them once in awhile, especially if you work from home the majority of the time. If, after careful preparation and thoughtful presentation, your boss still isn’t having it, don’t be afraid to ask again in a few months. And in the meantime, you could bolster your case by taking a day or two of unscheduled time off and just working from home unasked. If you can show your boss what the company gets out of it, they’ll be hard pressed to say no.  Published on By A new trend is emerging as more fast-food restaurants are turning toward senior citizens to join their workforce rather than teens, per Bloomberg. Walmart has been hiring older workers for years and taking a lot of scrutiny over it, but according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the labor force is changing. In the last 30 years of the 20th century, the number of workers aged 55 and older was the smallest segment of the workforce. Around 2003, this group was no longer the smallest share. Baby Boomers and Gen Xers are now living longer and working longer. The BLS estimates that the number of older Americans who will keep working after the age of 65 will grow by 4.5 percent through 2024. On the other hand, the number of teenagers expected to enter the workforce is expected to drop by 1.4 percent. Many workers in their prime are decreasing, due to the opioid epidemic, unaffordable childcare, and the incarceration rate, which some experts say is beginning to creating a labor shortage. In addition, seniors often have soft skills that teenagers just don’t have. After years in any industry, older Americans know how to be on time, deal with customers and navigate the ins and outs of working. Managers have to teach these skills to teenagers entering the job market. For seniors seeking work in fast food, they aren’t typically interested in moving up the corporate ladder. Financially, it can make sense for a business to hire an older worker over a teenager. A business gets the experience of age without having to pay any more for it. Would your business benefit? We recently reported on the litigation regarding the word “overqualified” being a code word for “too old to hire.” There’s also a concern that older Americans will carry a higher cost or not stay in a position for a long time, but it’s time to kick those stereotypes out. The labor force is changing and fast food chains are leading the charge. Will businesses keep up? Or will employers disregard candidates who will bring much more to the job than just being a body who shows up?

Asit Sharma,10122017,Fool,10052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Tiffany & Company (NYSE:TIF) has a 180 year history as a luxury brand, and the stock has jumped 30% in the last year. They also look at the latest acquisitions from leading consumer brands this week, including Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) $220 million purchase of Topo Chico and Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) acquisition of a New York City start-up. A full transcript follows the video. Asit Sharma: Hey, Vince! Thanks as always for having me back! Shen: Sure. Fools, we're going to turn our attention to the high-end luxury corner of the consumer retail world for this episode. If we watch the clock and we have enough time, we'll also offer some quick updates on the back half of this show as well. The company states outright in its 10-K that the brand is its single most important asset, and it'll invest heavily to maintain it brand perception. That means premium customer service, paying for spots for its stores in high-end malls and luxury areas, selling lots of expensive diamonds and precious stones. Jewelry makes up 90% of the company's business, specifically products with diamonds make up almost 60% of annual revenue. Asit, the stock is up about 30% in the last year, handily outperforming the broad market. Can you tell us about some of the latest developments at the company? Sharma: Sure. The most important development begins with the top line. Sales have dropped about 6% over the last two years. In 2015, Tiffany & Company booked $4.25 billion in sales, and that's dropped over the last two years to about $4 billion in 2016. So as a result, Tiffany replaced its CEO Frederic Cumenal, who was only there for 22 months, with Alessandro Bogliolo in July. Shen: Good timing there. Sharma: Tiffany & Company, the next CEO you hire, can you please give us a name that's easier to pronounce? But having said that, Bogliolo is the former CEO of Italian jeans and fashion house Diesel Clothing Company, and he also had a long stint in Bulgari & Company, which, for those of you who love high-end fashion and maybe live in a big city, New York, Chicago, you've certainly seen these beautiful stores and their beautiful products, a worthy competitor to Tiffany & Company. So Bogliolo's mission is to expand Tiffany's cachet, as Vinyce mentioned, to a younger demographic, to millennials, to revitalize the brand without impacting that strong resonance it has as an aspirational brand, and a brand that, at the end of the day, stands the test of time. So those are the most recent developments for Tiffany & Company. Shen: I would say, the timing there, by the way, you mentioned, of the CEO was perfect, because his official start date happened to be yesterday. As we watch the progress the company makes, it's really starting day one right now. Some big opportunities that you see management mention and see them play out in the numbers a bit, there's this new leadership change, they talk about new product categories that are intended to appeal to some of those younger consumers that you mentioned, they talk about the growth of their online sales, which are still a small portion of the company's business at this point, I believe 6% as of the end of their physical 2016. Then, they also have their international footprint to lean on. You'll see that going back to some of the quarterly reports, you'll notice a trend in that the Asian markets, which the company breaks down into Japan and Asia Pacific. And for that Asia Pacific region, China makes up over half of that, those regions have tended to deliver strong results, either flat or positive growth compared to some of the declines in the company's biggest market, the Americas and the U.S. specifically, which makes up almost half of all revenue. I feel like a company like this will face some cyclical challenges in that economic downturns will often hurt luxury sales. The company struggled a bit during the financial crisis. But another long-term headwind that I want to focus on is something you mentioned, and it's kind of topic on people's minds right now, and that seems to be decreasing interest in diamonds, especially among younger consumers. With some of the controversies surrounding sourcing for precious stones, for example, with conflict diamonds, and in general, we've talked in other industries, whether it's with restaurants, consumer packaged goods, snacks, beverages, whatever it may be, people are worried about environmental concerns, sourcing, sustainability. And that seems to be flowing into this business as well. What is the company really facing here? Sharma: The company is facing a similar problem that we've seen in many industries that we talk about here where consumer goods stands. We'll talk about Coca-Cola a little bit later in this show, but that's a great analog. Coca-Cola has been impacted by changing consumer tastes, the fact that if you have small children and you've grown up in this society and have a more sustainable bent about you and are more health conscious, you're not necessarily going to give your kids as much of that beverage, Coca-Cola, as you drank when you were small. The same with Tiffany -- we have these mini cycles ... larger ways where consumers' perceptions of the brand and what's behind the brand evolve. And for Tiffany, it has to be careful about the sourcing of its diamonds, and it has to show the consumer that they can enjoy the products, that is the aesthetic quality of the product, the brand cachet, but also feel good about the provenance of that. Where did the diamond come from? Is it responsibly sourced? Is it a blood diamond? So that's a drag that Tiffany is going to have to meet and continue to have a brand perception that customers can feel good about. I think they can beat that challenge. What's interesting to me is, it's going all the way to the other extreme to deal with a little bit less high-margin revenue from the retail diamonds in that it's in the wholesale diamond business. This is something that I really wasn't as much aware of until I was doing prep for this segment. The company has a fast-growing business, particularly in Asia, in the wholesale diamond trade. Now, that's got a much smaller margin than the luxury jewelry, the pendant necklace that you buy at their flagship stores. However, in these last two quarters, the company has booked $61 million of revenue from wholesale diamond trade. Now, that's only 3% of Tiffany & Company's total revenue over the last two quarters, of that $1.8 billion I mentioned. But it's growing at a 50% clip year over year. So you can see how, within a few quarters, if it can maintain that focus, this low margin part of the diamond trade will be a bigger portion of the company's bottom line, a little bit of a drag on earnings but it's a smart way, just as Coca-Cola has moved away from only selling those sugary sodas, and as we'll talk about a little bit later, and is moving into some other types of products that customers can feel better about. Shen: Why don't we just jump right into that, Asit? I think this is going to be a focus for the new CEO as he heads up the operations for the company. Can you tell us a little bit about what the company is expanding into, but also trying to help, in terms of appealing to the young consumers that it wants to bring on board? Sharma: Sure. It's two big picture avenues that Tiffany & Company is taking. One, like other companies of its ilk in many industries, it's firming up its approach to e-commerce. And this is one industry which, you can see Amazon.com is not as much of a threat as it is with so many companies we talk about on this show. It almost seems that, whatever segment we have, Vince, Amazon looms large. Shen: Yeah, absolutely. Sharma: Tiffany & Company has a really nice e-commerce portal that tries to recreate the experience of being in the stores. It's difficult, let's be honest, to match the experience. If you've had the opportunity to walk into one of their larger stores, it's impossible to actually recreate that. But you can recreate some of the ambience, some of the desire around the product. And what I love about this is, Tiffany & Company has done a smart job of breaking its products into different pricing. Very quickly, when you visit the homepage after a click or two, it just flat-out gives you the choice -- here are products under $250, then it gradates up to $1,000, $2,500, and beyond, sort of like when you sort on Amazon, which, I'm somewhat cheap on some things, so I will often sort by price. You don't feel like you've lost luxury of experience, but you can quickly go to the price point that interests you, and I think that's a really good approach on their part and will increase the flow of millennial traffic. Millennials as a whole, I don't think they're cheap like me, I'm a bit older, but I think they're thrifty. They know what they want, and they know how much they're willing to pay for certain products, especially luxury items of the type that Tiffany sells. So that flow going through their portal to completing that, converting that customer, is pretty well done. The other thing that the company is also pragmatically undertaking is its product line. They're moving more into products like watches. This year, they will improve and expand their women's line of watches, which is a huge market. The current CEO has experience with that. For those of you who are into the fashion house of Diesel, you know that they have very attractive watch offerings. So not simply price points, but looking at what millennials buy, what's important to them. They may not be in the market for a beautiful diamond or heart-shaped brooch like your grandmother was, but they could use a watch because they're tired of staring into their phone for hours a day. Shen: Sure. I think that's a piece of the strategy the company will have going forward. At the same time, I'm a little bit skeptical, when we were doing research for this, I found a lot of headlines talking about how high-end jewelry, diamonds are on this strong downward trend in terms of popularity, like we mentioned, with millennials and younger consumers in general. But I feel like, with a company like Tiffany, with a very aspirational brand, they talk about how they will invest in their inventory to have lots of very pricey and extravagant diamonds and precious gemstones, because they want customers to go into the store and feel like there are things that they cannot afford. It's aspirational. And I feel like that's something for young consumers that they will grow into over time as their tastes change and mature, as they grow older. I think the long-term picture for this company, there are always going to be people who appreciate what Tiffany represents in terms of the luxury world. So it will always have that moat. Any final thoughts from you, Asit, in terms of this challenge the company faces, and thoughts on what the outlook might be? Sharma: I think the company will be able to meet the challenges we talked about earlier. And also, these declining trends of interest in diamonds. That's somewhat geographically based. In the United States, we have a very advanced society on the curve of industrial development. But again, in China, if you look at India, which has a burgeoning middle class, and they love to buy gold objects, diamonds are the next step up. There is a market out there. It depends on where their focus is, and the company avidly seeks locations in Southeast Asia to expand. So they know where their future customers, who will still be interested in diamonds, exist. And I think that's simply numbers for them, that's one way they'll be able to counteract the trends that we see in places like Europe and the United States, where that interest is somewhat declining. Shen: Perfect. Thank you, Asit. For our next update here, we have two stories. The first is with Coca-Cola. They opened the week with the news that the company would be acquiring Topo Chico for over $200 million. I've never had a chance to try its products myself, but Topo Chico is an imported sparkling water brand from Mexico that's very popular in selected regions of the country, especially Texas, which makes up about 70% of Topo Chico's sales. The brand has a long history dating back over 100 years to 1895, and it seems to be a big part of its allure and popularity with consumers. Asit, this deal is made as part of Coca-Cola's Venturing & Emerging Brands unit. We've talked about this unit before, it's a really interesting part of the company. Can you tell us about this unit within the Coca-Cola umbrella? Sharma: Sure. VEB, Venturing & Emerging Brands group, functions as a venture capital arm within Coca-Cola. Their mission is to go out into very far reaches of the soft drink or beverage world and find companies that are developing brand which Coca-Cola can buy. Now, for Coca-Cola to buy a brand, it really has to have $10 to $20 million in sales. Then, it can scale those sales up to $200 million and beyond. But VEB doesn't necessarily have to find companies that are selling that much from the outset. They really take an ear-to-the-ground approach and try to meet with small companies when they're just forming up in start-up phase, and keep in touch with them, as many venture capitalists do with technology companies, in the hopes that they find a brand or label just starting to gain traction, and they have the advantage of the first-mover, they have a relationship with the entrepreneurs and can write a big check, acquire the rights, and then scale. I think this group has been effective. Some of you drink Honest Tea, that was a transaction that the VEB Group consummated. And this week's transaction, also consummated by the VEB Group, they did it with the Mexican bottler ARCA Continental for $220 million. And this is interesting for those who are wondering how Coke will parlay the strategy of small, tuck-in acquisitions. Previously, Coca-Cola was buying up some small labels and manufacturing product. But the company has sold its bottling operations over the past year to bottling partners in North America and throughout the world. And by next year, Coca-Cola is going to exist more as a marketing company than an actual manufacturer. And this is one of the first transactions we see how great that business model is, because Coca-Cola actually acquired the rights to Topo Chico rather than buying all of the manufacturing and trying to go bottle this product itself. Shen: Yeah. I want to mention a few other aspects of how the Venturing & Emerging Brands unit approaches its investments, and kind of apply that to this latest purchase that they've made for about $220 million. So the unit was established in 2007, and they're looking for these potential billion-dollar brands. But the thing is, they're focused on products that are outside of Coca-Cola's traditional carbonated soda and sugary beverages, because the business unit claims to think five to 10 years ahead about where the beverage industry is going, and the signs of the leaves seem to point away from some of those traditional Coca-Cola sodas. And you mentioned Honest Tea, for example, this was a pretty early success for the company. They made an initial investment of over $40 million in 2008 when the company had less than 100 employees and just $30 million in revenue. Almost a decade later, Coca-Cola has totally taken over the Honest Tea brand, and the latest number from 2015 puts Honest Tea sales at almost $180 million. So the formula here is, they have Phase I, they identify the opportunities. Phase II, they take a venture capital role and make that initial investment. And that seems to be where we are here with Topo Chico. The next phase, then, is when they start taking a greater role and usually a bigger investment as the brand grows its reach. This seems to be a pretty standard formula for the company, in terms of what options they have for Topo Chico. It has 70% of its sales in Texas, it has really strong market share there, and management has actually spoken to this idea about recreating this success and building more ""Texases"", basically growing Coca-Cola's share of the still-growing sparkling water industry, which at this point is still dominated by private label store brands that you might see at the grocery store, for example. Estimates I found pinned Topo Chico revenue at less than $70 million for 2016. So we know this is not exactly moving the needle for a company this size. Coca-Cola, keep in mind, despite the fact that their revenue is going down because of this restructuring they've done, you mentioned in terms of the bottling operations, they still had almost $40 billion in sales in the last 12 months. I think, basically, you have to think about what the company is going to be able to leverage, and I think Coca-Cola is legendary in terms of its ability to leverage its marketing machine, and allow Topo Chico to ride that and scale. Even though it's only available in 35 states and regions of Northern Mexico already, the brand is not that familiar outside of Texas. And I'm sure Coca-Cola will be working a lot to remedy that. But if you are a Coca-Cola shareholder or you're considering a position in the company and you're trying to adopt a Foolish long-term perspective, I guess the question becomes, do these satellite brands and venture capital-like investments have the ability to eventually offset some of the major declines that are expected with traditional soda consumption? What do you think, Asit? Sharma: In this case, it certainly does. Very interestingly, as you mentioned, revenues for Topo Chico are 70% in Texas. You can visualize a small band on the map of the U.S. border, this drink is actually manufactured in Northern Mexico, and it's sold in Northern Mexico. South of Northern Mexico and north of Texas, there's tremendous potential. Some of our listeners may know, Mexico is the second largest market for Coca-Cola outside of the United States, and Coca-Cola has been hit hard by Mexican government tariffs on sugary soft drinks. So this is an excellent way for Coca-Cola not just to take an exciting brand and scale it but to make up for lost revenue. It's exactly what you want to see as a long-term shareholder. What's the strategy to replace the declining revenue? And that is such an opportunity that falls into Coke's hands. I don't how many of our listeners, maybe you can tweet to us if you've tried it, those of you who are down deep in the South -- I've tried it. I've got my hands on some several months ago from my local Latin American store. It's an interesting drink. It has a very colorful label. Effervescence is a little bit higher than sparkling waters you might buy here, at least to me. It's got a little bit of a salt taste to it. So it's something that offers a different segment opportunity for Coca-Cola, a new brand that they can push out there, and it's beloved by hipsters in Texas. So, there's that cachet that we talked about with Tiffany. They may have some hipster cachet that they can expand on. I think it absolutely does fulfill that problem that you mentioned, Vince. We'll watch this one to see how far they can scale it in the next few years, for sure. Shen: I think it's interesting, that popularity that it has in Texas, has a lot to do, I think, with the heritage of the brand itself, again, dating back over 100 years. The company, in the release, there's a Q&A with some executives from the Venturing & Emerging Brands unit talking about how important it is for them to maintain that heritage and tradition for this brand, despite the fact that they're going to be putting it into the machine and expanding its presence across the country. We'll be watching to see what kind of success they have, whether this can be a next Honest Tea for them. But ultimately, this unit within Coca-Cola has invested in over something like 40 different brands at this point. Not every single one is going to be a major success, but if we know anything about this company, they certainly have the resources and the experience in beverages to experiment and test and find these small labels and help turn them into enormous successes. For our last story, it's yet another recent development from Wal-Mart. I know we've been hitting a lot of Wal-Mart coverage on the show lately, so I'll tentatively promise that this will be the last bit for the king of retail for at least a few weeks, if not a few months. But I won't deny that it's been pretty fascinating to follow along with the various experiments and new initiatives that Marc Lore has rolled out as the head of the company's e-commerce efforts. That's not to mention what Wal-Mart has done with the Jet.com business itself. The company actually announced this morning that it would be acquiring a small start-up called Parcel. What's the story here, Asit? Sharma: Parcel is, like you say, a small company that focuses on last mile and same day delivery in New York City. The transaction size was not disclosed, but it is said to be about $10 million. So you can imagine, this is a very tiny company. What would Wal-Mart want to do with a company that it can purchase for $10 million that's located in New York City of all places, a very dense city? The answer is that last-mile services are the hardest part of the logistics supply chain, the most expensive part pound-for-pound. Amazon.com, a fierce competitor to Wal-Mart, has partnered up with the United States Postal Service to solve last mile problems. But what's so interesting is, in New York City, there's a lot of opportunity for Jet.com to basically be a test kitchen for different ventures. And Parcel helps Jet.com, which Wal-Mart acquired, listeners will remember, for $3 billion. Parcel helps Jet.com test delivery services within dense populations like New York City. So we should talk about Uniquely J, which is Jet.com's answer to the Whole Foods-Amazon.com partnership. Uniquely J is a service developed by Jet.com to offer high-end food products and also products such as cleaning supplies, bath tissues, to customers for delivery, probably within that same two-hour window that Amazon.com promises. Parcel lets Jet.com make that last mile delivery, and it gives this experimental template for Wal-Mart to go into big cities where it doesn't necessarily want to put a Supercenter -- places like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago -- and have a supplemental business model while also trying to kick Amazon.com in the shins. Shen: I think this is where everything comes together. We have this small start-up logistics company to help organize same-day deliveries for New York City. It has some of the infrastructure, the staff, and experience in the city to ramp up the potential same-day shipping efforts for Jet.com and Wal-Mart.com in that market. At the same time, I believe that Parcel is already handling some of the deliveries, for example, for Bonobos, which also happened to be acquired by Wal-Mart earlier this year. And that becomes part of this overall plan where everything is starting to come together a little bit for the company's e-commerce efforts. They talk about the Bonobos and Modcloth acquisitions, these are men's and women's apparel companies. Now, Wal-Mart has recently announced that they intend to make both those brands available on Jet.com. So Jet.com previously having more of a discount reputation, they're starting to offer those two brands on there, raising the cachet, again, another time that we're using that, the brand premium that's associated with the site. And with Uniquely J, they've also mentioned that this private label Jet.com brand that's going to roll out with consumer staples in the next couple of months, they want it to target some of these urban-based millennials. So they'll get a similar theme here, because these Uniquely J products are supposed to be higher-end to appeal to that target market. Again, as you mentioned, this really follows closely on the heels of Amazon, which has made its 365 by Whole Foods products available online, and the initial reports for that said it was met with great success, a lot of items selling out very quickly. So we've spoken previously about the solid growth Wal-Mart is enjoying in its digital business. I ultimately believe this is still a marathon. These are all small moves on the chessboard for the company. Ultimately, Wal-Mart wants to widen its appeal with the help of Jet.com, and its reputation as a younger, cooler brand while establishing the necessary infrastructure and logistics it will need to provide greater convenience to customers in these various urban markets, obviously starting first with this one Parcel deal right in New York City. Any other takeaways for you, Asit, in terms of what this spells for the future, in terms of this arms race between the big retailers? Sharma: Sure, one last point. And by the way, what a great example, because these are two grand masters that are playing a very long game of chess. I was really intrigued by this acquisition, because Wal-Mart is taking such a different approach than Amazon. Everyone knows Amazon builds fulfillment centers every year all across the U.S. from the ground up, supplies them with amazing automation and technology. Wal-Mart is picking up on something that I was actually reading about in Supply Chain Newsletter several months ago, that there's a ton of warehouse space in cities like New York, in Brooklyn, where I believe Parcel is based, in Chicago, in almost any big city you can think of. You've seen how urban drift has created this. It's space that's unleased, perfectly usable, and very capital-lite for a company like Wal-Mart. So it's developing a model where it can have its own quasi-fulfillment centers which are just in big cities to deliver that last mile much more cheaply than if it tried to compete with Amazon and think of itself as a company that's going to build a bunch of its own fulfillment centers. Of course, Wal-Mart thinks that its super stores themselves are quasi-fulfillment centers, and they have a point, because they're so large. But I'm intrigued from the real estate aspect of this. Again, if this is a chess move, to me, this is equal to a threat on the chessboard. It's like calling check, and the other opponent over time is going to have to make sure that his king is well-protected. So we'll follow that as well.

    What Does the Future Hold for Tiffany & Co.? -- The Motley Fool

  "
Robert Schroeder,10122017,MarketWatch,10052017,"Published: Oct 12, 2017 12:10 p.m. ET President promises ‘great, great’ health care in White House ceremony By President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday directing federal agencies to consider expanding health-insurance coverage in low-cost plans that are not subject to Affordable Care Act rules, a move that could raise costs for sicker people. The order is designed to provide what the White House calls “alternatives” to plans offered through Obamacare markets. It comes after the implosion last month of Republicans’ latest attempt to dismantle President Barack Obama’s signature health-care law, a chief policy goal that Trump and GOP lawmakers campaigned on. See:  Senate Republicans junk last-gasp effort to kill Obamacare. Speaking before signing the order at a White House ceremony, Trump said consumers “will have so many options.” “People will have great, great health care,” he added. Trump also ordered the labor secretary to consider expanding consumers’ access to so-called association health plans. Those plans could allow employers to form groups across state lines, and allow access to more plans and lower rates, the White House says. The order does not, however, allow such plans to market directly to individuals. While the order stops short of dismantling Obamacare, health-insurance experts worry about the effect it could have on coverage. They say it could raise costs for the sick by drawing healthier and younger Americans to alternative plans, which could be less expensive. States currently regulate health plans within their borders. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has said interstate sales “will start a race to the bottom by allowing companies to choose their regulator.” Trump was joined at the event by Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, who said the order would allow “millions of people” to buy insurance across state lines. Market reaction to the news was muted.

The forecast has proven to be correct, yet it wasn’t rocket science. It was based on a simple observation that new money pours into Wall Street at the beginning of a quarter from pension funds.

                                   Let’s explore that investment starting with a chart. Chart Please click here for a larger annotated chart of Intel’s stock. Please note the following from the chart: • This is a weekly chart and, thus, is of more value in analyzing a breakout. • The price of Intel is breaking out. • The breakout is from a so-called triple top. • Breakouts from a triple top tend to have a higher probability of being successful. • The RSI (relative strength index) is barely overbought and shows that there is significantly more room to run. • The breakout is on low volume. This is negative and poses risks for those buying at current levels. Ask Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to Nigam Arora. Why the breakout now? The gurus are out in full force regurgitating the old news as a reason for the breakout. My 30-plus years of experience in the markets has shown that breakouts are seldom caused by stale news. The real reason for the breakout is that many risk-averse investors are searching for cheap stocks that are also laggards. Intel fits the bill on both counts. At least in theory, there is less risk in buying Intel today than a high-flying competitor. Here’s how Intel has fared over the past month compared with its Dow rivals: Further, a significant amount of money is tied to so-called quant strategies. Many quant strategies — based on computer models — work on mean reversion. Managers with such strategies are buyers of Intel at this time. In plain English, it means that stocks that have not risen with the broader market are now likely to increase. The strong group Intel is the largest U.S. semiconductor company. The semiconductor group, as represented by semiconductor ETF

                                   has been one of the strongest groups in the stock market. At late stages of an advance, historically the weakest stocks in a strong group tend to stage breakouts. Dividend and valuation The dividend and valuation will provide support in case there is a market decline. Intel’s dividend yield is 2.86%. Intel also has a much cheaper valuation than its competitors. Achilles heel Intel’s Achilles heel has been its reliance on PCs. Personal computers have been in a long decline. This is the reason the stock has lagged not only the broader market, as represented by the popular S&P 500 ETF

                                   are working on artificial intelligence. Even though Intel is behind, it is likely to find plenty of opportunities. Intel recently unveiled an artificial-intelligence chip called Loihi that mimics the human brain using an old neuromorphic technology. This technology uses spiking neurons as the basic computing unit instead of the logic gates that are used in conventional processors Altera acquisition Intel acquired Altera, a maker of programmable logic chips, in 2015. These chips have applications in all sorts of industries, ranging from automotive to telecommunications. In the future, this acquisition may give Intel an edge in artificial intelligence. Mobileye acquisition Intel recently purchased Mobileye, a maker of systems for autonomous cars. This gives Intel a foothold in an important growth area. Price target and how to buy it The Arora Report’s long-term target on Intel is $56 to $58. If Intel’s stock rises, it may see profit-taking in the zone of $42 to $44, and then around $50. In recognition that all investors are different, at The Arora Report we provide guidance on different ways of investing. Those buying today may note that the breakout is on a low volume and October tends to be a volatile month. So those buying now may want to scale in. And those who are more conservative may wait for a pullback into the buy zone of $35 to $37.63. There is a 70% probability of a pullback into this zone in the next 120 days.

After a House vote, the Senate approved a budget bill on Thursday. Republicans passed tax cuts through what is known as budget reconciliation, which requires just a simple majority in the Senate. Republicans currently control the Senate with 52 seats. A persistent uptrend for stocks have been partially underpinned by the hope of tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump, with a likelihood of the passage of a pro-business tax policy often propelling buying in assets perceived as risky. What are strategists saying? • “Up until a week ago there has been a lot of pessimism among investors that the Trump administration cannot pass any tax reforms, especially after the failure to repeal the [Affordable Healthcare Act]. But that seems to have changed last week, when the [Big Six] outlined their tax plan and more people now believe companies’ earnings will be boosted by lower tax rates,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated investors. The so-called Big Six includes the leaders of the House and Senate, national economic director Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. • “The path of least resistance for markets seems to be higher. Revisions on the earnings front have been positive, the global growth theme is continuing, and I think valuations are fine, given where we are in terms of inflation,” said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. “There are no classic signs of exuberance that would derail the market’s trajectory, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see multiples and earnings go higher, absent some crazy macro shock that no one can forecast.” See: Some investors see signs stock market ‘on verge’ of a melt-up Which stocks are in focus?

                                   from flooding the market with their appliances. Section 201 “provides that if the U.S. International Trade Commission (the Commission) determines that an article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article,” the president can take action to address the imbalance, the USITC said in a statement. The commission launched an investigation of the issue in June that resulted in a 4-0 vote. The USITC will hold a public hearing on Oct. 19 and will present a report to President Donald Trump by December 4. Trump will be responsible for the final decision on whether to offer relief to the U.S. industry and what kind of relief may be offered. The commission will consider recommending such moves as an increase in a duty, a quota, a tariff-rate quote, trade adjustment assistance or any combination of the above. Whirlpool welcomed the vote and said it’s an important win for American manufacturers and American workers. “For the third time since 2013, the ITC has found that Samsung and LG engaged in unlawful conduct by violating U.S. trade laws,” Chairman Jeff Fettig said in a statement. “This vote sets the stage for the administration to put in place an effective remedy to create a level playing field for American workers and manufacturers. This type of corrective action will create U.S. manufacturing jobs.” Read also: Like Amazon, these seven stocks have dropped 10% or more in a month — and analysts say buy them too Whirlpool has criticized the South Korean companies for operating “screwdriver operations,” or plants that assemble major parts that are brought in from overseas for final assembly, instead of investing the money needed to operate full manufacturing facilities. Samsung said it was disappointed with the decision and that it would hurt American consumers by limiting their choices, raising prices and offering less innovation in washing machines. “We remain committed to establishing our North American home appliance manufacturing facility in South Carolina and to delivering the most innovative washing machines, made by Americans, and sold to American consumers,” the company said in a statement. “We urge the Commission to consider carefully how potential remedies might hinder the establishment and operations of this facility and affect American consumers.” See:  Sears to sell Kenmore brand on Amazon In its most recent quarter, Whirlpool had sales of $5.348 billion, up from $5.198 billion in the year-earlier period.

Tony Robbins,10122017,MarketWatch,10052017,"Published: Oct 11, 2017 10:35 a.m. ET Take charge of your money before giving it to a professional manager By This is the first of a series of articles from life- and business strategist Tony Robbins on sharpening your investing and personal-finance skills. Doctors, lawyers, and certified public accountants in the United States are legally required to act in the best interests of the people they serve. Yet financial advisers get a free pass. There are more than 200 different designations for financial advisers, including “financial consultants,” “wealth managers,” “financial advisers,” “investment consultants,” “wealth advisers,” and — in case that doesn’t sound exclusive enough — “private wealth advisers.” But the reality is, of the roughly 310,000 financial advisers in the U.S., less than 10% are legally obligated to put your interests first at all times on all of your accounts. These are called “registered investment advisers” or RIAs for short. RIAs don’t accept sales commissions. Instead, they typically charge a flat fee or a percentage of your total assets for unbiased financial advice. It’s a cleaner model that removes awkward conflicts of interest and hidden agendas. As for the other 90%, they’re simply brokers in disguise. Many of them work for enormous Wall Street banks, brokerage houses, and insurance companies — the kind that splash their names on sports arenas. Why does this matter? Because brokers have a vested interest in hawking expensive products, which might include actively managed mutual funds, whole-life insurance policies, variable annuities, and “wrap” accounts. Don’t get me wrong, this is not an indictment on the good people that work in the industry. I have lots of friends and clients in the financial industry, so I’m speaking with firsthand knowledge when I tell you that they — and the vast majority of their colleagues — are people of real integrity. They have good hearts and good intentions. The trouble is, they work in a system that’s beyond their control — a system that has tremendously powerful financial incentives to focus on maximizing profits above all else. This is a system that richly rewards employees who put their employer’s interests first, their own interests second, and their clients’ interests a distant third. Even the best-intentioned financial advisers are often working within the confines of this system. They’re under intense pressure to grow profits, and they’re rewarded for doing so. If you — the client — happen to do well, too, that’s great. But don’t kid yourself. You’re not the priority. And for folks like you and me, that’s a recipe for disaster — unless we take the precaution of learning how the system works against us, and how to counter it. How do you start? By making sure to ask these seven questions of a financial adviser, or any adviser, you are considering: 1. Are you a registered investment adviser? If the answer is no, this adviser is a broker. Smile sweetly and say good-bye. If the answer is yes, he or she is required by law to be a fiduciary. But you still need to figure out if this fiduciary is wearing one hat or two. That’s because Its not enough that your financial adviser is an independent RIA. You need to be careful that the RIA is not also a broker. You heard that right. In a strangely allowable arrangement, an RIA can be both a broker and a fiduciary in a process called “dual registration.” When someone is “dually registered,” at one moment they play the part of an unbiased adviser, reassuring you that they abide by the fiduciary standard and can provide you with conflict-free advice for a fee. But they can switch hats and act as a broker, earning commissions or kickbacks by selling you specific products. When they’re playing this broker role, they no longer have to abide by the fiduciary standard. In other words, they’re sometimes obliged to serve your best interests and sometimes not. How warped is that? These arrangements are perhaps the most dangerous for consumers as it creates immense confusion. 2. Are you or your firm affiliated with a broker-dealer? If the answer is yes, you’re dealing with someone who can act as a broker and usually has an incentive to steer you to specific investments. One easy way to figure this out is to glance at the bottom of the adviser’s website or business card and see if there’s a sentence like this: “Securities offered through [adviser’s company name], member FINRA and SIPC.” This refers to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, respectively. If you see these words, it means he or she can act as a broker. If so, run. Run for your life! 3. Does your firm offer proprietary mutual funds or separately managed accounts? You want the answer to be an emphatic “no.” If the answer is yes, then watch your wallet. It probably means they’re looking to generate additional revenues by steering you into these products that are highly profitable for them (but probably not for you). 4. Do you or your firm receive any third-party compensation for recommending particular investments? This is the ultimate question you want answered. Why? Because you need to know that your adviser has no incentive to recommend products that will shower him or her with commissions, kickbacks, consulting fees, trips, or other goodies. 5. What’s your philosophy when it comes to investing? This will help you to understand whether or not the adviser believes that he or she can beat the market by picking individual stocks or actively managed funds. 6. What financial planning services do you offer beyond investment strategy and portfolio management? Investment help may be all you need, depending on your stage of life. But as you grow older and/or you become more wealthy with various holdings to manage, things often become more complex financially. For example, you may need to deal with saving for a child’s college education, retirement planning, handling your vested stock options, or estate planning. Most advisers have limited capabilities once they venture beyond investing. In fact, most aren’t legally allowed to offer tax advice due to their broker status. Ideally you want an adviser who can bring tools for tax efficiency in all aspects of your planning — from investment planning to business planning to estate planning. 7. Where will my money be held? A fiduciary adviser should always use a third-party custodian to hold your funds. For example, Fidelity, Schwab, and TD Ameritrade all have custodial arms that will keep your money in a secure environment. You then sign a limited power of attorney that gives the adviser the right to manage the money but never to make withdrawals. The good news about this arrangement is that if you ever want to fire your adviser, you don’t have to move your accounts. You can simply hire a new adviser who can take over managing your accounts without missing a beat. This custodial system also protects you from the danger of getting fleeced by a con man like Bernie Madoff. Tony Robbins is a life- and business strategist and author.

Jillian Berman,10122017,MarketWatch,10052017,"Published: Oct 11, 2017 2:33 p.m. ET Many Latino students who go to college attend the open-access colleges white students are fleeing By The fastest-growing group of workers is being held back by our higher education system. Between 1992 and 2016, the share of the population made up by Latinos grew by 9%, but the share of Latinos with at least some kind of college education grew by just 6% during that same period, according to an analysis published Wednesday by Georgetown University’s Center for Education and the Workforce. Latinos make up a smaller share of workers with good jobs — or jobs that pay a decent salary and have health insurance — that require a bachelor’s degree than they did in 1991, the report notes. What’s more, other demographic groups are seeing faster progress, which means Latinos are losing ground. In this way, Latinos have “essentially stalled” when it comes to obtaining higher education and landing their share of jobs that come with it, said Anthony Carnevale, the director of the Georgetown Center. And qualified Latino students who do enroll in higher education, are more likely to end up in schools where they may struggle to graduate or find a decent job. Each year, 125,000 Latino high school students earn test scores that would put them in the top half of the nation’s students. But just 26,000 enroll in one of the 500 most selective colleges in the country, according to the report. Instead, 65% of Latino students who go to college attend the open-access colleges white students are fleeing; white enrollment at these schools has dropped 18% since 2004, the report adds. Latino students “are largely consigned to the lower, crowded and underfunded two-year and four-year parts of the system,” Carnevale said. “That has real implications for their graduation and success.” “There’s a general presumption in the United States almost always with respect to new groups, especially immigrant groups, that it’s okay if people are behind, so long as they’re always getting better off, so long as there’s progress,” Carnevale said. “What this report shows is that that’s not really true for Hispanics. The presumption that they’re making steady progress is way overstated.” There are a variety of factors undermining their progress, Carnevale noted. For one, Latinos are poised to go to college in larger numbers at a time when college is expensive. Students are also increasingly relying on a combination of work and loans to pay for school. These trends are in part a result of decreased investment from state and local governments in higher education. Contrast that with white Americans who began going to college in large numbers for the first time when the GI bill became available, helping them pay for school. “They’ve got to make a very fast transition” from relying on decent-paying blue-collar jobs, which are shrinking, Carnevale said of Latino students. “The current state of higher education is not friendly to that. It’s very selective, high priced and offers very little support.” Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

                                    hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has knifed to the 2,550 technical target, punctuating a steep October breakout. The initial pullback has been distinctly flat. Tactically, near-term support (2,540) is followed by an inflection point matching the third-quarter close of 2,519. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has sustained a break to record territory. Here again, near-term support remains poorly-defined, though inflection points are illustrated. The Dow’s first notable floor matches the breakout point, circa 22,420, also illustrated on the daily chart. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite has snapped a stretch of six straight record closes. Though still near-term extended, and due to consolidate, Monday’s 10-point downturn barely registers. The Nasdaq’s first notable floor broadly spans from 6,460 to 6,477, matching the breakout point, better illustrated below. Widening the view to six months, the Nasdaq has confirmed its primary uptrend. The prevailing breakout originates from a tight September range, underpinned by major support at 6,342. The late-September low registered less than two points higher. To reiterate, the 6,460 breakout point matches the first notable floor against the current backdrop. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has taken flight. The October breakout punctuates a flag pattern pinned to the early-September rally. Separately, consider that the 50-day moving average, currently 22,130, has risen to match the September breakout point, technically 22,118. The prevailing leg higher originates from three successful retests of the 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has also refused to materially pull in. Consider that its closing high of 2,552 matches the projected target, technically 2,551. (Take the July peak minus the August low: 2,484 - 2,417 = 67 points. Then, add to the breakout point: 2,484 + 67 = 2,551.) Separately, the S&P’s 50-day moving average, currently 2,483, closely matches the September breakout point. Broadly speaking, the major U.S. benchmarks are off to a strong fourth-quarter start. Each index has confirmed its primary uptrend as the October earnings season approaches, and amid recently hawkish-leaning Federal Reserve policy language. Against this backdrop, the small-caps have recently staged the bull trend’s headline technical event.

                                   chart includes the 20-day Bollinger bands, also known as volatility bands. Those bands, illustrated in red, encompass two standard deviations of the small-cap benchmark’s 20-day volatility. As always, consecutive closes atop the bands signal a tension between two time horizons. Though near-term overbought, and due to consolidate, bullish momentum has been statistically unusual, improving the chances of longer-term follow-through higher. In the present case, the small-cap benchmark’s breakout encompassed three closes higher across a four-session window. Bullish price action. Tactically, near-term support (147.44) is followed by the firmer breakout point, circa 145.25. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has also broken out, though slightly less decisively. Its October breakout included a lone close atop the 20-day Bollinger bands (not illustrated). More broadly, the mid-cap benchmark’s prevailing leg higher builds on the late-2016 rally, illustrated on the three-year chart. All told, the U.S. benchmarks’ strong bull trend continues to defy seasonal tendencies. A grinding-higher summer rally has been punctuated by consecutive September and October technical breakouts. Moreover, the October rally has been statistically unusual in spots, though in different spots than the strong early-September breakout. More plainly, the technical backdrop remains rotational, and the bull trend firmly-grounded. As it applies to the S&P 500, the index has reached the 2,550 target and a consolidation phase is underway. Tactically, near-term support (2,508) is followed by a firmer floor (2,480) closely matching the 50-day moving average. The S&P’s intermediate-term uptrend is firmly intact barring a violation.

Fans of the beverage, rejoice: Beer may have a bad reputation for its empty calories and the “beer bellies” but, some research suggests, it could have some health benefits. For 35 years, Americans have been celebrating beer at the festival. The event has unlimited one-ounce tastings of more than 3,500 beers, plus competitions between some 800 breweries. Also see:  How everything changed for a craft beer brewer after it sold itself to MillerCoors How could beer actually be good for you? Beer could lower the risk of diabetes, according to a Danish study published this week in the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. Among 70,000 people, including both drinkers and non-drinkers, the lowest risk of diabetes was in the group of men who had 14 drinks a week and women who had nine drinks a week. “Moderate drinking is key here,” said Michelle Dudash, a registered dietitian and author of “Clean Eating for Busy Families.” Like wine, it does not contain any added sugar once it’s fermented. Cocktails, on the other hand, are often made with sugary ingredients like simple syrups, Dudash said. There are also a lot of light beers on the market now with half the calories, Dudash said. People should watch the alcohol content of beers, which could alter the number of beers they should be drinking, since a higher percentage in alcohol content means they should have fewer beers. The average is 5%, so drinking a beer with 7% alcohol content would be the equivalent of 1.4 beers, Dudash said. Also see: This is what Guinness is doing to sell more stout Drinking beer can promote heart health, similarly to wine, a 2016 study Penn State University found. Moderate drinkers — one to two drinks a day for men, and a half to one drink a day for women — saw the slowest decline in “good” cholesterol levels (also known as high-density lipoprotein), more so for those who opted for beer over hard liquor with beer drinkers experiencing better outcomes than people who drink hard liquor. That means a lower chance of cardiovascular diseases. The study tracked cholesterol levels in 80,000 participants for six years. Increased levels of high-density lipoprotein keep “bad” cholesterol from blocking arteries, according to Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support Training Center. Beer contains about 12% of the daily recommended amount of vitamin B6, Dudash said, though people with alcohol dependency tend to have lower levels of the vitamin.

The myth of the beer belly There’s actually no hard evidence to suggest a person’s gut comes from consuming a lot of beer, studies claim. That’s good news for those celebrating at the Great American Beer Festival, which runs from Oct. 5 to 7 and is hosted by the Brewers Association, a non-profit trade organization. Drinking a lot of the beverage can increase calorie intake and prevent fat burning, and beer does contain phytoestrogens, which can cause hormonal changes in men that make them more prone to storing belly fat. But again, it comes down to moderation, studies show. One study, published in 2007, men who consumed more than three drinks a day were 80% more likely to have more belly fat than those who didn’t consume as much, but that’s also more than the two drink per day limit for men that other studies suggest is a moderate level of drinking. Also see: Americans are buying beer and a beach vacation at the same time But drinking beer clearly has it’s downsides, right? Just because some beers have lower calories than others, and no added sugars, doesn’t mean guzzling a cold pilsner is the same as eating a kale salad, Dudash said. “I wouldn’t consider it a nutrient-rich food,” she said. What really causes a “beer belly” is too many calories, from any source, including alcohol, sugary beverages and oversized portions of food, according to medical reference site WebMD. Fat is usually stored and seen in men’s stomachs, while for women, it tends to be around the hips, Dudash said. Beers have also been linked to certain cancers when heavily consumed: More than seven beers a week for women and more than 14 beers a week for men. Cancers linked to all alcohol use include mouth, throat, voice box, esophagus, liver, colon and rectum and breast, according to the American Cancer Society. People’s taste for beer has also waned or, at least, changed. They want weaker, lower-alcohol content beers, as sales of wines and spirits are on the rise. The beer industry is becoming more localized The beer landscape is changing.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.72 points to close at 22,773.67, with Chevron and Boeing contributing the most to the losses. The index also snapped a seven-day winning streak. The S&P 500 declined 0.1 percent to 2,549.33, with consumer staples and telecommunications leading decliners. The index also snapped an eight-day winning streak — its longest in four years — and also ended a streak of six straigh record closes, the longest such streak since 1997. The Nasdaq composite eked out a record high, rising 0.07 percent to 6,590.18. The U.S. lost 33,000 jobs September due in large part to two major hurricanes hitting the country. Last month markets the first time the U.S. labor market contracted since 2010. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a gain of 90,000 jobs. Despite the weak headline number, average hourly earnings rose to an annualized rate of 2.9 percent. Hourly earnings are closely watched by investors looking for indications on inflation. The unemployment rate also fell to a 16-year low of 4.2 percent. ""Trying to guess the headline number on this one was a fool's game,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. The report ""looks pretty sloppy from the top, but there's more good news than bad."" Treasury yields jumped after the report's release. The benchmark 10-year yield advanced to 2.362 percent, while the two-year yield rose to 1.51 percent, notching its highest level since 2008. ""Everyone knew the report would be confusing because of the distortions from [hurricanes] Harvey and Irma,"" said Richard Piccirillo, managing director at PGIM Fixed Income. ""But despite the distortions, average hourly earnings went down and unemployment went down. I think the bond market is reacting a bit to that."" The strong wages data also increases the chances of a Federal Reserve rate hike by December, according to Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank. ""Over the past few months, they've reopened the path for another rate hike,"" he said. From before the central bank's previous meeting [to today], the odds of a rate hike have risen from about 30 percent to 80 percent."" Stocks were coming off yet another record-setting session. The S&P 500 posted its sixth straight all-time closing high on Thursday, marking its longest streak of record closes since 1997. The Dow and Nasdaq also notched record highs. The major indexes also posted strong weekly gains, rising more than 1 percent. Sentiment on Wall Street has been lifted lately by strong economic data and renewed hope of tax reform.

,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"(Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, said earnings will grow 13 to 16 percent in 2018 as medical costs remain low, and that it expects to benefit from new insurance products backed by U.S. President Donald Trump. UnitedHealth, the industry bellwether, is the first health insurer to report and its third-quarter net earnings rose 26.3 percent, beating analysts’ expectations. Its shares rose more than 5 percent, also lifting rival insurers such as Anthem Inc, Aetna Inc, and Cigna Corp. Trump, who promised to repeal predecessor Barack Obama’s signature the Affordable Care Act - so-called Obamacare - but failed to do so, last week signed an executive order to weaken it. UnitedHealth sold Obamacare individual plans in about two dozen states before booking financial losses and then mostly pulling out of the market this year. UnitedHealth’s new Chief Executive Dave Wichmann now sees opportunities in the plans outlined by Trump. Those plans envision the creation of more associations that will allow people to band together to buy cheaper, less regulated health plans, and extends the duration of benefit-light short-term plans to one year from three months. Wichmann said the company would work with the administration on the new products it had outlined, and that it already has 300,000 customers in association health plans. “We have a great deal of experience in the areas covered in the first order — short-term policies, association plans and expanded use of HRAs,” Wichmann said on a conference call, referring to taxfree employer-funded health reimbursement accounts. While it could take until 2019 until association plans are for sale, the short-term plan extension may come sooner. Wichmann also said the impact of Trump’s decision to scrap about $7 billion in subsidies paid to health insurance companies for low-income patients would be “extremely small”. The company only has about 30,000 customers who are eligible for these subsidies in four states. Boosting growth next year, the company also expects to increase the number of insurance customers and grow its Optum pharmacy and data businesses, adding to the benefits of its medical costs remaining within a targeted range. Wichmann said the 2018 outlook takes into account the reinstatement of Obamacare’s 3 percent tax on health insurance, putting the cost at about 75 cents in earnings per share growth. The tax was suspended in 2017 and will be back in effect after Republicans failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. UnitedHealth said net earnings rose 26.3 percent to $2.49 billion, or $2.51 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Excluding items, the company earned $2.66 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.56 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said investors had been concerned that the Wall Street consensus was too high and she was now hopeful that profits could rise even further. “Usually they are a conservative company,” Gupte said. The insurer said its withdrawal from individual insurance markets, combined with a health insurance tax deferral, reduced third-quarter revenue by about $1.6 billion and lowered the revenue growth rate by 4 percent. UnitedHealth shares were trading at $204.28, up $11.08, or 5.8 percent. ","

,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"(Reuters) - The U.S. government dropped a lawsuit accusing UnitedHealth Group Inc of submitting false claims to get inflated Medicare payouts, a court filing on Thursday showed, a week after a judge dismissed the complaint but said it could be amended. U.S. District Judge John Walter in Los Angeles ruled that the lawsuit failed to identify any UnitedHealth officers who signed documents vouching for data submitted to the Medicare Advantage program, or to claim that any of them knew they were signing off on false information. “We are pleased with the government’s decision to dismiss these meritless claims,” said UnitedHealth spokesman Matt Burns in a statement. The U.S. Department of Justice, which filed the lawsuit, declined to comment. A second lawsuit by the government, accusing UnitedHealth of obtaining over $1 billion of Medicare payouts it was not entitled to, remains pending. Medicare Advantage, an alternative to the standard fee-for-service Medicare in which private insurers manage health benefits, is the fastest growing form of government health insurance, with enrollment of 18 million people last year. The dismissed lawsuit said that since at least 2005, UnitedHealth knew many of the diagnosis codes it submitted to the Medicare program for increased payments, based on “risk” factors like health status, were not supported by patients’ medical records. But the company turned a blind eye, the lawsuit said, funding and encouraging one-sided chart reviews of patients of HealthCare Partners, which provided services to UnitedHealth beneficiaries in California. As a result, UnitedHealth was able to wrongfully retain risk adjustment payments it received from the government, the lawsuit said. The Department of Justice filed the lawsuit in May after it partially intervened in a whistleblower lawsuit brought by James Swoben, a former employee of Senior Care Action Network Health Plan and a consultant to the risk adjustment industry. The case is U.S. ex rel Swoben v. Scan Health Plan et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 09-cv-05013. ","

,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan deal from two senators to stabilize Obamacare by restoring subsidies to health insurers suffered major setbacks on Wednesday with the White House saying President Donald Trump now opposes it and senior Republicans speaking out against it. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, Senate Republican leadership member John Thune and others expressed hostility to the deal announced on Tuesday by Republican Lamar Alexander and Democrat Patty Murray. It was uncertain if it would ever come to a vote in a Congress controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans. The agreement would shore up Obamacare by reviving billions of dollars of federal subsidies to insurers for two years to help lower-income Americans obtain medical coverage. Alexander said on Wednesday that Trump had “completely engineered” the bipartisan proposal, but the president backed away from support he had expressed a day earlier. On Tuesday, Trump said the White House was involved in the negotiations and that the agreement was “a very good solution” for a short-term approach, but said on Wednesday he could “never support bailing out” insurance companies. Trump has cut off subsidies to the companies, saying Congress has not provided money for them and that they enrich insurers. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump did not support the deal in its current form, although she called it “a good step in the right direction.” “Look, we’ve said all along that we want something that doesn’t just bail out the insurance companies but actually provides relief for all Americans,” she said at a briefing. “And this bill doesn’t address that fact.” The confusion among lawmakers in both parties over Trump’s position on the healthcare deal and the lack of trust some of them have in the president come as Congress is entering a crucial period when important bills on federal spending, the U.S. debt limit and tax cuts are due for consideration. Thune said the agreement might have “stalled out” and that its future was an “open question.” Republicans have a 52-48 Senate majority, but other than Alexander only a few have publicly embraced the plan, including Senators John McCain, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mike Rounds and Bob Corker. “No way to pay for it,” Hatch said. “Oh my gosh, give me a break. I appreciate the innovation and the attempt to do it right. But it doesn’t help.” Trump, who campaigned on a promise to get rid of Obamacare but has been frustrated by the failure of Republicans in Congress to pass legislation to do so, also made clear he wanted broader legislation to repeal and replace the law. “Lamar Alexander’s working on it very hard from our side. And if something can happen, that’s fine,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “But I won’t do anything to enrich the insurance companies. ... They’ve been enriched by Obamacare like nothing anybody’s ever seen before.” Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement dubbed Obamacare, but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income people. Ending the subsidies, which are called cost-sharing reduction payments, could create chaos in the 2018 health insurance markets set up under Obamacare. Some leading insurers, including UnitedHealth Group, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc, have largely exited those markets, citing financial losses. Others including Anthem Inc have significantly reduced their presence in the state-based markets. Ryan gave no indication of willingness to consider the Alexander-Murray agreement. “The speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare,” Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said. The proposal drew broad Democratic support. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer ripped Trump for his shifting stances on the Alexander-Murray deal. “This president cannot govern if, whenever the hard right frightens him and says: ‘Jump,’ he says: “How high?’” Schumer told reporters. “The president is pointing fingers,” Schumer said. “He blames (Senate Majority Leader) Mitch McConnell for obstruction. He blames the Democrats for obstruction. He’s the obstructionist in chief because he cannot stick to a position.” The proposal would meet some Democratic objectives, such as reviving subsidies for Obamacare and restoring $106 million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans. In exchange, Republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage. Democratic attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia who have filed a legal challenge to the subsidy cutoff asked a judge in California to direct the administration by Thursday to continue the payments. At a hearing on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco said he would likely rule on the states’ request next week. Murray, speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, said her agreement with Alexander was still very much alive. “Absolutely,” Murray said. “Lamar and I are working to have a good set of co-sponsors,” and hope to formally introduce it as a Senate bill on Thursday.

Anthem said it would save $4 billion annually in the new contract with drug retailer CVS Health Corp, which will handle prescription fulfillment and claims processing starting in 2020 for five years for the new company, called IngenioRX. Anthem said it would pass on 80 percent of those savings to customers in pricing and 20 percent to the bottom line, boosting earnings by $2 per share starting in 2021. Anthem shares rose 3.1 percent, or $5.93, to $193 in Wednesday afternoon trading, while CVS shares were up 2.3 percent at $74.31. The new structure gives Anthem more control to lower healthcare costs, expand contracting with doctors and hospitals based on health outcomes and work on lowering annual increases in medical costs, Anthem Chief Executive Joseph Swedish said in an interview. Anthem had considered exiting the Express Scripts deal for several years and sued the pharmacy benefit manager in 2016 over claims of being overcharged by $3 billion annually. Express Scripts has countersued and denied allegations of overcharging. Pharmacy benefit managers negotiate prices with drugmakers and determine which treatments are included on their list of covered drugs and how much of a co-payment to charge for them versus their rivals. As drug prices have posted annual double-digit gains, companies, insurers and the U.S. government have pushed benefit managers to better manage costs. Lawmakers have criticized the companies for not being “transparent” about drug prices and questioned whether any savings make it to their customers and consumers. Swedish said that with the pharmacy function run by Anthem, it would be able to provide that information to customers. Leerink analyst Ana Gupte estimated that No.2 health insurer Anthem’s prescription business represents about 220 million scripts per year worth about $23 billion in revenue. Other insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc, already manage their pharmacy benefits themselves. Anthem, whose 10-year contract with Express Scripts expires in 2019, had said it was considering staying with Express Scripts, choosing another company, or doing the work itself. Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry said the company was disappointed by the move and would continue to work with Anthem through the contract end date and any transition period. Excluding Anthem, the company has 65 million members, he said. Express Scripts’ shares rose 2.3 percent. CVS Health, which also has a pharmacy benefit management business in addition to its pharmacies and Minute Clinics, said it expects to incur implementation charges related to the Anthem deal, but that the costs would not have an impact on its 2017 earnings.

 ,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"DECISION TIME: The European Union is considering whether to allow the continued use of the weedkiller glyphosate. France has said it would like to phase it out. Some farmers say such a move would damage their business. Above, a French farmer harvests wheat in a field in northern France. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol When the International Agency for Research on Cancer assessed the best-selling weedkiller glyphosate, significant changes were made between a draft of its report and the published version. The agency won't say who made the changes or why. By  Kate Kelland Filed Oct. 19, 2017, 3:30 p.m. GMT LONDON â The World Health Organization's cancer agency dismissed and edited findings from a draft of its review of the weedkiller glyphosate that were at odds with its final conclusion that the chemical probably causes cancer. Documents seen by Reuters show how a draft of a key section of the International Agency for Research on Cancer's (IARC) assessment of glyphosate - a report that has prompted international disputes and multi-million-dollar lawsuits - underwent significant changes and deletions before the report was finalised and made public. IARC, based in Lyon, France, wields huge influence as a semi-autonomous unit of the WHO, the United Nations health agency. It issued a report on its assessment of glyphosate - a key ingredient in Monsanto Corp's top-selling weedkiller RoundUp - in March 2015. It ranked glyphosate a Group 2a carcinogen, a substance that probably causes cancer in people. Related content Special Report: The WHOâs cancer agency left in the dark over glyphosate evidence WHO cancer agency asked experts to withold weedkiller documents That conclusion was based on its expertsâ view that there was âsufficient evidence"" glyphosate causes cancer in animals and ""limited evidence"" it can do so in humans. The Group 2a classification has prompted mass litigation in the United States against Monsanto and could lead to a ban on glyphosate sales across the European Union from the start of next year. The edits identified by Reuters occurred in the chapter of IARCâs review focusing on animal studies. This chapter was important in IARCâs assessment of glyphosate, since it was in animal studies that IARC decided there was âsufficientâ evidence of carcinogenicity.Â One effect of the changes to the draft, reviewed by Reuters in a comparison with the published report, was the removal of multiple scientists' conclusions that their studies had found no link between glyphosate and cancer in laboratory animals. In one instance, a fresh statistical analysis was inserted - effectively reversing the original finding of a study being reviewed by IARC. In another, a sentence in the draft referenced a pathology report ordered by experts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It noted the report âfirmlyâ and âunanimouslyâ agreed that the âcompoundâ â glyphosate â had not caused abnormal growths in the mice being studied. In the final published IARC monograph, this sentence had been deleted. Reuters found 10 significant changes that were made between the draft chapter on animal studiesÂ and the published version of IARCâs glyphosate assessment. In each case, a negative conclusion about glyphosate leading to tumours was either deleted or replaced with a neutral or positive one. Reuters was unable to determine who made the changes. IARC did not respond to questions about the alterations. It said the draft was âconfidentialâ and âdeliberative in nature.â After Reuters asked about the changes, the agency posted a statement on its website advising the scientists who participate in its working groups ânot to feel pressured to discuss their deliberationsâ outside the confines of IARC. Reuters contacted 16 scientists who served in the IARC expert working group that conducted the weedkiller review to ask them about the edits and deletions. Most did not respond; five said they could not answer questions about the draft; none was willing or able to say who made the changes, or why or when they were made. The chairman of the IARC sub-groupÂ tasked with reviewing evidence of glyphosateâs effect on laboratory animals was Charles Jameson, an American toxicologist. In testimonyÂ as part of personal-injury lawsuits against Monsanto in the United States, Jameson told lawyers for Monsanto he did not know when, why or by whom the edits had been made. Monsanto is facing multiple legal claims in the U.S. from plaintiffs who allege glyphosate gave them or their loved ones cancer. Jameson is an expert witness for the plaintiffs. He did not respond to questions for this article. Scott Partridge, Monsantoâs vice president of global strategy, told Reuters the changes to the draft showed how âIARC members manipulated and distorted scientific dataâ in their glyphosate assessment. IARC declined to comment. âIARC would like to reiterate that draft versions of the Monographs are deliberative in nature and confidential.â Numerous national and international agencies have reviewed glyphosate. IARC is the only one to have declared the substance a probable carcinogen. Compared with other agencies, IARC has divulged little about its review process. Until now, it has been nearly impossible to see details, such as draft documents, of how IARC arrived at its decision. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said that in its assessment of the weedkiller, the scientific decision-making process âcan be traced from start to finish.â Jose Tarazona, head of EFSAâs pesticides unit, told Reuters: âAnyone can go to EFSAâs website and review how the assessment evolved over time. So you can see clearly how experts â¦ appraised each and every study and also how comments from the public consultation were incorporated into the scientific thinking.â In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency published a full 1,261-page transcript of a three-day scientific advisory panel meeting on its ongoing evaluation of the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate in December 2016. No such record of the deliberations behind IARCâs monographs is published.In a previous response to questions about the transparency of the IARC process, the agencyâs director, Chris Wild, referred Reuters to a letter in which he said his agencyâs assessments are âwidely respected for their scientific rigour, standardised and transparent process.â Wild also said IARCâs methods are intended to allow scientists to engage in free scientific debate at its monograph meetings. DELETIONS AND ADDITIONS IARC says its working group scientists are selected for âtheir expertise and the absence of real or apparent conflicts of interest."" For the panel that evaluated glyphosate and four other pesticides in what is known as IARCâs Monograph 112, scientists from 11 countries met at the agencyâs headquarters in Lyon for a week-long meeting starting on March 3, 2015. The meeting ""followed nearly a year of review and preparationâ by IARC staff and working group members, âincluding a comprehensive review of the latest available scientific evidence,"" IARC said in a statement at the time. In June, Reuters reported how the chairman of the IARC working group was aware of new data showing no link between glyphosate and cancer in humans, but the agency did not take it into account because it had not been published. No drafts of IARCâs glyphosate assessment have surfaced before. However, a draft was obtained by Monsanto as part of the legal proceedings in the United States. Reuters reviewed chapter 3, the section on animal studies, which is the only section no longer covered by a confidentiality order of the court. Â The glyphosate review in IARCâs Monograph 112 runs to 92 pages; the chapter on animal studies consists of just over 10 pages. Reuters has not seen any other sections of the draft and cannot say whether they also underwent significant edits. In comparing draft and final versions of chapter 3, Reuters found that in several instances comments in the draft were removed; the comments noted that studies had concluded glyphosate was not carcinogenic. They were replaced in the final version with the sentence: ""The Working Group was not able to evaluate this study because of the limited experimental data provided in the review article and supplemental information."" This sentence was inserted six times into the final version. Each time it replaced a contrary conclusion, noted in the draft, by the original investigators on the study being considered, such as: ""The authors concluded that glyphosate was not carcinogenic in Sprague Dawley rats""; ""The authors concluded that glyphosate technical acid was not carcinogenic in Wistar rats""; and âThe authors concluded that glyphosate was not carcinogenic in CD-1 mice in this study.â Reuters also found changes to the conclusions and statistical significance of two mouse studies. These studies were cited in IARC's ultimate finding of ""sufficient"" evidence that glyphosate causes cancer in animals. One edit concerned a 1983 study in mice. IARCâs published monograph contains a fresh statistical analysis calculation as part of its review of that study. The original investigators found no statistically significant link between glyphosate and cancer in the mice. IARCâs new calculation reached the opposite conclusion, attributing statistical significance to it. This new calculation was inserted into the final published assessment, but was not in the draft version seen by Reuters. The change gave the working group more evidence on which to base its conclusion that glyphosate was probably carcinogenic. In further discussion of the same 1983 study, IARCâs final published report refers to expert pathologists on a panel commissioned to re-analyse the work of the original investigators. The IARC draft notes that these pathologists âunanimouslyâ agreed with the original investigators that glyphosate was not related to potentially precancerous tissue growths in the mice. IARCâs final report deletes that sentence. reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives Got a confidential news tip? Reuters Investigates offers several ways to securely contact our reporters Reviewing a second mouse study, the IARC draft included a comment saying the incidence of a type of animal cancer known as haemangiosarcomaÂ was ânot significantâ in both males and females. IARCâs published monograph, by contrast, inserts a fresh statistical analysis calculation on the data in male mice, and concludes that the findings were statistically significant. INFLUENTIAL MONOGRAPH IARC's assessment that glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen is an outlier. In the 40 or so years since the weedkiller first came to the market, glyphosate has been repeatedly scrutinised and judged safe to use. A year after IARC issued its evaluation, a joint United Nations and World Health Organization panel reviewed the potential for glyphosate in food to cause cancer in people. It concluded the weedkiller was ""unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans."" The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which first assessed glyphosate in the 1980s and has reviewed it several times since, says it has âlow toxicity for humans.â The European Food Safety Authority and the European Chemicals Agency, which advise the 28 members of the EU, have also assessed glyphosate within the past two years and ruled it safe. But IARCâs Monograph 112 has had great influence. It is weighing heavily on a pending European Union decision â due by the end of the year and possibly to be made next week - on whether glyphosate should be relicensed for sale across the 28 member states. France, one of the bloc's agricultural powerhouses, has said it wants the weedkiller phased out and then banned, provoking protests by its vocal farmers, who argue glyphosate isÂ vital to their business. A failure to renew glyphosate's licence by the end of the year would see an EU ban kick in on Jan. 1, 2018. In the United States, Monsanto â the firm that first developed and marketed glyphosate - is facing litigation in California involving at least 184 individual plaintiffs who cite the IARC assessment and claim exposure to RoundUp gave them a form of cancer known as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. They allege Monsanto failed to warn consumers of the risks. Monsanto denies the allegations. The case is ongoing. Members of the U.S. Congress, concerned about what they described as IARCâs âinconsistentâ standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic, last year launched investigations into American taxpayer funding of IARC. The investigations are ongoing. In Europe, IARC has become embroiled in a public spat with experts at the European Food Safety Authority, which conducted its own review of glyphosate in November 2015 and found it âunlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans.â With IARC monograph meetings, some outside observers are selected and allowed to witness proceedings, but they are banned from talking about what goes on. Journalists are generally not allowed in. Last year, Reuters reported on an email sent by IARC to the experts on its glyphosate working group in which the agency advised them not to discuss their work or disclose documents. The email said IARC âdoes not encourage participants to retain working drafts or documents after the monograph has been published.â Reuters sent questions about the draft version of the glyphosate assessment to members of the IARC working group that assessed the herbicide as well as to the head of IARCâs monograph programme, Kurt Straif, and to Kathryn (Kate) Guyton, the staffer responsible for the glyphosate review. IARC responded by posting the following message on its website: âMembers of the IARC Monograph Working Group which evaluated glyphosate in March 2015 have expressed concern after being approached by various parties asking them to justify scientific positions in draft documents produced during the Monographs process. IARC would like to reiterate that draft versions of the Monographs are deliberative in nature and confidential. Scientists should not feel pressured to discuss their deliberations outside this particular forum.â IARC answered none of Reutersâ specific questions about changes to the draft.

 ,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s expected move to “de-certify” the international nuclear deal with Iran is driving a wedge between Europe and the United States and bringing Europeans closer to Russia and China, Germany said on Thursday. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has spoken out repeatedly against Trump’s likely step, but his latest comments aimed to spell out the impact it would have in starker terms. “It’s imperative that Europe sticks together on this issue,” Gabriel, a Social Democrat, told the RND German newspaper group. “We also have to tell the Americans that their behaviour on the Iran issue will drive us Europeans into a common position with Russia and China against the USA.” Trump is seen unveiling a broad strategy on confronting Iran this week, likely on Friday, including a move to de-certify Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord, which he has called an “embarrassment” and the “worst deal ever negotiated.” Senior U.S. officials, European allies and prominent U.S. lawmakers have told Trump that refusing to certify the deal would leave the U.S. isolated, concede the diplomatic high ground to Tehran, and ultimately risk the unravelling of the agreement. The U.N. nuclear watchdog has repeatedly certified that Iran is adhering to restrictions on its nuclear energy programme mandated by the deal to help ensure it cannot be put to developing atomic bombs. Signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, the deal lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear work. Germany has close economic and business ties with Russia, although relations have soured since Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region. Berlin is also working to expand ties with China. Gabriel is expected to leave his post in coming months since his Social Democrats have vowed to go into opposition after slumping badly in the Sept. 24 election, opting not to reprise an awkward “grand coalition” with Merkel’s conservatives. Gabriel on Monday urged the White House not to jeopardise the nuclear agreement, saying such a move would worsen instability in the Middle East and could make it more difficult to halt nuclear arms programmes in other countries. In the interview released on Thursday, he said the nuclear agreement was being treated “like a football” in U.S. domestic politics, but the issue could have serious consequences. He said Russia was watching developments closely, including the divisions between Europe and the United States. “That doesn’t exactly strengthen our position in Europe.” Ultimately, Gabriel told the newspaper group, there were only three countries - the United States, Russia and China - that could avert a new nuclear arms race. “But those countries mistrust each other so much at the moment that they are not working together sufficiently. It must be in our interest to press for more trust.” ","

The blue-chip index, which surpassed similar 1,000-point marks three times previously this year, has been steadily inching higher and is up 2.6 percent so far this month, putting it on track for a seventh straight monthly advance. The Dow may in the near term have a difficult time sustaining a move above 23,000, said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York. “My view is it may pull back before staying above” that level. “It may take several days or a couple of weeks,” he said. “Right now, you’re contending with earnings season and the fact that the market has run up leading up into the earnings season,” Pavlik said. Recent strong economic data and renewed hope that President Donald Trump may be able to make progress on tax reform also have helped lift stocks in recent weeks.

Newcastle United did not respond to requests for comment. PCP, which has not yet put in an offer for Newcastle United, believes the club is worth around 300 million pounds with a further 150 million pounds needed to invest in players over the next two years, according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal is not public. The club has said they were willing to listen to offers that would be capable of “delivering sustained investment” towards achieving their ambitions in the top flight. Newcastle have been relegated twice since Ashley took charge in 2007.

 ,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"(This Oct. 18 story corrects age in paragraph 19 to five, not six) By Tom Bergin LONDON (Reuters) - The bill for compensating families of those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire in London may be as low as 4 million pounds ($5 million), according to several lawyers and a Reuters analysis of how damages laws apply in England. The blaze engulfed a 24-storey social housing block in west London on June 14, killing an estimated 80 people in the country’s deadliest fire since World War Two. While similar disasters in the United States have led to massive payouts, any compensation for Grenfell would be far lower because English laws offer less generous damages and don’t allow punitive claims, even if companies are found criminally responsible, said Brett Dixon, president of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL). The four main firms that have been linked to the Grenfell fire - U.S. companies Arconic Inc. and Whirlpool Corp. and Britain’s Harley Facades and Rydon Group - declined to comment on the size or calculation of potential payouts. The Reuters calculation of a bill of 4 million pounds is based on the compensation amounts stipulated in the Fatal Accidents Act of 1976, precedents set in previous cases and the individual circumstances of the 70 victims identified so far. Three personal injury lawyers have verified the methodology used by Reuters and said the estimate for the total payout is reasonable. If the courts find there was no unlawful behavior by any of the companies or public bodies involved, victims will not be entitled to sue for compensation and would only get the financial support and temporary housing already provided by the government and public donations, personal injury lawyers said. “The British judicial system is not renowned for being generous,” said Rebecca Thomas of law firm Duncan Lewis, which is representing some victims’ families. “It’s not about money for the families,” said Tim Murphy, whose brother Denis, a disabled former painter who lived on the 14th floor, died in the fire. “Nothing can ease our pain, (but) I think it’s quite insulting.” The U.S. legal system sees punitive damages as a way of encouraging companies to behave lawfully, but British and European governments have taken the view this approach would put excessive burdens on the judicial system, businesses, insurers and state bodies that might be liable, some legal experts say. While APIL said the Grenfell Tower disaster demonstrated the inadequacy of payouts to victims, Duncan Fairgrieve, who has advised the UK government on compensation rules, said more generous payouts could also harm society. They could drive up insurance costs for all and lead to big claims against government bodies such as the National Health Service and the police, he said. “There is an affordability issue,” said Fairgrieve, a Senior Research Fellow at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. If the courts find someone was wrongfully killed, the claim categories are a flat 12,980 pounds per victim for bereavement, costs such as funeral bills, dependency damages where minors or dependent spouses are left behind, and property damage - all to be paid by the party found responsible. Under the 1976 law, only family members who were supported by those who died can claim dependency damages. Reuters has identified only five people who died leaving dependents who could definitely claim damages - on the basis they were financially dependent on the deceased. Daniel Machover, a lawyer at Hickman and Rose, which is representing some victims’ families, also said he didn’t expect there to be many claims. Most of the others who died in the fire were minors, single or elderly and did not leave family members who were financially dependent upon them. The biggest dependency payout will be for children who lost both parents, said lawyers representing some of the victims. One five-year-old girl, Tasnim Belkadi, lost her mother, father and all her siblings in the fire. Lawyers said she could get 300,000 pounds, based on a share of her parents’ income and some childcare costs up to her 18th birthday. Her aunt, with whom she now lives, did not respond to requests for comment on the Reuters calculation. Grenfell plaintiffs can also claim expenses they incurred as the result of a death, such as the cost of a modest funeral. Heirs to the deceased could also claim the value of goods lost in the fire. The Association of British Insurers puts the cost of replacing the contents of an average three-bedroom home at 55,000 pounds. However, Thomas said Grenfell claims would probably be less than 30,000 pounds per property because compensation is based on the market value of personal belongings rather than replacement value, and the flats destroyed had only one or two bedrooms. Based on the victims’ circumstances, Reuters has calculated the payout for dependency damages could be 1.2 million pounds, for property it could be 1.4 million and for bereavement it could come to 1.0 million. Other smaller claims for costs and loss of parental guidance take the total to 4 million pounds. Police said the fire started in a fridge freezer made by a subsidiary of U.S. company Whirlpool and have been investigating whether the tower’s cladding, made by U.S. firm Arconic Inc., played a role in the spread of the blaze. Arconic said it was up to contractors to ensure its products were used correctly. Whirlpool said it was investigating the fire. Rydon Group, the contractor that oversaw the refurbishment when the new cladding was added, said it had complied with all regulations. Sub-contractor Harley Facades Ltd said it was not aware of any link between the fire and the cladding. Fears among investors that companies linked to Grenfell could be sued for large sums in the United States hit their shares. Whirlpool’s market value fell about $250 million on June 23 when police identified the maker of the appliance as Hotpoint, a brand owned by Indesit, which is a subsidiary of Whirlpool based in Italy. More than $1 billion was wiped off Arconic Inc.’s value after Reuters reported in June that internal emails showed it had supplied flammable cladding panels, knowing they would be used on the tower and despite warning in its brochures that only non-combustible panels should be used on tall buildings. Arconic’s share price has recovered since its late June lows but it and Whirlpool’s stock are below the levels they were at just before the fire, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 7 percent over the same period. Awards against companies in U.S. courts have run into the tens of millions of dollars per family in some cases. In 1980, a fire blamed in part on inadequate fire safety measures killed 85 people at the MGM Grand Hotel in Nevada and injured hundreds. The hotel operator and contractors agreed to pay victims’ families and survivors more than $200 million. Foreigners have often tried to sue U.S. corporations in U.S. courts over alleged wrongdoing abroad. However, judges have consistently ruled they lacked jurisdiction in such cases, saying adequate tribunals existed in the plaintiff’s own country and that it would be hard for defendants to make their case in the United States. Machover at Hickman and Rose said he was considering whether Grenfell victims could bring a U.S. case on the basis that two of the companies involved were based there. But Thomas at Duncan Lewis and Leigh Day partner Jill Paterson were skeptical that U.S. courts would agree to hear Grenfell claims given the United Kingdom offers a reasonable forum for redress and because the U.S. companies were involved through European-registered subsidiaries. “I can’t see any circumstances under which they could bring this in the United States,” said Thomas. Arconic and Whirlpool declined to comment on the possibility of legal claims against them. ","
