,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Plc said on Monday it signed an agreement with health insurer Aetna Inc under which payment for its insulin pump systems will be tied to how well diabetes patients fare after switching from multiple daily insulin injections. The deal is the latest example of the move toward contracts for prescription drugs and medical devices that attempt to bring down soaring healthcare costs by tying reimbursements to whether the products achieve their intended results. The deal with Aetna will measure health outcomes for  patients who transition to one of three Medtronic pumps that self-adjust to keep blood sugar levels in proper range based on patients’ individual needs for insulin. “This agreement reinforces our shift towards value-based healthcare,” Hooman Hakami, president of the Medtronic diabetes group, said in a statement. “We know technology alone isn’t enough and ultimately improved outcomes are what matter.” Patients with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 who have progressed to the need for insulin typically check blood sugar levels several times a day and inject insulin as needed. The pumps eliminate that chore. Medtronic declined to discuss financial details of the Aetna agreement, but said such deals tie revenue to achievement of clinical improvement targets, as well as shared savings for delivering on or exceeding clinical outcomes and cost targets. Suzanne Winter, vice president of the Medtronic diabetes group in the Americas, said the Aetna agreement will initially focus on whether patients on its pumps achieve their A1c targets, a commonly used measure of blood sugar levels. The American Diabetes Association recommends A1c levels below 7. In the future it may look at other measures, such as hypoglycemia episodes, time in proper glycemic range, and patient satisfaction, Winter said. Medtronic already has an agreement with UnitedHealth Group Inc that is moving toward including patient outcomes and other metrics, such as total cost of care, and the company is discussing similar deals with other insurers, Winter said. Pharmaceutical companies are also beginning to embrace reimbursement options that take patient outcomes into consideration. U.S. biotech Amgen Inc, in an effort to improve patient access to its expensive new cholesterol drug Repatha, has offered contract options that include refunding the cost of the drug if patients suffer a heart attack or stroke while on the medicine intended to prevent them.

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled legislation that would replace Obamacare with a plan that scales back aid to the poor and kills a tax on the wealthy, but the bill’s fate was quickly thrown into question as several senators voiced skepticism. Four conservative lawmakers said they could not support it in its current form, leaving Republicans short of the votes they need for passage. Democrats are united in opposition. The 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of President Donald Trump by rolling back former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to millions of Americans since it was passed in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion into the private marketplace. Trump welcomed the bill but indicated that changes may be in store. “I am very supportive of the Senate #Healthcarebill. Look forward to making it really special!” he wrote on Twitter. Trump urged the House of Representatives to pass a similar bill in May, only to criticize it in private as “mean” once it passed. He said on Wednesday he wanted a health plan “with heart.” Democrats immediately attacked the legislation as a callous giveaway to the rich that would leave millions without coverage. “The president said the House bill was mean,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. “The Senate bill may be even meaner.” Obama weighed in on Facebook. “If there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family – this bill will do you harm,” he wrote. The Senate’s most conservative members said the plan did not do enough to scale back the U.S. government’s role. “This current bill does not repeal Obamacare. It does not keep our promises to the American people,” said Senator Rand Paul, who along with fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson said they could not support it in its current form. Shares of hospital companies and health insurers rose on the bill’s release, with the overall S&P 500 healthcare sector closing up 1.1 percent at an all-time high. “The initial proposal I think is more generous and more positive to the industry than expected,” said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds. Over months of often bitter debate, Republicans have struggled to craft legislation that lowers costs and reduces government involvement, while minimizing the inevitable disruptions that would come with a revamp of a sector that accounts for one-sixth of the world’s largest economy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the House bill would kick 23 million Americans off their health plans, and the legislation is unpopular with the public. Fewer than one in 3 Americans supports it, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. The Senate measure maintains much of the structure of the House bill, but differs in several key ways. The Senate bill would phase out Obamacare’s expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually than the House version, waiting until after the next presidential election in 2020, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025. It would also allow states to add work requirements for some of the 70 million Americans who depend on the program. The legislation also provides more generous tax subsidies than the House bill to help low-income people buy private insurance. Those subsidies would be based on income, rather than the age-based subsidies contained in the House bill - a “major improvement,” according to Republican Senator Susan Collins, a key moderate who has expressed concern over the bill’s impact on the poor. The Senate legislation provides less money, however, for the opioid epidemic, allocating $2 billion in 2018, compared with  $45 billion over 10 years in the House version. Both versions would repeal the 3.8 percent net investment income tax on high earners, a key target for Republicans. They also would repeal a penalty imposed on large employers that do not provide insurance to their workers, and remove the fine that Obamacare imposes on those who choose to go uninsured. Policy experts said that would keep more young, healthy people out of the market and likely create a sicker patient pool. The Senate bill would provide money to stabilize the individual insurance market, allotting $15 billion a year in 2018 and 2019 and $10 billion a year in 2020 and 2021. It proposes defunding Planned Parenthood for a year, but abortion-related restrictions are less stringent than the House version because of uncertainty over whether they would comply with Senate rules. They could be included in another Senate bill. McConnell said Democrats chose not to help frame the bill, which Republicans say would fix a collapsing health marketplace. “Republicans believe we have a responsibility to act, and we are,” he said. Democrats say they offered to help fix Obamacare but were rebuffed. The bill’s real-world impact is not yet known, but the CBO is expected to provide an estimate early next week. As lawmakers spoke about the legislation on the Senate floor, a protest erupted outside McConnell’s personal office, with many people in wheelchairs blocking a hallway, holding signs and chanting: “No cuts to Medicaid.” U.S. Capitol Police said 43 protesters were arrested and charged with obstruction. Aside from the quartet of conservatives, none of the other 48 Republican senators appeared to reject the bill out of hand. But several said they would check with home-state constituents before taking a position. “I expect there’s going to be a number of changes between now and the final vote,” said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming.

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"LONDON (Reuters) - Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s L1 Retail has agreed to buy Britain’s Holland & Barrett for 1.77 billion pounds in its first acquisition, betting on continued growth and expansion abroad for the health foods chain. L1 Retail, part of Fridman’s empire that spans investments in ride-hailing firm Uber to North Sea assets, said it expected to complete the purchase from The Nature’s Bounty Co. and The Carlyle Group by September, subject to regulatory approvals. Britain’s retailers face an uncertain future, with consumer spending slowing and online competition picking up. Luxury clothing chain Jaeger fell into administration in April, while dealmaking has also been on the rise, with Brazil’s Natura set to buy The Body Shop from L’Oreal. However, some industry experts think healthier foods could prove a resilient part of the market, with online giant Amazon.com agreeing to buy U.S. chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion earlier this month. Researchers Euromonitor reckon the health and wellness market grew 4.8 percent a year between 2011 and 2016, reaching a total value of $704 billion last year. Holland & Barrett, whose products range from vitamins and homeopathic remedies to “free from” foods for allergy sufferers, says it has grown same-store sales for 32 consecutive quarters, with revenues topping 610 million pounds in 2016. While focused mainly in Britain, the 1,000-plus store chain has been expanding abroad as well as online, helping to catch L1 Retail’s eye. “We believe that the company is well positioned to benefit from structural growth in the ... health and wellness market and has multiple levers for long term growth and value creation,” said L1 Retail managing partner Stephen DuCharme. Holland & Barrett was founded in 1870, but traces its roots in health and wellness back to 1920 when Samuel Ryder - who went on to sponsor the international golf tournament that bears his name - set up a company specialising in herbs. Jonathan Buxton, partner and head of retail at Cavendish Corporate Finance, said the takeover by L1 Retail could help Holland & Barrett fend off growing competition. “With this kind of investment, we would expect that the retailer will continue to invest in its stores but more importantly, seek to increase its online presence to push back against the likes of Amazon following its acquisition of Whole Foods,” he said. According to Forbes, Fridman reached the seventh spot in Russia’s 2017 rich list, with wealth of $14.4 billion (11.31 billion pounds). Though he has moved his base to London from Moscow, the 53-year-old and his partners still own major assets in several industries in Russia, including a majority stake in Russia’s biggest food retailer by sales X5 Retail, top-10 lender Alfa Bank and Russia’s third-biggest mobile operator Vimpelcom. However, since selling out of oil company TNK-BP to Russia’s state-owned energy group Rosneft in 2013, they have largely sought to invest outside Russia. L1 Retail’s advisers include Karl-Heinz Holland, former CEO of German discount retailer Lidl Group, and Clive Humby, a founder of retail data pioneer dunnhumby. A spokesman for L1 told Reuters the company would create a board for Holland & Barrett that would include L1 Retail’s advisory board and investment team, possibly some outside non-executive directors and the chief executive and chief financial officer of the chain. Private equity firm Carlyle acquired Nature’s Bounty, including Holland & Barrett, in 2010 for $3.8 billion. Reuters reported in January that Carlyle had hired Goldman Sachs to help it sell Nature’s Bounty, but that it might opt to sell Holland & Barrett separately. Carlyle was advised by Goldman Sachs, Houlihan Lokey, UBS, PwC, Latham Watkins and OC&C. ","

The donation by Prince Mohammed bin Salman went to the United Nations Children’s Fund and the World Health Organization (WHO), as requested by the organizations, a statement by the Saudi ministry of culture and information said. It would help them “respond effectively to the cholera situation in Yemen, through a combination of water, sanitation and healthcare activities”, it said. The number of suspected cases of the disease, which is caused by the contamination of water or food by faeces, reached 179,548 by June 20, with 1,205 deaths, according to the WHO. U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O’Brien has described the cholera outbreak as a “man-made catastrophe” caused by the warring sides in Yemen’s civil war and their international backers. The country has suffered an economic collapse in two years of fighting which has left 19 million people in need of humanitarian aid. The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 3 million and ruined much of its infrastructure. As defense minister, Prince Mohammed is regarded by diplomats and analysts as a prime mover behind the Saudi decision to take military action in Yemen.1 The exiled Yemeni government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, is trying to roll back gains made by the Iran-aligned Houthi group which controls most of northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa.

Spending on healthcare in the United States is about $3.5 trillion a year, representing about 18 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. Cincinnati-based PatientPoint is one the players in the point-of-care industry, which puts advertisers and pharmaceutical companies in front of a captive audience in hospital waiting rooms and exam rooms. The company also develops health news and educational materials for patients. Searchlight Capital Partners and Silver Point Capital were the investors in the latest financing round.

The new funding will be used to expand PatientPoint’s digital content such as interactive touch screens, which currently makes up roughly half of its products, Chief Executive Mike Collette said in an interview. “The possibilities are limitless in terms of the various types of content that physicians and patients can engage with,” Collette said. The most recent investment values the company at roughly $500 million, according to a person familiar with the matter, who did want to be named because the valuation of the deal was not disclosed. PatientPoint says it delivers health-information content via print and digital devices at 1,000 hospitals and 31,000 physician offices across the country. The company aims to double its digital footprint by 2018 and triple it by 2019, and the company also wants to expand into the realm of virtual medicine, Collette said. ","

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will use the premise of a national security review of the U.S. steel industry to demand action by the Group of 20 leaders to reduce excess capacity and other distortions in the global steel market, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said on Thursday. The Trump administration expects to delay the release of the hotly anticipated study until after Trump has spoken with G20 leaders at the summit in Germany next week, another administration official said on Thursday, requesting anonymity. The official said the delay was due to July 4 holiday week scheduling issues, with “no cause or linkage” to the Group of 20 meeting. But the “Section 232” review will be a hot topic at the gathering in Hamburg. The report could lead to broad new U.S. quotas or tariffs on imported steel, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had previously said he hoped to reveal its findings by the end of June. “The premise of that report we will use as an opportunity to talk with many of our trading partners around the world about what’s going on in steel,” Cohn said on Thursday. The study invokes a Cold War-era trade law that allows the president to restrict imports of goods deemed critical to national defense. The administration official declined to provide details on the findings of the study, which the department aims to use as a catalyst to help reduce excess global production capacity, particularly in China. But American companies that consume steel have been “vigorously” lobbying Trump administration officials against major new tariffs on foreign steel that would raise prices of the key raw material, a lobbyist with clients on both sides of the debate said. He compared the anti-tariff push to efforts by corporate CEOs in April to stop Trump from withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement, with many calling the White House to try to persuade the president to change his mind. Russia requested a discussion on the U.S. steel 232 investigation at the World Trade Organization’s Council for Trade in Goods meeting on Friday, signaling that any new import restrictions could face challenges from WTO members. Russia is a significant steel exporter to the United States. The Trump administration, asked whether provisions would be made for NATO allies, many of whom supply steel products to the U.S. defense industry, to negotiate an exemption from tariffs, said: “I wouldn’t call them exemptions. There is an interest in negotiating collective action which would deal with the problem in a more global way.” Ross has said he believes there is a “genuine” national security concern over the steel industry’s health and one possible remedy is to impose import quotas on certain products coupled with tariffs on any amounts that exceed the quotas. Ross told a German economic conference that such measures might have to be “broad-scale” but would be aimed at provoking a collective solution to deal with global steel excess capacity. Cohn told the news briefing on Thursday that Trump would engage in discussions with G20 counterparts about promoting “free and fair trade,” including taking concrete actions to solve the excess capacity problems in the steel sector. But Cohn added that the Trump administration “will act to ensure a level playing field for all.” ","

Zhai, one of China’s richest women and president of the privately-owned HeungKong Group Ltd, said she never forgot her humble upbringing in Guangzhou in southern China where her father was an architect and her mother worked in a store. This made her determined to help others and she started donating to charity shortly after setting up the business with her husband in 1990. As their business grew, taking in real estate, financial investment and healthcare, Zhai broke new ground in 2005 by establishing China’s first non-profit charity foundation. Since then the HeungKong Charitable Foundation has helped an estimated 2 million people, by funding 1,500 libraries, providing loans for women to start businesses, and funding  orphans, single mothers, handicapped children and the elderly. “I realized there were a lot of poor people in China and this drove me to earn more money so I could help them,” said Zhai, 53, who was one of nine philanthropists named on Thursday as winners of the 2017 Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy. Zhai and her husband Liu Zhiqiang, whose HeungKong Group with 20,000 staff has made them worth about $1.4 billion according to Forbes magazine, are known for being leaders of the culture of philanthropy in China. Their foundation was listed as number 001 by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Zhai said at the end of 2015 there were 3,300 registered non-profit charity foundations in China. “By setting up the foundation I wanted to encourage other people, other entrepreneurs, to also donate to charity,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview from Guangzhou translated by her daughter. “Now I want to make sure that the next generation continues this culture of philanthropy in China,” she added, with two of her four children taking an active role in her foundation. The other philanthropists to win the Carnegie Medal - that was established in 2001 and is awarded every two years - came from across the globe. The list included India’s education-focused Azim Premji, Canadian-born social enterprise pioneer Jeff Skoll and American- Australian lawyer and former World Bank Group president James Wolfensohn. The winners were chosen by a committee made up of seven people representing some of the 22 Carnegie institutions in the United States and Europe. ","

As part of a complex series of financial transactions, ANZ ended up with ownership documents for nickel stored in Singapore and South Korea, but discovered they were fraudulent when it tried to sell the metal, the court papers said. ANZ has not yet filed a lawsuit, but the bank told the U.S. court it planned to do so in Asia once it discovered who was behind the fraud. ANZ “has every intention of pursuing causes of action against... fraudsters, once their identities are known”, the papers said. Marex had said in a statement it rejected the claim and issued a separate claim against Access World for an unspecified amount because it said the warehouse operator had verified the receipts as being authentic. Natixis and Access World had declined to comment. The fraud was uncovered following repurchase transactions between ANZ and two Hong Kong firms involving 84 warehouse receipts for nickel of which 83 turned out to be fake, the court papers filed by ANZ said. ANZ’s court filing included copies of the purchase contracts, showing the transactions involved 32,964 tonnes of nickel, which at current benchmark prices CMNI3 would be worth about $306.4 million. The deals were arranged by broker ED&F Man, which was not involved in the fraud and was cooperating to identify those responsible, ANZ added in the legal documents. “ED&F is not involved in this legal action and has no further comment to make,” the broker said in an emailed statement. ANZ said in the U.S. court papers that it had already unearthed information in Hong Kong after it asked courts there for access to bank records. For example, those bank documents, included in the U.S. court filing, showed transfers of $151 million from the two Hong Kong firms involved in the nickel trades to people and entities in California. ANZ told the U.S. court it wanted to interview those parties in California that received the funds. ","

Federal income taxes are applied on all forms of earnings that make up a taxpayer's taxable income, such as employment earnings or capital gains. Tax is collected from individuals and corporations by the city, state, or country in which the entity resides or operates. When the tax collected is credited to the government of the country’s account, it is referred to as federal tax. Federal tax is the money used by the government of a country to pay for the growth and upkeep of the country. Look at federal tax as “rent” charged to live in a country or the fee to use the resources provided by a country. When you pay tax to the American government, you’re in effect investing in your economy as the government uses the funds to build, repair or maintain infrastructure; fund the pensions and benefits of government workers; provide food and housing assistance to the poor; improve sectors such as education, defense, health, agriculture, utilities, public transportation, etc.; embark on new feats such as space exploration; provide emergency disaster relief; etc. The largest source of revenue for the federal government comes from the income of its residents. When people work for a company, group, or for themselves, they are compensated for the services that they render. They are mostly paid with cash, check, or direct transfer to their bank accounts. Workers receive their earnings either as net income or gross income. Net income is the total amount earned minus federal tax, which means that the company or payer has withheld the tax and paid it to the government on the worker’s behalf. Gross income includes the total amount of income, and the worker would have to pay the government what is owed. Tax deducted from income is known as the federal income tax. All money earned whether as a wage, a salary, cash gift from an employer, business income, tips, gambling income, bonuses, or unemployment compensation constitutes as income for federal tax purposes. The federal income tax is built on a progressive tax system, where higher income earners are taxed at a higher rate. Taxpayers who earn below an annual threshold set by the government would pay little to no tax, while workers who earn six figures or more annually have a mandatory tax rate that applies to their income. The tax rate that applies to each individual is set up in a marginal tax bracket that shows the highest tax rate to be paid on income earned. In effect, the amount of taxable income that one earns determines which tax bracket he would fall into. As of 2017, the table below shows the seven marginal tax brackets set up by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) for single or unmarried people. The marginal tax rate refers to the tax applied on a taxpayer’s next dollar earned. Unless a taxpayer is in the lowest marginal bracket of 10%, s/he would actually have two or more marginal tax brackets. An individual who is unmarried and earns $80,000 annually falls in the 25% marginal tax bracket. This means that: However, note that the tax rate that the individual will end up with is actually 19.67% = $15,378.75 / $80,000, even though his marginal tax rate is 25%. This rate is called the effective tax rate, and is the actual rate that the individual will end up paying the government from his income. It is important to distinguish between the general notion of income tax and federal income tax.

Ester Bloom,06292017,CNBC,06222017,"The House's version of the health care bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, was at last unveiled on Wednesday, with profound and far-reaching potential repercussions for how Americans are able to access and afford health insurance. Currently, Americans pay $3.4 trillion a year for medical care (and, unfortunately, don't get impressive results). According to the most recent data available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), ""the average American spent $9,596 on healthcare"" in 2012, which was ""up significantly from $7,700 in 2007."" It was also more than twice the per capita average of other developed nations, but still, in 2015, experts predicted continued sharp increases: ""Health care spending per person is expected to surpass $10,000 in 2016 and then march steadily higher to $14,944 in 2023."" Indeed, average annual costs per person hit $10,345 in 2016. In 1960, the average cost per person was only $146 — and, adjusting for inflation, that means costs are nine times higher now than they were then. According to eHealthInsurance, for unsubsidized customers in 2016, ""premiums for individual coverage averaged $321 per month while premiums for family plans averaged $833 per month. The average annual deductible for individual plans was $4,358 and the average deductible for family plans was $7,983."" That means that, last year, the average family paid $9,996 for coverage alone, and, if they met their deductible, a total of just under $18,000. Meanwhile, an average individual spent $3,852 on coverage and, if she spent another $4,358 to meet her deductible, a total of $8,210. These figures do not take into account any additional co-insurance responsibility she might have. In addition to co-pays and deductibles, an increasing number of plans now require co-insurance payments, which require that, even once you meet your deductible, you continue paying some percentage of all costs until you hit your out-of-pocket maximum. Young people, who are expected to benefit from lower premiums should the GOP repeal-and-replace efforts succeed, already pay the least. But even their costs can be considerable, depending on where they live. In 2016, the financial data site ValuePenguin found that the average costs for coverage for a 21-year-old go from $180 a month in Utah, plus a $2,160 deductible (potentially $4,320 a year, total), to $426 a month in Alaska, with a $5,112 deductible (potentially $10,224 a year, total). As a reminder, 72 percent of young millennials, aged 18-24, have less than $1,000 in their savings accounts and 31 percent have nothing saved at all.

Supporters argue that a single-payer 'Medicare-for-all' solution could provide universal coverage at a fraction of current costs while improving health outcomes. They propose that the average person would save more money on premiums than they would lose in tax increases. In addition, people would not lose coverage when they lose their job or when their income takes a dive. Skeptics argue that large losses incurred by healthcare providers, insurance companies, and those with generous policies makes single-payer healthcare politically unfeasible in the current climate. Many believe that that virtually free healthcare would result in unlimited demand that could only be curtailed by limiting services and care, also known as rationing. Immediate implementation will be challenging in the current political environment, but some states, including New York, California, Nevada, and Washington, are starting to put the pieces in place to maximize the longer term realization of new health-care models and their sustainability. Others, such as Delaware, Maryland, Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Ohio and Hawaii have been active in trying to push through single-payer bills but the legislation appears to be stalled and unlikely to be taken seriously at this point. Look at California. The golden state introduced a bill in February 2017 that would make it the first state to adopt single-payer. Residents would pay into a state agency that functions as an insurance company, and the agency would in turn pay doctors and hospitals when people sought treatment. Previous proposals in California suggested financing the agency by pooling the state's current funding for Medicaid, Medicare and other health programs and then taxing employees 4 percent of their income and employers 7 percent of payroll. California has a veto-proof democratically controlled state legislature and could achieve some traction with this ambition. The cost could be fully offset through the elimination of premiums, copays, deductibles and other healthcare expenses, as well as the ability for the state to negotiate lower rates with healthcare providers and by managing the steep rise in healthcare costs more aggressively and with more precision. At 15 percent of state GDP, single-payer healthcare spending in California would be 3 percent lower than the amount the U.S. as a whole is currently sinking into healthcare. A focus on improving the health outcome of individuals will be critical. The Senate passed the bill on June 1 by a vote of 23-14; it now heads to the State Assembly. Restrictions in the ACA prevented states from passing single-payer and other new innovative models of healthcare without special permission before 2017. Now that the restriction has expired, states can, in theory, create their own ACA alternatives using a Sec. 1332 Waiver for state innovation. Some states, including Washington, have already filed waivers and submitted initiatives. In Washington, several House representatives have sponsored a bill this year that would establish a single-payer healthcare system using the ACAs Innovation Waiver. The plan opts to combine Medicaid and Marketplace plans into one single-payer solution, with no deductibles or premiums, but in trade presents rather high payroll and income tax hikes. And in New York, an ACA repeal could leave up to 2.7 million without coverage. In response, an Assembly member (who first proposed and passed a bill in 1992, and then again in 2015 and 2016) reintroduced a bill this year that would finance a universal Medicare expansion through progressive taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers. General savings on the program would come from the state's ability to buy pharmaceuticals in bulk, while the legislation would be written so that everything currently covered by Medicaid and Medicare, like eye care and dental, will also be covered under the expansion. The bill has passed through the State Assembly and is currently headed to the Senate where it may get blocked. For now. Measures can be voted on by state legislators in voting cycles, including off-year and mid-term elections, and programs can be enacted as early as this year. In order to create a state-based coverage alternative, coverage quality and the number covered must be comparable to the current ACA standards, and the program can't add to the federal deficit. It can also only replace private coverage and not public programs like Medicaid. Technically, states are now in a position to create an ACA replacement using, at least in part, federal funding already provided. States that are looking to implement the single-payer model must address a number of challenges. First, the financing of a single-payer system typically requires replacing private insurance premiums with broad-based individual and corporate tax increases. Small businesses that don't currently insure their workers could be worse off because their taxes will increase without a reduction in premiums, and higher income, well-insured people, as well as many businesses (who pay more tax in general) will end up shouldering the majority of the funds needed to support such a model. They may see a reduction in the level of benefit currently being enjoyed. This will prove difficult to digest in many states and the messaging would have to be finely tuned to garner broad support. For example, in Colorado, voters overwhelmingly rejected ColoradoCare in November 2016, viewing the initiative as a tax-hike rather than the elimination of insurance premiums. Next, special interest groups would have to be expertly navigated and stakeholders aggressively engaged. There are clear losers from the introduction of single-payer plans. The most heavily impacted group, and potentially the most vocal and powerful, are health insurance companies. While some insurers would still do well by administering the system to pay provider claims, many would become irrelevant within states that implement a single-payer model. Local payers that have traditionally focused on the low-margin, but have a lean business of administering Medicaid (such as Managed Care Organizations), would have an advantage over the larger, commercially focused national firms. Additionally, a large single-payer network has substantial negotiating leverage to set and control healthcare reimbursement rates. This poses a significant threat to the profitability of large hospital systems, pharmaceutical companies, physicians, and other healthcare entities. In the short term, this may result in staff cutbacks and job losses. Therefore, supporters would need to stress the potential long-term benefits of moving to single-payer, which include a shift from provision to prevention, as well as the new job creation that this will enable. Finally, large employers with self-funded healthcare are unlikely to drop coverage for their existing employees in only one state. Therefore, they are unlikely to be supportive of an increase in corporate tax (essentially paying twice for healthcare). States have no regulatory authority over self-funded health plans; they can only be regulated at the federal level under a law known as ERISA. States will be powerless from intervening to restructure how these companies manage employee benefits. A shift over time to private exchanges and employee stipends to purchase their own coverage would lessen this complication. While states should renew their drive to reform health care on a local basis, the extent of the challenges means it is unlikely that any state (except possibly California) will move to a single-payer or a similar model in the short-term, even though these models could certainly result in a more equitable and fair provision of health care for Americans. That doesn't mean that those states with momentum won't be able to establish the necessary building blocks to succeed in the long term. New models could be tested using federal innovation grants and states can start putting in place the population health management prerequisites that will enable single-payer to thrive in the future.

Jeff Daniels,06292017,CNBC,06222017,"Hain Celestial founder and CEO Irwin Simon on Thursday sought to reassure weary investors even as a lengthy accounting probe cleared the company of wrongdoing but failed to help its battered stock price. Weighing on the shares is a weak outlook provided by management. Nonetheless, the chief executive was upbeat on the company's future and also saw a silver lining in Amazon's planned purchase of Whole Foods. ""Now is the time to move on and build our business and take it to the next level,"" Simon said in an interview Thursday on CNBC's ""Squawk Alley."" The CEO said the company completed the accounting review and audit process and found there was ""no material change"" to previously reported financials. He called it ""a great outcome."" Simon also was upbeat about Hain's general business outlook and its positioning in the organic and natural products space. ""We're in a great category in health and wellness,"" he said. ""The consumer will continue to eat healthy. We'll continue to look for 'better for you' products. And we have the brands and products that consumers want."" Hain's brands include Celestial Seasonings, Terra Chips and Garden of Eatin', among others. The company also is known for personal care products from Alba, Jason and Live Clean. On Thursday, Hain reported its delayed fiscal 2016 results after going more than a year without disclosing financials. The company also provided results for the first nine months of the current fiscal year ending June 30. It revealed that Hain's U.S. sales slowed in the nine-month stretch compared with the year-ago period and total sales were relatively flat. ""It's been a difficult year,"" said the CEO. ""There were a lot of things out of my control."" In particular, Simon said currency impacted the company's U.K. business and its turkey protein operation was hurt after prices came down. He also said there were issues with Hain's fruit business in the U.K. Hain also announced Thursday it would take $350 million of costs out of the business. Additionally, the company provided an initial fiscal 2018 outlook that was seen by some as rather optimistic. ""I feel good about going into 2018,"" Simon said. ""But what I feel good about is the brands that we own today, the products that we own globally around the world."" In addition to the internal accounting probe, Hain in February received a subpoena seeking ""relevant documents"" from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Hain's stock still hasn't fully recovered and remains 40 percent below where it was trading before the accounting issues were first disclosed in August. Even so, Simon has no plans to step aside. ""This is something that continues to grow, continues to evolve, and with that I think there's lots of runway left in Hain,"" he said. ""And there's lots of runway left within me."" Simon also was asked about Amazon's proposed purchase of Whole Foods, a major retailer selling organic and natural products. The CEO believes the deal is a good thing ultimately for Hain although some investors worry Amazon's bigger push into grocery will squeeze profit margins of big-brand consumer-packaged goods suppliers. ""Amazon is one of our fastest-growing customers,"" he said while also noting that Whole Foods is one of Hain's big customers. ""They want natural and organic products. Hain is in a strong position there."" Moreover, he said if there is price pressure from consolidation on the retail side it will be offset because Hain is cutting costs in its business to ""enhance our margins."" On Thursday, Hain's stock closed down 1.5 percent, but it was fractionally higher during part of the session. More than 14 million shares changed hands, or roughly seven times its average daily volume. ",Hain CEO seeks to reassure shareholders after probe finds no financial wrongdoing
Jennifer Schlesinger,06292017,CNBC,06222017,"The phone rings, pauses, and then a recording on the line says: ""Hello! This is Rachel at cardholder services,"" or ""This is an important notice about your automobile."" If you're like many Americans, you have probably received a robocall just like these, which have become a scourge for consumers despite increasing efforts to stop them. In May, there were 2.6 billion robocalls, or automatically dialed calls, in the U.S. That amounts to over eight calls a person, according to YouMail, an app designed to stop the pesky calls. ""Anytime you get a robocall in which somebody is trying to sell you a good or service, if you didn't give the caller prior expressed written consent for that call, that call is illegal,"" Janice Kopec, a staff attorney with the Federal Trade Commission, told CNBC's ""On the Money"" recently. The FTC's Do Not Call List was designed to stop telemarketing calls, yet robocalls are on the rise. They were up nearly 5 percent last month, according to YouMail's numbers, despite 226 active numbers registered with the Do Not Call List. All those unwanted calls have led to a massive surge in complaints. The FTC received nearly 3.5 million robocall complaints in fiscal year 2016, up 60 percent from the year before. ""The 'Do Not Call' registry actually works for legitimate businesses,"" said Alex Quilici, CEO of YouMail. ""The problem is all the people who don't respect it, who are the scammers who [couldn't] care less."" Calling for less than a cent Those scammers use new technology to call you in the hopes you will fall for their scam and hand over money. ""It's super easy to do, it's super cheap, and unfortunately, it works. People fall for the scams enough to make it worthwhile,"" Quilici said. The calls are often coming from overseas, where scammers try to stay out of the reach of regulatory authorities, according to the FTC. ""You can make millions of calls from anywhere in the world for a tiny amount of money, literally less than a cent a call,"" Kopec said. The Federal Communications Commission, which also regulates calls, received around 200,000 complaints annually. ""Unwanted calls — including illegal robocalls and telemarketing calls — are the top consumer complaint the FCC receives each year,"" the agency said in a statement sent via e-mail. Government crackdown The government is trying its best to crack down on robocallers, which has proved stubborn to defeat. The FCC is also testing letting phone companies block calls that are likely scams. ""We've brought over 130 law enforcement actions targeting those who send out unlawful calls and illegal calls,"" Kopec said. The FTC was awarded a $280 million judgment against Dish Network, a satellite television provider, for Do Not Call List violations, including some robocalls, earlier this month. ""DISH respectfully disagrees with the decision by the Court and will appeal the ruling. … DISH has long taken its compliance with telemarketing laws seriously, has and will continue to maintain rigorous telemarketing compliance policies and procedures,"" the company said in a statement sent to CNBC via email. The telecommunications industry is also working to stop robocalls, but challenges abound — such as the fact that some automated calls are actually legal. ""One of the things that consumers need to be aware of is that often times some of these robocalls ... we may not like them and they may not like to get them, but in most every state in the country, they're perfectly legal,"" said Kevin Rupy, vice president of law and policy for USTelecom, a trade group that represents landline providers. Aside from political calls, other robocalls such as school closures and push 911 messages are well withing the law, Rupy added. Another challenge is what is known as spoofing, when scammers change the number on caller identification. These sorts of calls look like a local call or that it is coming from someone you trust, like your bank. ""A lot of the criminal actors that are operating in this space are very sophisticated in how they're pushing these calls out to consumers,"" Rupy said. ""One example where you see is where the illegal robocallers will spoof the area code in the first three digits of the consumer's phone number, so that consumer believes that it could be the school calling, it could be my neighbor down the street calling, and they're going to be more inclined to pick up the phone,"" he added. To combat this, the industry is working on standards to add trustworthiness to caller ID. ""The wireless community — including wireless providers, handset vendors, and system providers — is united in its efforts to defeat robocalls,"" said Krista Witanowski, an assistant vice president of regulatory affairs at CTIA, a trade group that represents the wireless industry, in an e-mailed statement. ""These efforts, which collectively stop more than a million robocalls every day across the country, are ongoing and the wireless industry remains fully committed to stopping such nuisance calls,"" she added. What you can do to stop the calls Consumers also play a role in stopping robocalls. Here is what you can do.

Kate Rogers,06292017,CNBC,06222017,"In Charlotte, North Carolina, mother-son duo Julie and Michael Chambers are watching their small business, Melt in Your Mouth, come to life. The cupcake store they opened more than two years ago now has four employees, and they're hoping to open up additional locations. But chief among their concerns is the tax burden they face. Structured as an LLC, the company files taxes at the individual rate, paying some 35 cents on each dollar they make, Michael said, adding he's hoping for reform and lower rates under the new administration. ""We are in the process of trying to open up new stores, and just paying taxes on this one is taking capital away that we could be using on something else,"" he said. ""There is no clear-cut policy on where things are going right now. Compliance is extremely expensive for us, and it disproportionately affects us as a small business."" Taxes have long ranked as a top issue for America's small businesses, many of whom file as pass-through entities, combining business and personal income and, as a result, sometimes paying a higher effective rate. In the National Federation of Independent Business' 2016 ""Small Business Problems and Priorities"" study, federal taxes on business income ranked as the No. 3 issue behind the cost of health insurance and unreasonable government regulations. The first-ever CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey in June found that taxes were the No. 1 issue for 25 percent of the more than 2,000 businesses surveyed. North Carolina, where Melt in Your Mouth is based, revamped its tax code in recent years to lower both corporate and individual rates, which had a positive impact on its business competitiveness. In fact, in 2017 the foundation's ""State Business Tax Climate Index"" saw North Carolina jump from No. 41 to No. 11, the largest improvement ever recorded. The rate for individuals is currently 5.5 percent, while corporations pay 3 percent, but the state legislature is also working to lower rates even further in a pending budget deal. ""What North Carolina did is a good model for tax reform for the United States,"" said Joseph Henchman, vice president for State Projects at the Tax Foundation. ""Find a way to broaden the base of the tax system, lower rates for everybody, and make it more pro-growth."" The Trump administration is proposing parity for both small businesses and corporations in its blueprint to overhaul the tax code, bringing the rates from a top rate of 39.6 percent for individuals and 35 percent for businesses to an even 15 percent. The idea has been met with enthusiasm from Main Street advocates. House Speaker Paul Ryan also spoke out in favor of overhauling the tax code this week at the National Association of Manufacturers Summit Tuesday, pointing out the uneven playing field small businesses that file as pass-through entities find themselves on, compared to their corporate counterparts. ""Here in America, 8 out of 10 businesses file their taxes as individuals,"" Ryan said. ""In fact, most of our jobs come from these ... small businesses. Real tax reform ... means creating a new lower tax, specifically for small businesses, so they too can compete on a fair, level playing field."" For some businesses, like Jeremy Wanamaker's Waypoint Solutions Group, an IT services provider with locations in Charlotte and Albany, New York, it's more than just high rates. It's simply the complexity of complying with the federal tax code that's challenging. Wanamaker strategizes with his CPA to maintain competitiveness. ""We want to be as aggressive as we can while staying within the boundaries of the law,"" Wanamaker, CEO of the 30-person company, said. ""The tax code is too complicated. I think that small businesses are not able to reinvest money easily. The way we are taxed on our profits makes it difficult to reinvest. If we have a profitable year, we pay taxes on all of our profits, whether we use that money to take home or put it back into the business."" The Trump administration's proposal for parity between large and small businesses would be a ""very effective way"" to encourage small businesses to hire and grow, he said. ""If the tax rate on pass-through income was reduced, I could then take that money and reinvest it back into the business. That means hiring more people, buying equipment and doing something that impacts the economy as a whole."" While Michael Chambers of Melt in Your Mouth agrees, he's unsure Congress will be able to take action to move on tax reform anytime soon. ""They're pushing health care hard right now, and if they even manage to get that passed, I don't see them having anything left to be able to get any sort of meaningful tax reform through.""

 ,06292017,CNBC,06222017,"The euro fell from a one-year high on Wednesday, after the European Central Bank said markets misjudged ECB President Mario Draghi's comments a day earlier. The hints in Draghi's speech to a major central bank conference in Portugal convinced investors that its policymakers are ready to start to withdraw the emergency stimulus for the economy that has dominated policy-making for almost a decade. That provoked the banking world's single biggest cheerleaders for a stronger dollar, Deutsche Bank, to abandon calls for a stronger greenback and instead call the end to a dollar rally dating back to 2014. ""Our main message is that the EUR is likely to be the key vehicle via which financial conditions in the Euro-area will be tightened,"" Deutsche analyst George Saravelos said in a note to clients on Wednesday. ""We now see the risks as shifting towards an attempted break-out of the euro's multi-year 1.05-1.15 range to the topside."" Saravelos, who at the height of the dollar's rally called for the euro to fall to $0.85 by the end of this year, raised his end of year forecast from $1.03 to $1.16. The euro fell 0.05 percent to 1.133 per dollar after it traded at $1.1376, a 1.4 percent gain, on Tuesday. The latest failure of Republicans to pass healthcare legislation in the United States was also playing in to the dollar's weakness, further undermining faith in President Donald Trump's promises of other measures to support growth.

Dan Mangan,06292017,CNBC,06222017,"Martin Shkreli, the pharmaceuticals executive who gained public infamy by unapologetically hiking the price of a drug by more than 5,000 percent, on Monday begins jury selection for his trial on charges of securities fraud. Shkreli, 34, is charged in Brooklyn, New York, federal court with ripping off a drug company he founded, Retrophin, for millions of dollars for the purposes of repaying investors whom he allegedly also defrauded at hedge funds he ran. The trial could last for up to six weeks. The brash, social media and hip-hop-loving Brooklyn native, who has denied the allegations, was arrested on those charges in December 2015, months after garnering widespread scorn for raising the retail price of the drug Daraprim from $13.50 per pill to $750 per pill. Another company that Shkreli founded, Turing Pharmaceuticals, earlier that year had purchased the drug, which is used to treat a parasitic condition found in pregnant women, infants and people with HIV. The sky-high spike resonated with a public increasingly outraged by the cost of prescription medications. Shkreli quickly threw fuel on that fire by refusing to decrease the price of Daraprim. Shkreli also reveled in using Twitter to insult his many critics, who included then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Clinton's eventual opponent, Donald Trump, also joined in the public chorus denouncing Shkreli. None of that scorn deterred Shkreli, who later smirked while refusing to testify about Daraprim's price during an appearance before a congressional committee. Although it wasn't widely known at the time of the price hike, Shkreli was under federal criminal investigation for his tenure as CEO of Retrophin, the company he founded and ran before Turing. The company, echoed later by prosecutors, claimed that Shkreli had used publicly traded Retrophin like a personal piggy bank to pay back people who had invested in two Shkreli-run hedge funds with a series of stock transactions and consulting agreements. Shkreli is accused of misrepresenting the assets of those funds to investors to hide the fact the funds were money-losers. Prospective jurors on Monday are expected to be asked if they have any negative opinions about Shkreli based on widespread media attention he has received for the past two years. That attention has included stories about his purchase, for a whopping $2 million, of a single-copy album by the hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan, his heckling of Clinton outside her daughter's Manhattan apartment after she fainted last Sept. 11 after a 9/11 memorial event and his banning from Twitter for harassing a female journalist. Shkreli is being represented by a high-powered legal team headed by Benjamin Brafman, whose past clients have included Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the International Monetary Fund chief who was accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid. Brafman, after being hired by Shkreli, told reporters that he had told his client that he needed to stop talking to journalists. That hasn't happened. Last week, he granted an interview to The Associated Press. Shrekli also has continued livestreaming broadcasts online from his apartment, talking about investing, drug development, chess and more mundane matters to viewers. He also, while free on $5 million bail, has spoken at several colleges, including Princeton, where he recently agreed to pay a senior $40,000 for solving a math proof for a problem Shkreli had posed. Brafman last week said that offer, along with other monetary prizes posted by Shkreli, had not been paid, and that Shrekli was offering such rewards in an effort to remain in the public eye. The lawyer said that Shkreli was essentially cash broke, although he claimed his client was worth tens of millions of dollars from Shkreli's ownership stake in Turing. Brafman last week asked Judge Kiyo Matsumoto to reduce Shkreli's bail by $3 million so that the money could be used to reduce Shkreli's substantial tax liabilities, civil legal fees, and other debts related to both his tax issues and trial preparation. The judge has yet to rule on that request. The $3 million that Shkreli hopes to free up is in an E-Trade account being used to secure his release bail.

The big day has now come and gone. Yesterday, Republicans in the Senate unveiled their long-awaited healthcare reforms designed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which you probably know best by now as Obamacare. In March, House Republicans introduced the world to the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which some have dubbed ""Trumpcare."" After less than three weeks of back-and-forth debates among GOP members in the House, the AHCA was swept from the docket without going to vote because there wasn't enough support to pass the initial version. Image source: President Donald J. Trump's official Facebook page. Photo by Shealah Craighead. A little more than a month later, a second version of the bill emerged. It kept most of the initial version of the AHCA intact, but it added two new amendments designed to appease factions of the Republican Party who opposed the initial version. For more moderate House Republicans who felt that the AHCA would take away too much from sicker constituents, the Upton Amendment was introduced. It added $8 billion in additional funds (on top of a proposed $100 billion) to help states curb the inflationary pressures of treating patients with pre-existing conditions. For the Freedom Caucus, a group of GOP members who believe the AHCA didn't go far enough in distancing itself from Obamacare, the MacArthur Amendment was introduced, which allows states the option of applying for a waiver from Obamacare's 10 essential minimum benefits clause that each health plan is required to have. This secondary version of the AHCA passed by the narrowest of margins in the House. Here's a quick refresher of its key points: Image source: Getty Images. Of course, there were a lot of concerns with this plan. In particular, there were worries that stripping away income-based subsidies and replacing them with age-based credits would leave millions of low-income individuals and families on the outside looking in. There were also concerns about the elderly having to pay significantly more under Trumpcare than Obamacare, as well as folks with pre-existing conditions potentially being charged more. A handful of prominent Senate Republicans called the bill ""dead on arrival"" following the House vote. This pretty much set the table for Senate Republicans to craft their own version of healthcare reform, which was unveiled on Thursday. The 142-page bill introduced by Senate Republicans, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), kept a few components of the House's healthcare reform proposal, but really branched off to become its own unique bill. For instance, the BCRA would retroactively repeal the Shared Responsibility Payment (the penalty paid for not buying health insurance) all the way to the beginning of 2016, which is pretty similar to the repeal of the mandates and penalties described in the House bill. It also eliminates taxes on the wealthy, such as the 3.8% net investment income tax on individuals with more than $200,000 in modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), and the Medicare surtax of 0.9% on persons with MAGI above $200,000. Image source: Getty Images. But there are some very notable differences between the two plans. Here are a few biggies: There are a few other changes, but these are the most important. Image source: Getty Images. As you might expect, the Senate's bill isn't without controversy. While making healthcare more affordable for a number of healthier young adults, and providing protections for those with pre-existing conditions that weren't available under the AHCA, the BCRA has its drawbacks. For example, the middle class would take a hit with the federal poverty subsidy limits being scaled back. Additionally, older Americans still face significantly higher costs, especially those who qualify for a subsidy. Given what look to be some glaring problems with the bill, four Republican Senators have dug in their heels and announced that they have no intention of voting in favor of the current bill as it reads. They did not say they'll be voting no, but made it clear that further discussion would be needed before they would consider voting in favor of the BCRA. The four GOP senators are: All four senators released a joint statement that reads: Currently, for a variety of reasons, we are not ready to vote for this bill, but we are open to negotiation and obtaining more information before it is brought to the floor. There are provisions in this draft that represent an improvement to our current healthcare system, but it does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their healthcare costs. Though the Senate bill has yet to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office, which is what's halted moving the bill to the floor for debate and vote, chances are good that it'll provide the long-term reduction in healthcare costs that Rand Paul and his peers are seeking. Image source: Getty Images. It's no secret that both the AHCA and BCRA are probably going to be disliked by the public, but they do appear to provide health insurers with much-needed flexibility in pricing their plans. The waiver mandates and ability to charge older folks more (since older adults are often sicker than younger adults) is viewed as a critical component to keeping insurers involved, as well as to lowering healthcare premiums. National insurers UnitedHealth Group, Humana, and Aetna, were losing money hand over fist on Obamacare's exchanges and recently cut their coverage dramatically for 2017. Humana has said that it plans to pull out of the Obamacare exchanges entirely by next year. The danger in the Republican Senate health bill is that also allows insurers to pass along more out-of-pocket costs to consumers via higher deductibles. In other words, if you actually need to go to the doctor, you could be paying a lot more. What's more, Cruz, Paul, Johnson, and Lee are unlikely to get their way in distancing themselves any further from Obamacare, because doing so would mean rolling back subsidies on lower-income folks, which a vast majority of the American public have said they disagree with. As a reconciliation bill, the Senate only needs 50 votes for passage, since it's almost certain that Vice President Mike Pence would break the tie. Getting to 50 could still prove exceptionally challenging when, according to party lines, Republicans can only afford to lose two votes. With a July 4th recess looming, it looks as if healthcare reform may drag into late summer or the fall. ","
      
    Meet the 4 Republican Senators Who Won't Vote in Favor of Their Own Party's Healthcare Bill -- The Motley Fool

Todd Campbell,06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Remember when every retailer's favorite company to hate was Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), the big, bad box retailer that was destroying mom-and-pops and forcing small- and mid-sized department stores to close in droves? Despite cries to break it up, it's gone on to become America's biggest retailer by sales. Nowadays, it's Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) that's causing people to raise their pitchforks. But much like Walmart, making a case for breaking it up seems a bit silly, given how big and competitive retail remains. Amazon's pioneering of e-commerce continues to transform how consumers shop, and last week, the company's decision to tackle traditional brick-and-mortar retail by acquiring Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion increased worry that Amazon is getting too big for its britches. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. But the numbers don't really suggest that Amazon is nearly as big as the media reports might have you believe. Yes, it does over $140 billion in sales annually, and acquiring Whole Foods adds another $15.7 billion in fiscal-year sales, but that's not really a lot when you consider industrywide revenue, and it's still miles south of the sales that Walmart racks up. According to Census data, e-commerce sales totaled $395 billion in 2016 and $106 billion in the first quarter of 2017 alone. Although e-commerce sales are growing quickly, they represent only 8.5% of the country's retail spending. If you divide Amazon's total sales into these figures, it accounts for 36% of 2016 e-commerce sales and 34% of first-quarter sales. Or, to put it differently, about two-thirds of e-commerce sales go to other retailers that sell online, too. Comparing Amazon's revenue to Wal-Mart also suggests that Amazon's a long way away from scary-big. In fact, Amazon's sales would have to more than triple to eclipse Walmart's sales in 2016. Data source: YCharts. It's also important to keep in mind that Amazon's revenue isn't all from its retail business. Amazon runs multiple businesses under its umbrella, and in this respect, it may be more like Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway than J.C. Penney. In addition to being a retailer, it's also a technology services company (Amazon Web Services), a consumer electronics company (Kindle, Echo, Fire Stick), and a media company (Prime). Growing reliance on hosting services propelled Amazon's web services segment sales to $3.7 billion in Q1, up from $2.6 billion a year ago. That makes it a $15 billion business that's competing head to head against technology titans like Alphabet and Microsoft. According to industry watcher Gartner, the market for public cloud infrastructure will grow 36.8% to $34.6 billion worldwide this year. In consumer electronics, the company's Echo and Echo Dot are the market share leaders in the virtual-assistant market, but Alphabet, Sonos, Microsoft (via Cortana), and Apple Inc. (via Siri and soon the HomePod) all compete with it in that market. Similarly, Alphabet's Chromecast is stiff competition for Amazon's Fire Stick, as are smart TVs and DVRs. In tablets, Amazon competes with Apple, a consumer electronics Goliath with $216 billion in sales in 2016. Amazon's Prime service is similarly far from alone in the online entertainment market. Amazon battles Apple, Pandora, Spotify, iHeartRadio, and Alphabet, as well as others in online music. In online video, it competes with Alphabet's YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, broadcasters, and traditional and satellite television. Still think Amazon should be broken up? Consider that despite all of the worry over Amazon's size, its $142 billion in trailing-12-month sales still only ranks it 16th in size in terms of sales for companies with market caps over $20 billion. Toyota Motor, Berkshire Hathaway, UnitedHealth Group, and CVS Corp are some of the well-known names that remain far bigger than Amazon. Company Sales (billions/TTM*) Wal-Mart Stores $487 China Petroleum $299 Royal Dutch Shell $257 Petrochina Co. $250 Toyota Motor Corp. $248 Berkshire Hathaway $237 Apple Inc. $221 ExxonMobil Corp. $211 BP Plc $200 McKesson Corp. $199 UnitedHealth Group $189 CVS Health Corp. $179 General Motors Co $170 AT&T Inc. $163 Ford Motor Co. $153 Amazon.com, Inc $143 *Trailing 12 months. Chart by author. There's no denying that Amazon is laser-focused on disrupting multiple markets, that its innovation puts it in an enviable position of growing much bigger in the coming years, or that acquiring Whole Foods opens up all sorts of opportunities for the company to boost sales. But it's too early to say that Amazon is anywhere near a point where regulators would have to take action, or that it will ever be that big. Just as Amazon has taken the luster off Walmart, an upstart could eventually crimp Amazon's growth, too. Savvy investors should be focusing on that -- not on Amazon's risk of a breakup. ","

"Keith Speights, Timothy Green, and Matthew DiLallo",06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Investing profits tend to correlate pretty well with the time horizons that investors have. If you're overly concerned about short-term gains, those gains are usually relatively small. But if you're focused on the long term, your investing gains are greater. With this premise in mind, we asked three of The Motley Fool's contributors to identify stocks for the long haul. Here's why they picked Brookfield Property Partners (NASDAQ:BPY), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). Image source: Getty Images. Matt DiLallo (Brookfield Property Partners): Owning real estate can be a great way for investors to earn healthy returns over the long-term. That's because they can benefit from collecting rental income as well as capturing appreciation as property values increase. While there are plenty of options available, a great one for the long-term is Brookfield Property Partners, which is one of the largest real estate owners in the world. Not only does Brookfield own some of the best office properties around the globe but it owns a significant stake in General Growth Properties, which controls many of the top malls in America. Further, Brookfield Property Partners has invested in several opportunistic real estate funds managed by parent company Brookfield Asset Management, giving it access to other property classes like student housing, multi-family, and self-storage. That diversified portfolio of properties makes it a one-stop shop for real estate investors. What's great about owning commercial real estate is that these properties throw off steady income. Because of that, Brookfield Property Partners pays a high distribution to investors that currently yields 5.1%. The company shouldn't have any problems sustaining that payout given that long-term leases back its properties, and it maintains a safe ratio of around 80%. The company further supports that payout with a solid balance sheet, backed by an investment-grade credit rating, a conservative debt-to-capital ratio of less than 50%, and primarily fixed-rate debt, which insulates it from interest rate hikes. Brookfield complements that incomes stream with clearly defined growth prospects. Overall, the company expects its funds from operations to increase 8% to 11% annually, thanks to a combination of rising rents, high-grading its portfolio with better-returning assets, and completing its development projects. This growth should drive 5% to 8% annual distribution growth. When we add up its heathy finances, compelling dividend, and visible growth, it shows that Brookfield Property Partners has all the characteristics an investor could want in a long-term holding. Tim Green (International Business Machines): If you plan on holding a stock for the long haul, it's best to choose a company that's already proven it can stand the test of time. IBM, while facing its fair share of challenges, has been around for over a century. It remains a highly profitable company, and it's one of the key players pushing artificial intelligence and big data forward. IBM is focused on growing its ""strategic imperatives,"" which include businesses like cloud computing, analytics, and security. Its Watson cognitive computing system is the most visible part of its strategy, and it's being used in various industries, including healthcare and financial services. At the same time, various legacy businesses are in decline. The net result has been five years of slumping revenue. Image source: Getty Images. But IBM's existing base of large enterprise customers gives the company a key advantage as those customers look to move to the cloud. A recent $1.7 billion deal IBM signed with Lloyds Banking Group, an existing IBM customer, to provide dedicated cloud offerings and manage the transition to the new cloud is exactly the kind of deal that will push IBM's cloud revenue higher. While it's no longer true that ""no one ever got fired for buying IBM,"" the IT giant remains a critical partner for many large organizations. Its cloud business may not be as headline-grabbing as AWS, but the company's approach should ensure that it sticks around for decades to come. Keith Speights (United Parcel Service): United Parcel Service is a stock for the long haul in more than one way. The packaged goods delivery company certainly has its fair share of literal long hauls: UPS delivered over 4.9 billion packages last year across more than 220 countries. The stock is also a great pick for investors who would like to buy and hold for quite a while. One such investor is Warren Buffett. Although UPS is one of the legendary investor's worst-performing stocks so far in 2017, I doubt that Buffett is in a hurry to sell his relatively small stake. The Oracle of Omaha usually likes to stick with a stock for the long haul if he can. UPS' recent woes stem from increased capital expenditures and resulting pressure on margins. I think those are short-term problems that are actually sowing seeds for long-term success. UPS is in large part reacting to higher costs associated with handling increased e-commerce volume. However, more e-commerce means great prospects for the company in the coming years. Warren Buffett likes the companies he buys to have moats -- protection against competitors stealing market share. UPS enjoys a pretty good moat. The company is in something of a duopoly with FedEx in the packaged good delivery market. It's too expensive for most companies to build the infrastructure needed to deliver at the scale these two companies do, so UPS and FedEx largely have the market to themselves. Although Amazon is building out its own delivery program, I agree with my colleague Travis Hoium that UPS should continue to thrive regardless of what Amazon does.

                                   stocks, 49% are “buy” ratings, 45% are neutral — and only 6% are “sell”ratings,” according to a June 23 report from FactSet analyst John Butters. A “sell-side” analyst is one who works for a brokerage firm or on the brokerage side of an investment bank, providing research reports and ratings to brokerage clients and often making them available to the financial media. The firm’s bankers also use the reports when pitching for business. A “buy-side” analyst is one who works for professional investors, including hedge funds. So sell-side analysts are the ones being quoted most often, especially when you see monotonous quarterly headlines saying which companies have beaten or missed consensus earnings estimates. Their earnings estimates and ratings, in turn, can help drive stocks higher, so it’s important to consider their opinions. Read: How to stop being your own worst enemy in the stock market It may not surprise you that most companies beat estimates each quarter, no matter what is going on in the economy. If sales and earnings are weak, analysts will often lower their estimates heading into earnings season, sometimes in response to companies lowering their earnings guidance. A conversation with almost any sell-side analyst will highlight a deep level of knowledge of the industry he or she covers, along with an approach to ratings that is based on price targets, which themselves are based on estimates for sales, earnings and cash flow. But there’s no denying that analysts shy away from placing the equivalent of a “sell” rating on a stock, or that “good news” (including good ratings) makes it easier for brokerage companies to earn commissions as investors buy shares. Gary Lutin, the chairman of the Shareholder Forum (which supports access to information investors need) and a former investment banker, said it was “sad” that “the current marketplace for financial services doesn’t offer jobs that will pay all these talented and highly skilled professionals to offer advice that doesn’t ring a banker’s cash register.” In other words, investors still face the same challenge of figuring out how to get the best information on which to base their investment decisions. This is why it pays to do your own research (reading not only analysts’ reports but company filings, news articles, and industry and academic reports), which your broker or investment adviser can help you with, at least partially. Form your own opinions about a company’s strategy to dominate its industry over the long term. Read: 24 money-manager clichés — and what they really mean Analysts are most “optimistic” about the health-care and information technology sectors, according to Butters, as both have the highest percentage of “buy” ratings: 57%. Here are ratings percentages for all 11 sectors of the S&P 500. Note: Because of rounding, the percentages for the ratings may not add up to 100%. So positive sentiment is low for the utilities and telecommunications sectors, but none of the sectors have double-digit levels of negative sentiment. Here are the 10 S&P 500 health-care companies with the highest percentages of “buy” ratings: You can click on the tickers for more information, including news, estimates and company filings. Here are the 10 S&P 500 IT companies with the highest percentages of “buy” ratings: There are really 11 stocks listed here because Alphabet Inc. (Google’s holding company) has two publicly traded classes of common shares. While there isn’t a single S&P 500 company with majority “sell” ratings, it can still be useful to know which ones have the highest percentages of negative ratings: It’s fascinating to see that even on a list of stocks with the highest percentages of “sell” ratings, there is one company — News Corp.

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has topped three points under record territory, and once again pulled in to the range. A jagged slow-motion breakout attempt remains underway. Tactically, the 2,442 area matches consecutive session highs, and the top of the June gap. Separately, near-term support, circa 2,433, closely matches the 20-day moving average. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials’ backdrop remains slightly stronger. The index initially gapped to record territory last week, and has thus far maintained the bottom of the gap (21,384) on a closing basis. Near-term resistance matches the 21,450 area , and is followed by the Dow’s all-time high of 21,535. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has tagged two-week highs — just above the 6,300 mark — and pulled in. Tactically, the former range top (6,243) remains a near-term inflection point. Delving deeper, more important support matches the 6,164 breakout point, better illustrated below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has likely absorbed the mid-June FAANG-fueled key reversal. (The downturn paced by technology bellwethers Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet.) The downside follow-through on the initial plunge has been contained, and effectively underpinned by the 6,164 breakout point on a closing basis. Resistance broadly spans from 6,310 to 6,321, levels matching the early-June peak, and the Nasdaq’s record close, respectively. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has staged a flat late-June pullback from record territory. Recall that the bottom of the gap (21,384) has essentially underpinned recent weakness, an area better illustrated on the hourly chart. More broadly, the June breakout builds on the Dow’s initially steep February rally. Similarly, the S&P 500 is acting well technically. To reiterate, the 20-day moving average, currently 2,434, has underpinned the June range, and remains a near-term inflection point. The S&P has not closed lower since May 19. Though the big three U.S. benchmarks have asserted a late-June holding pattern, of sorts, the bigger-picture price action remains constructive. Consider that each index topped Monday firmly within view of record territory as follows: Though each benchmark reversed from session highs, the S&P and the Dow closed positive amid still flat late-June selling pressure.

                                   has asserted a range-bound, but still bullish, June posture. The small-cap benchmark’s record close (142.10) and absolute record peak (142.90) remain within striking distance. A near-term target projects to the 145.50 area on a breakout. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has maintained the 50-day moving average, rising from support on increased volume. Tactically, the 320 area remains an inflection point, and is closely followed by the mid-cap benchmark’s record high (322.75) established June 13. More broadly, the small- and mid-cap benchmarks remain longer-term well positioned, as illustrated on the three-year chart. Against this backdrop, the U.S. sub-sector price action remains rotational, and technically healthy, punctuated by recent biotech and health care sector breakouts. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has established a flag-like pattern, pinned to the late-May/early-June rally. The pattern has been underpinned by the 20-day moving average, currently 2,434. Delving deeper, firmer support spans from 2,405 to 2,416, areas matching the breakout point, and the FAANG-induced low. The ascending 50-day moving average, also currently 2,405, matches support, and the S&P 500’s intermediate-term path of least resistance points higher barring a violation.

Earlier this month, the yield violated the 200-day moving average, pressured despite the Federal Reserve’s June 14 quarter-point rate hike, its second this year. The subsequent price action has been flat, capped by the breakdown point (2.18). More broadly, the June downturn builds on the yield’s bearish double top — defined by the December and March peaks — a pattern that continues to project to the 2.00 area. Tactically, trendline resistance closely matches the 200-day moving average, currently 2.23, and a posture lower supports a bearish longer-term bias.

Yemen has been devastated by a 27-month war between a Saudi-led coalition and the armed Iran-aligned Houthi group, making it a breeding ground for the disease, which spreads by faeces getting into food or water and thrives in places with poor sanitation. Speaking at a joint news conference with representatives of the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank, Zagaria said that had been some 246,000 suspected cases in the period to June 30. The WHO said this week that the outbreak had reached the halfway mark at 218,798 cases as a massive emergency response has begun to curb its spread two months into the epidemic. Although most of Yemen’s health infrastructure has broken down and health workers have not been paid for more than six months, the WHO is paying “incentives” to doctors, nurses, cleaners and paramedics to staff an emergency cholera network. With funding help from the World Bank, the WHO is setting up treatment centers with 50-60 beds each, overseen by shifts of about 14 staff working around the clock. The aim is to reach 5,000 beds in total. ","

,07062017,Reuters,06292017,"The PwC audit of the Italian business is coming under increasing scrutiny worldwide after a similar investigation launched in Britain last week. PwC said in an emailed statement it was not the company’s policy to comment on client issues. BT lost a fifth of its market value in January after revealing a 530 million-pound ($685 million) black hole in BT Italia’s accounts as a result of “improper accounting practices and a complex set of improper sales, purchase, factoring and leasing transactions”. In April the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) asked Italian market watchdog Consob to send it documentation regarding the audits carried out by PwC on BT in the period 2014-2017, the source said. Consob provided the data after getting the go-ahead from the Milan prosecutors office which is carrying out a criminal probe into alleged false accounting and embezzlement. BT filed a criminal complaint in Italy in April accusing several former executives and other staff of unlawful conduct. Current and former staff told Reuters efforts to hide the Italian unit’s performance had gone on since at least 2013. A spokeswoman for PCAOB, which has the powers to fine or bar accounting firms or their individual associates, said the regulator did not confirm or comment on inspections as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Under the act the PCAOB is required to supervise and inspect all accounting firms that regularly audit companies whose securities trade in the United States. While BT’s main listing is in London, its shares are also quoted on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American Depositary Shares. Consob declined to comment, but a source close to the watchdog said the “regulator was giving its attention to the PwC issue”. Last week Britain’s accounting regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), said it would investigate PwC audits of BT Group after the BT Italia scandal emerged. Reuters could not immediately confirm whether the FRC and the PCAOB were collaborating on the PwC issue, although a spokesman for the FRC said the British watchdog maintained close contact with its counterparts in other countries to improve audit quality. BT said last month it would drop PwC, its auditors since 1984, after an evaluation found “areas for improvement”. It said it would move to KPMG [KPMG.UL], another one of the “Big Four” accounting firms. Since the scandal erupted, various BT shareholders in the United States have launched class action cases, accusing the telecoms group of not informing the market and shareholders soon enough of the financial irregularities at its Italian unit. In March a Reuters investigation found allegations that a network of people in BT Italia had exaggerated revenues, faked contract renewals and invoices and invented bogus supplier transactions in order to meet bonus targets and disguise the unit’s true financial performance. A source also told Reuters in March that he and two other employees at BT Italia had warned their Madrid-based supervisor about possible accounting problems at the business in November 2015, nearly a year before BT announced that it had found accounting irregularities at the Italian company.

,07062017,Reuters,06292017,"LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s top medical technology companies are turning to robots to help with complex knee surgery, promising quicker procedures and better results in operations that often leave patients dissatisfied. Demand for artificial replacement joints is growing fast, as baby boomers’ knees and hips wear out, but for the past 15 years rival firms have failed to deliver a technological advance to gain them significant market share. Now U.S.-based Stryker and Britain’s Smith & Nephew  believe that is about to change, as robots give them an edge. Robots should mean less trauma to patients and faster recovery, although they still need to prove themselves in definitive clinical studies, which will not report results for a couple of years. Fares Haddad, a consultant surgeon at University College London Hospitals, is one of the first in Britain to use the new robots and has been impressed. However, he agrees healthcare providers need decisive data to prove they are worth an investment that can be as much as $1 million for each robot. “The main reason for using a robotic system is to improve precision and to be able to hit very accurately a target that varies from patient to patient,” he said. “It is particularly useful in knees because they are more problematic (than hips) and there are a chunk of patients that aren’t as satisfied as we would like with their knee replacement.” Satisfaction rates are only around 65 percent for knee operations, against 95 percent for hips, according to industry surveys. The rival types of robots vary in cost and sophistication, assisting surgeons with precision image guidance for bone cutting and the insertion of artificial joints. Orthopaedic companies hope to emulate the success of Intuitive Surgical, an early pioneer of robots in hospitals, which now has more than 4,000 of its da Vinci machines installed around the world for procedures including prostate removal, hernia repair and hysterectomies. In addition to selling into big Western markets, they also want to expand robot use in India, China and other emerging markets, where owning a prestigious high-tech system can be a marketing advantage for private hospitals. Stryker is leading the charge with its MAKO robotic arm, a platform it acquired for $1.65 billion in 2013 and which has pioneered robot-assisted whole-knee operations by determining optimal positioning and then helping with bone cutting. But it has competition from smaller rival Smith & Nephew, which last week launched a cheaper product called Navio for total knee replacements in the United States. The British group bought the company behind Navio for $275 million in 2016. That has kicked off the battle in earnest, since both companies are now able to do total knee replacements, which represent the vast majority of knee procedures. MAKO, which uses only Stryker’s joints and implants, costs around $1 million to install, while Navio, which does not have as many features and is not tied exclusively to Smith & Nephew’s products, is less than half the price. Both companies believe their robots will help them capture a bigger share of an orthopaedic market that has been split between four big players for more than a decade. Indeed, Smith & Nephew Chief Executive Olivier Bohuon said it was his company’s most important strategic investment for a decade. “We are now basically head to head with Stryker,” he said in an interview. “I do believe we are going to gain market share due to the fact we have robots, whether it’s Stryker or us.” COST-EFFECTIVENESS QUESTION Stryker, meanwhile, expects its MAKO system to start delivering market share gains from the end of 2017. “As we exit this year, we expect to start to see evidence in our knee market shares,” Katherine Owen, head of strategy at Stryker, told an investment conference in June. “Our goal with MAKO on knees is to capture hundreds of basis points of market share. What that time frame looks like, we haven’t been specific about.” Zimmer Biomet and Johnson & Johnson, the two other big players in orthopaedics, are lagging in the robotics race but both have plans to enter the area in different ways. J&J is working on surgical robotics with Verily, the life sciences arm of Google parent Alphabet, while Zimmer last year bought a majority stake in France’s Medtech, a specialist in neurosurgery. Analysts at Morgan Stanley believe robots have the potential to disrupt a market in artificial joints that has arguably become commoditised, with no knee or hip implant emerging as supreme in recent years. That chimes with the view of Smith & Nephew’s Bohuon, who argues that robots give his company a chance to punch above its weight, despite ranking No. 4 in reconstructive surgery. He reckons robotics could account for 20 to 40 percent of knee operations. Much will depend, however, on how the rival systems stack up. Jefferies analysts said the semi-automated bone resection offered by MAKO might well win out in the long term, but Navio offers a far cheaper option and is still well ahead of anything the other two major manufacturers have today. Orthopaedic surgeon Haddad, who has experimented with both, said the machines were very different and healthcare systems would need to assess their cost-effectiveness in the light of clinical trial results. “I think the clinical benefit will be pretty obvious but whether that justifies the upfront outlay is a big question.” ","

The deal has no termination fee, implying confidence from both parties that a counterbid was unlikely, Eamonn Flanagan, analyst at Shore Capital, said. But top Novae shareholder Neptune said the offer undervalued the company, and a fair offer would be at least 5 or 6 percent higher than the Axis bid. Neptune, which held 16 percent of Novae at the close of business on Wednesday, said Axis had bid after a “torrid” nine months for the company. “The buyer has approached at a time of short-term weakness in the share price,” Neptune’s Mark Martin, head of UK equities, said, suggesting there could be other potential suitors in private equity or corporate entities. Novae’s shares have fallen 26 percent over the past nine months, hurt by lower than expected underwriting contributions and changes to Britain’s Ogden rule, a tool for calculating personal injury and accident claims, which hit its full-year profit. Novae did not respond to an emailed request for comment on Neptune’s view. Insurers have been preparing for a wave of mergers and acquisitions, as valuations in the Lloyd’s insurance market became more attractive to overseas buyers due to a fall in the value of the pound after Britain voted to leave the European Union.

 ,07062017,Reuters,06292017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will use the premise of a national security review of the U.S. steel industry to demand action by the Group of 20 leaders to reduce excess capacity and other distortions in the global steel market, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said on Thursday. The Trump administration expects to delay the release of the hotly anticipated study until after Trump has spoken with G20 leaders at the summit in Germany next week, another administration official said on Thursday, requesting anonymity. The official said the delay was due to July 4 holiday week scheduling issues, with “no cause or linkage” to the Group of 20 meeting. But the “Section 232” review will be a hot topic at the gathering in Hamburg. The report could lead to broad new U.S. quotas or tariffs on imported steel, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had previously said he hoped to reveal its findings by the end of June. “The premise of that report we will use as an opportunity to talk with many of our trading partners around the world about what’s going on in steel,” Cohn said on Thursday. The study invokes a Cold War-era trade law that allows the president to restrict imports of goods deemed critical to national defense. The administration official declined to provide details on the findings of the study, which the department aims to use as a catalyst to help reduce excess global production capacity, particularly in China. But American companies that consume steel have been “vigorously” lobbying Trump administration officials against major new tariffs on foreign steel that would raise prices of the key raw material, a lobbyist with clients on both sides of the debate said. He compared the anti-tariff push to efforts by corporate CEOs in April to stop Trump from withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement, with many calling the White House to try to persuade the president to change his mind. Russia requested a discussion on the U.S. steel 232 investigation at the World Trade Organization’s Council for Trade in Goods meeting on Friday, signaling that any new import restrictions could face challenges from WTO members. Russia is a significant steel exporter to the United States. The Trump administration, asked whether provisions would be made for NATO allies, many of whom supply steel products to the U.S. defense industry, to negotiate an exemption from tariffs, said: “I wouldn’t call them exemptions. There is an interest in negotiating collective action which would deal with the problem in a more global way.” Ross has said he believes there is a “genuine” national security concern over the steel industry’s health and one possible remedy is to impose import quotas on certain products coupled with tariffs on any amounts that exceed the quotas. Ross told a German economic conference that such measures might have to be “broad-scale” but would be aimed at provoking a collective solution to deal with global steel excess capacity. Cohn told the news briefing on Thursday that Trump would engage in discussions with G20 counterparts about promoting “free and fair trade,” including taking concrete actions to solve the excess capacity problems in the steel sector. But Cohn added that the Trump administration “will act to ensure a level playing field for all.” ","

 ,07062017,Reuters,06292017,"June 30 (Reuters) - The United Steelworkers International (USW) has warned executives at the largest refinery on the U.S. East Coast that its members are prepared to strike unless cuts to health and pension benefits are restored, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. A warning letter was delivered on Wednesday to Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), a joint venture between Carlyle Group and Energy Transfer Partners of the 335,000-barrel-per-day refinery on the south side of Philadelphia. The local USW chapter has scheduled emergency meetings for next week, and a strike authorization vote could come in the next two weeks, the sources said. The refinery is a key gasoline and diesel suppliers for the Mid-Atlantic, one of the busiest parts of the country in terms of refined product demand. PES forced employees to contribute more to their health plans and suspended pension contributions last September as the fat refining margins from the Bakken rail boom disappeared. The local union contested the cuts, and the issue is in arbitration. The USW did not immediately respond to requests for comment and PES declined to comment on Friday. A refinery strike unrelated to new contract negotiations would be highly unusual since all union contracts typically include no-strike clauses. Several refineries were hit by strikes in 2015 after contract negotiations stalled, forcing some to temporarily close. Carlyle helped rescue the refinery from closure in 2012. The move paid big dividends early as the refinery leveraged cheap crude shipped by rail from North Dakota’s Bakken oil fields to amass large profits. However, the Bakken discount has disappeared, and so have the trains, sapping profits. PES and other East Coast refiners have been forced to return to refining West African crudes.

In addition to the purchase price, VTG said it would reimburse financial holding company CIT Group for up to 140 million euros  ($159.89 million) that NACCO plans to invest in rail cars this year. VTG said it would finance the acquisition via a senior loan of up to 500 million euros, a privately placed hybrid bond of around 300 million euros and the assumption of around 120 million euros of debt. It said it would refinance the hybrid bond via the capital market, possibly via a rights issue. Depending on the investments NACCO makes this year, the purchase will add around 120 million euros to annual sales in 2018 and around 100 million euros to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), before transaction and integration costs and including synergies, VTG said.

As part of a complex series of financial transactions, ANZ ended up with ownership documents for nickel stored in Singapore and South Korea, but discovered they were fraudulent when it tried to sell the metal, the court papers said. ANZ has not yet filed a lawsuit, but the bank told the U.S. court it planned to do so in Asia once it discovered who was behind the fraud. ANZ “has every intention of pursuing causes of action against... fraudsters, once their identities are known”, the papers said. Marex had said in a statement it rejected the claim and issued a separate claim against Access World for an unspecified amount because it said the warehouse operator had verified the receipts as being authentic. Natixis and Access World had declined to comment. The fraud was uncovered following repurchase transactions between ANZ and two Hong Kong firms involving 84 warehouse receipts for nickel of which 83 turned out to be fake, the court papers filed by ANZ said. ANZ’s court filing included copies of the purchase contracts, showing the transactions involved 32,964 tonnes of nickel, which at current benchmark prices CMNI3 would be worth about $306.4 million. The deals were arranged by broker ED&F Man, which was not involved in the fraud and was cooperating to identify those responsible, ANZ added in the legal documents. “ED&F is not involved in this legal action and has no further comment to make,” the broker said in an emailed statement. ANZ said in the U.S. court papers that it had already unearthed information in Hong Kong after it asked courts there for access to bank records. For example, those bank documents, included in the U.S. court filing, showed transfers of $151 million from the two Hong Kong firms involved in the nickel trades to people and entities in California. ANZ told the U.S. court it wanted to interview those parties in California that received the funds. ","

This year, the healthcare sector and ETFs such as XLV are showing last year was just a bump in the road in what has been a lengthy move higher for the group. XLV is up 16% through the first half of 2017 compared to a gain of just over 9% for the S&P 500. Underscoring the strength in the healthcare sector is this data point: five of the top 10 sector ETFs on a year-to-date basis are healthcare funds. Proving that the rally in the group is widespread, those five ETFs include a small-cap fund, biotech ETFs and the high-flying iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI). Medical device stocks are extending a lengthy period of bullishness, including 2016 when the group outperformed the broader healthcare space by a wide margin. (For more, see also: Why This Healthcare ETF Is Surging.) IHI, XLV and other healthcare ETFs have been surging amid a volatile political environment for the sector that has seen the Trump Administration continually take aim at high pharmaceuticals prices and, more recently, the Republican-controlled Senate unveil a possible replacement for the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Still, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals stocks, among others, jumped late last month after the Obamacare replacement legislation was unveiled. “Favorable elements in the bill, according to analysts, included the elimination of taxes on industry and provisions to stabilize the insurance exchanges set up under former President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare law,” according to Reuters.

Leslie Picker,07062017,CNBC,06292017,"Acrobats and bald drummers will combine in a deal signed in blue ink. Cirque du Soleil said Thursday that it agreed to acquire Blue Man Productions, the first purchase in its quest to expand beyond the circus arts. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. ""We want to broaden our horizons, develop new forms of entertainment, reach out to new audiences and expand our own creative capabilities,"" said Daniel Lamarre, president and CEO of Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil in a statement Thursday. ""Today, we are taking a decisive step towards materializing these ambitions."" Lamarre told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" Thursday that the deal was a ""strategy of diversification"" for the famous circus company. ""We have the opportunity to have a new brand that we are going to bring to its full potential around the world,"" Lamarre said. ""Cirque du Soleil is an amazing marketing and distribution machine around the world, and the Blue Man Group deserve the support of an organization like ours to continue to grow around the world."" The ambitions were put in motion two years ago when TPG, a $73 billion private-equity firm, took a majority stake. At the time, The Wall Street Journal reported that the investment valued Cirque du Soleil at $1.5 billion. Fosun Industrial Holdings, a Chinese investment firm, and Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, a Canadian pension fund, also took a stake in Cirque du Soleil at the time TPG did. TPG owns stakes in a variety of entertainment brands including Creative Arts Agency, Spotify and Univision. TPG's growth-investing arm also co-founded STX Entertainment, which produced movies such as ""Edge of Seventeen"" and ""Bad Moms."" With the acquisition of Blue Man Group, Cirque du Soleil is looking to expand its audience pool. Blue Man Group currently has six productions stationed in New York, Boston, Las Vegas, Chicago, Orlando and Berlin and two touring productions roving around North America and the world. The company was owned by its co-founders Chris Wink and Phil Stanton and the GF Capital Private Equity Fund. Cirque du Soleil's audience is still demonstrably larger, with 18 shows being simultaneously performed. With the additional Blue Man Group productions added to Cirque du Soleil's shows, Lamarre hopes to grow the circus company into a ""global leader of entertainment."" ""It's a big, big shift, and it has been supported by the Blue Man Group,"" Lamarre said. ""What it means is that now, we're no longer only a circus company, but now, were going to become a global leader of entertainment. That's the goal we are pursuing."" It is just the first deal being contemplated. Cirque du Soleil and TPG have compiled a list of additional acquisition targets to add to the entertainment portfolio, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Wink and Stanton, along with Matt Goldman, built the image of the bald and blue performer that they named ""Blue Man,"" evoking the word ""human,"" according to the company's website. Their performances utilize bright colors, lights, technology and props to create percussive sounds and dance moves. That compares with Cirque du Soleil productions, which incorporate stunts and acrobatics into various storylines. Goldman Sachs served as the advisor to Blue Man Group.

 ,07062017,CNBC,06292017,"Arts and crafts retailer Hobby Lobby has agreed to forfeit thousands of illegally smuggled ancient Middle Eastern artifacts obtained from antiquities dealers for a Bible museum headed by its president, the company and U.S. officials said on Wednesday. The forfeiture will include some 5,500 artifacts purchased by Hobby Lobby that originated from the region of modern-day Iraq and were shipped under false labels, as well as an additional $3 million to settle the civil charges, the Department of Justice said in a statement. ""The protection of cultural heritage is a mission that (Homeland Security Investigations) and its partner U.S. Customs and Border Protection take very seriously as we recognize that while some may put a price on these artifacts, the people of Iraq consider them priceless,"" Angel Melendez, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in New York, said in the statement. Privately-held Hobby Lobby said that it was new to the world of antiquities when it began acquiring historical items for its Museum of the Bible in 2009 and made mistakes in relying on dealers and shippers who ""did not understand the correct way to document and ship"" them. The company's president, Steve Green, is the chairman and founder of the Museum of the Bible, which is under construction in Washington, D.C. The artifacts being forfeited include cuneiform tablets and bricks, clay bullae and cylinder seals. Cuneiform is an ancient system of writing on clay tablets. ""At no time did Hobby Lobby ever purchase items from dealers in Iraq or from anyone who indicated that they acquired items from that country,"" Green said in his statement. ""Hobby Lobby condemns such conduct and has always acted with the intent to protect ancient items of cultural and historical importance. ... ""We have accepted responsibility and learned a great deal,"" Green added, saying that the company has now ""implemented acquisition policies and procedures based on the industry's highest standards."" Federal prosecutors say that when Hobby Lobby, which is based in Oklahoma City, began assembling its collection it was warned by an expert on cultural property law to be cautious in acquiring artifacts from Iraq, which in some cases have been looted from archaeological sites. Despite that warning and other red flags the company in December 2010 purchased thousands of items from a middle-man, without meeting the purported owner, according to prosecutors. A dealer based in the United Arab Emirates shipped packages containing the artifacts to three Hobby Lobby corporate addresses in Oklahoma City, bearing false label that described their contents as ""ceramic tiles"" or ""clay tiles"" and the country of origin as Turkey.

"Mark Henricks, special to CNBC.com",07062017,CNBC,06292017,"These days, hardly anybody believes the American retirement dream is doing all right. In fact, 88 percent of Americans agree that the nation faces a retirement crisis, according to a 2017 survey by the Washington, D.C.-based National Institute on Retirement Security pension research group. However, a small but vocal group of scholars is advancing an opposing viewpoint. They say Americans' chances for financial security in retirement are in better shape than is commonly supposed. So is it possible the retirement crisis is oversold? ""It's not merely possible, it's probable,"" said Andrew Biggs, a scholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and former deputy commissioner for policy at the Social Security Administration. For one thing, he notes that while many contend low-earning Americans aren't saving enough for retirement, poverty is lower during retirement than during people's working years. A 2016 Census Bureau report shows that in 2015 just 8.8 percent of people 65 and older were impoverished, compared to 19.7 percent of children under 18 and 12.4 percent of 18- to 65-year-olds. If there were a crisis, Biggs says, retired people should be complaining. Yet a 2016 Gallup poll found 74 percent of U.S. retirees say they are living comfortably. And a 2017 Vanguard report found just 16 percent of retirees were dissatisfied with their financial situation, compared with 21 percent of pre-retirees. More from FA Playbook: The pros, cons of paying off mortgages before retirement Swelling ranks of retirees negatively impacting returns Retirement saving remains a challenge for many women Perhaps most surprisingly, Biggs points to recent research suggesting retiree incomes generally match or even exceed their pre-retirement incomes. A 2017 study by Internal Revenue Service and Investment Company Institute researchers analyzed tax returns and found most people experience no income dropoff after claiming Social Security. In fact, the median household's income rises after retirement. ""It's hard to paint a picture where this leads to a true retirement crisis,"" Biggs said. Retirement policy can get tangled up in ideology, partisan politics and Beltway power struggles. Presumably, those concerns would not influence a Canadian such as Frederick Vettese, chief actuary at Toronto-based human resource advisor Morneau Shepell and author of The Essential Retirement Guide: A Contrarian's Perspective. Vettese also doubts the retirement crisis. ""The retirement savings crisis has definitely been oversold,"" he said. ""A good indication of this is that pre-retirees have a significantly higher level of concern about whether they are financially prepared for retirement than is the case for retirees."" Buttressing Vettese's point, the 2017 Vanguard study found that 10 percent of U.S. pre-retirees considered their financial situation to be in crisis, while just 4 percent of retired people felt likewise. Vettese says those who warn of crisis are basing their concern on ""highly flawed"" estimates of what a comfortable retirement costs. The General Accounting Office in 2015 examined competing claims for existence of a retirement crisis and agreed that varying estimates of post-retirement spending needs explained most of the disagreement. In general, financial planners say retirees need about 70 percent of pre-retirement income to be secure in retirement. Some believe the figure should be much higher. In fact, the National Institute of Retirement Security uses 85 percent as a benchmark. Vettese says his analysis shows even the lower figures are too high. ""In the case of the typical middle-income household that paid off a mortgage, raised children and made the usual payroll deductions, the real target is closer to 50 percent,"" he said. Although those who disregard the retirement-crisis warnings can muster great assurance and quantities of data and analysis to support their views, crisis defenders are also well equipped with stats. ""It's as serious as it could be,"" said Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, which produces regular reports on the topic. Munnell says poverty is a poor benchmark and that a better one would measure the degree to which retirement will mean a less comfortable lifestyle. ""About half of today's working-age households are at risk of not being able to maintain their standard of living in retirement,"" Munnell noted. Munnell says two powerful factors drive the shortfall. ""First, people will need more retirement income in the future because we are living longer, retiree health-care costs continue to grow rapidly, and interest rates remain low,"" she said. ""Second, people will have less from traditional sources."" Social Security benefits have already been effectively cut by raising the full retirement age to 67 from 65, she explained, and few workers today can join defined-benefit pension plans. Munnell suggests falling post-retirement spending such as Vettese describes occurs because retirees can't afford to spend more. ""While it is true that spending declines as people age, this pattern may simply track declining income rather than an actual preference,"" she said. Also sounding the crisis alarm is Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist, director of the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at The New School in New York and author of How to Retire with Enough Money. Ghilarducci says the real crisis is one of downward mobility, not poverty. ""Members of the middle class will experience downward mobility and end up in near poverty in retirement,"" she said. Only a minority of ""independent and rigorous"" researchers consider that retirement savings are adequate, Ghilarducci explained. ""Most scholars do not think so,"" she said, pointing to the 2015 GAO report that examined a number of efforts to research whether Americans have saved enough for retirement. ""The studies generally found about one-third to two-thirds of workers are at risk of falling short of this target."" Both sides believe some of the problems around the reporting of the retirement crisis derive from profit-motivated financial firms and credulous financial journalists. They are the source of the viewpoints they disagree with. ""All these vendors make a lot of money when they say there's a crisis and we'll help you get out of it,"" Ghilarducci said. Biggs at the American Enterprise Institute agrees. ""What is the chance that a company that makes its business by selling retirement savings products is going to tell you that you're saving too much for retirement?"" he said. ""They're not lying."" He added, ""They believe in their product. But people are credulous about this, particularly in the media.""

"Kevin Johnson, Jilly Stephens and Diana Aviv",07062017,CNBC,06292017,"The United States is a nation built on the values of equal opportunity, hard work and self-determination. It prides itself on the belief that in this land of opportunity any woman, man and child should be able to reach their full potential. The challenge is to create the environment in which people can thrive. That includes a strong social compact in which government, business and the social (non-profit) sector invest in the well-being of individuals and families and ensure pathways to opportunity and success. At the most basic level that begins with ensuring access to life's basic needs, including quality, affordable food. Sadly, this is not the reality for all too many Americans. Despite their best efforts, millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. Many people across the country are working two or even three jobs to put food on the tables and keep a roof over their heads. A report supported by City Harvest found that, in New York City alone, over 2.7 million men, women and children face hunger. Across the United States, 42 million people are ""food insecure"" — meaning that they don't know with certainty where their next meal will come from, if at all. That includes more than 13 million children in the U.S. who live in food insecure households. Good nutrition is vital for their health and cognitive development, and needed for each child to reach his or her full potential. The coming months are especially challenging, as only one in six of the millions of children who are eligible for free or reduced-priced meals at school receive that benefit over the summer. The proposed federal budget calls for dramatic cuts to similar social programs that help the most vulnerable people in our nation. For example, potential cuts of $193 billion to SNAP (formerly food stamps) will deeply impact the 43 million women, children, men and seniors the program currently serves. With so many pressing issues at stake, we cannot lose sight of ensuring our neighbors aren't facing one of the worst uncertainties imaginable – not knowing if they will have enough food to eat. It is times like these when we need the private and social sectors to stand together to help our most vulnerable kids and their families. That is why Starbucks and other businesses are partnering with Feeding America® — and its nationwide network of food banks and food rescue organizations, including City Harvest — to create programs like FoodShare. The program has set a goal to eliminate any potential food waste by rescuing 100 percent of available-to-donate food from their U.S. stores and getting it in the hands of the millions of New Yorkers and Americans who are facing hunger. Food insecurity prevents the young girl in Harlem from focusing in school because of an empty stomach; causes the young mother in San Antonio to miss multiple meals in order to feed her child; and forces the grandfather in Chicago to scrape by to pay for medicine, which he prioritizes ahead of his next meal. Communities, families and children cannot thrive on empty stomachs. We must continue to ensure that people have access to nutritious meals that give them the fuel they need to thrive. We need the commitment of our friends, families and neighbors to support one another in good times and bad, and be willing to share not only our food but also the American dream.

""But one thing we know as a perennial winner is to bet on abnormal profitability and/or abnormal growth, and we're seeing a good bit of both in the tech space.""  ""The portion of the economy that is tech, one way or another, whether it is [artificial intelligence] or changes in entertainment, or changes in manufacturing, continues to grow,"" he said, adding that technology is indeed overbought, ""and the only caveat we would add to that is, so is everything else."" For the setup to a trade he planned to execute Thursday, TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon said he would bet against Apple amid the current struggling tech space. He pointed out that the $143 stock has fallen into a consolidation around the mid-$140's area, and has been unable to retake the high of $155.98 it reached in early June. Social stocks have gotten slammed, but one has survived the social media meltdown: Twitter. The charts could be setting up for an even bigger pop for the social network. The bears devoured the Apple trade this week, but one technician isn't sweating the sell-off. Should you buy the dip? Some say that's no longer the viable strategy it once was. Wells Fargo's Pravit Chintawongvanich says investors can't assume buying every dip will pay off. Small-cap stocks just entered the dreaded death cross, a technical development that traditionally suggests weakness ahead for an asset. And if history is any indication, that may signal trouble for the broader market. Apple shares just dipped into bear market territory. “I don’t think that we’ll see a recovery before the end of 2018,” according to tech investor Paul Meeks. Social stocks are in a slump, but one is flying above the rest: Twitter. Bill Baruch of Blue Line Futures and Michael Bapis of Vios Advisors at Rockefeller Capital Management discuss whether the stock is a social safety trade. Gina Sanchez of Chantico Global says a North Korean attack, should one occur, isn't likely to cause significant long-term market impact. Boris Schlossberg of BK Asset Management says the ISM non-manufacturing report is key to watch ahead the jobs data released Friday. Chad Morganlander of Washington Crossing Advisors is watching the dollar this week and expects it'll begin to strengthen heading into the second half of the year.

Fred Imbert,07062017,CNBC,06292017,"U.S. stocks closed lower Thursday as technology stocks declined amid a rise in global bond yields. Oil prices settled 0.9 percent higher at $45.52 a barrel after earlier rising more than 2 percent. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported U.S. commercial crude inventories fell by a more-than-expected 6.3 million barrels in the week through June 30. Energy ended 1.8 percent lower as the second-worst performer in the S&P 500. The Dow Jones industrial average finished the session 158.1 points lower at 21,320.04. UnitedHealth, Walt Disney, 3M and Apple had the greatest negative impact on the index. The Nasdaq composite closed 1 percent lower at 6,089.46. The S&P 500 finished Thursday down 0.4 percent at 2,409.75. Earlier, the major indexes pared losses in midday trade. Tech trimmed losses from an earlier decline of more than 1 percent to close 0.8 percent lower. ""Tech has recovered. You've seen German 10-year bund yields and U.S. Treasury yields kind of steady here. They're not going anywhere,"" said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. There's a ""comfort of yields steadying, allowing tech to recover."" Global sovereign bond yields held higher. The 10-year German Bund yield broke above 0.50 percent for the first time since January 2016 and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 2.38 percent. Julian Emanuel, UBS equity and derivatives strategist, said in a note Wednesday that higher yields could present a problem for tech stocks near-term. Higher yields ""will require superior earnings reports to halt the slide – the 'Summer Squall' for Tech and the 'Summer Stall' for the broad market could continue through July,"" he said. Shares of Facebook, Tesla, Apple, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet all traded lower, pushing the Technology Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund (XLK) down by 0.9 percent. Tesla shares fell 5.5 percent Thursday, sending shares down 20 percent from a recent high, or into bear market territory. In the last two days a slew of analysts, including ones from Goldman Sachs and Bernstein, said in notes that Tesla's second-quarter delivery results disappointed them. Tech — this year's best-performing sector coming into Thursday's session — has been sputtering lately, falling 4 percent over the past month. The sector was also on track for its fourth losing session in five and has been plagued by valuation concerns. That said, the sector's pullback should be short-lived, said Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital. ""Valuations are rich, but if think more money is going into these companies, then you're going to buy them anyway,"" she said. Bond prices have been falling as major central banks have adopted more hawkish rhetoric, especially from the European Central Bank. Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi said the European economy was ""strengthening and broadening,"" adding ""the threat of deflation is gone and reflationary forces are at play."" ""If Draghi hadn't spoken, yields globally would probably be unchanged,"" said Eric Souza, senior portfolio manager at Silicon Valley Bank. ""The market is basically looking down the road and realizing that this low-rate environment we're used to may not be ending, but [central banks] are definitely taking their foot off the pedal."" Minutes from the ECB's June meeting released Thursday also showed officials discussed shifting their bias from easing to neutral, helping yields in the region rise and drag their U.S. counterparts higher. ""There's a good analogy between what's happening right now in the German bond market and what happened in the U.S. bond market back in 2013,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, referring to the so-called Taper Tantrum. Investors in the U.S. also focused on a series of economic data releases. First, a report from ADP and Moody's Analytics showed the U.S. economy added 158,000 jobs last month, less than the expected 185,000. The report usually serves as a warm-up act for the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly employment report, which is set for release Friday. ""When we get to the level of employment that we have, ... you'd expect the pace of jobs creation to slow down,"" said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the Private Client Group at U.S. Bank. ""What we're looking for is how does that relate to inflation."" Weekly jobless claims, meanwhile, came in at 248,000, slightly higher than the expected 243,000. Other data released included the IHS Markit services PMI for June, which showed the strongest expansion in business activity since January, and the ISM nonmanufacturing index, which rose to 57.4 in June from 56.9 in May. Gold futures for August delivery rose $1.60 to $1,223.30 an ounce. The U.S. dollar index traded about half a percent lower, with the euro near $1.14 and the yen around 113.33 against the dollar. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 12.60, near its highest since June 29. About five stocks declined for every advancer on the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 877.77 million and a composite volume of 3.353 billion at the close.

Dan Mangan,07062017,CNBC,06292017,"""Pharma Bro"" Martin Shkreli, during a surprise visit with reporters covering his fraud trial Friday, criticized the people prosecuting him as the ""junior varsity,"" claimed he never considered taking a plea deal and said people ""blame me for everything."" Shkreli also griped about news headlines regarding his case, and teed off on a young woman who had testified he for almost a year dragged out redeeming her $435,000 investment in his hedge fund, saying she wasn't a ""victim."" And Shrkreli said that several documents discussed at the trial, which raised questions about his honesty with investors, were prepared by other people. ""Do I want to exonerate myself?"" he asked a small group of journalists when asked if he had desired to have his day in court. ""Yes."" He only stopped talking and left when his high-powered lawyer Benjamin Brafman  peered in the room and asked, ""Martin, can I talk to you for a minute?"" Later, Brafman said would prefer Shkreli not conduct any more impromptu press conferences ""because sometimes he doesn't have a filter."" ""I'm hoping he doesn't do it ever again,"" Brafman told reporters. Tweet At the end of the day's session, before leaving court, Shkreli told one reporter ""I have to be very careful about who I talk to. I might get into trouble."" And Shkreli said to a sketch artist, ""You're talking to 'Rain Man.' I remember everything."" The ""Rain Man"" reference was to Brafman's blistering opening argument, during which he said Shkreli's business colleagues used the name of that Tom Cruise movie behind his back because it featured an autistic savant, played by Dustin Hoffman. Those colleagues supposedly suspected the highly intelligent Shkreli also might be autistic. Shkreli's unexpected remarks came during the lunch break of his securities fraud trial in Brooklyn, NY, federal court. He is charged with looting millions of dollars from Retrophin, the publicly traded drug company he founded. Prosecutors claim he used the money to repay to investors whom allegedly defrauded at two hedge funds he had run, in addition to paying off personal debts. Shkreli walked into a courtroom that is on the same floor as the one where his trial is being conducted, and saw several reporters. The room has an video and audio feed of the trial for spectators who don't have seats in the main courtroom. ""Welcome,"" one reporter said when she saw Shkreli. The 34-year former pharmaceuticals executive then began talking freely for about five minutes. Shkreli first mentioned that a friend of his had been in the the trial's so-called ""overflow"" room earlier in the week, and tried to sit on the judge's bench. When a reporter asked Shkreli what he thought of the trial's opening arguments on Wednesday, he shot back, ""How do you think they went?"" Shkreli then suggested that his lawyer Brafman, who gave an impassioned opening, had far outclassed assistant United States Attorney G. Karthik Srinivasan, who argument was more workman-like. Shkreli several times mentioned that Srinivasan had joined the prosecutor's office in the Eastern District of New York only two years ago. He also pointed out that Srinivasan before that had been an associate at the Manhattan law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind. When a CNBC reporter noted that the Eastern District is a well-regarded prosecutors' office, one which as late as 2015 had been led by former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Shkreli scoffed. He then called the Eastern District the ""junior varsity."" There is a long-standing intramural rivalry between the U.S. Attorney's Office for Eastern District of New York — which encompasses Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island — and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, whose ambit includes Manhattan and its Financial District. In New York's legal world, many see the Southern District as the more elite of the two, a fact that Shkreli seemed keenly aware of. John Marzulli, a spokesman for the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District, declined to comment on Shkreli's scornful remarks. Shkreli also suggested that Winston Paes, who had been  the lead prosecutor in the case, chickened out of taking it trial, because he had accepted a job several months at the large Manhattan firm Debevoise & Plimpton. ""Why would you walk out on the biggest case of your life?"" Shkreli asked. Paes, through a colleague, declined to comment to CNBC. Asked if he thought Brafman's opening argument was worth $4 million that has supposedly been paid to that attorney's law firm, Shkreli disputed the accuracy of that amount. He also said the reporter who asked about it always gets facts wrong. But a 10-Q filing in May by Retrophin, which ousted Shkreli in 2014, says he claimed the company owed him $5 million in legal expenses that he had incurred in defending both the criminal case and a related civil case by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Retrophin, according to the company's filings, to date has advanced $2.8 million in pre-trial fees for Shkreli's lawyers, and $2 million in trial fees, for a total of $4.8 million. At the same time, Retrophin is suing Shkreli for allegedly ripping off the company, is and cooperating with federal authorities in their cases against him. Brafman, during a hearing last week, said his firm has been paid $800,000 less than the $4.8 million tally. The difference between the two amounts is $4 million. Shkreli on Friday said he thought the trial, which was in its third day since jurors were seated, was going well for the defense. But he bemoaned the headlines about the testimony of Sarah Hassan, who invested $300,000 of her own money in his hedge fund in 2011. Shkreli complained that those headlines did not highlight the fact that she  ended up getting a total of $1.3 million in cash combined with the proceeds of sales of Retrophin stock given her. Her own family's hedge fund, which she manages, netted even more from selling Retrophin stock it had acquired as a result of an initial $125,000 stake in the company. ""How can a victim make $2.7 million?"" Shkreli asked. ""She's not a victim."" But Hassan had testified that Shkreki for almost a year stalled in redeeming her personal investment stake — which he claimed had grown to $435,000 —  after she asked to be paid out upon learning he was closing that MSMB Capital. She also said Shkreli surprised her by telling her that he had, without getting her permission, used her personal money at MSMB to capitalize the start up of Retrophin. Shkreli told reporters Friday that he believed jurors were most impressed not by Hassan's complaints about the long delay in getting her money, but by the fact that she made ""four times"" her investment. ""I made nothing"" from MSMB Capital, Shkreli added. ""They blame me for everything,"" Shkreli said, apparently referring to prosecutors and his other critics. ""Blame me for capitalism,"" Shkreli said. ""Blame me for EpiPen."" Several prospective jurors earlier this week were excused from consideration because they incorrectly believed Shkreli had raised the price of the anti-allergy device EpiPen. In reality, Shkreli drew widespread public scorn in 2015 for hiking the price of an anti-parasite drug named Daraprim by more than 5,000 percent while serving as CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals. Shkreli also told reporters that he did not prepare tax documents or Retrophin marketing documents that Hassan testified about on Thursday. Other people did that, he said. Hassan had testifed that Shkreli dragged his feet in giving her tax documents related to her investment in his hedge fund, and that when she received them they mistakenly listed her father's name as part of the investment. Fred Hassan, her dad and a well-known pharma executive, also was listed as a member of Retrophin's board of directors on a pitch presentation assembled when the company was being created, Sarah Hassan said. Fred Hassan said he never invested in Shkreli's hedge fund, nor did he have any role as a director, adviser or investor in Retrophin. Instead, Hassan and his daughter testified,  Sarah Hassan invested $125,000 from the family's own hedge fund, DynaGrow, in Retrophin. More than 90 percent of DynaGrow's assets belongs to Fred Hassan and his wife. Shkreli played coy and declined to answer a reporter when asked if prosecutors had offered him a plea deal. But he noted that most federal criminal defendant plead guilty instead of going to trial. When asked directly if he had turned down any offer from prosecutors, which likely would have included a reduction in the number of criminal counts he would have pleaded guilty to, Shkreli said he had. Brafman, Shkreli's lawyer, told CNBC as he walked outside of court at the end of the day, ""I really think Martin is not going to be speaking to you guys again if he listens to me."" ""I don't think anything Martin says by now is going to affect the case one way or the other, but I would very much appreciate it if he did not talk to the press because sometimes he doesn't have a filter,"" said Brafman. As Bradfman spoke, Shkreli walked by his side, grinning broadly. ",Shkreli blasts prosecutors as 'junior varsity' to reporters
Michelle Fox,07062017,CNBC,06292017,"Valuations continue to climb higher, and that has trader Peter Costa staying out of the stock market. The president of Empire Executions has been shorting the market, and now he's ""almost thinking of doubling down."" ""You've had this move, and it's been nonstop,"" Costa told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Friday. ""There's going to be an inflection point, and I think it's coming up fairly soon."" U.S. equities closed mostly higher on Friday. The Nasdaq, which closed just below breakeven, posted its largest first-half gains since 2009. Costa believes people aren't paying attention to the ""big morass of problems"" in Washington, D.C., which he said will trickle down into the equity markets. While Costa has been betting against the stock market this year, it has continued to climb. He admitted there may come a point where he'll have to ""throw in the towel,"" like if he sees second-quarter earnings ""getting better and better."" ""We'll wait until … the end of the summer and see what happens there. By that time I'll either be broke or I'll ... be right,"" he said. Meanwhile, Chris Cordaro, chief investment officer at RegentAtlantic, believes ""there is a lot of value out there."" He likes financials, oils and energy infrastructure. He's also a big fan of Apple, which, he notes, when you strip out the cash is selling at a 15 price-earnings ratio. That's a ""tremendous bargain"" for a brand that ""can mint revenue,"" Cordaro said. For ""Shark Tank"" host Kevin O'Leary, holding positions internationally is a must. ""There are many, many good European companies trading at significant discounts to their equivalents in the S&P 500,"" the chairman of O'Shares ETFs said in an interview with ""Closing Bell."" For instance, he owns Anheuser-Busch. ""I'm staying in Europe forever with 20 percent of the portfolio. I'm staying international with 20 percent because I've just looked and realized I can never guess over the last 40 years when to be in or out of those Asian or European markets,"" O'Leary added. Fred Lane, on the other hand, is sticking to domestic stocks. While he agrees that valuations are cheaper overseas right now, he has a long-term orientation and is discouraged by Europe. ""When I look at Europe I see declining populations, I see very poor demographics, I see even higher level of entitlements than we have here in the United States [and] I think lower levels of productivity,"" the managing partner at Lane Generational of Raymond James told ""Closing Bell."" Right now he thinks tech stocks are in for a pause but will rebound. He also thinks health-care stocks will come back strongly. ","Market inflection point coming soon, trader says"
 ,07062017,CNBC,06292017,"The world's top medical technology companies are turning to robots to help with complex knee surgery, promising quicker procedures and better results in operations that often leave patients dissatisfied. Demand for artificial replacement joints is growing fast, as baby boomers' knees and hips wear out, but for the past 15 years rival firms have failed to deliver a technological advance to gain them significant market share. Now U.S.-based Stryker and Britain's Smith & Nephew believe that is about to change, as robots give them an edge. Robots should mean less trauma to patients and faster recovery, although they still need to prove themselves in definitive clinical studies, which will not report results for a couple of years. Fares Haddad, a consultant surgeon at University College London Hospitals, is one of the first in Britain to use the new robots and has been impressed. However, he agrees healthcare providers need decisive data to prove they are worth an investment that can be as much as $1 million for each robot. ""The main reason for using a robotic system is to improve precision and to be able to hit very accurately a target that varies from patient to patient,"" he said. ""It is particularly useful in knees because they are more problematic (than hips) and there are a chunk of patients that aren't as satisfied as we would like with their knee replacement."" Satisfaction rates are only around 65 percent for knee operations, against 95 percent for hips, according to industry surveys. The rival types of robots vary in cost and sophistication, assisting surgeons with precision image guidance for bone cutting and the insertion of artificial joints. Orthopaedic companies hope to emulate the success of Intuitive Surgical, an early pioneer of robots in hospitals, which now has more than 4,000 of its da Vinci machines installed around the world for procedures including prostate removal, hernia repair and hysterectomies. In addition to selling into big Western markets, they also want to expand robot use in India, China and other emerging markets, where owning a prestigious high-tech system can be a marketing advantage for private hospitals. Stryker is leading the charge with its MAKO robotic arm, a platform it acquired for $1.65 billion in 2013 and which has pioneered robot-assisted whole-knee operations by determining optimal positioning and then helping with bone cutting. But it has competition from smaller rival Smith & Nephew, which last week launched a cheaper product called Navio for total knee replacements in the United States. The British group bought the company behind Navio for $275 million in 2016. That has kicked off the battle in earnest, since both companies are now able to do total knee replacements, which represent the vast majority of knee procedures. MAKO, which uses only Stryker's joints and implants, costs around $1 million to install, while Navio, which does not have as many features and is not tied exclusively to Smith & Nephew's products, is less than half the price. Both companies believe their robots will help them capture a bigger share of an orthopaedic market that has been split between four big players for more than a decade. Indeed, Smith & Nephew Chief Executive Olivier Bohuon said it was his company's most important strategic investment for a decade. ""We are now basically head to head with Stryker,"" he said in an interview. ""I do believe we are going to gain market share due to the fact we have robots, whether it's Stryker or us."" Stryker, meanwhile, expects its MAKO system to start delivering market share gains from the end of 2017. ""As we exit this year, we expect to start to see evidence in our knee market shares,"" Katherine Owen, head of strategy at Stryker, told an investment conference in June. ""Our goal with MAKO on knees is to capture hundreds of basis points of market share. What that time frame looks like, we haven't been specific about."" Zimmer Biomet and Johnson & Johnson, the two other big players in orthopaedics, are lagging in the robotics race but both have plans to enter the area in different ways. J&J is working on surgical robotics with Verily, the life sciences arm of Google parent Alphabet, while Zimmer last year bought a majority stake in France's Medtech, a specialist in neurosurgery. Analysts at Morgan Stanley believe robots have the potential to disrupt a market in artificial joints that has arguably become commoditised, with no knee or hip implant emerging as supreme in recent years. That chimes with the view of Smith & Nephew's Bohuon, who argues that robots give his company a chance to punch above its weight, despite ranking No. 4 in reconstructive surgery. He reckons robotics could account for 20 to 40 percent of knee operations. Much will depend, however, on how the rival systems stack up. Jefferies analysts said the semi-automated bone resection offered by MAKO might well win out in the long term, but Navio offers a far cheaper option and is still well ahead of anything the other two major manufacturers have today. Orthopaedic surgeon Haddad, who has experimented with both, said the machines were very different and healthcare systems would need to assess their cost-effectiveness in the light of clinical trial results. ""I think the clinical benefit will be pretty obvious but whether that justifies the upfront outlay is a big question."" ",Robot wars: Knee surgery marks new battleground for companies

In the words of President Donald Trump, ""Nobody knew that healthcare could be so complicated."" Trump's surprise victory in November, coupled with Republicans retaining a majority of seats in the House and Senate, was expected to clear a path for a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the hallmark health bill of Barack Obama's presidency that's often called Obamacare. However, Republicans have struggled at every turn to pass a replacement bill. Image source: President Donald J. Trump's official Facebook page. Photo by Shealah Craighead. In March, the House GOP introduced the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which received scathing reviews from Democrats, much of the public, and even some members of its own party. The initial version of the AHCA never even went to vote. A second version, brought to the House floor a little less than two months later, wound up adding a few new amendments and passed by the narrowest of margins. Nonetheless, the AHCA was highly unpopular with the public, and it was estimated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that the AHCA would lead to 23 million people losing their health insurance within a decade. The latest plan, the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) from the Senate Republicans, takes bits and pieces from the AHCA and Obamacare and attempts to blend them together. Like the initial version of the AHCA, it currently is lacking the support for passage, meaning the GOP's efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare could be drawn out for many weeks and months to come. Interestingly enough, though, a solution may exist right under their noses. Namely, they could choose to leave Obamacare in place and simply fix the aspects of the law that are broken. It would mean swallowing a bit of hubris on the GOP's part, but it could resolve many of Obamacare's issues without leading to 22 million or 23 million people losing their access to affordable health insurance over the next decade. What's wrong with Obamacare, you ask? For starters, premium inflation is accelerating at a much faster pace than anyone imagined. This appears to be a result of national insurers dropping coverage in a number of markets. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest health insurance provider in the nation, reduced its coverage in 2017 to just three states from 34 states in 2016. The move was made after UnitedHealth's management cited years of unsustainable losses derived from Obamacare plans. Similar moves were made by Aetna (NYSE:AET) and Humana (NYSE:HUM), which reduced their county-based coverage by nearly 70% and almost 90%, respectively. Humana even went a step further and announced its intent to withdraw from the ACA marketplaces completely by 2018. Image source: Getty Images. On top of fewer national insurers, around three-quarters of Obamacare's 23 approved healthcare cooperative shuttered their doors due to financial instability. The lack of low-cost options in the marketplace is one reason why the average benchmark premium (the second-lowest cost silver plan in each state) for the 39 states covered by federally run HealthCare.gov rose 25% in 2017. The failure of the risk corridor was another massive disappointment for Obamacare. The risk corridor program, in its simplest form, was designed to take money from overly profitable insurers and distribute it to those who were losing money because they priced their premiums too low. Unfortunately, the risk corridor was chronically underfunded, because there were never that many profitable insurers within the ACA. The lack of a functioning risk corridor kept new insurers looking to expand their plan offerings out of the market. Lastly, we can certainly place some onus on the adverse selection insurers had to contend with. Adverse selection describes the process whereby insurers enroll a disproportionate number of sicker patients than healthy patients. Because the ACA didn't allow insurers to turn away patients with pre-existing conditions, it meant they had to accept people who, prior to Obamacare's passage, weren't able to get insurance (at least for a reasonable price). This adverse selection, coupled with poor healthy adult enrollment and overzealous enrollment estimates from the CBO, made life very difficult for insurers. Fixing Obamacare, however, wouldn't be as impossible as some lawmakers on Capitol Hill would make it seem. Here are three solutions to fix some of Obamacare biggest problems. Image source: Getty Images. Pretty much the biggest core issue with Obamacare is that there are too many sick people enrolling and not enough healthy people. This means insurers are seeing their medical expense ratios skyrocket, and they're reducing their coverage as a result. Why aren't enough healthy young adults enrolling? The answer is pretty simple: They're being financially savvy by sticking to the sidelines. Data from HealthPocket shows that an unsubsidized bronze plan would run close to $311 a month in 2017, or around $3,700 a year. Sticking to the sidelines if you're a healthy individual who doesn't go to the doctor would save you $2,700 -- and that's assuming you pay the SRP. The Internal Revenue Service can't garnish wages, seize property, or even turn away federal tax returns if line 61 (the line where SRP payments are reported) isn't filled in. The solution, while certainly unpopular, would bring more healthy young people into the system and help provide some sorely needed premium revenue for insurers: Raise the SRP penalty to the match the cost of the lowest-cost bronze plan in each state. This would provide the incentive for young adults to enroll since purchasing a health plan would at least provide them with benefits. There'd be obvious pushback among young adults, but their enrollment is vital to Obamacare's success. Image source: Getty Images. An arguably easier fix for Obamacare would be to provide more power to each state's Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC). Each state's OIC is responsible for analyzing why an insurance company has requested a 10% or greater increase or decrease in premiums on a year-over-year basis. In theory, OIC's are designed to be the bargaining tool between the insurance company and the consumer, with the OIC doing its best to haggle prices down for John and Jane Q. Public. The key phrase in the previous sentence being ""in theory."" In reality, OIC's have been blown over by even the slightest breeze from the insurance industry. The issue being that OIC's have no real power to mandate health plan pricing from insurance companies. They can make suggestions, but if an insurance company can provide justification that its premiums need to head higher by 30%, 40%, or 50% year over year because of ongoing losses, OIC's have little recourse other than to stand by and watch it happen. The fix? Put some meat on the OIC's bones. Give each state's OIC some power to actually negotiate with insurance companies instead of merely offering suggestions from the balcony. Given the inherent advantages drug companies enjoy in America, it's not as if we're going to see premium inflation grind to a halt, but putting some power into the hands of the OIC could chop off a few percentage points of premium inflation annually, in my opinion.

In 2014, some $2.87 billion in funds was requested by money-losing insurers via the risk corridor program, but only $362 million was paid to these insurers. If the SRP were amended to coerce more young adults to enroll, presumably more insurers would be profitable and the risk corridor would be fully funded. But even if the risk corridor were still short on funding, if the federal government stepped in to cover any shortage, the corresponding payments to money-losing insurers should prop them up long enough to adjust their premiums to sustainable levels and encourage more competition, ultimately pushing premium inflation down and possibly reducing the uninsured rate. In other words, providing federal funding to the risk corridor, if need be, could be a short-term cost that leads to a number of long-term positives. At the same time, the federal government could dangle a carrot to insurers that only allows them to participate in more populated markets if they also choose a lesser-populated market to provide coverage. This would be a means of encouraging competition in more rural communities, which in turn should make premiums more affordable for the average American. Some of these measures wouldn't be popular, but neither was Obamacare when it first rolled out. However, if the SRP were amended, the OIC's given greater power to negotiate, and the risk corridor reintroduced, we could see a sustainable insurance market and tamer premium inflation. But that's just one Fool's opinion. ","

Francine McKenna,07062017,MarketWatch,06292017,"Published: July 3, 2017 1:02 p.m. ET First-ever compliance counsel to Justice Department criminal division fraud’s section quits in protest of Trump’s behavior By Hui Chen, the first-ever compliance counsel to the U.S. Department of Justice criminal division’s fraud section, is mad as hell and has decided she is not going to take it any more. Chen announced via LinkedIn last week that she was leaving her role consulting to the department’s prosecutors on cases involving corporate ethics and compliance crimes. In her post entitled “Mission Matters,” Chen said that she felt like a hypocrite as she sat with companies accused of ethics and compliance violations. Chen wrote that on her mind “were the numerous lawsuits pending against the President of the United States for everything from violations of the Constitution to conflict of interest, the ongoing investigations of potentially treasonous conducts, and the investigators and prosecutors fired for their pursuits of principles and facts. Those are conducts I would not tolerate seeing in a company, yet I worked under an administration that engaged in exactly those conducts. I wanted no more part in it.” Chen had previously poked at President Trump on Twitter. Matt Kelly, founder and editor of the blog Radical Compliance, has been following this story for a while and produced a podcast interview with Chen last Friday. “I’ve talked with many compliance professionals of all political persuasions and they are challenged to explain the importance of good ethical conduct to executives in their companies,” Kelly told MarketWatch. “How can they when it doesn’t seem to matter to the President? None of the concerns about Trump’s behavior Chen details in her post would fly in any corporate environment.” Chen also wrote that she was “persistently prohibited” from being the one to speak publicly about a key document she produced for the DOJ’s use, “Evaluations of Corporate Compliance.” She watched “almost everyone except me being able to talk about (and often misinterpreting) my work,” she wrote in the LinkedIn post. Chen says she will continue to engage publicly, now that she is free do so, via public speaking, writing, and consulting. She also plans to work for candidates who “want to restore the notions of integrity, decency, and intellect back into our government.” Chen provided guidance and training to U.S. federal prosecutors on how to verify and evaluate compliance programs that companies implemented after being caught engaging in potentially illegal conduct that raised the possibility of criminal charges. She’s had plenty of experience doing that. She began her career at the Justice Department, spending six years as a trial attorney and then an assistant U.S. attorney. She was previously responsible for global management of antibribery and corruption compliance at Standard Chartered Bank

Alessandra Malito,07062017,MarketWatch,06292017,"Published: July 4, 2017 4:04 p.m. ET People will eat more than twice the amount of beef than chicken By What is the Fourth of July without hamburgers and barbecued chicken? Americans stocked up on plenty of meats in the two weeks before Independence Day last year, according to market-research group Nielsen. People spent more than $800 million on beef during the two weeks leading up to the July 4 weekend, followed by $371 million on chicken and $218 million on pork. Shrimp ($85 million) and salmon ($48 million) also made the chart. One reason: beef is cheap, at least compared to previous July 4 weekends. Retail prices for ground beef have fallen to $3.56 per pound in May this year, compared with $4.14 in May 2015, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. Chicken legs dropped to $1.45 per pound and pork chops $3.43 per pound, compared to $1.55 and $3.79, respectively, two years earlier. See: Tastes like chicken? Lab-grown ‘clean meat’ wins taste-testers’ approval Along with their meat, Americans also favored barbecue sauce more than any other meat-topping sauce, though popularity and sales are growing for Worcestershire and teriyaki sauces, Nielsen showed. Barbecue sauce sales were $43.8 million in that two-week period, significantly more than any other sauce, but only 2.7% dollar percent from the year before. Meanwhile, Worcestershire sauce grew 9.8% and teriyaki sauce 7.7% from the prior year, with hot sauce in third place at 5.8%. There are more meat lovers than vegetarians in the U.S., with the average American eating about 193 pounds of beef, pork and/or chicken a year compared to 3% of Americans who say they follow a vegetarian or vegan diet. In fact, Americans are consuming more meat now than they did in 2012, when the average was 184 pounds a year. Red meat has its risks. One study suggests eating red meat on a regular basis can shorten a person’s lifespan, according to the National Institutes of Health, and other research found red meat is linked to diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. While studying 37,000 men beginning in 1986 and 83,000 women in 1980, with checkups every two years and a food frequency questionnaire for participants to fill out every four years, a team of researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health found 5,900 had died from cardiovascular disease and 9,500 from cancer and those who had consumed the most red meat were at the highest risk for mortality. Researchers found an additional serving of unprocessed red meat during the study raised the mortality risk total by 13%, and an extra serving of processed red meat raised it by 20%. The study suggests substituting one serving per day of another protein would lower the risk of mortality from 7% to 19%. See also: In high demand: World Series tickets and T-shirts — also: goat meat Some studies counter the argument that red meat is dangerous, however, and experts say it doesn’t necessarily lead to health problems (or worse) if you consume it in moderation. The type of meat, size of the slab and the temperature at which it is cooked also contribute to the quality and safety of consumption. Meat should not be processed — so perhaps cut down on the bacon — and be mindful of how much to consume; 100 grams (or the size of a deck of playing cards) every day was attributed to a 17% rise in cancer risk. It should also be cooked at less-than-high temperatures, since searing has been linked to causing cancer because, according to one theory, the high temperatures change the meat’s DNA.

It was the latest in a series of hostile tweets over the past week attacking what Trump called the “fake and fraudulent news media,” including the hosts of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” and CNN, which on Saturday he called “FraudNewsCNN.” #FraudNewsCNN #FNN pic.twitter.com/WYUnHjjUjg In a statement Sunday, CNN said it was a “sad day when the President of the United States encourages violence against reporters.” “Instead of preparing for his overseas trip, his first meeting with Vladimir Putin, ‎dealing with North Korea and working on his health care bill, he is involved in juvenile behavior far below the dignity of his office,” CNN said. The network also called out the White House’s deputy press secretary, who said earlier this week that “the president in no way form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence.” “Clearly, Sarah Huckabee Sanders lied,” CNN said. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press joined the fray. “We condemn the president’s threat of physical violence against journalists,” the advocacy group said in a statement. Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, White House homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert denied Trump’s tweet was a threat. “No one would perceive that as a threat,” he said. “I’m proud of the president for developing a Twitter and a social-media platform where he can talk directly to the American people.” Encouraging violence toward journalists, though, is no joke. Just last month, Montana Rep. Greg Gianforte pleaded guilty to assaulting a reporter a day before a special election in May. CNN commentator and Republican strategist Ana Navarro told ABC News that Trump was inciting violence. “He is going to get somebody killed in the media,” she said. Congressional Democrats also condemned Trump’s tweet, with Rep. Ted Lieu, from Southern California, calling it “beyond unacceptable.” OMG, @realDonaldTrump is now encouraging violence against the media. He has violence and blood in his mind. This is beyond unacceptable. https://t.co/ZNarD7qSKG .@POTUS posts mock video of him attacking press, even after a GOP candidate did exactly that. Where will his downward spiral take us? I am calling on EVERY @HouseGOP Member of Congress to condemn this. You were elected to be a check on power. Check it, or you condone it. https://t.co/ZGR58Ufhww Violence & violent imagery to bully the press must be rejected. This #July4th, celebrate freedom of the press, guardians to our democracy Before the president got hold of the video and tweeted it out to his millions of followers, a Reddit user by the name of “HanAssholeSolo” posted it on the popular subreddit “The_Donald,” an unruly corner of the internet that bills itself as “the forum of choice for The President of the United States.” Han celebrated Trump’s tweet by saying, “Wow!! I never expected my meme to be retweeted by the God Emporer himself!!!” Prior to achieving virtual fame on “The_Donald,” the Han screen personality could be found posting messages like “It’s all part of United’s Remove A N**ger Over The Ocean program” under an image of a black child on a plane.

,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"(This version of the July 11 story corrects title of Larsen to Ping An group’s chief innovation officer, not chief technology officer, in second paragraph) By Kane Wu and Julie  Zhu HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ping An Insurance Group Ltd, China’s largest insurer by market value, is scouting for fintech and healthcare assets in the United States, Israel and Singapore, as it looks to use a $1 billion investment fund, a company executive said. The Shenzhen-based insurer plans to use the acquired technology and know-how to grow its business in China, Jonathan Larsen, Ping An Group’s chief innovation officer and chairman of the fund, told Reuters on Tuesday. “The primary rationale for the fund is strategic...to find capabilities, ideas, business models and technologies that can be valuable to Ping An,” he told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Hong Kong on Tuesday. Ping An launched the Hong Kong-based Global Voyager Fund in early May as the sole investor, but did not give details of which type of start-up companies it wanted to buy, or where it would look for assets. The fund will allocate 30 percent of the capital to growth companies that are at least three years old and have been through the early-stage challenges, with a single investment size of $10 million to $30 million, Larsen said. Another 30 percent will be deployed to bigger firms with a single investment size of between $30 million and $100 million, while a further eight to 10 percent will be invested in early-stage companies via partner funds. The rest will be used for special investment opportunities such as buyouts, said Larsen, formerly the global head of retail banking and mortgages at Citigroup, who joined Ping An in May. He added that although Ping An’s customer franchise is overwhelmingly Chinese, the group may follow in the footsteps of the country’s largest financial institutions. “We are at a point where we can very selectively contemplate international opportunities. And the fund could play a role in that mostly through partnerships,” he said. ","

 ,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"TOBACCO TITAN: A cigarette vending machine near the offices of Philip Morris International in Lausanne, Switzerland. The company, which sells Marlboro, is targeting the FCTC anti-smoking treaty on multiple levels. REUTERS/Paritosh Bansal The worldâs largest publicly traded tobacco company is deploying its vast resources against international efforts to reduce smoking. Internal documents uncovered by Reuters reveal details of the secret operation. By ADITYA KALRA, PARITOSH BANSAL, DUFF WILSON and TOM LASSETER Filed July 13, 2017, 11:15 a.m. GMT NEW DELHI/LAUSANNE, SwitzerlandÂ â A group of cigarette company executives stood in the lobby of a drab convention center near New Delhi last November. They were waiting for credentials to enter the World Health Organizationâs global tobacco treaty conference, one designed to curb smoking and combat the influence of the cigarette industry. Treaty officials didnât want them there. But still, among those lined up hoping to get in were executives from Japan Tobacco InternationalÂ and British American Tobacco Plc. There was a big name missing from the group: Philip Morris International Inc. A Philip Morris representative later told Reuters its employees didnât turn up Â because the company knew it wasnât welcome. In fact, executives from the largest publicly traded tobacco firm had flown in from around the world to New Delhi for the anti-tobacco meeting. Unknown to treaty organizers, they were staying at a hotel an hour from the convention center, working from an operations room there. Philip Morris International would soon be holding secret meetings with delegates from the government of Vietnam and other treaty members. Related content Part 2: Marlboro Country Archive: The Philip Morris Files Graphic: Lobbying strategy Graphic: Watering down Video: A âreal dangerâ The object of these clandestine activities: the WHOâs Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, or FCTC, a treaty aimed at reducing smoking globally. Reuters has found that Philip Morris International is running a secretive campaign to block or weaken treaty provisions that save millions of lives by curbing tobacco use. In an internal document, the company says it supported the enactment of the treaty. But Philip Morris has come to view it as a âregulatory runaway trainâ driven by âanti-tobacco extremistsâ â a description contained in the document,Â a 2014 PowerPoint presentation.Â Â Confidential company documents and interviews with current and former Philip Morris employees reveal an offensive that stretches from the Americas to Africa to Asia, from hardscrabble tobacco fields to the halls of political power, in what may be one of the broadest corporate lobbying efforts in existence. Details of those plans are laid bare in a cache of Philip Morris documents reviewed by Reuters, one of the largest tobacco industry leaks ever. Reuters is publishing a selection of those papers in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files. Dating from 2009 to 2016, the thousands of pages include emails between executives, PowerPoint presentations, planning papers, policy toolkits, national lobbying plans and market analyses. Taken as a whole, they present a company that has focused its vast global resources on bringing to heel the worldâs tobacco control treaty. Philip Morris works to subvert the treaty on multiple levels. It targets the FCTC conferences where delegates gather to decide on anti-smoking guidelines. It also lobbies at the country level, where the makeup of FCTC delegations is determined and treaty decisions are turned into legislation. Reuters uncovered thousands of pages of internal Philip Morris International documents. These excerpts show the companyâs tactics for combating the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, or FCTC, a treaty aimed at reducing smoking worldwide. (Some documents include highlighting by Reuters; some names have been redacted.) 1. A slide from a 2014 Philip Morris corporate affairs presentationÂ about the FCTC, the global anti-smoking treaty. CoP5 and CoP6 refer to the biennial meetings of treaty nations in 2012 and 2014. âENDSâ refers to e-cigarettes.Â 2. Another slide from the 2014 PowerPoint presentation.Â âParadigm shiftâ refers to an expected boom in what the company calls âreduced-risk products.â 3. A slide from the 2014 presentation shows Philip Morris plans for tracking anti-smoking groups, which the company callsÂ anti-tobacco organizations, or ATOs. 4. The same 2014 document shows objectives for corporate affairs executives. âRoadblocksâ refers to delays in implementing anti-smoking steps. âMoHâ refers to ministries of health. 5. Another slide from the 2014 document shows the characteristics that a Philip Morris corporate affairs (âCAâ) personÂ should possess. 6. A more detailed account of Philip Morrisâ corporate affairs tactics from the same 2014 presentation. 7. A list of methods the company has devised for opposing the implementation of plain packaging, a measure advocated by the FCTCÂ that bars the use of logos and distinctive coloring on cigarette packs. 8. This slide from the 2014 presentation shows some of the resources Philip Morris deployed at the FCTC treaty meeting in Moscow that year (CoP6), as the company looked ahead to the 2016 session in New Delhi (CoP7). ITGA = the International Tobacco Growersâ Association. 9. Philip Morris pushes for more delegates to FCTC treaty meetings from government agencies that deal with economic and trade issues. This slide from the 2014 presentation shows the companyâs plan to lobby for more delegates from outside of public health on Indiaâs delegation at the treaty meeting last year. 10. Excerpt from an October 18, 2014, email from Chris Koddermann, who led the Philip Morris team at the treaty meeting in Moscow that year. (full email) 11. An October 18, 2014, email from Nguyen Thanh Ky, a Philip Morris corporate affairs executive, about his meeting with the Vietnamese delegation to the 2014 Moscow treaty conference. 12. Excerpt from an October 2014 email from Gustavo Bosio, then Philip Morris manager for international trade, a few days after the end of the Moscow meeting. (full email) 13. Excerpt from a Philip Morris briefing paper on trade arguments, ahead of the treaty meeting in India last year. The company has long argued that the biennial Conference of the Parties (COP) should leave trade issues to the World Trade Organization (WTO).Â 14. Excerpt from a Philip Morris briefing paper on potential risks ahead of the treaty meeting last year, âCOP7â in India. ENDS, or Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems, refers to electronic cigarettes. 15. Excerpt from a 2011 draft Philip Morris plan for responding to moves in Israel to pass new anti-smoking measures. 16. In this slide from a Japan corporate affairs presentation, some ministers in the Japanese cabinet are identified according to their positions on tobacco. The two ministers designated âPro-tobaccoâ did not respond to questions from Reuters. 17. This slide, also from the Japan presentation, talks about Philip Morris Japan maintaining good relations with members of Japanâs FCTC delegation, and a Philip Morris executive meeting with members of the countryâs FCTC delegation. (MOF = Ministry of Finance; MOFA = Ministry of Foreign Affairs; JT = Japan Tobacco.) 18. This slide, also from the Japan presentation, reveals the companyâs plans for opposing moves in Australia to bar the use of logos or distinctive coloring on cigarette packs. The measure is known as plain packaging, or PP. The Tobacco Institute of Japan, or TIOJ, declined to comment. 19. A slide from a Philip Morris training document. The documents, combined with reporting in 14 countries from Brazil to Uganda to Vietnam, reveal that a goal of Philip Morris is to increase the number of delegates at the treaty conventions who are not from health ministries or involved in public health. Thatâs happening: A Reuters analysis of delegates to the FCTCâs biennial conference shows a rise since the first convention in 2006Â in the number of officials from ministries like trade, finance and agriculture for whom tobacco revenues can be a higher priority than health concerns. Philip MorrisÂ International says there is nothing improper about its executives engaging with government officials. âAs a company in a highly regulated industry, speaking with governments is part of our everyday business,â Tony Snyder, vice president of communications, said in a statementÂ in response to Reutersâ findings. âThe fact that Reuters has seen internal emails discussing our engagement with governments does not make those interactions inappropriate.â In a series of interviews in Europe and Asia, Philip Morris executive Andrew Cave said company employees are under strict instructions to obey both the companyâs own conduct policies and local law in the countries where they operate. Cave, a director of corporate affairs, said that while Philip Morris disagrees with some aspects of the FCTC treaty and consults with delegates offsite during its conferences, ultimately the delegations âmake their own decisions.â âWeâre respectful of the fact that this is their week and their event,â said Cave in an interview in New Delhi, as the parties to the treaty met last November. Asked in an earlier interviewÂ whether Philip Morris conducts a formal campaign targeting the treatyâs biennial conferences, Cave gave a flat âno.â When the FCTC delegates gather, lives hang in the balance. Decisions taken at the conferences over the past decade, including a ban on smoking in public places, are saving millions of lives, according to researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center. Between 2007 and 2014, more than 53 million people in 88 countries stopped smoking because those nations imposedÂ stringent anti-smoking measures recommended by the WHO, according to their December 2016 study. Because of the treaty, an estimated 22 million smoking-related deaths will be averted, the researchers found. According to the WHO, though, tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death â and by 2030 will be responsible for eight million deaths a year, up from six million now. There was jubilation among anti-smoking advocates when the treaty was adopted in 2003. The treaty, which took effect in 2005, made it possible to push for measures that once seemed radical, such as smoke-free bars. About 90 percent of all nations eventually joined. A big holdout is the United States, which signed the treaty but has yet to ratify it. Since the FCTC came into force, it has persuaded dozens of nations to boost taxes on tobacco products, pass laws banning smoking in public places and increase the size of health warnings on cigarette packs. Treaty members gather every two years to consider new provisions or strengthen old ones at a meeting called the Conference of the Parties, or COP, which first convened in 2006 in Geneva. But an FCTC reportÂ shows that implementation of important sections of the treaty is stalling. There has been no further progress in the implementation of 7 out of 16 âsubstantiveâ treaty articles since 2014, according to a report by the FCTC Secretariat in June last year. A key reason: âThe tobacco industry continues to be the most important barrier in implementation of the Convention.â Indeed, the tobacco industry has weathered the tighter regulation. There has been only a slight 1.9 percent decline in global cigarette sales since the treaty took effect in 2005, and more people smoked daily in 2015 than a decade earlier,Â studies show. The Thomson Reuters Global Tobacco Index, which tracks tobacco stocks, has risen more than 100 percent in the past decade, largely due to price increases. âSome people think that with tobacco, youâve won the battle,â said former Finnish Health Minister Pekka Puska, who chaired an FCTC committee last year. âNo way,â he said. âThe tobacco industry is more powerful than ever.â With 600 corporate affairs executives, according to a November 2015 internal email, Philip Morris has one of the worldâs biggest corporate lobbying arms. That army, and $7 billion-plus in annual net profit, gives Philip Morris the resources to overwhelm the FCTC. The treaty is overseen by 19 staff at a Secretariat office hosted by the WHO in Geneva. The Secretariat spends on average less than $6 million a year.Â Even when buttressed by anti-smoking groups, the Secretariat is outgunned. Its budget for this year and last year for supporting the treaty clause on combating tobacco company influence is less than $460,000. Vera Luiza da Costa e Silva, head of the FCTC treaty Secretariat, is the person tasked with preventing the industry from neutering the agreement. In two interviews at her Geneva office, da Costa e Silva, a medical doctor who holds a PhD in public health and has a dyed pink streak in her hair, explained why the FCTC banned attendance by any member of the public at the 2014 biennial conference in Moscow. The ban came in response to efforts by tobacco executives to use public badges to get inside the venue, she said, adding that industry representativesÂ then started borrowing badges from delegates they knew to gain entry. âItâs a real war,â said da Costa e Silva. âSome people think that with tobacco, youâve won the battle. No wayâ¦ The tobacco industry is more powerful than ever.â But she had only a partial picture of the forces ranged against her.Â She wasnât aware of the fact that Philip Morris had a large team operating throughout the convention in Moscow, or the details of its activities in New Delhi last November. âThis is so disgusting. These are the forces against which we have to work,â da Costa e Silva said in May after being told about the Philip Morris documents. âI think they want to implode the treaty.â The idea of a global tobacco treaty had been discussed among health advocates since at least 1979, when a WHO committee suggested the possibility. Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway who became director-general of the WHO in 1998, made it happen. She was aided by outrage over documents that surfaced as part of the landmark 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, in which the four largest U.S. tobacco companies agreed to pay more than $200 billion to 46 U.S. states. The internal communications showed that tobacco executives lied for years about their knowledge of the deadly nature of cigarettes. A 1989Â document revealed one companyâs plan to fight threats to the industry. âWHOâs impact and influence is indisputable,â the document said. It went on to contemplate âcountermeasures designed to contain/neutralize/re-orient the WHO.â That company was Philip Morris. In 2008, Altria Group Inc split up its Philip Morris business. Philip Morris USA, which remains a subsidiary of Altria, sells Marlboro and other brands in the United States. Philip Morris International was spun off, and handles business abroad. Since the split, Philip Morris International shares have more than doubled and Altriaâs have more than tripled. Philip Morris Internationalâs operational headquartersÂ are in Lausanne, Switzerland, down the street from a patch of Gallo-RomanÂ ruins, in a sleek building with a cafeteria, gym and a patio facing Lake Geneva. From there, the company is working to hobble the treaty. Internal company communications reveal the scope of Philip Morrisâ operation during the 2014 FCTC treaty meeting in Moscow. The company set up a âCoordinating Roomâ that could seat 42 people, according to theÂ 2014 PowerPoint presentation, titled âCorporate affairs approach and issues.â Leading the operation was executive Chris Koddermann. Formerly a lawyer and lobbyist in Canada, Koddermann joined Philip Morris in 2010. He is now a director of regulatory affairs in Lausanne. The PowerPoint describes the ideal corporate affairs executive as someone who is able to âplay the political game.â Koddermann previously worked for federal and provincial cabinet ministers in Canada, according to his LinkedIn profile. Reached on his cell phone in March, Koddermann said he wouldnât be able to meet and that any questions should be directed to Philip Morris International. At the end of the Moscow meeting, on Oct. 18, 2014, Koddermann sent an emailÂ congratulating a 33-person Philip Morris team on their success in diluting or blocking measures intended to strengthen tobacco controls and reduce cigarette sales.Â The gains he touted at the end of the week-long conference were the culmination of a two-year effort, his email said. The documents shed light on one key objective in Philip MorrisâÂ FCTC campaign: Keep tobacco within the ambit of international trade deals, so that the company has a way to mount legal campaigns against tobacco regulations. â¢ Has its roots in a small tobacconist shop in London in 1847.â¢ Now operates in more than 180 markets.â¢ Famous for its iconic Marlboro Man advertising.â¢ Has six of the worldâs top 15 cigarette brands, including Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield.â¢ Spun off from the Richmond, Va.-headquartered Altria Group in March 2008. â¢ Operational headquarters are in Switzerland.â¢ Produces over 800 billion cigarettes a year.â¢ Share price has more than doubled since the 2008 spin-off from Altria. Sources: Philip Morris International website; Reuters reporting In Moscow, one proposal initially called for carving out tobacco from trade pacts. International trade treaties often include provisions, such as the protection of trademarks, that Philip Morris has used to challenge anti-smoking measures. If tobacco were taken out of the treaties, as suggested by the proposal, Philip Morris could be deprived of many such legal arguments. An early draft asked parties to support efforts to excludeÂ tobacco from trade pacts and to prevent the industry from âabusingâ trade and investment rules. In the end, the proposal was watered down. The final decision only reminded parties of âthe possibility to take into account their public health objectives in their negotiation of trade and investment agreements.â There was no mention of excluding tobacco. Koddermann, in his email to colleagues on the last day of the conference, declared victory, describing the change as âa tremendous outcome.â Overall, the company achieved its âtrade related campaign objectives,â including âavoiding a declaration of health over tradeâ and âavoiding the recognition of the FCTC as an international standard,â he wrote. The win was significant. A former Philip Morris employee said the company has routinely used trade treaties to challenge tobacco control laws. The aim, he said, was âto scare governments away from doing regulatory changes.â Even though the tobacco industry has lost a series of major legal battles, its suits have served to discourageÂ the implementation of regulations that curb smoking. Those delays can yield years of unimpeded sales. As the Philip Morris PowerPoint presentation from 2014 put it: âRoadblocks are as important as solutions.â One roadblock was a campaign to stop the 2011 introduction of rules in Australia banning logos and distinctive coloring on cigarette packs. The companyâs litigation and arbitration against the measure ultimately were dismissedÂ â but not before five countries filed complaints against Australia on the same subject at the World Trade Organization. The global trade body has yet to announce a decision in the matter. The attempt to undo Australiaâs regulations has had a chilling effect elsewhere. It slowed the introduction of plain-packaging rules in New Zealand. Citing the risk that tobacco companies may âmount legal challenges,â the government announced in 2013 that it was postponing the move and waiting to âsee what happens with Australiaâs legal cases.â The legislation is now scheduled to go into effect next year. In his Moscow conference email, Koddermann also expressed pleasure at the fate of a proposal on farmers. Initial language would have recommended that countries restrict support for tobacco growers. The proposal was âsignificantly watered down,â he wrote.Â âThis is a very positive result.â Gustavo Bosio, at the time a manager for international trade, chimed in a few days after the conference in an email: âThese excellent results are a direct consequence of the remarkable efforts of all PMI regions and markets during the past two years and throughout the intense week in Moscow.â Philip Morris isnât alone in seeking to weaken the treaty. Ahead of the 2012 FCTC conference, in Seoul, four cigarette giants â Philip Morris, British American Tobacco (BAT), Japan Tobacco InternationalÂ and Imperial Brands Plc â formed an âinformal industry Working Groupâ to oppose various proposals on tobacco taxation, according to anÂ internal BAT documentÂ reviewed by Reuters. The 45-page paper, whose existence hasnât been previously reported, noted that the group would coordinate âto the extent that these issues do not raise any anti-competitive concerns.â The paper outlined a global campaign planned by BAT to counter the FCTC, which was âincreasingly going beyondâ its mandate. And it listed objectives, including a bid to block discussions around the introduction of a minimum 70 percent tax on tobacco. BAT declined to answer questions about the industry working group. Both Imperial and Japan Tobacco International said they didnât want to comment on a document from a competitor. Japan Tobacco International said its tax experts met with counterparts from other tobacco companies to discuss treaty guidelines on taxation ahead of the 2012 conference. Philip Morris did not comment on the document. The Philip Morris emails and documents donât explicitly detail how the company pulled off the victories in Moscow. But they provide insight into the importance it places on wooing delegates. The FCTC traditionally makes decisions by consensus, and so influencing a single national delegation can have an outsized impact. The treaty has a key clause meant to keep the industry from unduly influencing delegations. Article 5.3, as itâs known, says nations should protect their public health policies from tobacco interests. GuidelinesÂ that accompany Article 5.3 recommend that countries interact with the industry only when âstrictly necessary.â But the article â a single sentenceÂ â contains a loophole Philip Morris has exploited. The sentence ends with the words âin accordance with national law,â opening the door to arguments by pro-tobacco forces that any lobbying thatâs legal in a certain country is permissibleÂ when interacting with that countryâs representatives.Â They also argue that a sentence in a related document, the guidelines for Article 5.3, allows for such interactions to take place as long as they are conducted transparently. The Philip Morris International documents uncovered by Reuters include guidelines and country-specific lobbying plans aimed at hobbling the WHOâs global tobacco control treaty and national anti-smoking measures. Strategies include:â¢ Lobbying lawmakers, bureaucrats and other government officialsâ¢ Trying to move tobacco issues away from health departments â¢ Deploying third parties, including retail groups, to make its case and exert pressure on decision-makersâ¢ Engaging the media on tobacco issues and generating public debate to influence decision-makers The tabs below show the companyâs strategy in action in three countries in recent years, according to internal company documents. The extent to which Philip Morrisâ actions affected the outcome in each case is unclear. In September 2011, Israelâs health ministry proposed new measures to regulate flavoring and advertising of tobacco products. In a draft company strategy document from October 2011, Philip Morris said the proposals included âa few excessive and disproportionate measuresâ such as restricting the use of fruit or chocolate flavorings in tobacco products, and broadly prohibiting advertising and marketing of tobacco. Elements of the campaign:1:Â Leverage established relationships with different government ministries, mobilize retailers to advocate against âexcessiveâ provisions, and lobby the health ministry.2:Â Lobby the government through third parties such as an Israel-based supplier of licorice.3:Â Use Philip Morrisâ database of more than 60,000 adult smokersÂ to reach consumers and create a public debate through the media âto influence MPs,âÂ or members of parliament. OUTCOME:Â The bans on advertising and ingredients did not go through. A 2010 Philip Morris document shows the company drawing up plans to lobby Sweden in an effort to influence the European Commissionâs new tobacco regulations for member states, known as the Tobacco Products Directive (TPD). Elements of the campaign:1:Â Engage the justice ministry to âput pressureâ on the health ministry so that the Swedish representativeÂ on the European Commission committee opposes plain packaging and âexcessiveâ health warning labels, and supports lifting the ban on snus, a smokeless tobacco product.2:Â Build a âbroad coalitionâ of âthird-party stakeholders,â such as the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, and get them to pressure the government. (The chamber told Reuters that it does not lobby on behalf of individual companies.)3:Â Establish a retailer network and contact bloggers and journalists to voice concerns about issues, including plain packaging and point-of-sale display bans. OUTCOME:Â Plain packaging and point-of-sale display ban were not included in the directive, which came into force in May 2014. In January 2013, Osaka Prefecture in Japan held a public consultation on a proposal to abolish existing smoking rooms, with a âroadmap towards total smoking prohibition in all public places,â according to a February 2014 Japan corporate affairs presentation.Â The Philip Morris document describes it as an âextreme proposal.â Elements of the campaign:1:Â Ensure that ârelevant stakeholdersâ oppose the move. Philip Morris field sales staff engaged retailers and others.2:Â Engage local politicians and work with the industryÂ in pushing back against the proposal. OUTCOME:Â The proposal was withdrawn. One of the companyâs targets has been Vietnam. The day the Moscow meeting ended, Koddermann received an email from his colleagueÂ Nguyen Thanh Ky, a leading corporate affairs executive for Vietnam. Ky said he had a âdebrief lunchâ with the Vietnamese delegation and had a good outcome to report: The delegation was in favor of âmoderate and reasonable measuresâ to be implemented over a âpractical timeline,â he wrote. He did not specify which measures they discussed. The Vietnamese delegation spoke up often during the Moscow meeting. A review of notes compiled by tobacco-control groups accredited as observers showed Vietnamâs interjections frequently mirrored Philip Morrisâ positions on tobacco-control regulations. Just like the tobacco giant, the Vietnamese said a higher tax on cigarettes would lead to more illicit sales. Like Philip Morris, they said the FCTC should stay out of trade disputes. And like Philip Morris, they opposed proposals to set uniform parameters for the legal liability of tobacco companies. The FCTC guidelines on taxation did ultimately include a WHO recommendation for a minimum tax of 70 percent â something Philip Morris opposed. But the proposal to give the treaty more sway over trade disputes was weakened, and measures to strengthen the legal liability of cigarette companies were delayed. Vietnamâs foreign ministry did not respond to questions from Reuters. reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives As soon as the conference ended, the documents show, Philip Morris turned to the next one: the 2016 meeting in India. The 2014 PowerPoint presentation outlined the need to identify ways to gather intelligence during the Delhi conference. In a separate 2015 planning document, the company talks about the arrangement of farmer protests in the run-up to the meeting. Such protests did take place â including one in front of WHO offices in New Delhi. Reuters couldnât determine whether Philip Morris was behind those demonstrations. While other major tobacco companies also sent people to Delhi in November, Philip Morris was distinguished by its stealth. Executives from the company did not sign in with their tobacco industry colleagues at the FCTC convention center and stayed at a hotel about an hourâs drive away. The anonymity and distance helped Philip Morris approach delegates covertly. On the second day of the conference, a white Toyota van pulled away from the front of the Hyatt Regency hotel â where Philip Morris had its operations room â and headed for the FCTC treaty venue. The van was carrying Ky, its corporate affairs executive from Vietnam. Kyâs driver talked his way past police at the barricade outside the conference center, where FCTC-issued credentialsÂ were checked, explaining that he was driving âVIPs,â the driver later told Reuters. A few minutes later, a man in a dark suit walked out of the conference center, passed the van and stopped at a street corner. The van did a U-turn, and a Reuters reporter saw the man in the suit quickly climb in. He was a senior member of Vietnamâs delegation to the FCTC conference: Nguyen Vinh Quoc, a Vietnamese government official. The driver, Kishore Kumar, said in an interview that he dropped the two men off at a local hotel. Kumar said that on several other occasions that week, he took Ky to pick up people from the Hotel Formule1, a budget lodging where Vietnamâs delegation was staying during the conference. Ky and Quoc did not respond to requests for comment. Asked by Reuters about the interaction between Ky and the Vietnam representatives, Philip Morris executive Andrew CaveÂ thumped on the table in a bar at the hotel where company representatives were staying. Reuters should focus, he said, on efforts by the industry to develop so-called reduced-risk products â those that deliver nicotine without the burning of tobacco and which the company says reduce harm. When pressed about the meetings with Vietnam, Cave thumped the table again: âIâm angry that youâre focusing on that, rather than the real issues that matter to real people.â In a subsequent email, Cave said: âRepresentatives from Philip Morris International met with delegates from Vietnamâ during the Delhi conference âto discuss policy issues and this complied fully with PMIâs internal procedures and the laws and regulations of Vietnam.â Delegates, Cave said inÂ separate interviews, are reluctant to meet openly with Philip Morris because they are afraid of being ânamed and shamedâ by anti-smoking groups. Some delegates questioned the extent to which Philip Morris shaped the decisions made at the Moscow conference, saying attendees genuinely disagreed on certain issues. Nuntavarn Vichit-Vadakan, a Thai delegate, oversaw many discussions as the chair of an FCTC committee at the Moscow conference. She said delegates differed over the regulation of e-cigarettes, for instance, and any lobbying the company carried out would not have determined the outcome. The Philip Morris documents leave questions unanswered. In some cases, the documents show the company hatching plans to change an anti-smoking regulation or to monitor activists, but donât always make clear to what extent or how the plans were executed, if at all. The 2014 PowerPoint presentation called for âachieving scrutinyâ of tobacco control advocates and said a âglobal project teamâ had been established for this purpose. It did not list what means would be used. In some instances, Philip Morrisâ lobbying plainly failed. In July 2015, the Ugandan parliament passed sweeping new anti-tobacco laws inspired by the treaty. All that was needed was President Yoweri Museveniâs signature, and the small African nation would become a leader on the continent in implementing a strict interpretation of the FCTC. Philip Morris sent an executive, a younger white man, to tell the septuagenarian president, who long ago had helped topple dictator Idi Amin, why the tobacco act was a bad idea. Sheila Ndyanabangi, Ugandaâs lead health official for tobacco issues who was present at the meeting, described the executiveâs approach as lecturing the statesman. âHe said, âUgandan tobacco will be too expensiveâ and âit will not be competitive,ââ Ndyanabangi said. Her account was confirmed by a senior Ugandan government official who was also present. Museveni stared for a moment at the Philip Morris executive and a representative from a major tobacco buyer whoâd come with him. The president then declared: âSlavery ended a long time ago.â There was a long silence in the room, recalled Ndyanabangi. Museveni said Uganda didnât need tobacco, and the meeting was over. The president signed the bill that September. Museveniâs office did not respond to requests for comment. Over time, however, the industryâs lobbying has slowed the treatyâs progress. At the biennial conferences, the discussions have changed. In Moscow, for instance, there was a strong focus on trade and taxes. âYou could see from the floor that interventions were very, very, very much focusing on the trade aspects, many times even putting trade over health,â the FCTCâs da Costa e Silva said in an interview last year. The composition of FCTC delegations sent by governments has changed to include more members who arenât involved in health policy. Thatâs in line with what Philip Morris and other tobacco companies want: Philip Morris, as well as British American Tobacco, has sought to move the balance of the membership away from public health officials and toward ministries like finance and trade. Such agencies, said the former Philip Morris executive, benefit from tobacco tax revenues and attach less weight to health concerns. âThe health department would just want tobacco to be banned, while for the finance ministry itâs more like how can we leverage or get as much money as we can,â he said. The object of Philip Morrisâ efforts, according to the 2014 PowerPoint on corporate affairs, is to âmove tobacco issues awayâ from health ministries and demonstrate there are broader public interests at play â that âitâs not about tobacco.â Cave, the Philip Morris corporate affairs executive, confirmed the company tries to persuade governments to change the composition of delegations. Health officials, he said, arenât equipped to handle the intricacies of issues such as taxation. âYouâre looking at illicit trade, youâre looking at tax regimes, youâre looking at international law,â he said. âNow each of these areas, itâs logical, if you want to really tackle the trade and tobacco smuggling, illicit trade, who would you go to? You wouldnât go to the health ministry.â âIâm angry that youâre focusing on that, rather than the real issues that matter to real people.â Reuters analyzed the rosters of the almost 3,500 accredited delegation members who have attended the seven FCTC conferences since 2006. The analysis found that there were more than six health delegates for every finance-related delegate in 2006. In Delhi last year, that ratio had fallen to just over three health delegates for every finance delegate. The number of delegates from finance, agriculture and trade fields has risen from a few dozen in 2006 to more than 100 in recent years. Vietnamâs delegation, for example, has changed markedly. At the first FCTC conference in 2006, none of its four delegates were from finance or trade ministries. By 2014, in Moscow, there were 13 delegates, with at least four from finance-related ministries, including the chief delegate.Â Vietnamâs foreign ministry did not respond to questions about the delegation. Da Costa e Silva isnât opposed to having delegates from trade ministries, but she says their primary focus needs to be on health.Â And she was concerned by the makeup of the Vietnamese delegation. In a letter to the Vietnamese prime ministerÂ in late 2015, she asked that tobacco industry employees be excluded from the delegation. If they werenât, she wrote, Vietnam might be âunable to play a full part in discussions.â In 2016, VietnamÂ brought 11 delegates to the conference, of whom six were from health agencies, including the chief representative. Some tobacco-control activists who attended the Delhi meeting in November say it was the worst so far in terms of passing new anti-smoking provisions. Matthew Myers, who heads the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said multiple countries came prepared to consciously block action. He said he heard delegates making arguments âI havenât heard in 25 years.â A Nigerian delegate, for instance, asked to remove a reference to âthe tobacco epidemicâ from a draft proposal on liability for tobacco-related harm, according to notes taken by anti-smoking groups. Asked for comment, Christiana Ukoli, head of the delegation in Delhi, said the âNigerian delegation strongly dissociates itself from [that] statement.â The Delhi conference ended as it began, with treaty Secretariat officials not knowing where Philip Morris had been or what it had done. The company had flown in a team of executives, used a squad of identical vans to ferry officials in New Delhi, and then left town without a trace. Just days after the FCTC conference in Moscow ended in October 2014, Philip Morris executive Gustavo Bosio sent an email to colleagues highlighting what he said was the companyâs success in pushing back on three treaty proposals related to trade issues. âThese excellent results are a direct consequence of the remarkable efforts of all PMI regions and markets during the past two years and throughout the intense week in Moscow,â wrote Bosio, then manager for international trade.

 ,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s top medical technology companies are turning to robots to help with complex knee surgery, promising quicker procedures and better results in operations that often leave patients dissatisfied. Demand for artificial replacement joints is growing fast, as baby boomers’ knees and hips wear out, but for the past 15 years rival firms have failed to deliver a technological advance to gain them significant market share. Now U.S.-based Stryker and Britain’s Smith & Nephew  believe that is about to change, as robots give them an edge. Robots should mean less trauma to patients and faster recovery, although they still need to prove themselves in definitive clinical studies, which will not report results for a couple of years. Fares Haddad, a consultant surgeon at University College London Hospitals, is one of the first in Britain to use the new robots and has been impressed. However, he agrees healthcare providers need decisive data to prove they are worth an investment that can be as much as $1 million for each robot. “The main reason for using a robotic system is to improve precision and to be able to hit very accurately a target that varies from patient to patient,” he said. “It is particularly useful in knees because they are more problematic (than hips) and there are a chunk of patients that aren’t as satisfied as we would like with their knee replacement.” Satisfaction rates are only around 65 percent for knee operations, against 95 percent for hips, according to industry surveys. The rival types of robots vary in cost and sophistication, assisting surgeons with precision image guidance for bone cutting and the insertion of artificial joints. Orthopaedic companies hope to emulate the success of Intuitive Surgical, an early pioneer of robots in hospitals, which now has more than 4,000 of its da Vinci machines installed around the world for procedures including prostate removal, hernia repair and hysterectomies. In addition to selling into big Western markets, they also want to expand robot use in India, China and other emerging markets, where owning a prestigious high-tech system can be a marketing advantage for private hospitals. Stryker is leading the charge with its MAKO robotic arm, a platform it acquired for $1.65 billion in 2013 and which has pioneered robot-assisted whole-knee operations by determining optimal positioning and then helping with bone cutting. But it has competition from smaller rival Smith & Nephew, which last week launched a cheaper product called Navio for total knee replacements in the United States. The British group bought the company behind Navio for $275 million in 2016. That has kicked off the battle in earnest, since both companies are now able to do total knee replacements, which represent the vast majority of knee procedures. MAKO, which uses only Stryker’s joints and implants, costs around $1 million to install, while Navio, which does not have as many features and is not tied exclusively to Smith & Nephew’s products, is less than half the price. Both companies believe their robots will help them capture a bigger share of an orthopaedic market that has been split between four big players for more than a decade. Indeed, Smith & Nephew Chief Executive Olivier Bohuon said it was his company’s most important strategic investment for a decade. “We are now basically head to head with Stryker,” he said in an interview. “I do believe we are going to gain market share due to the fact we have robots, whether it’s Stryker or us.” COST-EFFECTIVENESS QUESTION Stryker, meanwhile, expects its MAKO system to start delivering market share gains from the end of 2017. “As we exit this year, we expect to start to see evidence in our knee market shares,” Katherine Owen, head of strategy at Stryker, told an investment conference in June. “Our goal with MAKO on knees is to capture hundreds of basis points of market share. What that time frame looks like, we haven’t been specific about.” Zimmer Biomet and Johnson & Johnson, the two other big players in orthopaedics, are lagging in the robotics race but both have plans to enter the area in different ways. J&J is working on surgical robotics with Verily, the life sciences arm of Google parent Alphabet, while Zimmer last year bought a majority stake in France’s Medtech, a specialist in neurosurgery. Analysts at Morgan Stanley believe robots have the potential to disrupt a market in artificial joints that has arguably become commoditised, with no knee or hip implant emerging as supreme in recent years. That chimes with the view of Smith & Nephew’s Bohuon, who argues that robots give his company a chance to punch above its weight, despite ranking No. 4 in reconstructive surgery. He reckons robotics could account for 20 to 40 percent of knee operations. Much will depend, however, on how the rival systems stack up. Jefferies analysts said the semi-automated bone resection offered by MAKO might well win out in the long term, but Navio offers a far cheaper option and is still well ahead of anything the other two major manufacturers have today. Orthopaedic surgeon Haddad, who has experimented with both, said the machines were very different and healthcare systems would need to assess their cost-effectiveness in the light of clinical trial results. “I think the clinical benefit will be pretty obvious but whether that justifies the upfront outlay is a big question.” ","

Axis Chief Executive Albert Benchimol said the acquisition of Novae, which covers property, casualty, marine, aviation and political risk, would create a roughly $2 billion player in the London specialty market. The deal, expected to close in the final quarter of the year, will add to Axis’ earnings in the first year and allow it to bulk up in the Lloyd’s insurance market. “It (Novae) remains a relatively small player in a global industry. Axis is a substantial and successful business which represents an excellent partner for the Novae business, its customers and employees,” John Hastings-Bass, chairman of Novae, said. Axis operates in the United States, Europe, Singapore, the Middle East, Canada and Latin America. The deal has no termination fee, implying confidence from both parties that a counterbid was unlikely, Eamonn Flanagan, analyst at Shore Capital, said. But top Novae shareholder Neptune said the offer undervalued the company, and a fair offer would be at least 5 or 6 percent higher than the Axis bid. Neptune, which held 16 percent of Novae at the close of business on Wednesday, said Axis had bid after a “torrid” nine months for the company. “The buyer has approached at a time of short-term weakness in the share price,” Neptune’s Mark Martin, head of UK equities, said, suggesting there could be other potential suitors in private equity or corporate entities. Novae’s shares have fallen 26 percent over the past nine months, hurt by lower than expected underwriting contributions and changes to Britain’s Ogden rule, a tool for calculating personal injury and accident claims, which hit its full-year profit. Novae did not respond to an emailed request for comment on Neptune’s view. Insurers have been preparing for a wave of mergers and acquisitions, as valuations in the Lloyd’s insurance market became more attractive to overseas buyers due to a fall in the value of the pound after Britain voted to leave the European Union.

 ,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A decade after the Islamist group Hamas seized Gaza, the Palestinian enclave is effectively unliveable for its 2 million people, with declining incomes, healthcare, education, electricity and fresh water, the United Nations said. In a report examining humanitarian conditions in the territory, which Hamas took over in June 2007 after a brief conflict with forces loyal to the Palestinian Authority, the United Nations concludes the situation in Gaza is deteriorating “further and faster” than was forecast only a few years ago. “Across the board we’re watching de-development in slow motion,” Robert Piper, the UN Coordinator for Humanitarian Aid and Development Activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. “Every indicator, from energy to water to healthcare to employment to poverty to food insecurity, every indicator is declining. Gazans have been going through this slow motion de-development now for a decade.” Immediately after Hamas took power, Israel moved to isolate the militant group by restricting the flow of goods and people in and out of Gaza, limiting access to the sea and working with Egypt to enforce a blockade. At the same time, Hamas has been in near-constant dispute with the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, prompting the PA to limit financial transfers to Gaza and, in recent weeks, asking Israel to cut back electricity supplies. The upshot is that Gaza’s population, which is projected to grow by another 10 percent in the next three years, is being squeezed on all sides, even as resources become more scarce. “I see this extraordinarily inhuman and unjust process of strangling gradually two million civilians in Gaza that really pose a threat to nobody,” said Piper. Asked who was doing the strangling, he replied: “Everyone’s having a go,” mentioning internal Palestinian political strife, Israeli security policies that leave Gazans caught in the middle, and regional dynamics including pressure on Qatar, a major donor to Hamas, from Saudi Arabia and Egypt. “That’s the message in this report, the fundamental message: Someone has got to step back and put the interests of civilians at the top of the queue for a change,” Piper said. “We talk about the unlivability of Gaza. When you’re down to two hours of power a day and you have 60 percent youth unemployment rates... that unlivability threshold has been passed quite a long time ago.” Gaza is a narrow wedge of land on the eastern Mediterranean, barely 40 km long and around 10 km wide, with most people living in densely packed, low concrete tower blocks, and many areas damaged in past bouts of fighting between Hamas and Israel. One of the most pressing challenges is power. Gaza needs at least 450 megawatts of electricity a day, but is now receiving 120 MW, partly because of the dispute between Hamas and the PA and a lack of internal power-generating capacity. By 2020, if growth picks up, Gaza will require up to 850 MW a day, but supplies are unlikely to top 360 MW. Piper sees ways in which conditions could quickly be improved without significant risk to Israel’s security, including expanding the fishing zone off Gaza to 20 nautical miles from six currently. A freer flow of goods, including water pumps, elevators, wood, steel, cables and other electrical equipment, would also help. Resolving the struggle between Hamas and the PA is essential in the long-run, but Piper says improving Gaza’s health, education, sanitation and growth is critical for Israel as well. “In the media, in the NGO community, and even in the Defence Ministry, you’ll find plenty of thoughtful Israelis that will recognise that, firstly, the current trajectory is threatening for Israel’s security and that a stable and prosperous Gaza... is also good for Israeli security,” he said. (This story corrects UN official’s title in para 3 to say .. in the Occupied Palestinian Territory ..not.. for the Gaza Strip and West Bank.) ","

 ,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"(Reuters) - Kind LLC has hired investment banks to advise on a minority stake sale it hopes will value the maker of the eponymous snack bars at more than $3 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. The stake sale will test the interest of some of the largest consumer food companies, which are looking to revitalize their sales as consumers turn to novelty and healthier alternatives. A deal could also give thirteen-year old Kind, which has developed a brand known for its use of ingredients “people can see and pronounce,” its first corporate partner to expand both in the United States and abroad. New York-based Kind, which has $727 million in annual sales according to Euromonitor, is working with investment banks BDT Capital Partners and Centerview Partners Holdings LLC on the stake sale, the sources said. BDT is also a minority investor in Kind. Kind is not offering the right to buy out the entire company down the line as part of the deal, one of the sources added. The sources requested anonymity because the process is confidential. “Kind is solely focused on becoming the foremost health and wellness leader to provide our consumers with delicious and healthy products so they can do the kind thing every day,” a Kind spokesman said, declining to comment specifically on the stake sale process. BDT declined to comment and Centerview could not be immediately reached for comment. Kind, founded in 2004 by Daniel Lubetzky, the Mexican-American son of a Holocaust survivor, sells nut bars, breakfast bars, clusters and fruit bites. It was one of the first popular food snacks to eschew artificial flavors and  preservatives, a trend that larger food companies are now embracing as they seek to woo back customers. In the United States, the world’s biggest packaged food market, upstart brands such as Kind could account for 15 percent of a $464 billion sector in a decade’s time compared with 5.0 percent now, according to Bernstein Research. In search of growth, food companies have turned to acquisitions, such as General Mills’ $820 million deal for organic food maker Annie’s Inc in 2014. Still, minority investments in established brands such as Kind have been less frequent. Private equity firm VMG group bought a stake in Kind in 2008. It later sold back its share to Lubetzky in 2014 in a stake sale that valued the company at $728.5 million. ","

 ,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"SUPERIOR, Arizona (Reuters) - Rio Tinto’s proposed Resolution Copper Mine in Arizona would tunnel 7,000 feet underground, where rocks radiate heat from the earth’s molten core. It would suck up enough water to supply a city and leave a crater a mile and a half wide and 1,000 feet deep. Planned for more than a decade, the project would be a prototype for a looming era of more invasive U.S. mines as companies run out of easy-to-reach deposits, geologists say. It is also the project President Donald Trump’s Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, had in mind as he began crafting a “hit list” of regulations that should be killed to speed industrial permitting. “A company shouldn’t have to be hundreds of millions of dollars into risk money without knowing whether there is a real chance it is going to get approved,” Ross told Reuters in a May 9 interview, referring to the mine. The massive project - which would be among the world’s largest copper mines - underscores the dangers of weakening America’s rigorous permitting process at a time mining endeavors are becoming increasingly complex and environmentally risky. And Ross’s citation of Resolution as a poster child for suffocating regulation reflects how far the Trump administration is willing to go to advance economic growth. Sorting out the mine’s potentially negative impacts is anything but simple, and many local residents, along with Native American and environmental groups, say Resolution is exactly the kind of development that cries out for intense public scrutiny - no matter how long it takes. “The companies have to mitigate their risks - mitigate what people are losing,” said Mila Besich-Lira, the mayor of Superior, the town closest to the project. A federal government review of the project has drawn about 130,000 comments from concerned constituents - more than 10 times the number who gave input on the smaller Rosemont Copper Mine nearby. Trump has vowed sweep away regulations he says cost America trillions of dollars with no public benefit. The regulatory review by Ross, due for release as soon as this month, is one of several parallel efforts to slash red tape. Trump has also started dismantling Obama-era climate change regulations through executive orders, for example, and directed agencies to kill two rules for every one they create. In the meantime, Congress could set the tone. A Republican bill introduced early this year - and supported by Rio Tinto - would set a two-and-a-half-year deadline on mine permitting, a standard similar to that seen in Australia and Canada. It is now four years into the federal regulatory review to approve new mines, a process that can take seven to 10 years. Victoria Peacey, a senior manager for environmental permitting at Rio Tinto, said the mine up probably won’t begin operating for another decade. Rio Tinto acknowledges the vast scope and sensitivity of its plans. “There are mines this deep; there are mines this hot; and there are mines this big; but there are no other mines this deep, this hot and this big all together,” said Carl Hehnke, a geologist for Resolution. Resolution will take copper from a zone where temperatures run 180 degrees Fahrenheit. With help from remotely controlled machines, miners will set off explosions to shatter sections of the deposit. The ore will be milled with a combination of sulfuric acid and as much as 6.5 billion gallons of water a year - enough to supply more than half the homes in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. It would eventually render more than 2,400 acres of what is now the Tonto National Forest off limits to visitors. Under the forest, in a process called “block cave mining,” Rio Tinto will excavate material from underground, making the material above sink and creating the expected one-and-a-half-mile-wide crater. That area will include a site considered sacred to the San Carlos Apache Tribe, which has been holding annual protests against the project. If Resolution’s copper deposit had been discovered under private land – and not a national forest – Rio Tinto might have been spared the federal review and faced only state regulators. Instead, the U.S. Forest Service is leading the study, which will consider jobs, recreation, public health and wildlife. Despite its substantial economic benefits to the nearby town of Superior, where many homes and businesses are boarded up, residents still have their concerns. “What am I going to tell my great-grandkids - how this place was totally destroyed?” said Anna Jeffries, a Superior resident, during an April 2016 public meeting with Forest Service officials at Superior High School. Mining industry lobbyists counter that they are only seeking an efficient and reasonable approval process. “We are not talking in any way, shape or form about any environmental rollbacks here,” said Katie Sweeney, general counsel for the National Mining Association, a trade group. “We’re talking about bureaucracy.” The NMA wants to see deadlines for permitting, along with rules requiring agencies to conduct studies simultaneously rather than consecutively. The NMA and Rio Tinto back the bill - introduced in January by Republican Congressman Mark Amodei of Nevada - that would give regulators the two-and-a-half year deadline to approve or reject mining projects. Mining companies in Canada and Australia applaud similar time limits in those countries, but a May 2016 report by a government watchdog in the Canadian province of British Columbia found Canada’s mine regulation had “major gaps in resources, planning and tools” that led to “inadequate” inspections and “increasing environmental risks.” Commerce Secretary Ross told Reuters in a June 23 phone message he believed the U.S. Forest Service was doing “a good job in terms of Rio Tinto.” But he added, “The rest of the process has been so abysmal that Rio Tinto actually testified before the U.S. Congress [about] how bad the process was.” Ross and his spokesman did not respond to additional questions seeking examples of problems that occurred between Resolution and permit-issuing agencies. But his office said he was referring to Congressional testimony given by Rio Tinto’s Managing Director for Copper and Diamonds, Nigel Steward, in March. Steward called the U.S. permitting process “inefficient” and said it “presents a major barrier to the domestic sector’s ability to perform to its full potential.” Rio Tinto is advocating for more certainty in permitting timelines and improved coordination among agencies involved - along with more money for agencies “to ensure that experienced and highly skilled people are devoted to complex technical aspects of permitting,” said Todd Malan, Rio Tinto’s vice president for external affairs and communications for the Americas. While the company supports permitting deadlines, at least one Rio Tinto official acknowledges that it would be hard to address the issues raised by the Resolution mine in less than years. “I’m not necessarily saying time frames would not be helpful, but three years? ... That’s a tight time frame,” said Peacey. While uncertain permitting timeframes raise financial risks for Rio Tinto, she said, the sometimes lengthy process also protects the public. “Those are people’s rights,” she said.

 ,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"BOGOTA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Congress in the Dominican Republic rejected upholding the nation’s total ban on abortion this week, approving a step that would allow the procedure for ending life-threatening pregnancies and those resulting from rape or incest. The lawmakers in the lower house voted against a decision in May by the Dominican Senate, which turned down recommendations made by President Danilo Medina to amend the criminal code and ease the nation’s abortion ban. The Dominican Republic is one of seven countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that have absolute bans on abortion. The decision by the Dominican Congress on Tuesday would allow abortion in cases of rape or incest, when a mother’s life is in danger or when a foetus would not survive the pregnancy. The contrasting decisions in each house pave the way for another vote to be introduced. Hopes have been raised among abortion rights activists that the country’s ban on abortion - dating back to 1884 - can be finally repealed. “The vote has shown a clear majority of house representatives standing with Dominican women’s fundamental rights to decide over their bodies and to be treated with dignity. This must be celebrated,” Robin Guittard, Caribbean campaigner at rights group Amnesty International, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The earlier vote by the Senate “would have virtually maintained a full ban on accessing abortion services ... in a context of high rates of unsafe abortions, maternal mortality and adolescent pregnancies,” he said. It is not clear when a new vote on the ban will occur, and it could be months before lawmakers start debating the controversial issue again, campaigners say. As in the past, moves to repeal the ban will face staunch opposition from conservative groups and the influential Catholic Church. Janet Camilo, the country’s minister for women, has said the abortion ban is a health care issue for women and decisions not to repeal it were based on sexism. Blanket abortion bans put women’s lives at risk by forcing women to undergo dangerous backstreet abortions, which were the cause of at least one in 10 maternal deaths in Latin America in 2014, according to Amnesty International. In recent years, the United Nations has urged the Dominican Republic to lift its abortion ban. Activists say the country should seize the opportunity to allow women to access a safe abortion in a country where more than 90,000 unsafe abortions occur each year. “Now it’s imperative that Dominican lawmakers ensure that the new penal code proposed guarantees human rights and access to justice for all girls and women,” said Catalina Martinez, Latin America director at the U.S.-based Center of Reproductive Rights.

Mark Kolakowski,07132017,Investopedia,07062017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Right now, active managers of large capitalization funds are crowded into nine stocks in particular, according to the June 30 release of the ""Active managers' holdings update"" from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, a division of Bank of America Corp. (BAC). Based on historical analysis by Merrill Lynch, there may be an opportunity to profit from taking short positions in these stocks through mid-July. Merrill defines over-owned stocks as those whose weight in the funds studied is more than 1.5 times their weight in the S&P 500 Index (SPX), and which are held by at least 35% of these funds. Topping the list as the most over-owned per Merrill's criteria is travel booking service The Priceline Group Inc. (PCLN), whose relative weight (weight in the funds studied vs. weight in the S&P 500) is 2.63x, and which is held by 35.4% of those funds. The other eight are, in descending order of relative weight: payments processor Visa Inc. (V), online merchant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), managed health care company UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), Google parent Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG), drug maker Biogen Inc. (BIIB), payments processor MasterCard Inc. (MA), Alphabet Inc. Class A (GOOGL) and mass media company Comcast Corp. (CMCSA). (For more, see also: Visa Inc. Announces Q4 and Fiscal Year 2016 Results.) At the opposite end of the spectrum, Merrill Lynch names six neglected stocks whose relative weights are 0.03x or less, and which are held by no more than 2.49% of the funds studied. These stocks are: electric and gas utility SCANA Corp. (SCG), furniture and engineered components manufacturer Leggett & Platt Inc. (LEG), insurer Cincinnati Financial Corp. (CINF), media conglomerate News Corp. (NWS), tax preparer H&R Block Inc. (HRB) and Connecticut-based bank holding company People's United Financial Corp. (PBCT). ""Positioning matters more than fundamentals in the short term, and this has been especially true around the quarter-end rebalancing,"" the Merrill Lynch report says. More specifically, based on data from the end of 2012 onwards, Merrill Lynch finds that crowded (overweight) stocks have underperformed neglected (underweight) stocks. Going a step further, Merrill Lynch has identified a trading strategy for the first 15 days after a quarter ends. Short selling the 10 most overweight stocks and buying the 10 most underweight stocks as of a quarter end has produced an average annualized gain of 119% over those 15 days. However, if you maintain those positions for 90 days after a quarter ends, the average annualized gain shrinks to 12%. Over the 18 quarters studied by Merrill Lynch, the annualized gains from the 15-day trading strategy have ranged from -31% to +875%. It produced losses in six of those 18 quarters, and the median annualized gain was 31.5%. For the 90-day holding period, the annualized gains ranged from -42% to +81%. Losses also were produced in six quarters, and the median annualized gain was 15%. In its report, Merrill Lynch does not present a theoretic rationale for its findings. However, as quoted above, Merrill does make a passing reference to quarter-end rebalancing. If portfolio managers consistently cut back on their most overweight positions shortly after a quarter-end, that would depress the prices of these securities, especially if the selling is widespread. Researchers have observed a similar dip in stock prices resulting from selling by mutual, pension and hedge funds around the end of each month, producing short-term buying opportunities, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. (For more, see also: What does the end of the quarter mean for portfolio management?)

Jacob Pramuk,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"The Senate is delaying its upcoming recess until the third week of August as it faces a packed legislative agenda and Republicans struggle to reach a consensus on an Obamacare replacement plan. ""In order to provide more time to complete action on important legislative items and process nominees that have been stalled by a lack of cooperation from our friends across the aisle, the Senate will delay the start of the August recess until the third week of August,"" Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Tuesday. The break will be shortened by two weeks to give senators more time to work toward legislative priorities. The announcement comes as disagreements within the Republican Party have delayed an overhaul of the U.S. health-care system and threatened to set back other action, like raising the debt ceiling, passing an appropriations bill or approving a tax reform plan. A group of 10 Republican senators had called on McConnell to shorten the recess as the GOP struggled to make progress on its broad agenda. McConnell said that ""once the Senate completes its work on health-care reform,"" it will turn to ""other important issues"" like the National Defense Authorization Act and President Donald Trump's nominees for government posts who await Senate confirmation. McConnell said Tuesday that a revised version of the health-care bill is expected to come Thursday morning. At least eight GOP senators still oppose the plan as written now. Republicans can only lose two votes and still pass the bill. The prospects of a bipartisan plan to stabilize insurance markets has increased recently as doubts grow about the GOP's ability to pass a plan on its own.

 ,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"Dalian Wanda Group said it would sell Chinese tourism projects and hotels to Sunac China for $9.3 billion, marking a step back for the property giant from its theme park ambitions. The sale — the second-biggest real estate deal ever in China according to Reuters data — is however expected to help Wanda cut its debt pile and strengthen its case for a listing on the mainland after it delisted from Hong Kong last year. Wanda said it would sell 91 percent of 13 cultural tourism projects, that typically include theme parks and leisure complexes, as well as 76 hotels to the acquisitive Tianjin-based developer Sunac for a total of 63.18 billion yuan. The Chinese group, with businesses spanning real estate, films, sports and entertainment, had plans to build at least 20 such cultural projects around China. Its billionaire owner Wang Jianlin had last year said his ""wolf pack"" of parks would beat U.S. rival Walt Disney Co. ""This (deal) signifies a retreat from Wanda's previous strategy in cultural tourism, and marks a pivot to an asset-light strategy,"" said Qin Gang, senior researcher at State Information Center, a government-linked think-tank. While Wanda did not give a reason for the sale, local business magazine Caixin quoted Wang saying the deal would greatly reduce Wanda Commercial's debt level and help the property unit to achieve an ""asset-light"" operation. ""Through this asset transfer, Wanda Commercial's debt ratio will be greatly reduced, all the proceeds will be used to repay loans. Wanda Commercial plans to repay most of the bank loans this year,"" Wang told Caixin. S&P downgraded Wanda Commercial in December citing rising financial leverage and slower-than-expected asset disposal at China's largest commercial developer. Another downgrade would push the rating into ""junk"" category. Wanda has been investing heavily in entertainment, leisure and financial businesses and the buying spree has drawn the attention of Chinese regulators, who ordered lenders last month to assess exposure to overseas deals by Wanda, HNA Group, Anbang Insurance and Fosun. Wanda had earmarked a more than 300 billion yuan investment for its cultural and tourism projects. It has also been very active globally, buying U.S. cinema chain operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc and taking a controlling stake in U.S. film studio Legendary Entertainment last year. The 91 percent stake in Wanda cultural and tourism projects, located across the country from the northern city of Harbin to Kunming in the south, will fetch 29.58 billion yuan. The price tag for the hotels is 33.6 billion yuan. Sunac and Wanda are expected to sign an agreement by the end of this month. Shares in Wanda Hotel Development  surged more than 150 percent after the news. Wanda said Tianjin-based Sunac, led by magnate Sun Hongbin, will be responsible for all the loans for the projects, but the brand name and design of the projects will remain unchanged, and they will still be operated and managed by Wanda. Sunac, whose shares in Hong Kong were suspended from trading ahead of what it said would be a ""very substantial acquisition"" announcement, declined to comment further.

Leslie Picker,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"Acrobats and bald drummers will combine in a deal signed in blue ink. Cirque du Soleil said Thursday that it agreed to acquire Blue Man Productions, the first purchase in its quest to expand beyond the circus arts. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. ""We want to broaden our horizons, develop new forms of entertainment, reach out to new audiences and expand our own creative capabilities,"" said Daniel Lamarre, president and CEO of Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil in a statement Thursday. ""Today, we are taking a decisive step towards materializing these ambitions."" Lamarre told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" Thursday that the deal was a ""strategy of diversification"" for the famous circus company. ""We have the opportunity to have a new brand that we are going to bring to its full potential around the world,"" Lamarre said. ""Cirque du Soleil is an amazing marketing and distribution machine around the world, and the Blue Man Group deserve the support of an organization like ours to continue to grow around the world."" The ambitions were put in motion two years ago when TPG, a $73 billion private-equity firm, took a majority stake. At the time, The Wall Street Journal reported that the investment valued Cirque du Soleil at $1.5 billion. Fosun Industrial Holdings, a Chinese investment firm, and Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, a Canadian pension fund, also took a stake in Cirque du Soleil at the time TPG did. TPG owns stakes in a variety of entertainment brands including Creative Arts Agency, Spotify and Univision. TPG's growth-investing arm also co-founded STX Entertainment, which produced movies such as ""Edge of Seventeen"" and ""Bad Moms."" With the acquisition of Blue Man Group, Cirque du Soleil is looking to expand its audience pool. Blue Man Group currently has six productions stationed in New York, Boston, Las Vegas, Chicago, Orlando and Berlin and two touring productions roving around North America and the world. The company was owned by its co-founders Chris Wink and Phil Stanton and the GF Capital Private Equity Fund. Cirque du Soleil's audience is still demonstrably larger, with 18 shows being simultaneously performed. With the additional Blue Man Group productions added to Cirque du Soleil's shows, Lamarre hopes to grow the circus company into a ""global leader of entertainment."" ""It's a big, big shift, and it has been supported by the Blue Man Group,"" Lamarre said. ""What it means is that now, we're no longer only a circus company, but now, were going to become a global leader of entertainment. That's the goal we are pursuing."" It is just the first deal being contemplated. Cirque du Soleil and TPG have compiled a list of additional acquisition targets to add to the entertainment portfolio, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Wink and Stanton, along with Matt Goldman, built the image of the bald and blue performer that they named ""Blue Man,"" evoking the word ""human,"" according to the company's website. Their performances utilize bright colors, lights, technology and props to create percussive sounds and dance moves. That compares with Cirque du Soleil productions, which incorporate stunts and acrobatics into various storylines. Goldman Sachs served as the advisor to Blue Man Group.

Rachel Cao,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"If you're looking for affordable health care, consider seeking medical attention outside the U.S. As costs continue to climb, retirees increasingly are looking abroad for less costly coverage. Below are the five best countries in which to find affordable health care, according to InternationalLiving.com. Just as in the U.S., metropolitan areas in these countries will typically provide better quality of care than rural ones, says International Living senior editor and author Dan Prescher, and often matches or beats care in the U.S. Large clinics and hospitals in Panama are often affiliated with U.S. counterparts such as the Cleveland Clinic and John Hopkins Medicine International. While most expats tend to pay out-of-pocket, International Living says it's best to still have private insurance. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Panama offers coverage for as little as $80 per month for those under age 65. Older expats or those with pre-existing conditions may opt for a hospital membership that costs anywhere between $90 and $175 per month, according to International Living. Unlike many insurance plans, some hospitals may offer limited coverage for pre-existing conditions after a waiting period of one or two years. Mexico is known for providing health care at a fraction of U.S. costs. Expats can expect to pay half or less for medical expenses and prescription drugs. Legal Mexican residents have access to two health care systems: government-run public health or private. The government-run systems offers basic care with costs running as low as a few hundred dollars per year. Many expats also use private health care where you can pay with cash or use insurance. A standard visit to the doctor can run $30 to $40. The World Health Organization ranks Colombia's health-care system 22nd worldwide, which is higher than both Canada (ranked 30th) and the U.S. (ranked 37th). Anyone under age 60 with a national ID card, even those with pre-existing conditions, can apply for government health insurance. Co-pays average $3. Many ex-pat retirees pay a premium of $70 to $85 for a couple, according to International Living. Private health insurance can also be added. Premiums vary yet are still are significantly lower than what a couple would pay in the U.S. There are two medical systems in Costa Rica: a government-run one and the private medical system, with most people choosing to combine both. Caja is Costa Rica's universal health care system, which is available for both citizens and legal residents. As a Caja user, you pay an income-based monthly fee that covers the applicant and a dependent spouse. The fee is about $75 to $150, according to International Living, and provides complete coverage, including doctor and specialist visits, diagnostic testing and prescriptions. However, a major drawback is long waiting times for specialized surgeries, since Caja covers a majority of the population. The private medical system is another option. A doctor's visit there is $50, ultrasounds run $75 and major surgeries are usually half to a quarter of costs in the U.S., according to International Living. Malaysia's most popular areas of treatment are cosmetic surgery, dental work and dermatology, attracting 1 million medical tourists worldwide in 2016, according to International Living. George Town and Kuala Lumpur are the main medical centers. Most Malaysian doctors were trained in the U.S., Australia or the U.K., and all are English-speaking, a major perk for ex-pats. Malaysia has about 11 hospitals with Joint Commission International (JCI) certification, considered the gold standard for health-care providers worldwide.

Christina Farr,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"When Harvard Medical School professor John Brownstein had an idea for how Uber could provide a health service back in 2015, he shot off a few cold messages on LinkedIn. Brownstein didn't get a response from any of the Uber executives he contacted, so he tried a different tactic. After his next ride, he wrote a response to a support ticket: ""The ride was fine, but you guys should really consider health care as your next application."" That idea later became UberHEALTH. Over the years, Brownstein, who is also a computational epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital, has quietly become a go-to for tech executives as they plot their initial steps into the health sector. ""I work with tech companies because I think a lot about how we can use these data-sets to understand population health,"" he said in a recent interview with CNBC. Brownstein is fascinated by how the growing volume of digital data aggregated by tech companies can be meaningful. He studies how things like Google searches, data from wearable trackers, or social media posts can provide insight on predicting disease and improving health outcomes. He was among the first to develop an Apple CareKit application to make it easier to collect medical data for parents of children with special needs. He was also a pioneer in leveraging Twitter's health-related conversations to study public health issues like chronic disease and gun violence. He worked with a small group of researchers to find out whether Yelp reviews could be an indicator of food poisoning outbreaks. These days, he's intrigued by the health potential of Amazon's Alexa application. He's one of the judges for a Merck-sponsored competition to build diabetes-management apps for the voice application. And his team at Boston Children's Hospital developed its own app called KidsMD to provide simple health advice to parents. Not every idea has turned into a big success. For instance, he worked closely with Google on its ill-fated flu trends project, which was shut down three years ago because the data collected wasn't accurate enough. But Brownstein says that many of the first technology efforts in health care were ahead of their time. Efforts that get off the ground today might have a better shot, he said. ""There will be some successes, because the electronic medical record companies are more open than they used to be,"" he said. The newly available data from medical records includes labs, allergy lists and so on. This may be why some companies have held off on entering $3 trillion health sector. Facebook and Twitter haven't done much, Amazon is just getting its feet wet—CNBC reported last month that the company is looking to build out a team for an online drug sales push. But Brownstein believes that most of the big tech companies will jump on the health tech bandwagon in coming years.

 ,07132017,CNBC,07062017," Since May, hackers have been penetrating the computer networks of companies that operate nuclear power stations and other energy facilities, as well as manufacturing plants in the United States and other countries. Among the companies targeted was the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, which runs a nuclear power plant near Burlington, Kan., according to security consultants and an urgent joint report issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation last week. The joint report was obtained by The New York Times and confirmed by security specialists who have been responding to the attacks. It carried an urgent amber warning, the second-highest rating for the sensitivity of the threat. The report did not indicate whether the cyberattacks were an attempt at espionage — such as stealing industrial secrets — or part of a plan to cause destruction. There is no indication that hackers were able to jump from their victims' computers into the control systems of the facilities, nor is it clear how many facilities were breached. Wolf Creek officials said that while they could not comment on cyberattacks or security issues, no ""operations systems"" had been affected and that their corporate network and the internet were separate from the network that runs the plant. In a joint statement with the F.B.I., a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said, ""There is no indication of a threat to public safety, as any potential impact appears to be limited to administrative and business networks."" The hackers appeared determined to map out computer networks for future attacks, the report concluded. But investigators have not been able to analyze the malicious ""payload"" of the hackers' code, which would offer more detail into what they were after. John Keeley, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, which works with all 99 electric utilities that operate nuclear plants in the United States, said nuclear facilities are required to report cyberattacks that relate to their ""safety, security and operations."" None have reported that the security of their operations was affected by the latest attacks, Mr. Keeley said. More from the New York Times:Hacker who aided Russian intelligence is sentenced to 2 yearsPrivate not state hackers likely to have targeted UK parliament: SourcesHacks raise fear over NSA's hold on cyberweapons In most cases, the attacks targeted people — industrial control engineers who have direct access to systems that, if damaged, could lead to an explosion, fire or a spill of dangerous material, according to two people familiar with the attacks who could not be named because of confidentiality agreements. The origins of the hackers are not known. But the report indicated that an ""advanced persistent threat"" actor was responsible, which is the language security specialists often use to describe hackers backed by governments. The two people familiar with the investigation say that, while it is still in its early stages, the hackers' techniques mimicked those of the organization known to cybersecurity specialists as ""Energetic Bear,"" the Russian hacking group that researchers have tied to attacks on the energy sector since at least 2012. Hackers wrote highly targeted email messages containing fake résumés for control engineering jobs and sent them to the senior industrial control engineers who maintain broad access to critical industrial control systems, the government report said. The fake résumés were Microsoft Word documents that were laced with malicious code. Once the recipients clicked on those documents, attackers could steal their credentials and proceed to other machines on a network. In some cases, the hackers also compromised legitimate websites that they knew their victims frequented — something security specialists call a watering hole attack. And in others, they deployed what are known as man-in-the-middle attacks in which they redirected their victims' internet traffic through their own machines. Energy, nuclear and critical manufacturing organizations have frequently been targets for sophisticated cyberattacks. The Department of Homeland Security has called cyberattacks on critical infrastructure ""one of the most serious national security challenges we must confront."" On May 11, during the attacks, President Trump signed an executive order to strengthen the cybersecurity defenses of federal networks and critical infrastructure. The order required government agencies to work with public companies to mitigate risks and help defend critical infrastructure organizations ""at greatest risk of attacks that could reasonably result in catastrophic regional or national effects on public health or safety, economic security, or national security."" The order specifically addressed the threats from ""electricity disruptions and prolonged power outages resulting from cybersecurity incidents."" Jon Wellinghoff, the former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said in an interview last week that while the security of United States' critical infrastructure systems had improved in recent years, they were still vulnerable to advanced hacking attacks, particularly those that use tools stolen from the National Security Agency. ""We never anticipated that our critical infrastructure control systems would be facing advanced levels of malware,"" Mr. Wellinghoff said. In 2008, an attack called Stuxnet that was designed by the United States and Israel to hit Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility, demonstrated how computer attacks could disrupt and destroy physical infrastructure. The government hackers infiltrated the systems that controlled Iran's nuclear centrifuges and spun them wildly out of control, or stopped them from spinning entirely, destroying a fifth of Iran's centrifuges. In retrospect, Mr. Wellinghoff said that attack should have foreshadowed the threats the United States would face on its own infrastructure. Critical infrastructure is increasingly controlled by Scada, or supervisory control and data acquisition systems. They are used by manufacturers, nuclear plant operators and pipeline operators to monitor variables like pressure and flow rates through pipelines. The software also allows operators to monitor and diagnose unexpected problems. But like any software, Scada systems are susceptible to hacking and computer viruses. And for years, security specialists have warned that hackers could use remote access to these systems to cause physical destruction.

"Bob Rall, principal at Rall Capital Management",07132017,CNBC,07062017,"Meeting with our clients is one of the best parts of my job. Many of our clients have been with us for several years, and our meetings are like conversations with old friends. While we spend a good amount of time in our meetings reviewing portfolios and discussing financial issues that are affecting them, most of our time is spent catching up on what has occurred in their lives since our last meeting and making sure we are all prepared for whatever might happen in their future. Every client is different, and therefore every conversation is different, but there are also a number of similarities. A couple of meetings I had last week demonstrate how similar our conversations can be at times. In two separate meetings with two separate longtime clients, I had the same piece of advice: ""Go spend some money"" was my message to both. That advice might sound funny coming from someone who makes a living by trying to get clients to save and invest for their future. But in these two cases, the advice was certainly appropriate. And based upon the report ""Living Too Frugally? Economic Sentiment & Spending Among Older Americans,"" by Matt Fellowes, CEO of United Income, it's probably appropriate for a lot more people. Both meetings I am referring to involved at least one spouse who is more than 80 years old. They are both still healthy, although both admit to starting to slow down a bit. The other thing they have in common is, both couples were very good savers through their working years and are very comfortable financially. Not rich, but comfortable. Both couples have nice-sized individual retirement accounts. And both are taking just enough from each to barely satisfy their required minimum distributions. More from Advisor Insight: The bad things good people do with 401(k) balances Beyond health, home and auto, do you know what kind of insurance you need? Dog eats cash, man makes stink ... and Treasury pays up My advice to go spend some money is based on my philosophy that because we get to go around only once in this life, we should limit the ""I wish we would have …"" thoughts before it's too late. A financial life-planning approach should aim to limit the regrets they may have at the end of life. ""I wish we would have taken more family vacations,"" ""I wish we would have traveled more,"" and ""I wish we would have given more"" are all examples of regrets. I certainly understand the desire to keep a healthy level of funds available in the event of a long-term-care need. In fact, I support it. The time bomb ticking inside of anyone's financial plan is the potential for a long stay in a nursing home. So I'm not advocating they go on some wild spending spree. But I don't want them so concerned about a potential need that they miss out on what life has to offer. The research report I mentioned earlier confirms that my clients are not unique in this regard. It suggests retirees are not spending enough in retirement to live out their lifelong dreams. The report indicates that, for a lot of seniors, a lack of confidence in future economic growth and their own financial well-being keeps them sitting on large portfolios. A study done by the University of Michigan for the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Commerce Department found that adults become less optimistic about future economic growth and financial health as they age. So they are less likely to spend their nest egg. The study also found wealth and investments generally grow as people age — so they are leaving behind large amounts of wealth when they pass away. While leaving behind some wealth for your heirs is certainly not a bad thing, I would guess (or at least hope) most kids would prefer to see Mom and Dad live life in such a way as to have few regrets. So do some long-term-care planning and make sure you will be able to afford whatever care you may need as you grow older. Then go spend some money. While names of these funds abound, they all aim to beat the market, either with better performance or risk management. Being an entrepreneur has many payoffs, but small-business owners need a good financial plan in place to attain them.

Obamacare is on the verge of collapse -- at least according to some in Washington. It's easy to see why they think that's the case. Major insurers, including UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), have pulled out of most Obamacare exchanges after losing billions of dollars. Aetna (NYSE:AET) is one large insurer that has totally withdrawn from Obamacare exchanges. On the other hand, Trumpcare could be on the verge of collapse, as well. Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) stated over the weekend that the Senate GOP healthcare bill endorsed by President Trump is ""probably going to be dead."" So what's next for the U.S. healthcare system? Those on the left are pushing for one solution, while those on the right want another. Here are two potential paths for the nation's healthcare -- and the vastly different scenarios for investors if each becomes reality. Image source: Getty Images. Former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) believes that ""the only long-term solution to America's healthcare crisis is a single-payer national healthcare program."" Sanders, a socialist who caucuses with Democrats in the U.S. Senate, promotes what he calls ""Medicare for all,"" -- a universal healthcare system where all Americans would receive full health insurance through Medicare. While there are other alternatives for a single-payer system in the U.S., Sanders' plan includes most of the goals of the political left. Under this plan, Medicare would pay all of Americans' healthcare expenses. There would be no co-pays and no deductibles. The federal government would negotiate all pricing with healthcare providers and drugmakers. Proponents maintain that a single-payer system such as this would lower the overall cost of healthcare. They point to other countries with government-funded healthcare with significantly lower healthcare spending levels per capita. Sen. Sanders states that his proposed plan would cost $1.38 trillion annually. This would be funded through tax increases. Employers would pay an additional 6.2% tax. Most Americans, regardless of income level, would pay a 2.2% higher tax. Income taxes for the wealthy (annual income of $250,000 or more) would be raised significantly and tax deductions limited. Also, capital gains and dividends would be taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Image source: Getty Images. Not everyone agrees that the U.S. should shift to a socialist type of healthcare system. Conservatives and Libertarians argue for an approach that relies more on free market competition and lower regulations. One such approach has been proposed by another former presidential candidate, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a conservative ophthalmologist who describes himself as ""libertarianish."" Sen. Paul's plan is to totally repeal Obamacare and replace it with several key changes that give individuals more flexibility in purchasing health insurance. All Americans would receive the same tax deduction for health insurance regardless of whether they obtain insurance through their employers or buy it themselves. Health savings accounts (HSAs) would be encouraged through tax credits and eliminating maximum contribution limits. HSAs could also be used to pay for health insurance premiums, prescription drugs, and over-the-counter drugs. Individuals would be allowed to pool together to purchase insurance like employers currently do. These pools could include non-profit organizations, such as churches, civic groups, and trade associations, as well as other entities formed solely for the purpose of buying insurance. Small businesses would be able to pool together across state lines to purchase health insurance as well. Insurers would also be allowed to sell policies licensed in one state to any other state. It's not known exactly how much Sen. Paul's healthcare plan would cost, although it would certainly be far less than the $1.38 trillion cost for Sen. Sander's plan. The advantages of the plan, according to Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), are that it moves the U.S. in ""the right direction toward patient-centered healthcare, lower costs, bigger pools to insure everyone and cover preexisting conditions."" Brat stated that so far Paul's plan is ""the most free market approach to healthcare that will truly bend down the cost curve."" Image source: Getty Images. These are obviously starkly different plans with arguments for and against each one. How would investors be impacted if something similar to Sen. Sander's single-payer system became law? Shareholders of health insurance stocks would likely feel the most pain. It's possible that private insurers could offer Medicare Advantage plans as they do now. However, membership in these plans made up only 7.5% of UnitedHealth's total enrollment in 2016 and only 5.9% of Aetna's total enrollment last year. Health insurer stocks would plunge if a single-payer system was implemented. Biotech and pharmaceutical stocks would also no doubt suffer. We've already seen negative effects on these stocks from President Trump's statements earlier this year that he wanted to allow Medicare and Medicaid to negotiate prices with drugmakers. There's also a good chance that many other stocks would take a beating under Sen. Sanders' plan. Raising U.S. corporate taxes (which already rank among the highest in the world) probably wouldn't be seen as a good thing. Furthermore, increasing taxes on capital gains and dividends could cause investors to sell off stocks to avoid paying higher taxes before the single-payer system took effect. How would investors be affected by Sen. Paul's plan? Health insurance stocks would likely soar. Companies like UnitedHealth Group and Aetna, which have retreated from the individual markets under Obamacare, would probably jump back in. HealthEquity (NASDAQ:HQY), which provides a technology platform for consumers to manage HSAs, would no doubt surge even more than it has over the last year. Stocks of companies that rely heavily on the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, on the other hand, would likely drop. How the stocks of drugmakers and of other industries would be impacted is hard to predict. It depends on the details that a final plan would include. Image source: Getty Images. The odds of Sen. Rand Paul's plan being implemented also seem low. He first floated his proposal in January. It hasn't gained too much momentum since then. For now, the most likely scenarios are probably either a modified version of Trumpcare or making changes to sustain Obamacare. Americans, including investors, will have to keep waiting to find out how they'll be impacted by whatever comes next. ","

Todd Campbell,07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A full transcript follows the video. Todd Campbell: It was great, I was actually up in northern Maine in the quaintest little village. They did a parade that was basically just people walking down the street led by a drum major to a brass band. Harjes: That sounds awesome. Campbell: It was, it was so down home. Harjes: Was there anybody around to watch the parade, or was the whole town in it? Campbell: There [were] at least 15 people on the sidelines. Harjes: Solid, good turnout. Campbell: [laughs] But, it was a very nice Fourth of July. Didn't get to see any fireworks, though, how about you? Harjes: I saw enough for the both of us. I live in D.C., so you kind of have to. Campbell: Oh. I could hear them from afar, but those dreaded pine trees were blocking my view. Harjes: Oh, man. Maybe next year, come visit HQ, we'll watch some fireworks. Campbell: There we go. Harjes: I don't know about you, but I'm actually very happy to be back after the long weekend. I'm kind of happy to just be back in the office and in the studio. For the show today, we're talking about retail pharmacies. Rite Aid and Walgreens' attempts to make a deal were all over the news last week, before we took a hiatus for the long weekend, so we're going to digest these headlines for you all, and then talk about the pharmacy space at large. Sound good, Todd? Campbell: Yeah, there were a lot of fireworks last week, related to this merger, right? Harjes: That's a good way of putting it. Campbell: It's unfortunate, I know a lot of listeners are probably looking at it and saying, ""Please tell me something good."" This was a deal that was supposed to go through, it's hopefully going to go through. Back in 2015, investors were thinking they were going to get $9 a share -- Harjes: For Rite Aid? Campbell: Yeah, for Rite Aid, Walgreens offering over $9 billion to acquire the company, lock, stock, and barrel. Now, Rite Aid shares sitting below $3, you need to triple before you get back to those levels, and it's all about the FTC. And to mix a bunch of metaphors together, no joy in Mudville last week, the FTC has struck out the Rite Aid-Walgreens merger. Harjes: Right. Digging through the timeline here a little bit, as you said, back in October 2015, that's when you had the original deal that was announced. That was since revised because the FTC was like, ""No, you guys can't just get together, there wouldn't be enough competition in this space,"" which is perhaps not surprising when you consider that, between CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens, they completely dominate the retail pharmacy space. Campbell: It's crazy, Kristine. You have this top tier, because of consolidation over the last decade, of players that includes those three that you just mentioned, plus, Wal-Mart is a big player in that, too. But if you conclude just that top tier, they control two-thirds of market share in prescription drug volume by revenue. And that's just an amazingly consolidated industry to be trafficking in. And that's why, obviously, the FTC was concerned that pairing these two companies up together might be a problem. Harjes: Right. So, the two to revise their agreement down to an acquisition price of between $6.50 to $7.00 per share of Rite Aid, depending on how many of the Rite Aid stores were divested. That was going to be between either 1,000 and 1,200 stores sold to a company called Fred's, so that $6.50 to $7.00 range was dependent on how many stores, between 1,000 and 1,200, were divested. Campbell: Yeah. I felt like this whole deal was all about, ""What if we try this? What about this?"" And they just kept throwing darts at the wall, hoping that the FTC would say, ""Oh, that works for us."" But no. Harjes: Yeah. That was plan B. Last Monday, Rite Aid shares soared 30% on news that the merger is more likely than not to be approved by the FTC coming up ahead of their deadline of July 7th. But, now we're on to plan C because the deal fell apart again. Campbell: Yeah. Rumors and innuendo, don't buy stocks because of them. This is a prime example of, you never know if a deal is going to close until the deal closes, especially when you're talking about a very competitive market like pharmacy and pharmacy retail. Walgreens is the second largest player in terms of retail pharmacy market share with about 13.8%, Rite Aid clocks in about 5%; combine the two together, and they come out to about 19% market share in retail pharmacy. Obviously, that was too concentrated for the FTC to go ahead and say, ""Yeah, we're OK with it."" So, back to the drawing board for yet another try at a very different deal. Harjes: Right. So, now the deal is that Walgreens will acquire around half of Rite Aid stores, 2,186 of them, and they'll get some other things like inventory as well. In return, they will give Rite Aid $5.175 billion in cash, and Rite Aid will also receive a $325 million merger termination fee. Campbell: Yeah. Thank goodness that they were able to at least get this deal -- well, it's not approved yet -- but, to announce this deal at the same time that they announced Walgreens was abandoning the prior bid, because who knows where the share price would have gone on Rite Aid. As a refresher, to go back in time for investors, Rite Aid took on a tremendous amount of debt back in the late 2000s to expand, because they recognized, ""If we want to keep up with CVS and Walgreens, we need to grow our footprint, build up our buy power."" So, they did a lot of acquisitions, but unfortunately they did those acquisitions with debt, that debt was costly, and it really hamstrung them. For Walgreens to step in and say, ""We'll buy you, including all the problems you may have profitability wise,"" was great. Now we're looking at a situation where those problems still exist, there's still a tremendous amount of debt on the balance sheet, you have some questions regarding how bloated corporate expenses are relative to some of their other retailing peers -- there's a lot of things that make people nervous about this company surviving or thriving against CVS and Walgreens on a stand-alone basis. Some may be unfounded, though. Harjes: Yeah. I actually kind of like where this leaves Rite Aid. As you mentioned, they're sitting on a ton of debt, it's over $7 billion last time I looked. Right now, when they get $5 billion-plus from Walgreens, a lot of that is going to be able to de-lever them and help bring down interest expense. They paid $432 million in interest expense just last year. So, I like this shift in strategy from them, where they're not going to be trying to take on a bunch more debt to expand their footprint. In fact, they're doing the opposite. They're selling these stores to Walgreens so that they can actually focus on their own profitability. And, this is an important thing to note, they also have a PBM business, EnvisionRx is their pharmacy benefits management business, and that's going to become a more important segment of Rite Aid now that they don't have as many stores to worry about. Campbell: Yeah, it's almost like, we gave you the bad news, now maybe here's the good news, the silver lining, what could go right in the playbook for Rite Aid as you go forward. Without a doubt, like you said, EnvisionRx is a big part of that, because the pharmacy benefit management business is a higher EBITDA generating as a percentage of sales, it's more profitable than the retail store business. So, you're going to get a shift in revenue mix that would theoretically provide a tailwind to the company's profitability once this deal closes -- assuming, obviously, the FTC doesn't block it. The FTC could still halt this deal in its tracks, so people should be aware that risk still exist. It doesn't yet have the blessing of the regulators. If EnvisionRx is able to continue to grow against some very large players, including Express Scripts and CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare has a PBM business as well, then theoretically, an argument, I think, could be made that investors are overreacting with how much they've driven down the share price. If I just look at price to sales for Express Scripts, it's about 0.40 right now. If I look at the fact that the EnvisionRx business is going to do $6 billion in sales, you could make an argument that that's worth $2.4 billion, and the market cap of Rite Aid right now is about $2.7 billion. So, would you pay $300 million for 2,000 stores? I would. Harjes: Yeah, absolutely. That's a really interesting point. Before we take a break, what about Walgreens in this situation? Where does this leave them? Campbell: Walgreens, I think, is a winner in this. Theoretically, they've got to go through, look at their entire footprint, figure out what stores they could get from Rite Aid that would dovetail perfectly within their own model. They say they're going to be able to make this deal accretive within one year. They think they can carve $400 million in synergies, i.e., cost savings, layoffs, whatever, out of this deal. So they're going to make money on this deal. So, from Walgreens' perspective, we don't get the problems, we don't have to buy the problems, we can just buy the stores we want, walk away, and theoretically this makes us bigger, stronger, and even more profitable. So, I think they are a winner. Rite Aid is more of a mixed bag, because you're looking at it and saying, how much of the debt will we pay off? Will we be lean and mean enough to be able to survive and thrive as we go forward? There is something else, though, Kristine, that we didn't mention, and we should probably touch on really quick, and that's the ability to piggyback on Walgreens' buying power. Harjes: Oh, yeah, this is an important detail, here. I'll let you go into the details, but essentially, Rite Aid can still buy drugs at cost from Walgreens affiliates for up to 10 years. Campbell: Right. One of the big reasons that Rite Aid stores have suffered profitability-wise has been a lot of payback and compression on margins in the back end of the store, the pharmacy business at the retail stores. And a lot of that has come from generic drugs, which are obviously lower-cost, lower-margin drugs, and they represent 90% of all prescriptions written. So, the ability to team up and piggyback on Walgreens' purchasing power -- because Walgreens is much larger and they get much better deals on these drugs -- theoretically, that should boost store profitability. There [are] also opportunities to boost store profitability by investing in RediClinics, which are in-store clinics that could drive additional volume there as well, and doing remodeling. They have about 60% of their footprint will be updated to the most recent model that they like, the format that they like, the wellness format, and I assume they'll double down and get the rest of that 40% upgraded to those stores, too. Harjes: We talked a little bit about what is next for these major retail pharmacies, but we left out the risk that they will be disrupted entirely. It may come as little surprise that Amazon is a threat to the front-of-store sales in the brick-and-mortar stores, but the threat doesn't stop there. Amazon could effectively compete with these companies' entire operations, and it's not as far-fetched as it seems. Campbell: Amazon is, without a doubt, one of the most innovative and aggressive retailers out there, and they have successfully disrupted business after business after business. In May, some people and some chatter started about it potentially getting into the pharmacy retailing business. Again, this is rumor, and we don't want to buy stocks based on rumor. However, there is some smoke that could indicate there's fire here to the idea that Amazon might try and figure out a way to either use its newly acquired Whole Foods stores to help with prescription fulfillment somehow, as delivery centers or pickup centers, and there is some other evidence that they're making a push into the pharmacy benefit management business, which we talked about a little bit earlier in the show, for their own use, and that they could theoretically open that pharmacy benefit manager up to anyone, to all sorts of employers across the nation. Harjes: And that's so Amazon of Amazon, to do it like that, where they create something for their own internal usage and then flip it to be external-facing, where anybody can come in and use it then. And they're so good at doing this. In fact, actually, this reminds me of an article I read recently in TechCrunch called ""Why Amazon Is Eating The World."" If anyone listening is interested in this article, it was a really amazing deep dive into how Amazon is poised to win everything because of this model of developing things internally and then exposing them externally. Anyway. Specifically about the PBM, Amazon has 128,000 employees. CNBC reports that they're creating an internal pharmacy benefits manager for those employees. This is a business where scale is everything. Margins are slim, efficiency is huge. So, when you look at Amazon, that sounds exactly like something Amazon could win. They're amazing at supply chain efficiencies, all their sourcing, and their distribution. If they're able to harness that kind of scale and those efficiencies, I can really see them competing in this space. Campbell: With that many employees, you know you're spending a heck of a lot of money on healthcare. So, from an internal perspective, developing your own pharmacy benefits manager -- as a refresher, what those pharmacy benefit managers do is negotiate for lower drug prices with the drug manufacturers and the distributors. So, the bigger scale you have, the better price you can get. Amazon is a huge employer, and it's probably not lost on them that if they took their size and paired it up with some of the other large employers in the country, maybe we can really get their expenses to drop when it comes to healthcare cost. So, there is reason to think that without a doubt, they're doing the PBM. They already hired somebody earlier this year, that's a fact. Based on just looking at LinkedIn profiles, I found a gentleman named Mark Lyons, who used to work for Premera Blue Cross, which handles or ministers the health insurance program for Amazon employees, they hired him to theoretically develop this pharmacy benefit manager. There's also been some talk of job postings out there for other positions that would also be tied into developing this pharmacy business of some sort. So, I think that's a very intriguing angle for them. I don't think it would be out of the question for them to try and pursue it. They're going to have to overcome some regulatory hurdles anyway internally, so why not leverage all of those lessons learned to expand it more broadly? Also, Kristine, it shouldn't be ignored that over in Japan, where, of course, you have a different regulatory framework, they're experimenting by doing some partnerships with pharmacies in major population centers where you can order your prescription online, have it validated by a pharmacist, and then you can go pick it up at the pharmacy. That way, that model, is kind of similar to a deal that Amazon had with drugstore.com way back in the day. Kristine, do you remember drugstore.com? Harjes: I do not. Campbell: This was the internet heyday, late 1990s, ""Wouldn't it be great if we could order things online like our prescription medicine?"" It came out at around the same time that mail order pharmacy was really starting to become a big thing. Amazon took a 40% stake in drugstore.com, and drugstore.com had a 10-year supply relationship with none other than Rite Aid. So, it's interesting to think that Bezos was on drugstore.com's board, that Amazon was a big investor in this early on play, and that there was already some familiarity with Rite Aid via that deal. Now, I don't want to start flaming the fire that maybe Amazon would come knocking on Rite Aid's door, but it did dawn on me that Rite Aid already has EnvisionRx, and Amazon has shown it has an interest in retail store footprints by buying Whole Foods. So, why couldn't you just buy the PBM business from Rite Aid, plus the stores, and voila, you're in the pharmacy business. Harjes: Yeah. I could see that. Obviously, you and I are just speculating, here, but I would be really interested to see a map of the store footprint overlay of Amazon distribution centers, plus the Whole Foods stores they just acquired, plus existing Rite Aid stores that are not going to end up being sold to Walgreens. I don't think you actually even know that last part yet, I don't think they've cherry-picked just yet which stores they would actually take. That's probably contingent on this deal actually being approved by the FTC. Campbell: It's going to actually be rolled out, Kristine, in phases. They're going to take some stores at a time. They do have a pro forma map out there that would show the concentrations afterwards. Rite Aid will be mostly West Coast and Northeast. So, something to keep in mind for anyone at home as they're drawing their own maps, sketching it out with their own paper and pencil, ""Would this really makes sense?"" Harjes: Yeah, I'm kind of doing this in my head right now, and from the overlay maps that I've seen of Whole Foods and Amazon, that's kind of already where they are, it's a lot of Amazon on the coast, and Whole Foods also on the coast, but filling in some of the gaps in the Midwest region. Campbell: Yeah, and the smaller footprint of Rite Aid stores, Kristine, I have a Rite Aid near me, but I don't have a Whole Foods anywhere near me. Harjes: Interesting. Campbell: So, I think there are opportunities for them to fill in the gaps. Again, this is pure speculation, people. We don't know what's going to end up happening, or how Amazon will pursue this, or even if they will pursue it. They definitely throw a lot of things at the wall to see what sticks. There just happens to be some interesting evidence that they've been interested in this industry in the past via drugstore.com, that there are some drum beats to the idea that they might be exploring doing the PBM, and then, of course, with the recent news of the deal falling apart with Walgreens, it just makes it interesting to speculate and say, ""Hmm, would Rite Aid be intriguing to Amazon?"" It's anyone's guess how this will all shake out, but it's definitely, definitely something that people are going to want to keep an eye on, because wow, the reverberations would be huge. Harjes: Oh, absolutely. This isn't just you and me speculating on this. There are clearly investors everywhere that are making the connections between these two different spaces. For example, on the day of the acquisition announcement of Whole Foods, I was looking at shares of some of these pharmacies, and I remember seeing both CVS and Walgreens down about 4.5% each, just on that day. For example, Walgreens gets 78% of its total gross profit from retail pharmacy. So, these industries are very much intertwined, and I suspect they will become even more so. Campbell: Yeah. You want to really start putting on your look-forward cap -- what would it look like in the future? If you were a Prime member, would you qualify for free delivery, if you were somehow able to be vetted so that you knew your medicine could show up to your door like mail-order, very simple [to] be able to use it and order it? I mean, who out there does not have an Amazon account at this point? They have, what, 80 million Prime members, or something ridiculous like that. Theoretically, you could create one heck of a rewards program around this whole thing. Harjes: Yeah, and they are a trusted name. In a Wells Fargo survey, they found that five in 10 adults would use or probably use an Amazon pharmacy. Campbell: I would. Harjes: I would, too. I absolutely would. So, yeah, you made a good point earlier about how you really do need to look far out into the future if you're going to be a long-term investor, like we preach here at The Motley Fool. Campbell: Absolutely. And with over $300 billion in prescription drug spending in the U.S. alone, this is a massive market that's ripe for disruption, and there's no one who's better at supply chain, as you indicated earlier, than Amazon. If somebody can figure out a way to shave an additional percentage off of cost, it's going to be Amazon. Harjes: Absolutely. Todd, thank you, as always, for calling into the show today.

    Could a Reckoning at Rite Aid Spark an Amazon.com Acquisition? -- The Motley Fool

Buck Hartzell,07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In 2010, President Obama selected Beth to be a member of the President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability, where she created MoneyAsYouGrow.org, which has since been adopted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Buck Hartzell recently sat down with Beth at Fool HQ to find out more about the importance of educating children about money, saving, and more. A full transcript follows the video. Buck Hartzell: Thank you, all, for coming! Welcome, Beth, to The Motley Fool! I'll give you a quick introduction, and then we'll get into some questions, and we'll help all of us that have kids in the audience make your kids money geniuses, I think that's a desire that we all share. Beth Kobliner: Even if you're not. Hartzell: Yeah. And that's great. When I look at some of the folks that come here to The Motley Fool for help with their finances, they have degrees, sometimes graduate degrees in certain topics, but they don't have a basic understanding of a lot of things that you mentioned in your book, whether it's a Roth IRA or a 401(k) or how much they should contribute. So, the question is, where did you learn about money? Was that something that you learned in school? Or did it come from somewhere else? Kobliner: I definitely didn't learn it in school. I grew up middle class in Queens. My dad was a teacher and then a principal, and my mom was a chemistry teacher, but by the time I was born, a stay-at-home mom. My parents scrimped and saved to have enough money to send us to college. In fact, I was saying this before, I found a spreadsheet that my dad made in 1981, and my parents said, ""You can either get into Brown,"" or a few other schools that I didn't get into, ""Or you can go to Queens College,"" which was our neighborhood school that was basically free, because they felt like it was worth the scrimping and saving. He made a whole spreadsheet on what I would have to contribute, $2,000 a year, which adjusted for inflation was about $10,000 today. So, I think that, observing my parents, they're both Depression generation babies, they were both born in 1929, and my mom would only shop on triple coupon day and she would buy in bulk, and we had 20 cans of tuna fish in our basement because she would always buy when it was a big sale, if you buy a lot you save more money. So, they were really careful about money, but I never felt a lack of much. When I think that, except for once where I wanted a Lacoste Izod alligator shirt -- I never got one, and now I don't want one -- but other than that, I think, kids learn by osmosis, and I don't think you need to be a money genius to teach a kid to be smart about money. But I think, if you love to spend, or that's what you value, those messages come across a little to kids. Hartzell: And you mentioned your parents. Harold is mentioned in there, Shirley is mentioned throughout the book. There were some great stories in there. One involved a candy shop. Do you mind sharing a little bit about that story? Kobliner: Thank you. My dad is Harold, my mom is Shirley. Didn't make up those names, that's their names. My dad was born in 1929, and his father was an alcoholic. I don't think you called it that back then, but he didn't work throughout the whole Depression, and his mom was a seamstress. They had four kids. His brother, when he was born, slept in a drawer because they couldn't afford a crib. They were very poor. And my dad decided when he was 10 that he needed a job. So what he did was he sat in a candy store, the local candy store. He lived in this tenement. And every time the phone would ring in the candy store, the public pay phone, my dad would pick up the phone and run out to the tenement, because nobody had phones in those days, he would say, ""Mrs. Jones, phone call!"" And Mrs. Jones would come downstairs, he tells the story like, she had curlers in her hair and she would come down, and he would get a tip. He would get a nickel or a dime for telling her that there was a phone call. And he was sitting in a candy store doing this, and he used to say to my kids when they were little, ""Do you think I bought candy?"" And they were like, ""Yeah!"" And he said, ""No. I saved that money, I never bought candy, and I gave it to my parents,"" because they were always fighting about money and he thought maybe if he could give them a little more money, give them a little bit, that it would make a difference. And that, to me, is the epitome of that delayed gratification, and that ability to be able to say, ""I'm not going to spend it now, I'm going to think toward the future."" And I do think that the Depression generation had that, and I would argue Millennials, who are always bashed, with avocado toast or whatever, I actually think the Millennials I've been talking to also have a bit more of trying to get a bargain and not getting into credit card debt, that similar kind of mentality. Hartzell: Boomers not so much. Kobliner: Boomers and Gen X-ers, forget it. [laughs] Hartzell: [laughs] You mentioned delayed gratification, which appears throughout the book. An important topic. Carol Dweck talked about the effort effect, which I think aligns pretty well with that, and the marshmallow test, of course, which you talk about. Can you give us an example? How do you get kids, and I think, in a world where there's cellphones in almost everyone's hands, you have social media, you have video games, you have fidget spinners, I saw Tom over there with his fidget spinner, how do you get somebody to delay gratification? Kobliner: Tom, are you going to take that question? [laughs] I think that there are different ways. You could talk to your kids about, ""One day, we as a family are going to go to Disneyworld or Europe and we're going to have to save for that. And we have three or four years before we can go, and if we save this amount, we're not going to eat out as much,"" having concrete goals and examples, I think, is a wonderful way to make it clear, to start putting that message in kids' minds. Also, some kids who really like math, you can go to investor.gov, and if you plug in different interest rates and you save 20 years or 40 years, it's so fun to look at that number. ""If I start at 16 and I save every year for four years with my summer earnings of $1,000, I'll have $100,000 by the time I'm 65."" Or, if you save $1 a day starting at age 10, and you do that to age 65 and earn 7%, you'll have $200,000. Just, numbers like that can motivate, and anecdotes. I learned from my parents, my mom would say, ""If you want to teach your kids a message, tell them a story."" I was like, ""What if I don't have a story?"" She said, ""Make it up."" But, telling kids, ""Our old neighbor, he didn't have a lot of money, but he saved $100 a month, because he always wanted a boat. And he was able to save up that money."" That kind of concrete goal I think is really critical, and gets the message across to kids. You have to say it a million times. Just like vegetables, they have to try it eight times before they like it. You could probably say it 800 times. Hartzell: I like the idea of having something fun, and a way to celebrate your savings, too. I think one of the things that some folks here, Robert Brokamp, some folks at The Fool talked about having different savings jars or buckets for different things. One of them could be college, and that's a longer-term goal, and there's another shorter-term goal, it could be, ""I want to buy a new football,"" or, ""I want to celebrate by buying something that I really like."" And that's the way, I think, maybe, to get people delaying buying something today with buying something even nicer a little bit down the line. So, work ethic is a topic that comes up a lot. Certainly with your parents, Depression-era, and being around there, is an important thing. I'll ask this question, and I'll share an anecdote with somebody here. One of the Hartzell kids' favorite thing to do is, when we get snow around here, which isn't very often, they've realized that's actually money laying around on the sidewalk -- Kobliner: I made so much money shoveling snow. Hartzell: Yeah! And there are a lot of people in our neighborhood that are old or don't want to shovel their own snow, so as soon as the snow hits they're out early, the crack of dawn, and shoveling snow in driveways. And one of their friends happened to be over and found out about this, and they were like -- Kobliner: Uh oh, competition. Hartzell: ""This is great, there's money out there waiting to be shoveled up."" Kobliner: Literally. Hartzell: So, they went out and knocked on door around their neighborhood, and one gentleman in the house came out and was so amazed, he said, ""I've been waiting,"" he happens to own a business, owns a company, and he said, ""I've been waiting for 10 years for some kid in our neighborhood to come around and ask me if he wants to shovel my snow. So, I'm going to pay you to shovel the driveway, and here's a $100 tip."" And they were like, oh my gosh! This was unbelievable for them. So, the question for you is about work ethic. Are we making kids lazy today? Are we enabling them to be lazy? Or is that just my impression, that kids are different today than they were maybe a long time ago? Kobliner: I love that story. That's a great story. I made a bundle. I remember so clearly. It was like, $5. They would ask how much do you charge, and we're like, ""Well, whatever you think,"" and that was a mistake because people would say, ""Oh, $2,"" and we were sweating. But, I think that today, take high school. If you look at the statistics, it's not that kids necessarily have that much more homework, at least according to the research I've looked at, although I think my kids have so much more homework than I did back in high school. But the pressures to do well, to take SAT prep courses, to take SAT II prep courses, all these things that didn't exist. When I was working, I had four jobs in high school, I worked at a diner, I worked at a grocery store, I worked at a pharmacy, and I think that there are more pressures and there are more demands on kids' time, the idea that you need to be on a team, all these resume-building items. And, also, we know, in some ways, it makes logical sense, because research shows that if a kid works over 10 to 15 hours a week in high school, kids who work more than that are likely to not graduate from high school, they're more likely to not graduate -- in other words, it's OK to work around 10 to 15 hours a week, but once you pass that mark, that's a dangerous sign, if your kid is working much more than that, because they're not spending enough time on their school work. But I do think working over the summer, the internship versus paying summer camp job that your kids are doing -- I think it's smart what you're doing because you're starting younger. And I think when kids are in middle school and high school, having those summer jobs, it is important. But the year or two before high school, I don't know what you would do, if your kid either had an internship working in a lab with a scientist or whatever, versus working bagging groceries. As a parent, it's a tricky equation to figure out. Hartzell: Yeah, it's definitely a balance, for sure. I know we're getting ready to go on a family vacation here in a couple of days to Europe, and our kid missed out on an internship that he got for going, because we're going to be away. Kobliner: Can I come? [laughs] Hartzell: But, you have to balance some of those things out. On investing, and you've talked about mutual funds and indexing and keeping your costs low, we totally agree with that and love that idea. You didn't seem as enamored with owning individual stocks for children, so I wanted to talk a little bit about that. My kids own stocks, they have their own portfolio, and I think it's fun to follow individual companies. You learn a lot of lessons around those. What are your thoughts on owning individual stocks versus an index fund or an ETF or something like that? Hartzell: Yeah. And low expense ratio, as you mentioned. You get exposure right away off the bat to all those 500 companies. Kobliner: Right, diversification, exactly. Hartzell: We also like the idea, and I think a fun thing to do, sometimes, for kids, when they own some stock, is go to an annual meeting and make that an event and have it fun. Kobliner: Isn't he a fun dad? [laughs] Hey, kids! Hartzell: Usually those annual meetings are on weekdays and you get out of school, so that's a bonus right there. And some of them actually serve chocolate covered strawberries and things afterwards, so there's some rewards in there. So, let's talk a little bit more here about, how can we make money just fun? I think that's one of the things, my oldest son is 16, he's taking a course online on personal finance, he doesn't exactly enjoy it. This is the same person who goes to an annual meeting. He'll tell you everything about Apple, he knows everything about them. But it's just not that fun. How do you put the fun back in finance, how can we do that? Hartzell: Thank you. Kobliner: He's 87. But, that idea of, this is something that's important. And there's no question your kids are going to grow up and say, ""This is something that's important. Lord knows he pretended to like all those annual meetings."" [laughs] To make dad happy. But that's setting the tone for what you think is important as a parent, and that does so much, it goes such a long way. Hartzell: Speaking of not real. College is one of the most expensive things most people will buy. To a lot of them, it doesn't seem like a real expense, a lot of them will borrow an immense amount of money to go there. You talk positively about college, too, about how important it is to get an education for your future earnings potential. So, the question for you is, how much is college worth? An Ivy League school nowadays is probably north of $300,000 if you want to do four years of school. As good consumers, as frugal coupon clippers and everything else, what's the amount that somebody should be willing to pay when they're looking around at schools? What's the right amount? Kobliner: I think this is a huge issue, and more and more, hopefully, I don't think it'll happen in the next 3.5 to 4 years, but I think paying attention to the cost of college. One rule of thumb that I heard of from this guy Mark Kantrowitz, who's this guru on student loans, is, don't have your kid borrow more than the first year's income. If the kid makes $40,000, try not to have him or her borrow more than $40,000. Which is still a big chunk of money. The average right now is $37,000. The median -- it's hard to get the numbers exactly, which in itself is a crime, that we don't have really good statistics -- is $20,000 for kids graduating from college. And the reliance of private student loans, which is only going to get worse because the rules have already been loosened up, that private student loans are usually much higher interest rates than federal student loans, which are still about 4-4.25% right now. Private student loans can be double digits, 15-16%, and they're harder to pay back as well. And I think, we're getting to, I'll meet someone who says, ""I'm a philosophy major."" I mean was an English major at Brown, don't get me wrong. But I think there really was, back in the day, you could be a great writer and come out and get a job. Or start The Motley Fool. [laughs] What was your major? Tom Gardner: English. Kobliner: English! Woo! [laughs] Hartzell: I was sociology. Kobliner: Ah, there you go! But I think it's much more difficult now for kids, and grad school. So many young people are thinking, ""I'm going to grad school, they would be like $200,000 to get my PhD in philosophy."" And as much as that's brilliant, there are no jobs. Even if you come out of Harvard philosophy school, if there's such a thing, there's still one or two jobs in the whole country. So, you have to be much more pragmatic. It makes me so sad, I've met so many parents over the last year who say, ""We scrimped and saved because our kid got into this school, and we thought it was so great, but after the first year our kid was miserable, we forgot to include travel costs, and we're going to send them to the local public school and we realized we had three more kids down the line."" It's so expensive and so mystifying, the whole financial aid form. And I'm a little bit depressed by this because when I was on President Obama's Council, they really made an effort, and Arne Duncan, who's the education secretary, really tried to make the FAFSA form, the free financial aid form, a little simpler. And they really tried to take some steps. But, it's really hard for parents. Hartzell: And a lot of kids get in -- I paid a visit to my financial aid office where I went to undergraduate school and asked them a little bit about what they see coming through the office, what are the challenges and problems? And they were saying, it used to be that parents would come in and co-sign for these loans, but now they aren't, because although the parents earn in plenty to co-sign, they have a lot of debt, so they're not co-signing. And I think a lot of the students don't necessarily realize, these aren't loans you can walk away from. They're going to be with you a long time. Over $1 trillion in student debt now, I think being pragmatic probably makes sense. You have a great point that I love in the book. It's called your 10 investment rules. I'm not going to go through all 10 of those, but if you could just riff on a couple of those I'd be interested to hear them. One is, you don't need to be a perfect investor to be a good investor. What do you mean by that? Kobliner: I think it's something I've heard throughout my 30 years writing about personal finance. What? It's been 30 years doing this? I'd better be damn good at it. [laughs] But, I think it's that, if you have money in the market -- you need to have money in the stock market. And whether you feel like, ""I'm really good at this, picking stocks,"" just putting some money in the stock market, ideally it might be in an index fund, you will do better than not being in the market at all. And as the saying goes, perfection is the enemy of the good, people are like ""Oh, I don't know, I'm not sure, I'm not going to sign up for a 401(k) because I don't really know what investment to choose,"" that procrastination, life goes on and you miss out. So, I think just making sure you're in the stock market, and making a choice, and hopefully a low-cost one. We know, research shows, it's much better than staying out of it completely. Hartzell: We see that with a lot of new investors, that fear of failure. And I think of it like the person who has all straight A's never want to get a B, they never want to fail. And the reality is, in investing, if you're the best in the world, you're going to be wrong 40% of the time. It's OK. It's OK to buy a stock that goes down or doesn't work out, because of the successes you're going to have over the course of your lifetime are going to far outweigh some of those losses. So, that fear of failure is something we talk a lot about here at The Fool. Kobliner: At least, statistically speaking. We don't know, we can't promise for the future of stocks or the stock market. But we know, if we use past history, as a group of stocks, predictably, we think it will do better over the long time. I meet so many people who might get a financial, personal finance, in your 20s and 30s, and you meet people in their 40s and 50s, and now I met someone who was 60s, and they were like ""I read your book when I was younger."" I'm like, am I 112 years old? How does that math work? But people have said, they did put a little bit in. And I said, ""Put 10%, just put 10%, I know you can afford it, just do it."" And then they said, and I'm sure you get the same thing, ""I look back and I have hundreds of thousands of dollars that I wouldn't have otherwise."" And I think of it like, you drink three cups of coffee a day and you cut back to two, and the first week you have headaches and it's so hard, but after a while, it's OK. I think the same with money, you just force yourself, if you earn $20,000, $50,000, $200,000, you have to put 10% away. And your lifestyle, just live off the rest, the 90%, and your lifestyle adjusts, and you don't buy certain things, and it works out. And I think that mentality is just important. Hartzell: Another rule is, be lazy and trade less. Does it pay to be lazy? Hartzell: Yeah. And one of the dangers of the ETFs now, which proliferate all over the place is, you can buy and trade them like stocks, which is a double-edged sword for a lot of us, because we see people trading in and out of sectors and doing all those things that hurt them in stocks, but now they can do them in ETFs and they feel safer, but it's not necessarily safer because they're doing the same thing, you're churning them, you're paying commission. Kobliner: Not at all. You just buy the broad-based index, and you put maybe 20% of it internationally. I do think that money is one of those things that, you can be lazy. You can set it and forget it, putting whatever you can into your company 401(k) and making sure that over time that you put the maximum in, or putting money into an index fund. I think those are those set it and forget it things, and they're so beneficial for people. And it's counterintuitive. You think the smart people are actively trading. No, actually, they're doing worse. Hartzell: There's one point in this book that made me a little bit sad. I have a daughter, she's in the middle, 14 years old. You mentioned that parents or more open and more likely to talk to their boys about money and finance than they are to their daughters. And one of the things we see when I go out and talk to colleges, if you go to an investing club, it's probably 80-90% males. We see, not to that great of a degree, across our services. We certainly see more males that are interested in money. So, my question is, do we just not talk to the girls about money and finances? Or is it that we need to talk to them in a different way, maybe, than we talk to boys about money and finance? Hartzell: I have a couple more questions, and I want to do a short section on buy, sell, or hold, and then we'll take any questions from people in the audience. In your opinion, as an expert in this field, what's the most important thing that we can do as parents to teach our children? What's the most important thing? If you had to take one thing away, go home and do this with your kids, what would that be? Kobliner: I would say, no matter your child's age, teach them that credit card debt is a bad thing. I just heard that Warren Buffett says that, too. I wish he would stop copying me. It's, the notion that, if you have a credit card, and there's certainly less credit card debt, like I said, among young people, because they couldn't get credit cards in high school, the rules changed in 2009, you had to either have an income or be 21, or have a parent co-sign to get a credit card. Which is a mistake, never co-sign a credit card with your kid. But, I think, teaching a kid, do not spend more than you have in your savings, do not buy things you cannot afford, is a concept that people still don't get. And I think that's a lesson that I knew, by osmosis coming from parents who were Depression-generation, and my father said, he's 87 years, so, I don't know how long he's had a credit card, but he never paid a late payment, he always paid in full. I think, if you have a credit card that's charging 15%, paying it off is equivalent of earning 15% guaranteed on your money after taxes. And that's still basically the best. You can't get 15% guaranteed after taxes anywhere, except a 401(k) with matching, which is 100%. Hartzell: And stocks have only done about 9% over their history. Kobliner: Right. So, don't get into credit card debt. Teaching it to kids. Because, I think kids see it as magic. ""My parents swoosh this card and they get something."" And it's very confusing for kids, and that's debit cards, but I think credit is really such an insidious thing, credit cards can be so problematic for people down the line, that I would say, that would be it, if I had to take just one financial lesson. Hartzell: On the flip side, the mistakes. We all make mistakes as parents in different things. What's the biggest mistake that you see across parents that they need to eliminate in order to help their children be better with their finances? Kobliner: I think it's lying. [laughs] Whether you have a lot of money and you don't want to confront it because you don't want your kids to know how you feel, or you have very little money, so you might overcompensate, and think, ""I'm going to buy my kid that because I don't want them to miss out."" I think both of those are problems. You don't have to tell your kids everything. You don't have to tell them your income, who makes more, mommy or daddy. I don't think you have to tell them how much you have in your 401(k). There are a lot of questions you don't have to answer, and I have a list of them in my book. But I do think we have to try to be someone honest about the things we do answer. As simple as, you walk in a store, ""Can I have that?"" ""Oh, I don't have any money on me,"" and then you use your card and they see you using your card and they're like, ""Wait, you don't have money on you."" A woman I know told me a story where, just recently, she went out with her kids and forgot her credit card and she had cash and they went to the Gap and they went out to lunch and they said, ""Can we go to the movies, mom?"" And she said, ""I ran out of money."" And they were like, ""Does that mean we're homeless? What do you mean, we've run out of money."" They were little kids, they didn't get that concept of running out. Hartzell: That's great. We'll take your questions here. I have a quick round. We call it a buy, sell, or hold round here. I'll throw out the idea, and you'll let me know whether you going to buy, sell or hold. The first one is autonomous driving vehicles. Would you buy them, sell them, or hold them? In our near future. Kobliner: [laughs] I don't know! What's the expense ratio? Buck Hartzell: Google, Apple? Kobliner: Sure, I guess, it's a good thing to hold. Hartzell: OK, she's a hold on that one. Bitcoin, or other blockchain types of new currencies are you a buy, sell, or hold on these new currencies? Kobliner: I would only say buy because I think they've had such a bad time and they're probably down and probably eventually, maybe, so it's a value -- I don't know any of this. I don't know. Index funds. Ask me another one. Hartzell: OK, the last one. A degree at the University of Michigan for $250,000. Are you going to buy, sell, or hold the Wolverines? Kobliner: I would get a scholarship. My dad, I look back, he got a 0% interest rate loan from this thing called the Hebrew Loan Society. I don't even know what that is, but they gave a 0% interest rate loan for my college. He was a veteran, so he got a VA scholarship for me. I think getting creative and trying to really figure out how you can not get yourself or your kids into huge debt. I'm afraid of the parents who borrow for their kids' college, and the PLUS loan, the parent loan, which allows you to borrow as much as you can, as much as you need. It's really a problem. So, I don't know. I'm like a bad juror, I can't say guilty or not guilty unless I get to -- Hartzell: Well, I'm going to say that's a sell, because Andy Cross, our chief investment officer, went to Michigan, and Ron Gross's daughter, who sits right behind me, is going to Michigan. So I'm going to say it's a sell. Kobliner: It's a great school. Hartzell: No. My wife went to Ohio State, they're rivals. So, that's it for buy, sell or hold. Questions from anybody else in the audience about how to make your children money geniuses? Yes? Audience: You said one of the biggest influences is osmosis, kids watching what you're doing. But if the osmosis is of the wrong kind, how could I as another relative try to overcome that, especially when they live on the other side of the country? Hartzell: Let me ask that, in case they don't hear it. Sometimes kids don't have the right role models what if you're a relative, but not there with them all the time? How can you help out? What can you do to be a good role model from a distance? Kobliner: Right, that's a great question. And you're right, that's an inherent contradiction. You don't need to be a money genius to make your kid a money genius. But it sure is helpful if you're good at money and responsible, to make that. I think, whatever chance you get, talking to the kid. You can't bad mouth their parents, because that's a disaster. But you can say, ""I've been saving."" Again, anecdotes and stories. And saying, ""I'm going to set up a college plan for you,"" and the reason is, we know from research, and this is my favorite piece of research, that when you tell a child that you're saving for their college, they are seven times more likely to go to college, regardless of how much money is in that account. So whether you have $100 or $100,000, kids are more likely. It's the expectation, that you know someone believes in you and is saving for your college. And that's very powerful, and I know of a lot of philanthropic efforts that are starting with that, the notion that the kid knows someone is saving for them and they're more likely to go. And hopefully, they won't get into debt in the process. But, I think, using that, whether, these kids are not in college yet, and encouraging them to, you're going to match, for every $1 they put in, you'll put in $1 or $0.50. Maybe that does go back to making it fun. Having it more like a game. You put in a certain amount and I'll match it. And I think that can be very motivating to kids, without making it like, ""I think your parents are doing a lousy job."" Hartzell: Other questions. Tom? Gardner: We have Foley these two days, she's a 10 year old -- Kobliner: I met her already. She's a little intimidating, but she's very nice. Gardner: A soccer star. She's also somebody who saves what she earns. But, what about the child that saves too much, who maybe doesn't learn how to spend or what to spend on? [...] How do you encourage a child who's very thoughtfully saving, which is so rare, to also use that? Kobliner: To spend it. Hartzell: I should say, the question is, stop and smell the roses. Foley is a great example of somebody who's diligently saving all her money. How do we also enjoy it? Kobliner: OK, can I just ask whose kid is Foley? I met her during my interview, my podcast. Do you know what you're saving for, Foley? Or are you just saving? Good for you, that's awesome. Hopefully you'll hire me one day. [laughs] I'll come to you and you'll be like, ""No, I'm sorry."" I've gotten that question a lot. My husband was worried about our own kids. I would bring them to talks since they were little. My little one was like, ""Oh, I'm so worried!"" I was like, ""What's the matter?"" ""I don't know if I can afford health insurance, mommy, it's so expensive!"" when he was like six. It really was that level. So, in the end, that instinct to save money, at some point, breaks. I think some little kids love to just save. And I don't think that they have to spend when they're little, because instinct kicks in at one point, whether it's when they're in college or out of college. So, I don't worry about that. I look at all three of our kids, they were all voracious savers, and now, my oldest is 21 -- although, one thing that I think we did do well is, for college, we do pay for college for her, and she does work a very little bit in college, but, we've given her spending money, but it's a set amount, and we said, ""This is money."" And sometimes I'm very cynical about it, because I think, when I was a kid, I had four jobs, I worked at the Brown cafeteria, I worked in the Brown student agency doing dry cleaning and so on. And sometimes you have to step beyond yourself and say, ""My kids, we're going to give them some spending money, but that's it. We pay for your books, your college, your healthcare. If you want to take an Uber rather than the New York subway or walk to class, that comes from your money. If you want to go on a vacation with your friends who live in Australia,"" which she wanted to do, she figured out the cheapest flights. So, giving kids ownership of some money as they get older, I think, it makes them -- this is sort of the opposite of what you're asking, but it makes them more careful about spending. But, I've never met a 30 year old -- I mean, I guess there's a rare case of the hoarder who never spends money. But, I think life gets so tempting. Gardner: Why are we laughing in the front row? Audience: Because she's here. Hartzell: Next year is the year, Megan. Kobliner: I think it's great. I would embrace your hoarding tendencies. If you're saving, you have a chunk of money that, one day, there will be a reason. Do you own a home? Audience: No, not anymore. Kobliner: Not anymore. But you will one day. I just think that, having a huge amount of savings is never a bad thing. I was just on a show, I was on ABC or CBS this morning, and the woman said, the host, she was so cute, she took off her shoes and like, ""Look! $24, my shoes! And I got them 20% off!"" And I was like, ""Good for you!"" And she said, ""Do you know why my nail polish just chipped? Because I'm saving money!"" I'm like, ""Good for you!"" We save money, and there will be something that comes along, and you'll know when you want to buy it. I don't know, I have a bias toward saving. Hartzell: There'll be something you want, Foley. I trust you. It could be a shiny gold fidget spinner. Someday. OK, great. Thank you very much, Beth, for joining us. Kobliner: Thank you! These were great questions. Hartzell: And thank you all for coming today. ","

Emma Court,07132017,MarketWatch,07062017,"Published: July 12, 2017 8:54 a.m. ET Programs that circumvent the coupons target high-cost drugs and are expected to become popular By Co-pay coupons offered by drug makers are controversial. Where patients see a way to reduce or eliminate the out-of-pocket cost of their medications, health plans see a menace that pushes patients to take more expensive drugs. The issue has prompted U.S. government scrutiny, led federal health programs to bar those they insure from using the coupons, and even caused states to limit or consider limiting their use. Health insurers are also firing back, with new programs that target co-pay coupons for pricey drugs. The changes should help health plans achieve a long-desired outcome: curbing rising drug costs. And, because the programs take advantage of co-pay coupons, they could become a lot more expensive for drug manufacturers to offer, potentially changing or even endangering the coupons themselves. Though the new coupon-curtailment programs are in their early days, patients are already paying the price, patient advocates charge. Many of the affected drugs don’t have lower-cost alternatives, they say, and are financially out of reach without co-pay coupons. “This is potentially catastrophic for a lot of rare-disease patients,” said Kollet Koulianos, the National Hemophilia Foundation’s senior director of payer relations. “The cost could prevent them from accessing their medications, period,” which could put at risk the medications’ required regular use. Read:  The real reason drug makers offer discount cards (you’ll pay eventually) A contentious history, and a solution Co-pay coupons have been offered for at least a decade, experts say, and the growth of coupon programs has accelerated in recent years. To some extent, the co-pay coupons work just like any other coupon, by reducing how much a consumer pays at checkout. They can be found in such places as a doctor’s office, online or even in an advertisement. But co-pay coupons also differ in an important way. Because of health insurance, most patients only see a fraction of the cost of their medication. A co-pay coupon works only on that piece, not the drug’s total price tag. Drug makers say that coupons play a critical financial role, especially as health plans increasingly shift costs to consumers. Under a high-deductible health plan, for example, a patient might have to pay $6,000 out-of-pocket before his or her health plan picks up the tab. But others, including industry players and a growing body of research, say that the coupons instead elevate health-care costs. Generally, the more expensive a drug, the more a patient’s wallet feels it. By cutting down or eliminating out-of-pocket costs, coupons subvert those financial incentives to choose the cheaper drug, health insurers and others argue. When co-pay coupons were offered on 23 drugs facing generic competition for the first time between 2007 and 2010, total drug spending increased an estimated $700 million to $2.7 billion more than it would have without coupons, according to a New England Journal of Medicine article published last year. Related:  Why did these generic drugs’ prices jump as much as 85%? Coupons are a marketing expense for drug makers — and one that’s intended to cheat health insurers and employers — in the view of Adriane Fugh-Berman, a professor of pharmacology and physiology at Georgetown University. “It’s a great investment for pharmaceutical companies. If your drug costs $1,000 and the co-pay is preventing patients from getting it, then paying $50 still means you’re making $950 off that prescription,” Fugh-Berman said. “It’s very cost-effective for pharmaceutical companies.” Coupon use also makes it appear that a consumer has met his or her deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. For example, a consumer who uses a $6,000 coupon may appear to have met her $6,000 deductible, though she has in reality paid nothing out of pocket. Related:  This is what your health insurance looks like this year Usually processed through separate systems, coupons are “very hard for us to study,” said Chad Murphy, vice president of pharmacy and strategic programs for Premera Blue Cross, a nonprofit health-insurance company based in Washington state. “We’ve been looking for a solution [for years],” he said. (Premera Blue Cross hasn’t implemented a program to rein in coupon use but is evaluating them, Murphy told MarketWatch.) All of this comes at a time when drug spending is “increasing at a greater rate than any other health-care cost that [employers] have,” said Ellen Kelsay, chief strategy officer at the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers on health-policy issues in Washington, D.C. That trend is especially true of costly brand-name drugs, she said, many of them specialty drugs that treat complicated or chronic diseases. Companies have previously tried blocking the use of co-pay coupons for certain medications and at certain pharmacies. But the latest approaches have taken a very different tack by instead taking advantage of the coupons, just not to the benefit of consumer out-of-pocket costs.

                                   — among the largest U.S. pharmacy-benefit managers — seem poised to take off industrywide, experts told MarketWatch. The most promising program targets high-cost specialty drugs, using the co-pay coupon to offset the drug’s total cost instead of the consumer’s co-pay. Pharmacy-benefit managers are able to do this, and to offer the program for free, by requiring that health plans exclusively deal with a certain specialty drug pharmacy. Before the program, a patient using a coupon would very quickly meet her health plan’s out-of-pocket requirements, at which point the coupon would no longer be necessary. Under the change, however, the coupon could be used many more times and the patient would pay more out of pocket, making the co-pay coupon more expensive for the drug maker and reducing the health plan’s total drug costs by an estimated 1% to 3%. The program has attracted a good deal of health-plan interest, experts told MarketWatch. See:  Drug stocks surge on report that President Trump plans to ease industry regulations Prime Therapeutics, a pharmacy-benefit manager owned by 14 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, began rolling out such a program at the start of this year across several states, according to Chief Clinical Officer David Lassen. “That deductible is meant to be applied. That member is meant to pay something out of pocket,” he said. “By ensuring that that coupon does not apply to the out-of-pocket max, we’re helping to ensure that we’re lowering overall health-care costs.” But for some individuals with rare diseases, this has made it harder to afford their medications. Koulianos, of the National Hemophilia Foundation, said that she knows of about 50 people affected, and that the number is growing. “While we agree that this is in theory a good mechanism to help patients consider, ‘I better take the lower-cost drug’… in this case there is no lower-cost drug,” she said. If patients can’t afford their medications, they could end up in the hospital, or worse, she said. Another new co-pay coupon-circumvention program has a similar goal — taking advantage of drug makers’ coupons — but approaches it differently. The manufacturer coupons are often valued at far more each year or per drug than patients pay out of pocket. So pharmacy-benefit managers adjust the co-pay amount patients pay for certain drugs up to coupon thresholds, to take advantage of the coupon’s total possible value. Only certain drugs will be affected, with expensive cancer and hepatitis C drugs likely targeted, amounting to estimated drug-cost savings of 2% to 4%. But because the program requires making changes to a health plan, it’s expected to have reduced or limited interest. It also raises questions about how those who don’t use co-pay coupons might be affected. Still, some say that, like an endless game of whack-a-mole, the battle over co-pay coupons is unlikely to end anytime soon. “While there may be countermeasures put into place, it will just continue to evolve,” said Premera Blue Cross’s Murphy. “I don’t know if we’ll ever fully solve the issue.” Express Scripts declined to make a representative available for comment. UnitedHealth did not return MarketWatch’s request for comment.

Emma Court,07132017,MarketWatch,07062017,"Published: July 12, 2017 8:55 a.m. ET Gonorrhea is ‘a very smart bug,’ mutating to resist antibiotic treatments By World Health Organization experts warn that it’s “only a matter of time” before the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea is resistant to all current antibiotic treatments. Three cases of untreatable gonorrhea have already been documented in certain countries, the United Nations health agency said, and gonorrhea is already widely resistant to older, cheaper antibiotics. Meanwhile, just three new antibiotics are being developed, “with obviously no guarantee these drugs will make it out of the pipeline,” said Manica Balasegaram, director of the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership. “The situation is fairly grim.” Gonorrhea resistance has become such a big problem because of the bacterial infection itself, which is a “very smart bug,” in the words of the WHO’s Teodora Wi, that’s able to mutate in response to new antibiotics. That tendency is exacerbated by other, outside factors, including incorrect usage or overuse of common antibiotics and use of poor-quality antibiotics, said Wi, the medical officer of the WHO’s Department of Reproductive Health and Research. See:  Would you get tested for STDs by mail? Some millennials are doing just that Gonorrhea affects an estimated 78 million new people a year, and rates appears to be on the rise. In the U.S. About 820,000 new cases are reported annually, according to Planned Parenthood. Left untreated, the bacterial infection can have serious health consequences, including fertility problems and a painful condition called pelvic inflammatory disease in women. Even those who have been treated for gonorrhea can be re-infected. Related:  Untreatable form of gonorrhea may show up in the U.S. This isn’t the first time the WHO has warned about untreatable gonorrhea. About a year ago, the health agency advised doctors to treat the infection using two antibiotics, ceftriaxone — one of two last-resort treatments — and azithromycin, as part of a broader warning about antibiotic resistance to three STIs. It’s also likely that antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea is more common than statistics show. Ten high-income countries have reported cases of gonorrhea resistant to the last-line treatment cefixime, while resistance to another last-line treatment, ceftriaxone, is less commonly reported, according to a report recently published in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS Medicine. This suggests that resistance may be occurring in other countries that have less established disease surveillance systems, Wi said. Read:  3 questions to ask before taking antibiotics Of the three new antibiotics being developed, one just finished late-stage clinical trials, and the other two have each completed a midstage trial, according to the WHO’s Thursday release. However, drug makers tend to make relatively few investments in antibiotic development. Because antibiotic regimens are relatively short and gonorrhea and other infections can quickly become resistant to them, the drugs are seen as less lucrative, according to the WHO and other health groups. The WHO and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative launched the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, of which Balasegaram is the director, to address precisely this issue. The partnership is working with the privately held Entasis Therapeutics Inc. to co-develop the antibiotic zoliflodacin in a late-stage global clinical trial, the group and company announced late Thursday. Read:  There’s only one way to prevent sexual transmission of Zika — and it’s not special condoms The drug is the only new antibiotic being developed specifically to treat gonorrhea, they said. In addition to new treatments, many new tools and tactics will be needed to prevent gonorrhea, the health groups said Thursday, including greater use of condoms, better diagnostic testing, improved health-worker education and, in light of evolving antibiotic resistance to drugs, a vaccine.

Typically that process would take 11 days, says Glenn Shapiro, Allstate’s executive vice president of claims. Speed is important because roofing contractors are booked quickly after a big storm hits. “We like the idea of getting our customers to the front of the line,” Shapiro says. Using drones is also safer for insurance company employees. “Giving our adjusters a drone that keeps them on the ground may be more expensive than giving them a ladder, but even one adjuster falling off a roof is one too many,” says Gary Sullivan, vice president of property and subrogation claims for Erie Insurance. Drones can’t be used everywhere. Companies can’t fly drones near airports and military bases. And they’re not the right tool for every type of claim. Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a consumer advocacy group, says drone footage could be helpful to supplement property inspections but should not replace physical inspections. Bach acknowledges she’s not an expert on drones’ capabilities, but she questions whether a drone could capture the extent of damage the way a human inspector could. “Hail damage can be subtle even when it’s serious,” she says. Insurers by law must get customers’ permission to fly drones on their properties. And Federal Aviation Administration regulations require operators to keep drones within sight. Shapiro of Allstate says an adjuster will get on a roof if a customer wants a traditional inspection or if the drone pictures aren’t sufficient. Insurers began using drones for claim inspections in the past couple of years, especially after new FAA rules for commercial drones went into effect in August 2016. The new rules make it easier to fly legally; drone operators no longer have to have a pilot’s license, for example. The nation’s large home insurance companies are in varying stages of rolling out drones. Ragone says the drone inspection captured the video and pictures for processing his claim quickly. “The whole thing was interesting, and everything was pretty quick,” he says. “We had an estimate for repairs that day.” More from NerdWallet: Barbara Marquand is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.

,07202017,Reuters,07132017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - For seven years, U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell vowed to slay Obamacare if only his Republican Party controlled both chambers of Congress and the White House. Pull it out “root and branch,” he pledged. The 75-year-old Senate majority leader now has that luxury. But instead of basking in the glow of his first major legislative victory in the Donald Trump era, McConnell is what a source close to the majority leader calls “the man in the middle in an impossible spot.” Late on Monday and again on Tuesday, after a long struggle, McConnell’s efforts to repeal all or portions of former President Barack Obama’s landmark 2010 Affordable Care Act and replace them with less expensive healthcare came crashing down. With 52 Republican senators in the 100-member chamber, McConnell could lose only two of his colleagues on any bill that was opposed by Democrats and still win with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote. Three times, he failed to muster the 50 supporters needed. The man who epitomized “the party of no” in Democrats’ eyes during Obama’s presidency, especially when he slammed the door in February 2016 on Merrick Garland’s Supreme Court nomination, fell victim to the “no” of fellow Republicans. “We finally get a chance to repeal and replace, and they don’t take advantage of it,” Trump, six months into his four-year presidential term, said on Tuesday. Across Washington, there was dismay Republicans could not deliver on a promise they assert helped them to assume control in January of Congress and the White House. “I am kind of shocked,” said Republican Representative Dave Brat, of the conservative firebrand House Freedom Caucus that has been a thorn in the side of the Republican establishment. His hand weakened, McConnell could be heading into fierce budget battles, a tax reform fight and a storm over legislation avoiding a government debt default that could shake global financial markets. The result has Democrats feeling emboldened 16 months before the next congressional elections. Around town, the sphinxlike McConnell is known as a master of Senate rules, able to outfox opponents, giving nothing away until he can strike at just the right moment. The senator’s leadership job, a position he yearned for in the years leading up to his 2015 ascension, does not appear to be in jeopardy. But this rocky run calls into question McConnell’s reputation as a master tactician and deal-maker that he earned as Republican minority leader under the Democratic Obama. It is “a real blow to Republicans in Congress generally and to leadership,” said former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Republican. More of the blame sits with the rank-and-file, Lott said. “The problem in Washington today is not lack of leadership. The problem is lack of followership.” Had McConnell succeeded, Lott said he would have been “considered a magician” given the inability of Republicans to coalesce around healthcare legislation for so many years. A Republican operative with ties to McConnell saw a possible silver lining: Failure to pass healthcare could boost chances for tax reform or infrastructure investment if Republicans felt it a more urgent political imperative to rack up a win for Trump before the November 2018 congressional elections. McConnell, a courtly Kentuckian who can appear at pains to speak to reporters nipping at his heels, won accolades in years past for cutting deals with Democrats to keep the government operating and making permanent most of former President George W. Bush’s tax cuts. Those deals involved giving voters government services and lower taxes. But Republican healthcare legislation involves taking something away from millions of lower-income people - their medical coverage. “In part they (Republicans) misunderstood how difficult it will be” to repeal and replace Obamacare, former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, a Democrat, said in a phone interview. Republican rhetoric against Obamacare was so “hyperbolic” it had to take priority early in Trump’s presidency, but senators lacked enthusiasm for legislation, said Daschle, who like Lott lobbies on behalf of healthcare interests. Once boxed into healthcare, McConnell took another controversial step, one that many Republicans questioned. Instead of developing a healthcare bill in public,  McConnell and his top aides, with the advice of a 13-member group of male senators, called the shots. McConnell said hearings were unnecessary, as healthcare policy had been intensively debated since Obama took office in 2009. He said he was listening to suggestions of all of his 51 fellow Republican senators. Many senators felt disconnected and tensions boiled over. As Monday wore on, matters only got worse for McConnell. Republican Senator Ron Johnson publicly accused him of “a real breach in trust” in hard-charging back-room negotiations. He threatened to withhold support for the bill. McConnell supporters argued that no matter how he handled the private negotiations, the Republican leader was dealt a difficult hand from the outset. “The majority leader is trying to keep all the frogs in the wheelbarrow and it’s a tough job but he’s doing a good job,” said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski. And then there was Trump. As McConnell struggled, the president was in France last week celebrating Bastille Day before jetting back to the United States to attend a tournament at his New Jersey golf course. He tweeted about his excitement at the tournament, his disgust with “fake news” and an investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election. Trump boasted that the White House “is functioning perfectly” and “I have very little time for watching T.V.” Missing, some Senate aides said, was Trump traveling the country in a serious effort to bolster support for McConnell’s efforts.

,07202017,Reuters,07132017,"ASPEN, Colorado (Reuters) - The Trump administration is developing the first comprehensive strategy to defend the United States against disease pandemics and biological attacks by terrorists, the top White House homeland security official said on Thursday. “We have not had as a country a comprehensive bio-defense strategy ever,” White House homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert told the annual Aspen Security Forum, in Aspen, Colorado. “It’s high time we had a bio-defense strategy.” The effort involves retired Admiral Tim Ziemer, who oversaw the Obama administration’s initiative to fight malaria in Africa, and the White House hopes to publish the new strategy “as soon as we can,” said Bossert, who provided no further details. Bossert noted that the Bush and Obama administrations took steps to address biological threats after letters containing anthrax spores were sent to two Democratic senators and several news organizations in the weeks following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The spores infected 22 people, five of whom died. But, he added, “There have been a lot of fits and starts in our investments.” “At this point, we need to look clear eyed at the fact that we may have a devastating pandemic influenza or an intentional anthrax attack,” said Bossert. He noted recent news reports that scientists in Canada used commercially available genetic material to construct the extinct horse pox virus, a relative of the small pox virus, which claimed tens of millions of lives before being wiped out. “That’s (horsepox) not going to kill any of us, but that suggests that somebody might now in the future possess the ability to produce synthetic small pox without a live virus and that scares me to death,” he said. The threat of disease pandemics demands global attention, he said. Some experts have criticized the Trump administration for seeking reductions in funding for global health programs that they contend would hurt the country’s ability to prevent and respond to biological threats like pandemics. Bossert, however, said that the administration plans to give “full-throated support” to the Global Health Security Agenda, a partnership of more than 50 nations and international organizations that works to build countries’ capacities to prevent and fight infectious diseases.

,07202017,Reuters,07132017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With talks to renegotiate the NAFTA trade pact just weeks away, U.S. farm groups and lawmakers from rural states are intensifying lobbying of President Donald Trump’s administration with one central message: leave farming out of it. Trump blames the North American Free Trade Agreement - the “worst trade deal ever” in his words - for millions of lost manufacturing jobs and promises to tilt it in America’s favor. But for U.S. farmers the 23-year old pact secures access to stable, lucrative markets in Mexico and Canada that now account for over a quarter of U.S. farm exports. Now they fear this access could become a bargaining chip in efforts to get a better deal for U.S. manufacturers. “Perhaps some other sectors of our economy are given better terms and in exchange for that agriculture tariffs would be reintroduced,” said Joe Schuele, a spokesman for the U.S. Meat Export Federation in Denver, Colorado. Another concern is that the mere uncertainty of open-ended trade talks could drive Mexico to alternative suppliers of grains, dairy products, beef and pork. Mexico became even more crucial after Trump’s pullout from a vast Pacific Rim trade pact negotiated under Barack Obama dashed farmers’ hopes of free access to more markets. Next week, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is due to outline the administration’s goals for the NAFTA talks to Congress and the farm lobby has turned up the heat in the past weeks to ensure that its interests will make Lighthizer’s list. Operating under the umbrella of the U.S. Food and Agriculture Dialogue for Trade, more than 130 commodity groups and agribusiness giants since Trump’s inauguration have been bombarding the new administration with phone calls and letters, public comments to USTR and face-to-face meetings with top officials who have Trump’s ear. “Our first ask is to do no harm,” said Cassandra Kuball, the head of the umbrella group. Lobbyists said that Lighthizer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have been receptive, but the wild card is how Trump ultimately will come down on the talks. They also wonder what concessions Mexico will seek from Washington in the talks due to start in mid-August. For example, U.S. cotton producers, marketers and shippers in mid-June warned the Trump administration that any weakening of NAFTA “would threaten the health of the U.S. industry and the jobs of the 125,000 Americans employed by it.” Annual U.S. farm exports to Mexico have grown from about $4 billion in 1994, when NAFTA began, to an estimated $18.5 billion this year. With Canada included, that number is forecast to reach $40 billion, quadrupling under NAFTA. Republican lawmakers from rural states that have backed Trump in the 2016 election have sought to leverage their political clout to press farmers’ case at a time when they struggle with low crop prices. Pat Roberts, Republican senator from Kansas, who chairs the Senate Agriculture Committee, said he used an unexpected invitation for a private White House meeting with Trump to plug in agriculture’s cause in NAFTA and beyond. “He (Trump) wanted to know what was happening in farmland,” Roberts said. “I told him we went through a very rough patch and if we did not have a strong, robust, predictable trade policy, it’s going to make life much more difficult in farm country,” Roberts said of the 45-minute meeting in late June. In May, 18 Republican senators, mainly from pro-Trump farming states, wrote the administration about the “tremendous growth” in U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada as a result of NAFTA. “Efforts to abandon the agreement or impose unnecessary restrictions on trade with our North American partners will have devastating economic consequences,” they warned. Trump’s pledges to crack down on immigration and calls for a wall along the border with Mexico also vex farm state lawmakers. “What I really need is a good, solid immigration system,” South Dakota Republican Senator Mike Rounds said. Given his state’s low unemployment rate of just around 2.8 percent, farmers and ranchers need better access to legal foreign labor, he said. Agriculture Secretary Perdue got a taste of farmers’ angst when met cattle ranchers in Nebraska on May 20. The event was held shortly after Washington agreed with China to resume beef exports, but some 60 ranchers who gathered at U.S. Senator Deb Fischer’s Sunny Slope Ranch quickly turned to NAFTA. “If the president wants to renegotiate that agreement with our neighbors and partners in Mexico and Canada please leave the ag portion of that discussion out,” said Pete McClymont, executive vice president of Nebraska Cattlemen, summarizing the discussion. While lobbying in Washington, some Republican lawmakers have also met with Mexico’s ambassador and U.S. farming representatives traveled south to assure their partners unsettled by Trump’s “America First” mantra. “The common comment is: ‘why are you here? The problem is not with us. The problem is in Washington. Why are you talking to us?’” said Tom Sleight, president and CEO of the U.S. Grains Council. “The new normal is that feed buyers, millers, grain buyers are actively looking at alternative sources,” he said. It will take months to find out how effective the lobbying was. Meantime, some are willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. Daryl Haack, a corn and soybean farmer from Primghar in northwest Iowa, like others fears retaliation from either Canada or Mexico, but is optimistic it will not come to that. “I think President Trump is a negotiator,” he said. “I think he runs bluffs. A lot of negotiators will do that.” ","

Philip Morris says in internal documents it wants to win the ""hearts and minds"" of smokers aged 18 to 24 in India. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi The tobacco giant is pushing Marlboros in colorful ads at kiosks and handing out free smokes at parties frequented by young adults - tactics that break Indiaâs anti-smoking laws, government officials say. Internal documents uncovered by Reuters illuminate the strategy. By ADITYA KALRA, PARITOSH BANSAL, TOM LASSETER and DUFF WILSON Filed July 18, 2017, 11 a.m. GMT NEW DELHIÂ â S. K. AroraÂ spent moreÂ than three years trudging through the Indian summer heat and monsoon rains to inspect tobacco kiosks across this sprawling megacity, tearing down cigarette advertisements and handing out fines to store owners for putting them up. But as fast as he removed the colorful ads, more appeared. The chief tobacco control officer at the DelhiÂ state government, Arora asked the major cigarette companies to put a stop to the cat-and-mouse routine. In official letters and face-to-face meetings, he told them Indiaâs tobacco control laws barred such public advertising and promotion of cigarettes. That included the Indian arm of Philip Morris International Inc, the worldâs largest publicly traded tobacco company. Early last year, Arora said, he met with a Philip Morris director for corporate affairsÂ in India, a man named R. Venkatesh, and told him the signs were an unequivocal violation of Indian law. Like other tobacco companies, Philip Morris kept up its ad blitz. Related content Part 1: Treaty Blitz Archive: The Philip Morris Files Video: Delhi raid Video: Marlboro parties Venkatesh says Philip Morris is doing nothing wrong. In response to questions from Reuters, he said the companyâs advertising is âcompliant with Indian lawâ and that Philip Morris has âfully cooperated with the enforcement authoritiesâ on the matter. But Indian government officials say Philip Morris is using methods that flout the nationâs tobacco-control regulations. These include tobacco shop displays as well as the free distribution of Marlboro â the worldâs best-selling cigarette brand â at nightclubs and bars frequented by young people. In internal documents, Philip Morris International is explicit about targeting the countryâs youth. A key goal is âwinning the hearts and minds of LA-24,â those between legal age, 18, and 24, according to one slide in a 2015 commercial review presentation. As with the point-of-sale ads at kiosks, public health officials say that giving away cigarettes is a violation of Indiaâs Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act and its accompanying rules. Philip Morrisâ marketing strategy for India, which relies heavily on kiosk advertising and social events, is laid out in hundreds of pages of internal documents reviewed by Reuters that cover the period from 2009 to 2016. In them, Philip Morris presents these promotions as key marketing activities. In recent years, they have helped to more than quadruple Marlboroâs market share in India, where the company is battling to expand its reach in the face of an entrenched local giant.Â Reuters is publishing a selection of those documents in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files.Â  Â  Â The companyâs goal is to make sure that âevery adult Indian smoker should be able to buy Marlboro within walking distance,â according to another 2015 strategy document. InÂ targeting young adults, Philip Morris is deploying a promotional strategy that it and other tobacco companies used in the United States decades ago. A studyÂ published in the American Journal of Public HealthÂ in 2002 found that during the 1990s,Â âtobacco industry sponsorship of bars and nightclubs increased dramatically, accompanied by cigarette brand paraphernalia, advertisements, and entertainment events in bars and clubs.â With cigarette sales declining in many countries, Philip Morris has identified India, population 1.3 billion, as a market with opportunity for significant growth. âIndia remains a high potential market with huge upside with cigarette market still in infancy,â says a 2014 internal document. According to government data, India has about 100 million smokers. Of those, about two-thirds smoke traditional hand-rolled cigarettes.Â Tobacco use kills more than 900,000 people a year in India, and the World Health Organization estimates that tobacco-related diseases cost the country about $16 billion annually. Philip Morris is not alone in using marketing methods that Indian officials say are illegal. The countryâs largest cigarette maker, ITC Ltd, uses similar tactics, such as advertising at kiosks. British American Tobacco Plc and Indian state-run companies have large, passive stakes in ITC, which controls about 80 percent of the market. Tobacco-control officerÂ Arora, a short, mustachioed man with a gruff demeanor,Â sent a letter to Philip MorrisÂ and other tobacco companiesÂ in mid-April, giving them until the end of the month to remove all advertisements. âLegal action will be initiated against the companyâ if it did not comply, he wrote in the letters, copies of which were reviewed by Reuters. A day after Aroraâs deadline passed, he and his team conducted a raid in an affluent area of cafes and coffee shopsÂ in New Delhi that showed his letters did not have the desired effect. On that hot afternoon in May, the team cut down about a dozen advertisements for Marlboro and various ITC brands. As word of the raid spread, worried vendors covered their ads with newspapers or took them down. One kiosk owner, Rakesh Kumar Jain, removed his Marlboro ads before Aroraâs team arrived. JainÂ said the signs had been put upÂ by Philip Morris representatives. In return, he said, he received free cigarettes each month worth about 2,000 rupees (about $30). Jain knew that putting up the posters was illegal, but they helped improve sales, he said. About a dozen kiosk owners interviewed by Reuters said that tobacco companies paid them a monthly fee for advertisements and product displays, with the amount determined by factors such as location, volume of business and type of promotional material. In payment receipts seen by Reuters, Philip Morrisâ India unit promised to pay 500 Indian rupees ($7.50) a month to a cigarette seller with a small roadside kiosk in New Delhi for putting up Marlboro ads. The receiptsÂ were signed by a company representative. During the raid, fines were issued to some vendors, many of them repeat offenders, and they were threatened with court action if the ads went up again. Like Philip Morris, ITC says that it is in full compliance with Indiaâs 2003 tobacco control law. If it wasnât, the companyÂ saidÂ in a statement to Reuters, then âthe relevant government authorities would have initiated action.â Since Aroraâs threat of legal action in April, there are fewer Philip Morris advertisements outside cigarette shops in the capital. But both Philip Morris and ITC say that advertising inside a shop is allowed. Â âAdvertisements of tobacco products at the entrance and inside the shops selling tobacco products are clearly and categorically permitted,âÂ ITC said in response to questions from Reuters. Arora, however, said all advertising is prohibited - âThere are no two ways about it,â he insisted - but he canât start legal proceedings until getting further guidance from the federal government.Â He has yet to receive an answer. Federal health officials say in interviews that the ads are out of bounds.Â Amal Pusp, a director for tobacco control at the health ministry, told Reuters that âthere is no confusionâ: All advertisements - inside and outside shops - are illegal. Â The 2003 law allows tobacco companies to advertiseÂ at shops, but subsequent rules issued by the government prohibit it. âIndia remains a high potential market with huge upside with cigarette market still in infancy.â In 2004, India became one of the first countries to ratify the World Health Organizationâs Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) treaty. TheÂ pact has 181 membersÂ and contains a raft of anti-smoking provisions, including tobacco taxes, warning labels on cigarette packs and advertising bans. The country enacted its national tobacco control law the year before ratifying the FCTC, and since then the government has added rules to strengthen the law in line with the treatyâs provisions. The health ministry published rules in 2005Â that banned any display of brand names, pack images or promotional messages. The rule specified that tobacco retailers could only display a 60-by-45 centimeter board, roughly 24 by 18 inches. The signÂ canÂ have a description of the type of tobacco products sold â such as cigarettes or chewing tobacco â but cannot include any brand advertisingÂ and must carry a large health warning. reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives The health ministryâs rules were challenged in court by a group of cigarette distributorsÂ and put on hold by a state-level High Court for seven years. They finally came into force in 2013 on orders of Indiaâs Supreme Court. The High Court had overlookedÂ the fact that advertisement of tobacco products âwill attract younger generation and innocent minds, who are not aware of grave and adverse consequences of consuming such products,â the Supreme Court said in its ruling. Philip Morris has lobbied against the passing of stricter tobacco control rules by the Indian government. In documents detailing the companyâs plans for the biennial FCTC treaty convention in India last November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi emerges as a prime target. AÂ key goal: to pre-empt Modi from taking âextreme anti-tobacco measuresâ before delegates were to gather from around the worldÂ for the treaty meeting, according to a 2014 corporate affairs PowerPointÂ presentation. Reuters reviewed hundreds of pages of internal Philip Morris International documents relating to India. These excerpts show the companyâs marketing and lobbying tactics, which are aimed at bolstering the Marlboro brand among young adults and blocking the âenactment of extreme anti-tobacco measures.â Letters from Indian officials detail the governmentâs efforts to enforce the countryâs tobacco control regulations.

Ahead of the World Health Organizationâs global tobacco control treaty meeting in India last November, Philip Morris planned to engage Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an effort to head off new anti-tobacco measures. The slide is from a 2014 corporate affairs document. CoP7 = Conference of the Parties, the biennial treaty meeting. The company planned to gain Modiâs ear through those close to him.Â It identified several people in this group, including Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda,Â and Amit Shah, president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Modi and the other politicians didnât respond to requests for comment. Philip Morris International also didnât comment on the plan. The tobacco giantâs efforts to fend off anti-smoking steps have had limited impact so far. Last year, for instance, India ordered manufacturers to cover 85 percent of the surface of cigarette packs with health warnings, up from 20 percent. The rule, which is still being challenged in a state courtÂ by the tobacco industry, including Philip Morrisâ India partner, was implemented by order of the Supreme Court. Marlboro has just a 1.4 percent shareÂ of the almost $10 billion cigarette market in India. The industry is dominated by ITC, which has a strong grip on distributors and retailers.Â One major method Philip Morris is deploying to gain ground, the marketing documents show, isÂ the free distribution of cigarettes at bars and nightclubsÂ - known as Legal Age Meeting Points, or LAMPs, in company jargon.Â The hiring of young women and men to work at these gatheringsÂ is outsourced to event management companies, according to people with knowledge of the gatherings. Some of the recruiting takes place online. âHey girlsâ¦We are searching A++ Hot & Gorgeous girls for the Marlboro pub activity...Pay: 2000/day...Work: Promotion in clubs in Delhi,â read one postÂ on a Facebook public group in June last year. There was no company name attached to the ad. At severalÂ parties attended by Reuters in Delhi and Mumbai, young women dressed in the colors of the latest Marlboro variant handed out packsÂ of cigarettes. During one party at a nightclub in a Delhi hotel, a young woman walked around with a tablet showing an ad that highlighted Marlboro features. A television screen played a video promoting the brand: âFor trendsetters, for forward thinkers, a smooth and balanced smoking experience.â In many ways, it was right out of the Philip Morris 1990s playbook. The American Journal of Public Health study, drawing on previously secret industry documents, found that Philip Morris ran bar promotions in 1990 using racing jackets, and added âneon message boards and cocktail traysâ in 1991. The study described methods for collecting names for a company database âto generate smoker profiles, direct mailing campaigns, and conduct telephone research studies after the bar events.â At the parties in India, people who took the Marlboro packs were asked their names, ages and preferred brands. Philip Morris calls this distribution of free cigarettes âsampling,â which it says in an internal document is allowed under the law. The company has spent millions of dollars on these activities. In 2014, for example, Philip Morris estimated it spent $1.6 million on LAMP events and sampling at kiosks in India, according to the 2015 commercial review presentation. The company planned to use LAMPs in 2015 to generate 30,000 âtrials,â or samplings of cigarettes. And it planned to generate another 500,000 trials that year through sampling at cigarette shops and kiosks,Â according to the 2015 strategy document. The company instructs employees to watch their words. An undated training manualÂ for market researchers says: âDo not say this is a âPROMOTIONâ or âADVERTISINGâ.â Indian health ministry officials say that anyone who hands out free cigarettes, whatever the circumstances,Â is breaking the law. The Health Ministryâs Amal Pusp says the law against distribution of free cigarettes is unambiguous. He cites Section 5 of the countryâs tobacco control act, which says: âNo person, shall, under a contract or otherwise promote or agree to promote the use or consumption ofâ cigarettes or any other tobacco product. The law carries a fine of up to 1,000 rupees (about $15) and a sentence of up to two years in prison for a first conviction. âWe believe we market our products in a responsible manner, and in compliance with Indian regulations,â Philip Morrisâ Venkatesh said, without elaborating. In October last year, the month before India was due to host delegations from around the world at the biennial FCTC tobacco control conference in Delhi, tobacco-control officer Arora said he suddenly started getting traction. The cigarette ads vanished and Delhi was âcleaned,â he said. That success couldnât have come at a better time for Arora and his colleagues at the federal health ministry: They wanted to make sure foreign delegates visiting India saw the country was serious about its tobacco regulations. Weeks after the FCTC delegates left town in November, however, kiosks in the capital were again displaying ads for Marlboro.

 ,07202017,Reuters,07132017,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - S. K. Arora spent more than three years trudging through the Indian summer heat and monsoon rains to inspect tobacco kiosks across this sprawling megacity, tearing down cigarette advertisements and handing out fines to store owners for putting them up. But as fast as he removed the colorful ads, more appeared. The chief tobacco control officer at the Delhi state government, Arora asked the major cigarette companies to put a stop to the cat-and-mouse routine. In official letters and face-to-face meetings, he told them India’s tobacco control laws barred such public advertising and promotion of cigarettes. Like other tobacco companies, Philip Morris kept up its ad blitz. Venkatesh says Philip Morris is doing nothing wrong. In response to questions from Reuters, he said the company’s advertising is “compliant with Indian law” and that Philip Morris has “fully cooperated with the enforcement authorities” on the matter. But Indian government officials say Philip Morris is using methods that flout the nation’s tobacco-control regulations. These include tobacco shop displays as well as the free distribution of Marlboro – the world’s best-selling cigarette brand – at nightclubs and bars frequented by young people. (See the web version of this story - reut.rs/2uuye5Y) In internal documents, Philip Morris International is explicit about targeting the country’s youth. A key goal is “winning the hearts and minds of LA-24,” those between legal age, 18, and 24, according to one slide in a 2015 commercial review presentation. As with the point-of-sale ads at kiosks, public health officials say that giving away cigarettes is a violation of India’s Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act and its accompanying rules. Philip Morris' marketing strategy for India, which relies heavily on kiosk advertising and social events, is laid out in hundreds of pages of internal documents reviewed by Reuters that cover the period from 2009 to 2016. In them, Philip Morris presents these promotions as key marketing activities. In recent years, they have helped to more than quadruple Marlboro's market share in India, where the company is battling to expand its reach in the face of an entrenched local giant. Reuters is publishing a selection of those documents in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files. (reut.rs/2sT51xF) The company’s goal is to make sure that “every adult Indian smoker should be able to buy Marlboro within walking distance,” according to another 2015 strategy document. In targeting young adults, Philip Morris is deploying a promotional strategy that it and other tobacco companies used in the United States decades ago. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health in 2002 found that during the 1990s, “tobacco industry sponsorship of bars and nightclubs increased dramatically, accompanied by cigarette brand paraphernalia, advertisements, and entertainment events in bars and clubs.” With cigarette sales declining in many countries, Philip Morris has identified India, population 1.3 billion, as a market with opportunity for significant growth. “India remains a high potential market with huge upside with cigarette market still in infancy,” says a 2014 internal document. According to government data, India has about 100 million smokers. Of those, about two-thirds smoke traditional hand-rolled cigarettes. Tobacco use kills more than 900,000 people a year in India, and the World Health Organization estimates that tobacco-related diseases cost the country about $16 billion annually. Tobacco-control officer Arora, a short, mustachioed man with a gruff demeanor, sent a letter to Philip Morris and other tobacco companies in mid-April, giving them until the end of the month to remove all advertisements. “Legal action will be initiated against the company” if it did not comply, he wrote in the letters, copies of which were reviewed by Reuters. A day after Arora’s deadline passed, he and his team conducted a raid in an affluent area of cafes and coffee shops in New Delhi that showed his letters did not have the desired effect. On that hot afternoon in May, the team cut down about a dozen advertisements for Marlboro and various ITC brands. As word of the raid spread, worried vendors covered their ads with newspapers or took them down. One kiosk owner, Rakesh Kumar Jain, removed his Marlboro ads before Arora’s team arrived. Jain said the signs had been put up by Philip Morris representatives. In return, he said, he received free cigarettes each month worth about 2,000 rupees (about $30). Jain knew that putting up the posters was illegal, but they helped improve sales, he said. About a dozen kiosk owners interviewed by Reuters said that tobacco companies paid them a monthly fee for advertisements and product displays, with the amount determined by factors such as location, volume of business and type of promotional material. In payment receipts seen by Reuters, Philip Morris’ India unit promised to pay 500 Indian rupees ($7.50) a month to a cigarette seller with a small roadside kiosk in New Delhi for putting up Marlboro ads. The receipts were signed by a company representative. During the raid, fines were issued to some vendors, many of them repeat offenders, and they were threatened with court action if the ads went up again. Like Philip Morris, ITC says that it is in full compliance with India’s 2003 tobacco control law. If it wasn’t, the company said in a statement to Reuters, then “the relevant government authorities would have initiated action.” Since Arora’s threat of legal action in April, there are fewer Philip Morris advertisements outside cigarette shops in the capital.

 ,07202017,Reuters,07132017,"Bay Minette, Alabama (Reuters) - Dr. Nicole Arthur, a family practice physician, was trained to avoid Cesarean deliveries in child-birth, unless medically necessary, because surgery increases risks and recovery time. But she has adjusted her approach since arriving last year at the 70-bed North Baldwin Infirmary in rural, southern Alabama. Low patient admissions and high costs mean the hospital does not have doctors on site around-the-clock to administer anesthesia in the case of an unexpected emergency Cesarean. As a result, Dr. Arthur performs the surgery if there are any signs of complication, rather than waiting and running the risk that comes with the 20 to 30 minutes it takes for an anesthesiologist to arrive in the middle of the night. “It’s better for me to do a C-section when I suspect that something may happen,” she said of her new strategy. “Getting the baby out healthy and happy outweighs some of the risk.” Physicians in rural communities across America are facing the same tough choices as Dr. Arthur. Hospitals are scaling back services, shutting their maternity wards or closing altogether, according to data from hospitals, state health departments, the federal government and rural health organizations. Nationally, 119 rural hospitals that have shut since 2005, with 80 of those closures having occurred since 2010, according to the most recent data from the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program. To save on insurance and staffing costs, maternity departments are often among the first to get shuttered inside financially stressed rural hospitals, according medical professionals and healthcare experts. “It’s been a slow and steady decline,” said Michael Topchik, the National Leader for the Chartis Center for Rural Health, about maternity ward closings. “It’s very expensive care to offer, especially when it’s lower volume.” More than 200 maternity wards closed between 2004 and 2014 because of higher costs, fewer births and staffing shortages, leaving 54 percent of rural counties across the United States without hospital-based obstetrics, data from the University of Minnesota’s Rural Health Research Center show. The trend has escalated recently even though the national healthcare law, known as Obamacare, was designed in part to help rural hospitals thrive. But unpaid patient debt has risen among rural hospitals by 50 percent since the Affordable Care Act was passed, according to the National Rural Health Association, especially in states that decided not to expand Medicaid – the state and federal insurance program for the poor. The outlook for these hospitals was not poised to improve had Congress approved legislation to replace Obamacare. Senate Republicans’ proposed cuts to Medicaid would have pushed about 150 more rural hospitals into the red, according to the Chartis Center for Rural Health, mainly in states that voted Republican in the last election. But late on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Republican effort to repeal and immediately replace Obamacare will not be successful, after two of McConnell’s Senate conservatives announced that they would not support the bill. The consequences go beyond politics. When local doctors and midwives leave town, rural women lose access to essential services. Many skip or delay prenatal care that could prevent complications, premature birth or even death. The U.S. infant mortality rate is among the highest in developing countries at 5.8 deaths per 1,000 births. Pregnant woman in rural areas are more likely to have their deliveries induced or by Cesarean section that, while potentially life-saving, are more expensive and risky than a normal vaginal birth, according to patients, medical professionals and researchers. Almost a year after her second son’s birth, Courtney Cross is still repaying money she borrowed because of the smaller paychecks and larger gas bills she had from driving 60 minutes each way to a specialist in Mobile, Alabama. “There were some days I had to reschedule because of the money factor,” said Cross, a medical technician and mother of two, who some months made the trip multiple times. “I had to make money.” Cross is not alone. The most common reasons for the hospital closures are people and money. More and more people are moving to urban areas in pursuit of work and a better paycheck. And in most states, lower revenue from insurance and U.S. government payments are pushing these hospitals into financial stress, particularly in states that did not build out their Medicaid programs as Obamacare allowed. “The majority of births in rural America are paid for by Medicaid, and Medicaid is not the most generous payer,” said Diane Calmus, government affairs and policy manager for the National Rural Health Association. “For most hospitals it is a money losing proposition.” This is the main reason why Connie Trujillo shuttered her midwife practice this spring in Las Vegas, New Mexico. The local hospital had closed its maternity ward, and the closest hospital to deliver babies was at least 60 miles away. She sees more elective inductions because the patients live far away and can’t afford to go back and forth. “Some of them just don’t have the resources,” she said. A year after shuttering, the hospital is trying to hire additional staff to reopen the ward. The number of induced U.S. deliveries nationally has doubled since 1990 to about 23.3 percent, but rates are significantly higher in rural areas, where it is routinely offered to women traveling long distances, especially if the weather is bad. Induced labor and surgery come at a high cost. Commercial insurance and Medicaid paid about 50 percent more for Cesarean than vaginal births, according to a 2013 Truven Health Analytics report. The report said Medicaid payments for maternal and newborn care for a vaginal birth was $9,131 versus $13,590 for a C-section. In largely rural West Virginia - where the Summersville Regional Medical Center became the latest hospital to stop delivering newborns earlier this year - elected inductions for first time mothers rose to 28.7 percent in 2015 from 24.1 percent in 2011, according to data provided to Reuters by the West Virginia Perinatal Partnership, a statewide effort to improve care. ""Inductions allow the physicians to manage their case loads and timing of deliveries,” said Amy Tolliver, director of the Perinatal Partnership. “We know that inductions are happening in small hospitals that have difficulty with staffing."" To address staffing issues at Dr Arthur’s hospital in Alabama, the facility paid temporary doctors for a year to keep the department open when one of its two maternity doctors stopped doing deliveries. “It’s important to have access (to obstetrics),” said hospital president Benjamin Hansert, who also organized a group of doctors from Mobile about 40 minutes away to cover some of the shifts so that staff doctors would not always be on call. “Where the mother goes for care, the rest of the family will follow.” ","

 ,07202017,Reuters,07132017,"SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A leading Chinese private equity consortium backed by senior executives from Global Logistic Properties (GLP) GLPL.SI won a bid to acquire GLP for S$16 billion ($11.6 billion), marking Asia’s largest private equity buyout in a buoyant sector. The group is offering S$3.38 in cash per share, representing an 81 percent premium over its 12-month volume weighted average price and a 25 percent premium over its last full trading day before the announcement. Surprisingly, the acquisition is not conditional on getting antitrust approvals or a green light from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), among others, at a time when regulators are vetting takeovers more closely. Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC [GIC.UL], which owns 37 percent of GLP and is its biggest shareholder, is supporting the transaction but is free to accept an unmatched superior offer. “GIC played hard to get a decent offer,” said a person with direct knowledge of the deal. “There’s a good premium with very few strings attached.” Last year, GIC nudged GLP to start a strategic review of its business after its shares tumbled over a period of two years starting in 2015. GLP then hired JPMorgan as its financial adviser and Allen & Gledhill as its legal adviser to work on the review. The seven-month auction for GLP was marred by complaints from some potential bidders about a lack of transparency and the perceived advantages of the Chinese consortium through their business ties. GLP then formed a committee of independent directors and said it took measures to alleviate potential conflicts of interest. It said on Friday that it chose the Chinese consortium because it had more deal certainty and “limited conditionality”, reducing “execution risk”. GLP shares soared 22 percent on Friday to a record high. Before Friday’s jump, the shares had surged nearly 50 percent since late last year when GIC requested the strategic review. Analysts said GLP, which earns the majority of its revenue from China, was especially well positioned to benefit from the e-commerce boom. “Their substantial footprint in some of the largest global economies make them well positioned to leverage improving global industrial trade and services, including the rapidly rising share of e-commerce in global retail,” said Priyaranjan Kumar, regional executive director of Cushman & Wakefield’s Asia Pacific capital markets group. “To build a similar platform would take many years and present its own set of economic challenges,” he said. The bid for GLP stands out at a time when China’s outbound M&A volumes nearly halved in the first six months of 2017 following Beijing’s crackdown on capital outflows, data showed, and its new scrutiny of acquisitive groups is set to dampen Asian deal flow further. The proposed acquisition will be done by way of a scheme of arrangement and the Chinese group plans to delist and take the Singapore-listed firm private. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were the lead joint financial advisers for the consortium and are providing the financial resources confirmation related to the purchase. DBS Bank and China International Capital Corporation also advised the consortium. Goldman and Citi are putting up $5 bln to help fund the deal, sources said. Goldman and Citi declined comment. ","

 ,07202017,Reuters,07132017,"TOBACCO TITAN: A cigarette vending machine near the offices of Philip Morris International in Lausanne, Switzerland. The company, which sells Marlboro, is targeting the FCTC anti-smoking treaty on multiple levels. REUTERS/Paritosh Bansal The worldâs largest publicly traded tobacco company is deploying its vast resources against international efforts to reduce smoking. Internal documents uncovered by Reuters reveal details of the secret operation. By ADITYA KALRA, PARITOSH BANSAL, DUFF WILSON and TOM LASSETER Filed July 13, 2017, 11:15 a.m. GMT NEW DELHI/LAUSANNE, SwitzerlandÂ â A group of cigarette company executives stood in the lobby of a drab convention center near New Delhi last November. They were waiting for credentials to enter the World Health Organizationâs global tobacco treaty conference, one designed to curb smoking and combat the influence of the cigarette industry. Treaty officials didnât want them there. But still, among those lined up hoping to get in were executives from Japan Tobacco InternationalÂ and British American Tobacco Plc. There was a big name missing from the group: Philip Morris International Inc. A Philip Morris representative later told Reuters its employees didnât turn up Â because the company knew it wasnât welcome. In fact, executives from the largest publicly traded tobacco firm had flown in from around the world to New Delhi for the anti-tobacco meeting. Unknown to treaty organizers, they were staying at a hotel an hour from the convention center, working from an operations room there. Philip Morris International would soon be holding secret meetings with delegates from the government of Vietnam and other treaty members. Related content Part 2: Marlboro Country Archive: The Philip Morris Files Graphic: Lobbying strategy Graphic: Watering down Video: A âreal dangerâ The object of these clandestine activities: the WHOâs Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, or FCTC, a treaty aimed at reducing smoking globally. Reuters has found that Philip Morris International is running a secretive campaign to block or weaken treaty provisions that save millions of lives by curbing tobacco use. In an internal document, the company says it supported the enactment of the treaty. But Philip Morris has come to view it as a âregulatory runaway trainâ driven by âanti-tobacco extremistsâ â a description contained in the document,Â a 2014 PowerPoint presentation.Â Â Confidential company documents and interviews with current and former Philip Morris employees reveal an offensive that stretches from the Americas to Africa to Asia, from hardscrabble tobacco fields to the halls of political power, in what may be one of the broadest corporate lobbying efforts in existence. Details of those plans are laid bare in a cache of Philip Morris documents reviewed by Reuters, one of the largest tobacco industry leaks ever. Reuters is publishing a selection of those papers in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files. Dating from 2009 to 2016, the thousands of pages include emails between executives, PowerPoint presentations, planning papers, policy toolkits, national lobbying plans and market analyses. Taken as a whole, they present a company that has focused its vast global resources on bringing to heel the worldâs tobacco control treaty. Philip Morris works to subvert the treaty on multiple levels. It targets the FCTC conferences where delegates gather to decide on anti-smoking guidelines. It also lobbies at the country level, where the makeup of FCTC delegations is determined and treaty decisions are turned into legislation. Reuters uncovered thousands of pages of internal Philip Morris International documents. These excerpts show the companyâs tactics for combating the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, or FCTC, a treaty aimed at reducing smoking worldwide. (Some documents include highlighting by Reuters; some names have been redacted.) 1. A slide from a 2014 Philip Morris corporate affairs presentationÂ about the FCTC, the global anti-smoking treaty.

In this slide from a Japan corporate affairs presentation, some ministers in the Japanese cabinet are identified according to their positions on tobacco. The two ministers designated âPro-tobaccoâ did not respond to questions from Reuters. 17. This slide, also from the Japan presentation, talks about Philip Morris Japan maintaining good relations with members of Japanâs FCTC delegation, and a Philip Morris executive meeting with members of the countryâs FCTC delegation. (MOF = Ministry of Finance; MOFA = Ministry of Foreign Affairs; JT = Japan Tobacco.) 18. This slide, also from the Japan presentation, reveals the companyâs plans for opposing moves in Australia to bar the use of logos or distinctive coloring on cigarette packs. The measure is known as plain packaging, or PP. The Tobacco Institute of Japan, or TIOJ, declined to comment. 19. A slide from a Philip Morris training document. The documents, combined with reporting in 14 countries from Brazil to Uganda to Vietnam, reveal that a goal of Philip Morris is to increase the number of delegates at the treaty conventions who are not from health ministries or involved in public health. Thatâs happening: A Reuters analysis of delegates to the FCTCâs biennial conference shows a rise since the first convention in 2006Â in the number of officials from ministries like trade, finance and agriculture for whom tobacco revenues can be a higher priority than health concerns. Philip MorrisÂ International says there is nothing improper about its executives engaging with government officials. âAs a company in a highly regulated industry, speaking with governments is part of our everyday business,â Tony Snyder, vice president of communications, said in a statementÂ in response to Reutersâ findings. âThe fact that Reuters has seen internal emails discussing our engagement with governments does not make those interactions inappropriate.â In a series of interviews in Europe and Asia, Philip Morris executive Andrew Cave said company employees are under strict instructions to obey both the companyâs own conduct policies and local law in the countries where they operate. Cave, a director of corporate affairs, said that while Philip Morris disagrees with some aspects of the FCTC treaty and consults with delegates offsite during its conferences, ultimately the delegations âmake their own decisions.â âWeâre respectful of the fact that this is their week and their event,â said Cave in an interview in New Delhi, as the parties to the treaty met last November. Asked in an earlier interviewÂ whether Philip Morris conducts a formal campaign targeting the treatyâs biennial conferences, Cave gave a flat âno.â When the FCTC delegates gather, lives hang in the balance. Decisions taken at the conferences over the past decade, including a ban on smoking in public places, are saving millions of lives, according to researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center. Between 2007 and 2014, more than 53 million people in 88 countries stopped smoking because those nations imposedÂ stringent anti-smoking measures recommended by the WHO, according to their December 2016 study. Because of the treaty, an estimated 22 million smoking-related deaths will be averted, the researchers found. According to the WHO, though, tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death â and by 2030 will be responsible for eight million deaths a year, up from six million now. There was jubilation among anti-smoking advocates when the treaty was adopted in 2003. The treaty, which took effect in 2005, made it possible to push for measures that once seemed radical, such as smoke-free bars. About 90 percent of all nations eventually joined. A big holdout is the United States, which signed the treaty but has yet to ratify it. Since the FCTC came into force, it has persuaded dozens of nations to boost taxes on tobacco products, pass laws banning smoking in public places and increase the size of health warnings on cigarette packs. Treaty members gather every two years to consider new provisions or strengthen old ones at a meeting called the Conference of the Parties, or COP, which first convened in 2006 in Geneva. But an FCTC reportÂ shows that implementation of important sections of the treaty is stalling. There has been no further progress in the implementation of 7 out of 16 âsubstantiveâ treaty articles since 2014, according to a report by the FCTC Secretariat in June last year. A key reason: âThe tobacco industry continues to be the most important barrier in implementation of the Convention.â Indeed, the tobacco industry has weathered the tighter regulation. There has been only a slight 1.9 percent decline in global cigarette sales since the treaty took effect in 2005, and more people smoked daily in 2015 than a decade earlier,Â studies show. The Thomson Reuters Global Tobacco Index, which tracks tobacco stocks, has risen more than 100 percent in the past decade, largely due to price increases. âSome people think that with tobacco, youâve won the battle,â said former Finnish Health Minister Pekka Puska, who chaired an FCTC committee last year. âNo way,â he said. âThe tobacco industry is more powerful than ever.â With 600 corporate affairs executives, according to a November 2015 internal email, Philip Morris has one of the worldâs biggest corporate lobbying arms. That army, and $7 billion-plus in annual net profit, gives Philip Morris the resources to overwhelm the FCTC. The treaty is overseen by 19 staff at a Secretariat office hosted by the WHO in Geneva. The Secretariat spends on average less than $6 million a year.Â Even when buttressed by anti-smoking groups, the Secretariat is outgunned. Its budget for this year and last year for supporting the treaty clause on combating tobacco company influence is less than $460,000. Vera Luiza da Costa e Silva, head of the FCTC treaty Secretariat, is the person tasked with preventing the industry from neutering the agreement. In two interviews at her Geneva office, da Costa e Silva, a medical doctor who holds a PhD in public health and has a dyed pink streak in her hair, explained why the FCTC banned attendance by any member of the public at the 2014 biennial conference in Moscow. The ban came in response to efforts by tobacco executives to use public badges to get inside the venue, she said, adding that industry representativesÂ then started borrowing badges from delegates they knew to gain entry. âItâs a real war,â said da Costa e Silva. âSome people think that with tobacco, youâve won the battle. No wayâ¦ The tobacco industry is more powerful than ever.â But she had only a partial picture of the forces ranged against her.Â She wasnât aware of the fact that Philip Morris had a large team operating throughout the convention in Moscow, or the details of its activities in New Delhi last November. âThis is so disgusting. These are the forces against which we have to work,â da Costa e Silva said in May after being told about the Philip Morris documents. âI think they want to implode the treaty.â The idea of a global tobacco treaty had been discussed among health advocates since at least 1979, when a WHO committee suggested the possibility. Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway who became director-general of the WHO in 1998, made it happen. She was aided by outrage over documents that surfaced as part of the landmark 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, in which the four largest U.S. tobacco companies agreed to pay more than $200 billion to 46 U.S. states. The internal communications showed that tobacco executives lied for years about their knowledge of the deadly nature of cigarettes. A 1989Â document revealed one companyâs plan to fight threats to the industry. âWHOâs impact and influence is indisputable,â the document said. It went on to contemplate âcountermeasures designed to contain/neutralize/re-orient the WHO.â That company was Philip Morris. In 2008, Altria Group Inc split up its Philip Morris business. Philip Morris USA, which remains a subsidiary of Altria, sells Marlboro and other brands in the United States. Philip Morris International was spun off, and handles business abroad. Since the split, Philip Morris International shares have more than doubled and Altriaâs have more than tripled. Philip Morris Internationalâs operational headquartersÂ are in Lausanne, Switzerland, down the street from a patch of Gallo-RomanÂ ruins, in a sleek building with a cafeteria, gym and a patio facing Lake Geneva. From there, the company is working to hobble the treaty. Internal company communications reveal the scope of Philip Morrisâ operation during the 2014 FCTC treaty meeting in Moscow. The company set up a âCoordinating Roomâ that could seat 42 people, according to theÂ 2014 PowerPoint presentation, titled âCorporate affairs approach and issues.â Leading the operation was executive Chris Koddermann. Formerly a lawyer and lobbyist in Canada, Koddermann joined Philip Morris in 2010. He is now a director of regulatory affairs in Lausanne. The PowerPoint describes the ideal corporate affairs executive as someone who is able to âplay the political game.â Koddermann previously worked for federal and provincial cabinet ministers in Canada, according to his LinkedIn profile. Reached on his cell phone in March, Koddermann said he wouldnât be able to meet and that any questions should be directed to Philip Morris International. At the end of the Moscow meeting, on Oct. 18, 2014, Koddermann sent an emailÂ congratulating a 33-person Philip Morris team on their success in diluting or blocking measures intended to strengthen tobacco controls and reduce cigarette sales.Â The gains he touted at the end of the week-long conference were the culmination of a two-year effort, his email said. The documents shed light on one key objective in Philip MorrisâÂ FCTC campaign: Keep tobacco within the ambit of international trade deals, so that the company has a way to mount legal campaigns against tobacco regulations. â¢ Has its roots in a small tobacconist shop in London in 1847.â¢ Now operates in more than 180 markets.â¢ Famous for its iconic Marlboro Man advertising.â¢ Has six of the worldâs top 15 cigarette brands, including Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield.â¢ Spun off from the Richmond, Va.-headquartered Altria Group in March 2008. â¢ Operational headquarters are in Switzerland.â¢ Produces over 800 billion cigarettes a year.â¢ Share price has more than doubled since the 2008 spin-off from Altria. Sources: Philip Morris International website; Reuters reporting In Moscow, one proposal initially called for carving out tobacco from trade pacts. International trade treaties often include provisions, such as the protection of trademarks, that Philip Morris has used to challenge anti-smoking measures. If tobacco were taken out of the treaties, as suggested by the proposal, Philip Morris could be deprived of many such legal arguments. An early draft asked parties to support efforts to excludeÂ tobacco from trade pacts and to prevent the industry from âabusingâ trade and investment rules. In the end, the proposal was watered down. The final decision only reminded parties of âthe possibility to take into account their public health objectives in their negotiation of trade and investment agreements.â There was no mention of excluding tobacco. Koddermann, in his email to colleagues on the last day of the conference, declared victory, describing the change as âa tremendous outcome.â Overall, the company achieved its âtrade related campaign objectives,â including âavoiding a declaration of health over tradeâ and âavoiding the recognition of the FCTC as an international standard,â he wrote. The win was significant. A former Philip Morris employee said the company has routinely used trade treaties to challenge tobacco control laws. The aim, he said, was âto scare governments away from doing regulatory changes.â Even though the tobacco industry has lost a series of major legal battles, its suits have served to discourageÂ the implementation of regulations that curb smoking. Those delays can yield years of unimpeded sales. As the Philip Morris PowerPoint presentation from 2014 put it: âRoadblocks are as important as solutions.â One roadblock was a campaign to stop the 2011 introduction of rules in Australia banning logos and distinctive coloring on cigarette packs. The companyâs litigation and arbitration against the measure ultimately were dismissedÂ â but not before five countries filed complaints against Australia on the same subject at the World Trade Organization. The global trade body has yet to announce a decision in the matter. The attempt to undo Australiaâs regulations has had a chilling effect elsewhere. It slowed the introduction of plain-packaging rules in New Zealand. Citing the risk that tobacco companies may âmount legal challenges,â the government announced in 2013 that it was postponing the move and waiting to âsee what happens with Australiaâs legal cases.â The legislation is now scheduled to go into effect next year. In his Moscow conference email, Koddermann also expressed pleasure at the fate of a proposal on farmers. Initial language would have recommended that countries restrict support for tobacco growers. The proposal was âsignificantly watered down,â he wrote.Â âThis is a very positive result.â Gustavo Bosio, at the time a manager for international trade, chimed in a few days after the conference in an email: âThese excellent results are a direct consequence of the remarkable efforts of all PMI regions and markets during the past two years and throughout the intense week in Moscow.â Philip Morris isnât alone in seeking to weaken the treaty. Ahead of the 2012 FCTC conference, in Seoul, four cigarette giants â Philip Morris, British American Tobacco (BAT), Japan Tobacco InternationalÂ and Imperial Brands Plc â formed an âinformal industry Working Groupâ to oppose various proposals on tobacco taxation, according to anÂ internal BAT documentÂ reviewed by Reuters. The 45-page paper, whose existence hasnât been previously reported, noted that the group would coordinate âto the extent that these issues do not raise any anti-competitive concerns.â The paper outlined a global campaign planned by BAT to counter the FCTC, which was âincreasingly going beyondâ its mandate. And it listed objectives, including a bid to block discussions around the introduction of a minimum 70 percent tax on tobacco. BAT declined to answer questions about the industry working group. Both Imperial and Japan Tobacco International said they didnât want to comment on a document from a competitor. Japan Tobacco International said its tax experts met with counterparts from other tobacco companies to discuss treaty guidelines on taxation ahead of the 2012 conference. Philip Morris did not comment on the document. The Philip Morris emails and documents donât explicitly detail how the company pulled off the victories in Moscow. But they provide insight into the importance it places on wooing delegates. The FCTC traditionally makes decisions by consensus, and so influencing a single national delegation can have an outsized impact. The treaty has a key clause meant to keep the industry from unduly influencing delegations. Article 5.3, as itâs known, says nations should protect their public health policies from tobacco interests. GuidelinesÂ that accompany Article 5.3 recommend that countries interact with the industry only when âstrictly necessary.â But the article â a single sentenceÂ â contains a loophole Philip Morris has exploited. The sentence ends with the words âin accordance with national law,â opening the door to arguments by pro-tobacco forces that any lobbying thatâs legal in a certain country is permissibleÂ when interacting with that countryâs representatives.Â They also argue that a sentence in a related document, the guidelines for Article 5.3, allows for such interactions to take place as long as they are conducted transparently. The Philip Morris International documents uncovered by Reuters include guidelines and country-specific lobbying plans aimed at hobbling the WHOâs global tobacco control treaty and national anti-smoking measures. Strategies include:â¢ Lobbying lawmakers, bureaucrats and other government officialsâ¢ Trying to move tobacco issues away from health departments â¢ Deploying third parties, including retail groups, to make its case and exert pressure on decision-makersâ¢ Engaging the media on tobacco issues and generating public debate to influence decision-makers The tabs below show the companyâs strategy in action in three countries in recent years, according to internal company documents. The extent to which Philip Morrisâ actions affected the outcome in each case is unclear. In September 2011, Israelâs health ministry proposed new measures to regulate flavoring and advertising of tobacco products. In a draft company strategy document from October 2011, Philip Morris said the proposals included âa few excessive and disproportionate measuresâ such as restricting the use of fruit or chocolate flavorings in tobacco products, and broadly prohibiting advertising and marketing of tobacco. Elements of the campaign:1:Â Leverage established relationships with different government ministries, mobilize retailers to advocate against âexcessiveâ provisions, and lobby the health ministry.2:Â Lobby the government through third parties such as an Israel-based supplier of licorice.3:Â Use Philip Morrisâ database of more than 60,000 adult smokersÂ to reach consumers and create a public debate through the media âto influence MPs,âÂ or members of parliament. OUTCOME:Â The bans on advertising and ingredients did not go through. A 2010 Philip Morris document shows the company drawing up plans to lobby Sweden in an effort to influence the European Commissionâs new tobacco regulations for member states, known as the Tobacco Products Directive (TPD). Elements of the campaign:1:Â Engage the justice ministry to âput pressureâ on the health ministry so that the Swedish representativeÂ on the European Commission committee opposes plain packaging and âexcessiveâ health warning labels, and supports lifting the ban on snus, a smokeless tobacco product.2:Â Build a âbroad coalitionâ of âthird-party stakeholders,â such as the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, and get them to pressure the government. (The chamber told Reuters that it does not lobby on behalf of individual companies.)3:Â Establish a retailer network and contact bloggers and journalists to voice concerns about issues, including plain packaging and point-of-sale display bans. OUTCOME:Â Plain packaging and point-of-sale display ban were not included in the directive, which came into force in May 2014. In January 2013, Osaka Prefecture in Japan held a public consultation on a proposal to abolish existing smoking rooms, with a âroadmap towards total smoking prohibition in all public places,â according to a February 2014 Japan corporate affairs presentation.Â The Philip Morris document describes it as an âextreme proposal.â Elements of the campaign:1:Â Ensure that ârelevant stakeholdersâ oppose the move. Philip Morris field sales staff engaged retailers and others.2:Â Engage local politicians and work with the industryÂ in pushing back against the proposal. OUTCOME:Â The proposal was withdrawn. One of the companyâs targets has been Vietnam. The day the Moscow meeting ended, Koddermann received an email from his colleagueÂ Nguyen Thanh Ky, a leading corporate affairs executive for Vietnam. Ky said he had a âdebrief lunchâ with the Vietnamese delegation and had a good outcome to report: The delegation was in favor of âmoderate and reasonable measuresâ to be implemented over a âpractical timeline,â he wrote. He did not specify which measures they discussed. The Vietnamese delegation spoke up often during the Moscow meeting. A review of notes compiled by tobacco-control groups accredited as observers showed Vietnamâs interjections frequently mirrored Philip Morrisâ positions on tobacco-control regulations. Just like the tobacco giant, the Vietnamese said a higher tax on cigarettes would lead to more illicit sales. Like Philip Morris, they said the FCTC should stay out of trade disputes. And like Philip Morris, they opposed proposals to set uniform parameters for the legal liability of tobacco companies. The FCTC guidelines on taxation did ultimately include a WHO recommendation for a minimum tax of 70 percent â something Philip Morris opposed. But the proposal to give the treaty more sway over trade disputes was weakened, and measures to strengthen the legal liability of cigarette companies were delayed. Vietnamâs foreign ministry did not respond to questions from Reuters. reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives As soon as the conference ended, the documents show, Philip Morris turned to the next one: the 2016 meeting in India. The 2014 PowerPoint presentation outlined the need to identify ways to gather intelligence during the Delhi conference. In a separate 2015 planning document, the company talks about the arrangement of farmer protests in the run-up to the meeting. Such protests did take place â including one in front of WHO offices in New Delhi. Reuters couldnât determine whether Philip Morris was behind those demonstrations. While other major tobacco companies also sent people to Delhi in November, Philip Morris was distinguished by its stealth. Executives from the company did not sign in with their tobacco industry colleagues at the FCTC convention center and stayed at a hotel about an hourâs drive away. The anonymity and distance helped Philip Morris approach delegates covertly. On the second day of the conference, a white Toyota van pulled away from the front of the Hyatt Regency hotel â where Philip Morris had its operations room â and headed for the FCTC treaty venue. The van was carrying Ky, its corporate affairs executive from Vietnam. Kyâs driver talked his way past police at the barricade outside the conference center, where FCTC-issued credentialsÂ were checked, explaining that he was driving âVIPs,â the driver later told Reuters. A few minutes later, a man in a dark suit walked out of the conference center, passed the van and stopped at a street corner. The van did a U-turn, and a Reuters reporter saw the man in the suit quickly climb in. He was a senior member of Vietnamâs delegation to the FCTC conference: Nguyen Vinh Quoc, a Vietnamese government official. The driver, Kishore Kumar, said in an interview that he dropped the two men off at a local hotel. Kumar said that on several other occasions that week, he took Ky to pick up people from the Hotel Formule1, a budget lodging where Vietnamâs delegation was staying during the conference. Ky and Quoc did not respond to requests for comment. Asked by Reuters about the interaction between Ky and the Vietnam representatives, Philip Morris executive Andrew CaveÂ thumped on the table in a bar at the hotel where company representatives were staying. Reuters should focus, he said, on efforts by the industry to develop so-called reduced-risk products â those that deliver nicotine without the burning of tobacco and which the company says reduce harm. When pressed about the meetings with Vietnam, Cave thumped the table again: âIâm angry that youâre focusing on that, rather than the real issues that matter to real people.â In a subsequent email, Cave said: âRepresentatives from Philip Morris International met with delegates from Vietnamâ during the Delhi conference âto discuss policy issues and this complied fully with PMIâs internal procedures and the laws and regulations of Vietnam.â Delegates, Cave said inÂ separate interviews, are reluctant to meet openly with Philip Morris because they are afraid of being ânamed and shamedâ by anti-smoking groups. Some delegates questioned the extent to which Philip Morris shaped the decisions made at the Moscow conference, saying attendees genuinely disagreed on certain issues. Nuntavarn Vichit-Vadakan, a Thai delegate, oversaw many discussions as the chair of an FCTC committee at the Moscow conference. She said delegates differed over the regulation of e-cigarettes, for instance, and any lobbying the company carried out would not have determined the outcome. The Philip Morris documents leave questions unanswered. In some cases, the documents show the company hatching plans to change an anti-smoking regulation or to monitor activists, but donât always make clear to what extent or how the plans were executed, if at all. The 2014 PowerPoint presentation called for âachieving scrutinyâ of tobacco control advocates and said a âglobal project teamâ had been established for this purpose. It did not list what means would be used. In some instances, Philip Morrisâ lobbying plainly failed. In July 2015, the Ugandan parliament passed sweeping new anti-tobacco laws inspired by the treaty. All that was needed was President Yoweri Museveniâs signature, and the small African nation would become a leader on the continent in implementing a strict interpretation of the FCTC. Philip Morris sent an executive, a younger white man, to tell the septuagenarian president, who long ago had helped topple dictator Idi Amin, why the tobacco act was a bad idea. Sheila Ndyanabangi, Ugandaâs lead health official for tobacco issues who was present at the meeting, described the executiveâs approach as lecturing the statesman. âHe said, âUgandan tobacco will be too expensiveâ and âit will not be competitive,ââ Ndyanabangi said. Her account was confirmed by a senior Ugandan government official who was also present. Museveni stared for a moment at the Philip Morris executive and a representative from a major tobacco buyer whoâd come with him. The president then declared: âSlavery ended a long time ago.â There was a long silence in the room, recalled Ndyanabangi. Museveni said Uganda didnât need tobacco, and the meeting was over. The president signed the bill that September. Museveniâs office did not respond to requests for comment. Over time, however, the industryâs lobbying has slowed the treatyâs progress. At the biennial conferences, the discussions have changed. In Moscow, for instance, there was a strong focus on trade and taxes. âYou could see from the floor that interventions were very, very, very much focusing on the trade aspects, many times even putting trade over health,â the FCTCâs da Costa e Silva said in an interview last year. The composition of FCTC delegations sent by governments has changed to include more members who arenât involved in health policy. Thatâs in line with what Philip Morris and other tobacco companies want: Philip Morris, as well as British American Tobacco, has sought to move the balance of the membership away from public health officials and toward ministries like finance and trade. Such agencies, said the former Philip Morris executive, benefit from tobacco tax revenues and attach less weight to health concerns. âThe health department would just want tobacco to be banned, while for the finance ministry itâs more like how can we leverage or get as much money as we can,â he said. The object of Philip Morrisâ efforts, according to the 2014 PowerPoint on corporate affairs, is to âmove tobacco issues awayâ from health ministries and demonstrate there are broader public interests at play â that âitâs not about tobacco.â Cave, the Philip Morris corporate affairs executive, confirmed the company tries to persuade governments to change the composition of delegations. Health officials, he said, arenât equipped to handle the intricacies of issues such as taxation. âYouâre looking at illicit trade, youâre looking at tax regimes, youâre looking at international law,â he said. âNow each of these areas, itâs logical, if you want to really tackle the trade and tobacco smuggling, illicit trade, who would you go to? You wouldnât go to the health ministry.â âIâm angry that youâre focusing on that, rather than the real issues that matter to real people.â Reuters analyzed the rosters of the almost 3,500 accredited delegation members who have attended the seven FCTC conferences since 2006. The analysis found that there were more than six health delegates for every finance-related delegate in 2006. In Delhi last year, that ratio had fallen to just over three health delegates for every finance delegate. The number of delegates from finance, agriculture and trade fields has risen from a few dozen in 2006 to more than 100 in recent years. Vietnamâs delegation, for example, has changed markedly. At the first FCTC conference in 2006, none of its four delegates were from finance or trade ministries. By 2014, in Moscow, there were 13 delegates, with at least four from finance-related ministries, including the chief delegate.Â Vietnamâs foreign ministry did not respond to questions about the delegation. Da Costa e Silva isnât opposed to having delegates from trade ministries, but she says their primary focus needs to be on health.Â And she was concerned by the makeup of the Vietnamese delegation. In a letter to the Vietnamese prime ministerÂ in late 2015, she asked that tobacco industry employees be excluded from the delegation. If they werenât, she wrote, Vietnam might be âunable to play a full part in discussions.â In 2016, VietnamÂ brought 11 delegates to the conference, of whom six were from health agencies, including the chief representative. Some tobacco-control activists who attended the Delhi meeting in November say it was the worst so far in terms of passing new anti-smoking provisions. Matthew Myers, who heads the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said multiple countries came prepared to consciously block action. He said he heard delegates making arguments âI havenât heard in 25 years.â A Nigerian delegate, for instance, asked to remove a reference to âthe tobacco epidemicâ from a draft proposal on liability for tobacco-related harm, according to notes taken by anti-smoking groups. Asked for comment, Christiana Ukoli, head of the delegation in Delhi, said the âNigerian delegation strongly dissociates itself from [that] statement.â The Delhi conference ended as it began, with treaty Secretariat officials not knowing where Philip Morris had been or what it had done. The company had flown in a team of executives, used a squad of identical vans to ferry officials in New Delhi, and then left town without a trace. Just days after the FCTC conference in Moscow ended in October 2014, Philip Morris executive Gustavo Bosio sent an email to colleagues highlighting what he said was the companyâs success in pushing back on three treaty proposals related to trade issues. âThese excellent results are a direct consequence of the remarkable efforts of all PMI regions and markets during the past two years and throughout the intense week in Moscow,â wrote Bosio, then manager for international trade.

 ,07202017,Reuters,07132017,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A crisis between Qatar and four Arab countries is straining a Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen’s government in a two-year war against Iranian-aligned Houthis and slowing the alliance’s military advances. At the heart of the crisis is the accusation that Qatar supports the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement that coalition mainstays Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have designated a terrorist group. But Yemen’s government is packed with supporters of the Islah party, an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood, threatening the unity of the alliance which has already been weakened by the withdrawal of Qatar’s forces after the row erupted on June 5. “The Gulf rift has cast a shadow on the government and could split it as ministers linked to Islah sympathise with Qatar,” a senior official in the Yemeni government, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. The coalition is seeking to restore the internationally-recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and backs forces fighting Houthi rebels and troops loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Fighting near the Red Sea port city of al-Mokha, where a UAE-backed offensive was being prepared on the port of Hodeidah which handles most of Yemeni food imports, has slowed. “The fighting has been frozen since the start of the dispute with Qatar, which reflects the extent of the UAE concerns over the strength of Islah in the province,” a local official told Reuters. UAE officials did not respond to requests for comment. Saudi Arabia currently hosts the exiled Yemeni government which includes five cabinet ministers from the Islah party. The chief of staff also belongs to Islah and Vice President Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar is a close Islah ally. The party also has thousands of followers fighting against the Houthi forces who control the capital Sanaa with Saleh loyalists. Unusually in Yemen’s fractured political landscape, Islah has supporters in the north and south of the country. Since the Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, Islah has tried to distance itself from the Brotherhood, in deference to the government-in-exile’s Saudi hosts. The coalition depends heavily on Islah fighters on the ground. “Whatever Saudi Arabia’s current view of the Muslim Brotherhood in other countries, in Yemen they are natural allies against the Houthi-Saleh alliance,” April Longley Alley, a senior Arabian Peninsula analyst for the International Crisis Group (ICG) said. “In many fighting fronts in the north, tribesmen or soldiers associated with Islah are a critical, if not the most important, part of the anti-Houthi fighting force.” Saudi officials were not immediately available for comment. The Brotherhood has posed a big challenge to Arab rulers in the Middle East, where it has built a strong base opposed to the principle of dynastic rule. While Qatar has supported the movement, Gulf monarchies and emirates, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have spent billions trying to prevent the Brotherhood holding power in the Arab world since 2011 uprisings swept the region. The UAE, a crucial member of the coalition and which is more hostile to the Brotherhood than other members, appears to have been the most uncomfortable about its military fighting alongside Brotherhood-linked Islah forces. The UAE has also built a southern army that remains under the influence of southern Yemeni politicians who are hostile to the Brotherhood’s ideology and want to break with the north. On the frontlines in the south, the offensive against the Houthis and Saleh forces has slowed down because of the UAE position on Islah, local officials said. UAE officials were not available to comment. Fighting in the two strategic provinces of Taiz and Marib has halted for more than a month, except for occasional air strikes and naval shelling on the rebels. Cracks in the Yemeni government on the Qatar crisis were  highlighted when the quarrel broke out with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates imposing travel and diplomatic sanctions on Qatar. Yemen’s government rushed to express solidarity with Qatar on the state news agency website. Within two hours that message of support was wiped off. The next day the government cut ties with Doha, falling into line with Saudi and the others. ","

 ,07202017,Reuters,07132017,"BOGOTA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Congress in the Dominican Republic rejected upholding the nation’s total ban on abortion this week, approving a step that would allow the procedure for ending life-threatening pregnancies and those resulting from rape or incest. The lawmakers in the lower house voted against a decision in May by the Dominican Senate, which turned down recommendations made by President Danilo Medina to amend the criminal code and ease the nation’s abortion ban. The Dominican Republic is one of seven countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that have absolute bans on abortion. The decision by the Dominican Congress on Tuesday would allow abortion in cases of rape or incest, when a mother’s life is in danger or when a foetus would not survive the pregnancy. The contrasting decisions in each house pave the way for another vote to be introduced. Hopes have been raised among abortion rights activists that the country’s ban on abortion - dating back to 1884 - can be finally repealed. “The vote has shown a clear majority of house representatives standing with Dominican women’s fundamental rights to decide over their bodies and to be treated with dignity. This must be celebrated,” Robin Guittard, Caribbean campaigner at rights group Amnesty International, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The earlier vote by the Senate “would have virtually maintained a full ban on accessing abortion services ... in a context of high rates of unsafe abortions, maternal mortality and adolescent pregnancies,” he said. It is not clear when a new vote on the ban will occur, and it could be months before lawmakers start debating the controversial issue again, campaigners say. As in the past, moves to repeal the ban will face staunch opposition from conservative groups and the influential Catholic Church. Janet Camilo, the country’s minister for women, has said the abortion ban is a health care issue for women and decisions not to repeal it were based on sexism. Blanket abortion bans put women’s lives at risk by forcing women to undergo dangerous backstreet abortions, which were the cause of at least one in 10 maternal deaths in Latin America in 2014, according to Amnesty International. In recent years, the United Nations has urged the Dominican Republic to lift its abortion ban. Activists say the country should seize the opportunity to allow women to access a safe abortion in a country where more than 90,000 unsafe abortions occur each year. “Now it’s imperative that Dominican lawmakers ensure that the new penal code proposed guarantees human rights and access to justice for all girls and women,” said Catalina Martinez, Latin America director at the U.S.-based Center of Reproductive Rights.

,07202017,Investopedia,07132017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A minimum wage is the lowest wage per hour that a worker may be paid, as mandated by federal law. The minimum wage is a legally mandated price floor on hourly wages, below which non-exempt workers may not be offered or accept a job. As of 2017, the federal minimum wage rate in the United States is $7.25 per hour. This means that it is illegal for an American worker to sell their labor for less than $7.25 per hour unless the worker falls into a category specifically exempted from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Minimum wage laws were first used in Australia and New Zealand in an attempt to raise the income of unskilled workers. Most modern developed economies and many underdeveloped economies enforce a national minimum wage. Examples of countries with no established minimum wage include Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Singapore. Even though the United States enforces a federal minimum wage, individual states, cities, and localities may also pass different minimum wage requirements as long as the stipulated hourly wage is not lower than the federal minimum wage. An employer who is subject to the federal and state minimum wage requirement must pay the higher of the two. States will usually set a minimum wage that is reflective of the cost of living in the region. For example, the state of Massachusetts has a minimum wage of $11 per hour, compared to Arkansas which has a minimum wage rate of $8.50. As of 2017, minimum wage rates exceeded the federal rate in 29 of the 50 states, led by Massachusetts and Washington at $11 per hour. Some states like Alabama, New Hampshire, and South Carolina have no state minimum wage. Cities and municipalities may also set a minimum wage for their residents which must be higher than the federal minimum wage. For example, even though the state of Illinois set its minimum wage at $8.25, the city of Chicago has a minimum wage of $11.00. The government periodically assesses the federal minimum wage level for changes in inflation or cost of living. The table shows the minimum wage set at each state level. Some states have set their minimum wage higher than the federal minimum wage, others have set the same minimum wage as the federal rate, and a select few don't have a minimum wage requirement. In the latter case, the federal minimum wage of $7.25 will apply. Like all price floors, a minimum wage law only has a measurable effect when set above the market clearing price for a transaction. For example, a minimum wage of $10 per hour will have no effect for workers whose marginal productivity in a given line of work is greater than $10 per hour. The legal supply and demand remains unchanged for such labor. For those with a marginal productivity less than $10 per hour, however, a $10 per hour minimum wage creates an artificial shortage of profitable labor. An unskilled worker with a marginal productivity of $8 per hour in California or Massachusetts can only offer to work at a loss to his or her potential employer — that is, the employer can only hire the worker if they are willing to pay more in salary than marginal revenue produced by the worker, or unless the employer incorrectly estimates the worker’s marginal productivity to be above $10 per hour. Several groups of individuals are exempt from being paid the minimum wage. Individuals that fall into these groups are usually paid below the minimum wage in order to incentivize companies to hire them. Low-skilled laborers in the United States can be exempted from the minimum wage if a sizable portion of their income is derived from tips. If exempted, a lower minimum wage of $2.13 per hour applies to tipped employees who regularly receive more than $30 in tips per month, or if the total tips retained in addition to the hourly wage rate is equal to or greater than the federal minimum wage. In a case where the employee’s total tips and hourly rate falls below the minimum wage, the employer is expected to compensate the employee for the shortfall. A full-time student working for a university, retail store, or service establishment can be paid not less than 85% of the minimum wage. Although students may work up to 8 hours per day, they cannot work more than 20 hours per week when school is in session. In addition, students in a technical or vocational program can be paid not less than 75% of the minimum wage throughout their active enrollment in the program. Workers below 20 years of age may be paid $4.25 per hour by federal law, until they pass the three-month probationary period, after which the employer must convert their pay structure to the federal minimum wage rate. Finally, workers with physical or mental disabilities can be paid less than the federal minimum wage according to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Disabilities which can affect production capacity include blindness, cerebral palsy, alcohol and drug addiction, mental illness, and developmental disabilities. There is a high elasticity of demand for low-skilled labor. This means that a small change in the price for low-skilled labor tends to have a large effect on its demand. For these reasons, too high a minimum wage can lead to increasing unemployment among the low-skilled. In modern times, the proliferation of improved technology also increases the marginal rate of technical substitution for low-skilled labor. When the cost of labor increases, companies find it increasingly profitable to switch to labor-replacing technology, such as the decision made by Wendy’s Co. in 2016 to introduce self-serve kiosks in response to higher minimum wage laws.

 ,07202017,CNBC,07132017,"UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, driven by its pharmacy benefit management business, medical cost control and raised its full-year earnings forecast. The insurer's results come after a second attempt to pass a health-care legislation in the Senate collapsed late on Monday, with U.S. President Donald Trump calling for an outright repeal of Obamacare and others seeking a change in direction toward bipartisanship. Last year, UnitedHealth pulled out of the 2017 Obamacare individual exchanges and took charges for the plans. The insurance, which was set up as part of former President Barack Obama's health reform law, had higher cost members than expected last year and many insurers lost money. UnitedHealth, which sells employer-based insurance as well as Medicare and Medicaid plans, said net earnings attributable to shareholders rose to $2.28 billion, or $2.32 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $1.75 billion, or $1.81 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, UnitedHealth earned $2.46 per share, beating average estimate of $2.38, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mizuho Securities USA analyst Sheryl Skolnick said UnitedHealth 'means' outstanding execution, but this quarter seems particularly good. Revenue from its Optum business, which manages drug benefits and offers healthcare data analytics services, rose about 10 percent to $22.67 billion. Total revenue rose 7.7 percent to $50.05 billion, largely in line with estimates. The insurer said its withdrawal from Obamacare individual markets, combined with the health insurance tax deferral, reduced second-quarter revenue by about $1.8 billion and lowered revenue growth rate by 4.5 percent. The company said medical care ratio of 82.2 percent increased 20 basis points year-over-year, as a 150 basis point increase from the health insurance tax deferral was offset by an improved business mix, product performance. Medical ratio is the amount an insurer spends on medical claims compared with the insurance premiums that it brings in. That the medical care ratio has been well controlled recently, especially since the exit from the exchanges ... makes us even more comfortable that the company is years ahead of peers, Skolnick wrote in a note. The company raised its forecast for 2017 net earnings to $9.20 to $9.35 per share and adjusted net earnings to $9.75 to $9.90 per share. UnitedHealth had earlier forecast earnings of $9.10 to $9.30 per share and adjusted earnings of $9.65 to $9.85 per share. ",Insurer UnitedHealth's quarterly profit rises 30 percent
Christina Farr,07202017,CNBC,07132017,"One Medical, the venture-backed primary care group with 60 clinics nationwide, has tapped an executive from health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group to be its new CEO. Amir Rubin, an executive vice president in UnitedHealth's Optum division, was named to the top post on Tuesday. Tom X. Lee, who founded One Medical and ran the company for a decade, will stay on as executive chairman. Rubin said he intends to spend his first few months building out the business by opening new clinics and signing up more corporate customers. One Medical sells memberships to individuals as well as to companies that offer its primary care service as a benefit. ""We have seen a tremendous (revenue) growth in our corporate relationships,"" Rubin said in an interview. Individual members pay an annual fee of $149 to $199 and get access to same-day appointments that they can book online or with the mobile app. Corporate rates vary based on the number of employees and the extent of their benefits. Rubin, who was previously CEO of Stanford Health Care, expects the enterprise business to become a bigger part of One Medical's overall revenue. One way the company is attracting large employers is by opening small clinics on corporate campuses, similar to a model used by start-ups like Crossover Health. One Medical has raised more than $180 million in financing from investors including Benchmark and Alphabet's GV. In addition to online scheduling, the company offers a virtual medical team, a suite of mobile apps and has built its own electronic medical system. Rubin has no immediate plans to raise further rounds of financing even with the company's ""ambitions for continued growth."" Rubin didn't rule out future acquisitions of digital health start-ups. In 2016, the company bought Rise, a nutrition coaching app, to bolster its digital medicine offerings. Rubin also said he ""doesn't anticipate"" a sale to a major health system, despite a clear trend in the market toward consolidation. The company declined to share its valuation, though it's reportedly worth at least $1 billion. Correction: This article originally missatated Rubin's title at UnitedHealth.

Elizabeth Gurdus,07202017,CNBC,07132017,"The GOP's failure to pass health care reform has shaken the market, so much so that Jim Cramer made the case for cordoning off Wall Street from Main Street. While Wall Street obsesses over the FANG stocks, Cramer's acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet, for being the few plays immune to Washington's turmoil, strong earnings reports are overlooked or even met with disdain. ""That's why I want to sing the praises of a bunch of companies that have reported this earnings season, companies that would be getting a lot more attention and love right now if Washington wasn't making us feel so pessimistic, so cynical,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. One such company was UnitedHealth. The largest health care provider in the country, UnitedHealth reported its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, topping the Street's estimates. Cramer's go-to UnitedHealth analyst, Mizuho Securities' Sheryl Skolnik, called it ""an outstanding report,"" but the stock closed up only 0.2 percent, a mere 50 cents. ""Don't let its measly 50-cent gain fool you,"" Cramer warned. ""United Health reported a great quarter. Its stock's a buy."" The technology sector may be seen by the stock market as the hotbed of growth and the rally's main driver, but Cramer wanted to put its performance into context. ""It's not like tech is vaulting into the stratosphere while everything else does nothing,"" Cramer said. ""What we have here is a broad-based rally that's taking up all sorts of stocks, proving once again that diversification is the only free lunch in this business."" In the last six months, the tech stocks in the S&P 500 rallied 15 percent on average, but the health care stocks rose over 13 percent, with industrials, materials and financials up 8 percent. So Cramer used the charts of technician Bob Moreno, publisher of RightViewTrading.com and Cramer's colleague at RealMoney.com, to highlight some of the overlooked sectors' top names. In light of Netflix's strong earnings report, Cramer knows CEO Reed Hastings understands three things: content can be king, people love bargains, and bigwig money managers will invest in internet stocks with promise. ""Netflix is, to the naked eye, a two-pronged success. If your company can produce local content that people love worldwide and you only charge them $8 or €8 a month, you'll land and expand. You'll grow and grow and grow,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. But the third element, the willingness of Wall Street financiers to catch and pay for the next hot internet-related trend, was what really drove Hastings' success so far, Cramer said. Cramer also analyzed the action in Straight Path Communications, using the stock's moves to make the case that markets are not, as some economic theories say, perfectly efficient. Verizon recently announced it would buy Straight Path, which owns bandwidth licenses for 5G networks, for $184 a share after a bidding war with AT&T that sent the stock price soaring from $36, where it stood before the bids began. ""The action in Straight Path Communications has been very exciting, but I wouldn't call it efficient,"" Cramer said. ""The reason you can make money in individual stocks — as long as you do the homework — is that markets are rarely super efficient, the conventional wisdom is often wrong, and there are often huge opportunities there for the taking if you know where to look. Straight Path had a lot going against it, sure, absolutely, but at the end of the day they owned some insanely valuable spectrum assets that ultimately made AT&T and Verizon willing to pay through the nose to buy the whole company. That's what really mattered."" Finally, Cramer spoke with Hamid Moghadam, the CEO of warehouses real estate investment trust Prologis, to check in on the REIT space and see how the industry is building on the rise of e-commerce. ""It's really broader than e-commerce,"" Moghadam told Cramer on Tuesday. ""I mean, it's all consumption-related and, you know, supply has been very disciplined in the last couple of years and demand has been really strong, so the combination of those two [has] made the best market of my career."" And as data becomes increasingly important to technology companies working on the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, Moghadam said his company is well-positioned to take advantage of the information boom. ""I think in 10 years we're going to think about our businesses, not just the real estate business, but also a very significant data business, and I think that data is going to help our customers, it's going to help our own decision-making, and who knows? If we're really successful at this, it could be a separate business that could be valued separately by the market,"" the CEO said. ""It's way too early to get that far ahead of our speed, but I'm really excited about those opportunities."" In Cramer's lightning round, he flew through his take on some callers' favorite stocks, including: United Parcel Service: ""UPS is getting its act together and they are levered to e-commerce. No, you don't want to sell. We're not going with that. We like UPS."" McKesson Corporation: ""I have to tell you, long term buy.

Christine Wang,07202017,CNBC,07132017,"A new official analysis released Wednesday finds that repealing much of Obamacare without a replacement law would increase the number of people without health insurance by 32 million people, double insurance premiums in the individual plan market and leave most of the United States without an insurer selling such plans by 2026. The report comes as Republican leaders in the Senate, desperate to pass some kind of health-care law, have said that next week they might consider a possible Obamacare repeal bill that could eventually be amended to include a replacement. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that with a repeal-but-no replacement bill the number of uninsured is expected to be 17 million higher than if Obamacare remains in place. And by 2020 there would be 20 million more uninsured people, CBO said. That tally would grow to 32 million by 2026, the report said. The projections assume the end of the Obamacare rule requiring most Americans to have insurance or pay a find, the end of subsidies to help low- and middle-income people buy individual plans, and an end in 2020 to federal funding for the expansion of Medicaid to more poor adults under the Affordable Care Act. In January, CBO had issued a report with similar estimates, which were based on a bill passed by Congress in 2015, which was vetoed by then-President Barack Obama. Like that report, the new CBO analysis is almost certain to make it politically difficult, if not impossible, for Republican Congressional leaders to pass a repeal bill without having a replacement bill in hand at the same time. The CBO has not yet issued a report on the leading Senate bill to replace Obamacare, which does not have enough GOP senators to pass at the moment. Tweet The CBO's new report projected that a repeal-without-replacement would lead average premiums in the individual health insurance market to rise by about 25 percent relative to the current Obamacare law next year. That increase ""would reach about 50 percent in 2020, and premiums would about double by 2026,"" the CBO report found. Those premium hikes would occur in the ""non-group market,"" or the private insurance market that serves people who do not get insurance through an employers. Tweet And CBO said that ""about half of the nation's population would live in areas having no insurer participating in the nongroup market in 2020 because of downward pressure on enrollment and upward pressure on premiums."" ""That share would continue to increase, extending to about three-quarters of the population by 2026,"" the report said. CBO also said that repealing many provisions of the Affordable Care Act, as Obamacare is formally known, would decrease federal deficits by $473 billion from 2017 through 2026. Republican leaders in the Senate have unsuccessfully struggled for weeks to pass a bill that would replace large parts of Obamacare, and a frustrated President Donald Trump in reaction suggested Monday that Obamacare be repealed outright. Tweet The Senate  next week expects to consider a bill to either replace Obamacare, or repeal it, and then allow a replacement to be crafted later. During a lunch meeting Wednesday, Trump pushed Senate Republicans to forge an agreement on health-care legislation before leaving town for the August recess. ""We have to stay here. We shouldn't leave town, and we should hammer this out and get it done,"" the president said. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., said, in reaction to the CBO report, said, ""Repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement plan would have disastrous effects on people's lives and our health care system."" ""This course of action is just a hasty and reckless attempt by Republican leadership to make good on a campaign slogan when, instead, we should focus on working together across party lines to do what President Trump has said time and time again he wants to do: provide better health care at a lower cost for every American,"" Carper said.

 ,07202017,CNBC,07132017,"China's Dalian Wanda Group did not fund a spate of deals made by AMC Entertainment Holdings, the U.S. cinema chain majority owned by Wanda said late on Tuesday, after reports that Beijing was cracking down on the Chinese firm's overseas deals. AMC's shares dived over 10 percent on Monday after sources said regulators in China had told banks to stop providing funding for several of Dalian Wanda's overseas acquisitions amid broader curbs on companies moving funds overseas. The curbs on Wanda, announced at a meeting in June, focused on six overseas deals, four of which have already been completed, an internal bank document seen by Reuters showed. AMC said deals for Starplex Cinemas, Odeon & UCI Cinemas, Nordic Cinema Group and Carmike Cinemas completed between 2015 and earlier this year were fully funded by the firm's own funds and loans from U.S.-based banks. ""At no time was Wanda ever a source of funding for any of these acquisitions or individual theater purchases,"" AMC said in a statement. Wanda bought AMC for $2.6 billion in 2012, part of a broader push by the Chinese company firm into cinemas. The cinema chain added it had also never ""never received committed financing from any bank headquartered in mainland China for any purpose, including for acquisitions"". The most recent four deals were funded by loans from syndicates of U.S. banks taken out by AMC and from AMC's own cash reserves. Beijing is on a major drive to control risks in its financial system, including firms taking on excessive levels of debt to fund overseas deals. Chinese authorities clamped down on capital outflows and overseas acquisitions last year. Rooted in property, Wanda is one of a handful of Chinese conglomerates that have expanded aggressively abroad over the past few years, into areas beyond their original business. It is controlled by one of China's richest men, Wang Jianlin. AMC's chief executive Adam Aron said in the statement that Wanda ""does not actively participate in the day-to-day running of AMC"" beyond its three seats on the company's board. ""AMC is an American company run from its Leawood, Kansas, headquarters by our management teams located in the U.S. and Europe,"" he said. AMC is the top cinema chain in the United States, and has around 1,000 theaters around the world. ",Cinema chain AMC says deals not funded by Chinese parent Wanda
 ,07202017,CNBC,07132017,"A secretive U.S. government panel has objected to at least nine acquisitions of U.S. companies by foreign buyers so far this year, people familiar with the matter said, a historically high number that bodes poorly for China's overseas buying spree. The objections indicate that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews acquisitions by foreign entities for potential national security risks, is becoming more risk-averse under President Donald Trump. Chinese companies and investors eyeing U.S. assets could face more roadblocks as a result, at a time when the Chinese government is also restricting the flow of capital out of China following a bonanza of Chinese overseas deals. There have been 87 announced acquisitions of U.S. companies by Chinese firms so far in 2017, the highest on record and up from 77 deals in the corresponding period in 2016. CFIUS's more conservative stance towards deals coincides with growing political and economic tensions between the United States and China. On Wednesday the two countries failed to agree on major new steps to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China. Since the start of the year, CFIUS has sent letters to companies involved in at least nine deals to say they would be blocked based on measures they have proposed to address potential national security risks, the people familiar said. Many of these deals are in the technology sector, the sources said. A rise in cyber security threats and rapid advances in technology makes it more difficult to establish whether a deal poses any threat, lawyers who represent companies before CFIUS said. An initial objection by the watchdog does not necessarily kill the deal immediately. Some companies this year have chosen to keep their CFIUS filings alive by proposing new mitigation measures, while others have pulled their applications and canceled their deals, the people said. They asked not be identified because interactions between CFIUS and the companies are confidential. ""CFIUS decisions are highly sensitive and we are not going to comment on rumors of their outcome,"" a White House spokeswoman said. A spokesman at the Treasury Department declined to comment. Treasury leads CFIUS with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin serving as chairman. Most of the deals that CFIUS has sought to block this year have not been announced. Among the companies that have disclosed they have withdrawn their CFIUS applications and canceled their deals are U.S. electronics maker Inseego Corp, which tried to sell its MiFi mobile hotspot business to Chinese smartphone maker TCL Industries Holdings, and Texas oil producer ExL Petroleum Management LLC, which sought to sell its assets to Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman's L1 Energy. By comparison, in the entirety of 2014, the last year for which CFIUS has released official data, nine deals were withdrawn after CFIUS began an investigation. Several more companies face protracted CFIUS reviews amid delays after Trump took office in filling important mid-level political positions at several of the 16 government departments and agencies that comprise CFIUS. CFIUS is on track to review a record-setting 250 to 300 transactions in 2017, according to Anne Salladin, a CFIUS expert with the law firm Stroock and Stroock and Lavan LLP - up sharply from 147 deals in 2014. The backlog is leading many companies that fail to gain CFIUS clearance within the standard 75 days allocated for review to refile their applications. Refiling resets the clock and gives up to another 75 days to complete the national security review and try to resolve potential issues. A number of companies have said in regulatory filings that their high-profile deals are before CFIUS. They include Chinese payments company Ant Financial's $1.2 billion acquisition of U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International and China-backed buyout fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners' $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. chip maker Lattice Semiconductor. In addition, investment firm China Oceanwide Holdings Group's $2.7 billion acquisition of U.S. life insurer Genworth Financial and China-based semiconductor investment fund Unic Capital Management's $580 million acquisition of U.S. semiconductor testing equipment company Xcerra are also with the watchdog. Ant Financial has refiled its MoneyGram deal with CFIUS once, while Canyon Bridge and China Oceanwide have refiled their deals twice, according to company disclosures and Reuters reports. Unic is still on its first filing with CFIUS on its Xcerra deal, company disclosures and Reuters reports showed. Of the two dozen political appointee positions in the Treasury Department just three have been confirmed by U.S. lawmakers. A key CFIUS nomination is that of former Allen & Overy LLP lawyer Heath Tarbert, who has been appointed as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for international markets and development, and has yet to be confirmed. The U.S. is not alone in concerns about foreign dealmaking: Germany, for one, raised the bar on criteria for overseas acquirers seeking to snap up domestic targets in tech-heavy industries.

Lauren Thomas,07202017,CNBC,07132017,"The best days for American retailers are ahead, Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday at a summit hosted by the National Retail Federation. ""I promise you that,"" Pence told the crowd. More than 200 retail representatives from across the country, including small-business retailers, national executives and state officials, attended the Retail Advocates Summit in Washington, D.C. This year's convention focused on the importance of tax reform for retailers and their employees. ""As retail goes, so goes America,"" Pence said. ""This president is going to work with this Congress, this year, and pass the largest tax cuts since the days of Ronald Reagan."" The current tax code creates ""huge barriers"" to creating more retail jobs, he added. ""The internal revenue code is [currently] two times as long as the Bible, with no good news,"" he joked. The GOP has promised to simplify the tax code, making the language ""fairer"" and ""simpler."" On Tuesday, Pence took the opportunity to speak about Trump's latest efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. He opened the event by detailing Republicans' latest push in health care — probably not the conversation many retailers were expecting to have. Lately, Republicans have been facing heated pressure from big businesses, including retailers, to move on from health-care legislation to passing some sort of tax reform. Many executives have stressed the importance of securing a major reduction in the corporate tax rate, which currently stands at 35 percent. On Tuesday, Pence suggested to the retailers a cut to 15 percent. Though both White House and Republican leaders have proposed steep cuts, analysts say divisions within the GOP and the stalemate on health care have diminished the prospect of aggressive action. Retail executives in particular remain concerned about one of House Speaker Paul Ryan's proposals: a border adjustment tax, also referred to as BAT. But Pence didn't mention BAT — a definite elephant in the room — during his Tuesday speech. The consumer-facing industry has been leading the fight against the proposed measure, which would tax imports into the United States. In May, for example, a group of retail CEOs met with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to express frustration regarding the import tax, with many arguing this plan would cause companies to hike prices and pass the burden on to consumers. Present at the May meeting were executives from Coca-Cola, Dollar General and J.C. Penney. The estate tax, however, did come under fire. ""[U]nder President Trump we will repeal the death tax once and for all,"" Pence said, to a heavy round of applause. This is important to retailers because some closely held businesses are subject to the estate tax. ""Less regulation, lower taxes, better infrastructure,"" he said. The president wants retailers to be able to compete on a ""level playing field"" with companies all across the world, he said. [We] ""will put retailers back on the path to jobs and growth and back to competitiveness."" ","'As retail goes, so goes America,' VP Pence tells a room full of retailers"

"Benjamin Ward, CEO of Maricann Group Inc.",07202017,CNBC,07132017,"There's a groundswell of support for cannabis legalisation in the United States, with 29 states, as well as Washington D.C. approved for medicinal cannabis, and eight for lifestyle use. Things are farther ahead in Canada. Regulations for production and sales have been in place for over three years, and the federal government has introduced a timeline to full federal legalisation for lifestyle use in July 2018. Capacity in Canada for lifestyle alone is projected to reach ""5 billion dollars per year to start,"" according to a recent report from Deloitte. Yet, while many investors focus on opportunities stemming from Canada's upcoming legalization – plus the longer-term investment potential in what will likely be a growing number of American states – they are missing the global shift in cannabis towards Western Europe. That's where the action is really heating up. The population of the United States is approximately 325 million. There are 35 million living in Canada. But compare that to the European Union's population of 510 million. Germany, with more than 80 million people alone, legalized medicinal cannabis in January of this year. Add that to Italy's nascent existing medicinal cannabis program. These European markets are increasingly important to the cannabis sector. Each has a well-funded medical system, residents who seek natural and complementary therapies, and a government-supported mandate to stop the rising tide of opiate addiction related to chronic pain treatment. Taken together, these and other European examples show that we're seeing traditionally conservative attitudes shift as medicinal cannabis is legalized. That also means investors in cannabis who focus solely on North America are missing the huge potential found across the Atlantic. Those investors restricting their cannabis investments to this side of the ocean – and in the United States in particular – are left navigating an array of legislation on a state-by-state basis, prohibitive out-of-state investment regulations, and a prohibitive tax code. These investors miss the boat as they churn through such choppy water. In Germany, cannabis will be produced by licenced producers and distributed to pharmacies like any other medication, with each prescription eligible for full reimbursement from health insurance. In their patient-driven markets, Germans, Italians and other Europeans are demanding the alternative of cannabis over opiates. In our view, people who think opiates are the only answer to pain relief have a similar mis-perception as people who still think medicinal cannabis is nothing more than smoking up with their doctor's permission. They are both wrong. In short, medical cannabis is about personalized and effective medicine. It's not about getting high. The Europeans know that, as we do in North America. As Germany moves smartly down this path of medicinal cannabis, the rest of Europe will soon follow. And to ignore 500 million people in a stable economy is a mistake. We're at the start of the global revolution. We all need to be looking to Europe next. ",Medical marijuana is really taking off in Europe-commentary
Rachel Cao,07202017,CNBC,07132017,"If you're looking for affordable health care, consider seeking medical attention outside the U.S. As costs continue to climb, retirees increasingly are looking abroad for less costly coverage. Below are the five best countries in which to find affordable health care, according to InternationalLiving.com. Just as in the U.S., metropolitan areas in these countries will typically provide better quality of care than rural ones, says International Living senior editor and author Dan Prescher, and often matches or beats care in the U.S. Large clinics and hospitals in Panama are often affiliated with U.S. counterparts such as the Cleveland Clinic and John Hopkins Medicine International. While most expats tend to pay out-of-pocket, International Living says it's best to still have private insurance. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Panama offers coverage for as little as $80 per month for those under age 65. Older expats or those with pre-existing conditions may opt for a hospital membership that costs anywhere between $90 and $175 per month, according to International Living. Unlike many insurance plans, some hospitals may offer limited coverage for pre-existing conditions after a waiting period of one or two years. Mexico is known for providing health care at a fraction of U.S. costs. Expats can expect to pay half or less for medical expenses and prescription drugs. Legal Mexican residents have access to two health care systems: government-run public health or private. The government-run systems offers basic care with costs running as low as a few hundred dollars per year. Many expats also use private health care where you can pay with cash or use insurance. A standard visit to the doctor can run $30 to $40. The World Health Organization ranks Colombia's health-care system 22nd worldwide, which is higher than both Canada (ranked 30th) and the U.S. (ranked 37th). Anyone under age 60 with a national ID card, even those with pre-existing conditions, can apply for government health insurance. Co-pays average $3. Many ex-pat retirees pay a premium of $70 to $85 for a couple, according to International Living. Private health insurance can also be added. Premiums vary yet are still are significantly lower than what a couple would pay in the U.S. There are two medical systems in Costa Rica: a government-run one and the private medical system, with most people choosing to combine both. Caja is Costa Rica's universal health care system, which is available for both citizens and legal residents. As a Caja user, you pay an income-based monthly fee that covers the applicant and a dependent spouse. The fee is about $75 to $150, according to International Living, and provides complete coverage, including doctor and specialist visits, diagnostic testing and prescriptions. However, a major drawback is long waiting times for specialized surgeries, since Caja covers a majority of the population. The private medical system is another option. A doctor's visit there is $50, ultrasounds run $75 and major surgeries are usually half to a quarter of costs in the U.S., according to International Living. Malaysia's most popular areas of treatment are cosmetic surgery, dental work and dermatology, attracting 1 million medical tourists worldwide in 2016, according to International Living. George Town and Kuala Lumpur are the main medical centers. Most Malaysian doctors were trained in the U.S., Australia or the U.K., and all are English-speaking, a major perk for ex-pats. Malaysia has about 11 hospitals with Joint Commission International (JCI) certification, considered the gold standard for health-care providers worldwide.

Healthcare is front and center in Washington once more, and lawmakers have made little progress toward making anticipated changes on the insurance front. In the absence of more reform efforts, health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) continues to walk its own path, making key strategic decisions intended to support the insurer's profitability while still retaining its customer base. Coming into Tuesday's second-quarter financial report, UnitedHealth investors were optimistic that the insurance company's efforts would pay off with broad growth in sales and earnings. The company's results largely bore those expectations out, and UnitedHealth again boosted its 2017 profit guidance to reflect the success it has had. Let's look more closely at UnitedHealth and what its results mean for investors going forward. Image source: UnitedHealth. UnitedHealth's second-quarter results continued its string of solid performance. Revenue of $50.05 billion was up 7.7% from year-ago levels, almost exactly matching the consensus forecast among investors. Net income soared by a third to $2.35 billion, and even after allowing for extraordinary items, adjusted earnings of $2.46 per share topped what those following the stock had expected to see by $0.08 per share. Looking more closely at how UnitedHealth did, the company's two main segments had more balanced contributions to its growth. The UnitedHealthcare insurance division revenue climbed almost 9% to $40.8 billion, as strength in its Medicare and retirement, community and state, and global segments offset a slight revenue decline from employer and individual plans. UnitedHealth served 195,000 more people during the quarter than it did three months ago, as new awards in several states offset seasonal workforce reductions with some of the insurer's private-employer customers. Margin improvement helped boost operating earnings to $2.2 billion. UnitedHealth's Optum health services unit also showed signs of renewed growth. Revenue climbed almost 10%, with particularly strong results for the OptumHealth health-plan management business and the OptumInsight revenue management and business process business. The OptumRx pharmacy benefit management service still lagged somewhat, but it managed to post a 5% rise in segment sales. UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley was pleased with the performance of the company. ""Continued strong revenue growth from new business and exceptional customer retention reflects the confidence customers place in our commitment to and effectiveness in meeting their healthcare needs,"" Hemsley said. Investors will be curious to see whether UnitedHealth can keep up its streak of favorable claims performance. During the second quarter, the company said that medical reserves development added $200 million to performance, compared to a $100 million headwind in the year-ago quarter. Improved business mix and product performance also helped offset the impact of tax deferral issues. With a medical care ratio of 82.2%, UnitedHealth remains healthy. UnitedHealth again boosted its projections for the full year. The health insurer didn't change its revenue guidance from its previous level of around $200 billion mark, but adjusted earnings are now projected to come in between $9.75 and $9.90 per share. That's a rise of $0.05 to $0.10 per share from the previous quarter's guidance, and that shows that UnitedHealth isn't concerned about the potential impact of healthcare reform efforts on its bottom line. Going forward, it will be interesting to see how UnitedHealth responds if changes to the Affordable Care Act take place. The company has slashed its coverage under the ACA in 2017, retreating to only three states compared to its 34-state network in 2016. If reform makes it more profitable for insurance companies to maintain plans under a federal framework, then UnitedHealth might return to the market, and that could actually make the area a growth driver again. UnitedHealth shareholders were reasonably happy with the company's performance, and the stock rose slightly in pre-market trading following the announcement. Investors will have to deal with uncertainty in the health insurance field for a while, but they can expect UnitedHealth to keep pressing forward and making the most of whatever opportunities it can capitalize on in the future.

Dan Caplinger,07202017,Fool,07132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Most Americans get their healthcare through a managed care organization, but nearly no one truly knows the ins and outs of the health insurance program they have. Managed care organizations are plans that insurance companies set up as a framework for healthcare benefits, and the idea behind managed care is to drive behavior that minimizes costs for benefits providers while also giving plan participants financial incentives to control their healthcare expenses. As a healthcare consumer, you'll likely have to deal with a managed care organization as a participant. As an investor, you can profit from the efforts that insurers take to make their managed care organizations as financially efficient and lucrative as possible. Managed Care Plan Insurer Market Capitalization 5-Year Average Annual Return UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) $179 billion 29.8% Humana (NYSE:HUM) $34 billion 27.6% Centene (NYSE:CNC) $14 billion 36.4% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. There are several types of managed care organizations, including the following: In addition, fee-for-service plans are a different type of health insurance coverage that doesn't use managed care practices. Instead, the plan simply reimburses all or a portion of medical costs for services provided, irrespective of the professional providing the services. Image source: Getty Images. Health maintenance organizations were initially created in the early 1970s. The key attribute of the HMO is the primary care physician, a single medical professional who has primary responsibility over the patient's care. The primary care physician is typically a general practitioner who can provide initial diagnoses of a wide range of problems, but for patients, the defining characteristic is that if specialty medical services are required, then the primary care physician must refer the patient to a specific specialist. Similarly, except in emergency situations, admissions to hospitals and other medical services may need pre-authorization from the primary care physician. If you don't follow the HMO rules, then your insurance can deny coverage or give you less comprehensive benefits. HMO users must also typically visit in-network medical professionals if they want coverage for services. Preferred provider organizations are groups of medical professionals, healthcare institutions, and other providers of healthcare services who gather together into a common network. A PPO doesn't absolutely require that a patient use medical professionals within the network in order to get benefits, but it reserves the best benefits for those who stay in-network. Because of the greater flexibility of PPOs compared to HMOs, premiums on PPOs are often a bit higher, but some patients prefer them because of the right to keep their own doctor as long as they're willing potentially to pay an out-of-network surcharge. Point-of-service plans incorporate different aspects of other managed care organizations. You'll typically choose a primary care physician from within a network of professionals, and in-network referrals are made easier than going beyond the network. Patients are also financially rewarded for staying in network by getting reduced rates, although, again, coverage for out-of-network professionals isn't completely unavailable as it might be for an HMO. Independent practice associations are groups of physicians that make contracts with managed care organizations like HMOs, PPOs, or point-of-service plans to provide healthcare services. IPAs have been the medical profession's response to certain health insurance innovations, allowing doctors and other healthcare professionals to organize on their own and determine their own frameworks for working together to treat patients. As a patient, choosing the right managed care organization can result in savings on healthcare costs. The most important thing to remember is that lower premiums don't always mean lower costs. HMOs often have the lowest premiums, but if you expect to run afoul of their provisions, their inflexibility can lead to lack of coverage for certain costly items. In those cases, the higher premiums that more flexible plan options charge can still be worth it if the coverage you get is more comprehensive. As an investor, the question to ask from a health insurance provider is whether their managed care organizations are effective in controlling costs and maximizing profit. The more that a company can convince its members to take advantage of options that save costs both for members and insurers alike, the better the overall relationship will be. UnitedHealth, Humana, and Centene all have expertise in handling managed care organization frameworks, and they've been quite successful in driving long-term returns for shareholders. UNH Total Return Price data by YCharts. Managed care organizations can be tough to navigate as a user, but they have become part of the healthcare system as we know it.

The standard eligibility age for Medicare in the United States is 65. However, many people don't know if they need to sign up for Medicare if they already have other health insurance coverage, such as through a job, a spouse's employer, from their former employer, or through COBRA. Here's a quick guide that can help you determine if you need to sign up for Medicare when you turn 65 or if you can wait longer without paying a penalty. When you have more than one insurance provider, there are certain rules that determine who pays what it owes first and who pays based on the remaining balance. For seniors who don't have other insurance, Medicare is obviously the primary payer. However, when you have other insurance, it's a little more complicated. Image source: Getty Images. Depending on the type of insurance you have (group coverage, retiree coverage, COBRA, marketplace coverage, etc.), Medicare can either be the primary or the secondary payer. If Medicare would be a secondary payer to your current insurance, you can delay signing up for Medicare Part B. If your current insurance would become a secondary payer to Medicare, you should sign up during your initial enrollment period, which is the seven-month period that begins three months prior to the month you'll turn 65. It's also worth noting that although I'm specifically mentioning Medicare Part B, which is medical insurance, this applies to Part A (hospital insurance) as well. However, Medicare Part A is free to the vast majority of Americans, so it's probably worth signing up for Part A whether you're required to or not. On the other hand, Medicare Part B has a monthly premium you'll have to pay ($134 per month for most new beneficiaries in 2018), which is why it can make sense to delay signing up if it's not going to be your primary insurance. If you aren't sure if your employer meets the ""group health coverage"" criteria, ask your employer's benefits manager. It's also important to note that regardless of whether you're still working or not, if you've already signed up for Social Security benefits, you'll be automatically enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B when you turn 65. If you don't want to keep Part B, you'll need to cancel it (instructions are on the Medicare card you'll receive). This leaves a fairly long list of other types of insurance that become secondary payers to Medicare. Therefore, if you're turning 65 and any of these situations apply to you, you should sign up for Medicare during your initial enrollment period. If one of these situations applies to you and you don't sign up for Medicare Part B during your initial enrollment period, you could face permanently higher premiums when you do. ","

Below, three Fools lay out the case for investing in WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT:DLN), Schwab U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (NYSEMKT:SCHZ), and Vanguard Health Care ETF (NYSEMKT:VHT), three low-cost index funds that are fit for investors who want to stay invested for the long haul. This fund has a dividend-focused strategy that reduces risk by offering broad exposure to large-cap U.S. dividend-paying stocks. It even takes a slight contrarian and value approach, increasing its holdings in stocks when they become cheaper relative to their dividends and their peer group. Some of the fund's largest holdings include juggernaut names such as Apple Inc., Microsoft, and AT&T, but the fund is so diverse that those three holdings combine to make up barely 10% of total assets. WisdomTree's fund has a trailing 12-month dividend yield of 2.54%, which is well above the S&P 500 average yield of about 1.91%. Further, its expense ratio of 0.28% and low turnover of 11% make it a cheap and competitive option among similar funds. If you're looking for a safe fund offering a combination of income and upside, WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend ETF is a great way to keep you in the investing game. These three index funds offer compelling returns and attractive expense ratios for long-term investors. Image source: Getty Images. Jordan Wathen (Schwab U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF): When it comes to retirement, it's time to start taking some risk off the table. The Schwab U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF allows you to diversify your portfolio with more bond exposure (reducing risk) while slashing the expenses you pay: Its expense ratio is a next-to-nothing 0.04%. The Schwab U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF allows you to have your cake and eat it too. The fund's underlying bond investments have an average yield to maturity of 2.6% from a super-safe portfolio of investment-grade bonds, roughly half of which are government or government-backed issues. It remains the lowest-cost way to add high-quality bond exposure to your portfolio. Jason Hall (Vanguard Health Care ETF): While politicians argue about how to drive down healthcare spending and costs -- a serious issue in the United States -- there is an inexorable trend happening around the world: Billions of people are growing older, and this aging population will drive a significant amount of healthcare spending over the next several decades. This is especially true as life expectancies increase in both developed and developing economies. Furthermore, we're entering a golden age of healthcare, with personalized medicine set to significantly improve patient outcomes across a swath of illnesses and potentially increase life expectancies even more. There are already diseases being cured that only a few years ago were the equivalent of a death sentence. The best part for investors is these major advances in treatment and care are only just getting started. Since most of us don't have the knowledge or expertise to pick the healthcare companies that will be the biggest winners, the Vanguard Health Care ETF is an excellent way to gain exposure to the potential. This ETF tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Health Care 25/50 Index. It has beaten the S&P 500 handily since inception, and it only carries a 0.10% expense ratio (that's $1 per year per $1,000 invested). Looking ahead, I think the prospects are great that this index fund will continue to outperform the market for many years to come.

Michael Douglass,07202017,Fool,07132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The best way to invest is to find great businesses, and then buy and hold their stocks for a long time -- maybe even forever. That holds true in healthcare as well as in any other part of the market. But because of healthcare's complexity and the risks attached to pharmaceutical stocks and biotechs, many struggle to invest in this huge growth sector. The good news is, you don't have to buy risky biotechs to invest in healthcare. In fact, you can buy big, well-diversified companies with much simpler business models, including estate investment trusts (REITs). Welltower (NYSE:WELL) is one such REIT. It owns buildings that healthcare businesses lease. Let's talk through the top 10 reasons, then, to buy Welltower stock and hold it forever. Demographics favor companies like Welltower. Image source: Getty Images. As the population ages, healthcare spending is likely to ramp up significantly. It's already a $3 trillion industry in the U.S., and if you pay attention to the news, you've probably been hearing plenty of ideas for reducing costs. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, care in hospitals -- which provide some of the most expensive care in our healthcare system -- accounted for 32% of healthcare spending in 2015. Welltower is investing in lower-cost post-acute care and senior housing, because care is likely to shift away from hospitals over the long term as our system struggles to contain costs. Welltower's dividend currently yields 5%. As a REIT, it's required to pay out 90% of otherwise taxable income out as dividends. That means a juicy dividend for income investors. Management has paid 184 consecutive dividends. And the dividend is well covered by funds from operations (FFO, a REIT metric similar to earnings per share, with depreciation and amortization added back in), with a 73% payout ratio based on trailing-12-month FFO, according to data from S&P Market Intelligence. Many companies catering to senior healthcare are heavily reliant on government healthcare payers, whether Medicare or Medicaid. This situation creates reimbursement risk, as the government regularly uses its size to demand lower prices for services. Ninety-three percent of Welltower's portfolio NOI, however, comes from private pay sources, which shields it nicely from this common risk. In Q1 2017, Welltower reported that its same-store NOI increased by 2.1% year over year. That highlights Welltower's ability to control costs and raise rent over time, enabling the company to improve its return on each asset in its portfolio. Welltower owns 1,375 properties, with 70% of its in-place NOI coming from senior housing, 17% outpatient medical, and 13% post-acute or long-term care. Welltower operates primarily in the United States (which represents 81% of total revenue) but has a presence in both the U.K. and Canada. While Welltower operates across the United States, its portfolio is concentrated in urban markets with high barriers to entry. That helps it maintain pricing power and maintain high occupancy, which is why its medical outpatient occupancy is 95%, compared with its peers' average of 91%. Welltower is good at buying up buildings. It then leases them to partners such as Genesis Healthcare, Sunrise Senior Living (owned by Healthcare REIT), and Brookdale Senior Living. That means Welltower can stick to its core areas of expertise while enabling others to save on the substantial up-front cost of owning their buildings. Even better: No single operating partner represents more than 14% of Welltower's NOI from continuing operations. That helps Welltower spread out the risk tied to any operator's potential bankruptcy. The Federal Reserve has held interest rates low since the Great Recession, which makes borrowing cheap. That's great for REITs, which generate returns by raising capital -- usually debt -- to buy properties, leasing out those properties, and pocketing the spread between those two numbers. With the Federal Reserve gradually raising rates, REITs will have more difficulty growing. This is particularly true for REITs with lots of variable-rate debt, as they'll see their interest rates increase, making that debt increasingly burdensome for those carrying it. However, less than 20% of Welltower's $10.5 billion in debt is variable-rate, which should help shield it from some of the immediate effects of the interest-rate increases. REITs tend to grow by acquisition, and Welltower has plenty of room to do just that. Management estimates that REITs own roughly 10% of outpatient square footage, with health systems owning the vast majority of the rest. As hospitals seek to free up cash to upgrade their technology footprints or acquire other hospitals, selling their outpatient centers and then leasing them back could look increasingly attractive. But even if that scenario didn't pan out, the underlying point remains: Welltower has plenty of room to expand into a footprint several multiples of its current size if management can continue sourcing attractive deals. All businesses have their weaknesses. For example, all REITs – Welltower included -- will suffer some ill effects as the Fed raises interest rates. But with the combination of attractive factors we've discussed here, I think many investors -- particularly risk-averse income investors looking for a strong dividend and a business model not dependent on a single drug -- would do well to give Welltower a second look. And then a third. ","

Buck Hartzell,07202017,Fool,07132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In 2010, President Obama selected Beth to be a member of the President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability, where she created MoneyAsYouGrow.org, which has since been adopted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Buck Hartzell recently sat down with Beth at Fool HQ to find out more about the importance of educating children about money, saving, and more. A full transcript follows the video. Buck Hartzell: Thank you, all, for coming! Welcome, Beth, to The Motley Fool! I'll give you a quick introduction, and then we'll get into some questions, and we'll help all of us that have kids in the audience make your kids money geniuses, I think that's a desire that we all share. Beth Kobliner: Even if you're not. Hartzell: Yeah. And that's great. When I look at some of the folks that come here to The Motley Fool for help with their finances, they have degrees, sometimes graduate degrees in certain topics, but they don't have a basic understanding of a lot of things that you mentioned in your book, whether it's a Roth IRA or a 401(k) or how much they should contribute. So, the question is, where did you learn about money? Was that something that you learned in school? Or did it come from somewhere else? Kobliner: I definitely didn't learn it in school. I grew up middle class in Queens. My dad was a teacher and then a principal, and my mom was a chemistry teacher, but by the time I was born, a stay-at-home mom. My parents scrimped and saved to have enough money to send us to college. In fact, I was saying this before, I found a spreadsheet that my dad made in 1981, and my parents said, ""You can either get into Brown,"" or a few other schools that I didn't get into, ""Or you can go to Queens College,"" which was our neighborhood school that was basically free, because they felt like it was worth the scrimping and saving. He made a whole spreadsheet on what I would have to contribute, $2,000 a year, which adjusted for inflation was about $10,000 today. So, I think that, observing my parents, they're both Depression generation babies, they were both born in 1929, and my mom would only shop on triple coupon day and she would buy in bulk, and we had 20 cans of tuna fish in our basement because she would always buy when it was a big sale, if you buy a lot you save more money. So, they were really careful about money, but I never felt a lack of much. When I think that, except for once where I wanted a Lacoste Izod alligator shirt -- I never got one, and now I don't want one -- but other than that, I think, kids learn by osmosis, and I don't think you need to be a money genius to teach a kid to be smart about money. But I think, if you love to spend, or that's what you value, those messages come across a little to kids. Hartzell: And you mentioned your parents. Harold is mentioned in there, Shirley is mentioned throughout the book. There were some great stories in there. One involved a candy shop. Do you mind sharing a little bit about that story? Kobliner: Thank you. My dad is Harold, my mom is Shirley. Didn't make up those names, that's their names. My dad was born in 1929, and his father was an alcoholic. I don't think you called it that back then, but he didn't work throughout the whole Depression, and his mom was a seamstress. They had four kids. His brother, when he was born, slept in a drawer because they couldn't afford a crib. They were very poor. And my dad decided when he was 10 that he needed a job. So what he did was he sat in a candy store, the local candy store. He lived in this tenement. And every time the phone would ring in the candy store, the public pay phone, my dad would pick up the phone and run out to the tenement, because nobody had phones in those days, he would say, ""Mrs. Jones, phone call!"" And Mrs. Jones would come downstairs, he tells the story like, she had curlers in her hair and she would come down, and he would get a tip. He would get a nickel or a dime for telling her that there was a phone call. And he was sitting in a candy store doing this, and he used to say to my kids when they were little, ""Do you think I bought candy?"" And they were like, ""Yeah!"" And he said, ""No. I saved that money, I never bought candy, and I gave it to my parents,"" because they were always fighting about money and he thought maybe if he could give them a little more money, give them a little bit, that it would make a difference. And that, to me, is the epitome of that delayed gratification, and that ability to be able to say, ""I'm not going to spend it now, I'm going to think toward the future."" And I do think that the Depression generation had that, and I would argue Millennials, who are always bashed, with avocado toast or whatever, I actually think the Millennials I've been talking to also have a bit more of trying to get a bargain and not getting into credit card debt, that similar kind of mentality. Hartzell: Boomers not so much. Kobliner: Boomers and Gen X-ers, forget it. [laughs] Hartzell: [laughs] You mentioned delayed gratification, which appears throughout the book. An important topic. Carol Dweck talked about the effort effect, which I think aligns pretty well with that, and the marshmallow test, of course, which you talk about. Can you give us an example? How do you get kids, and I think, in a world where there's cellphones in almost everyone's hands, you have social media, you have video games, you have fidget spinners, I saw Tom over there with his fidget spinner, how do you get somebody to delay gratification? Kobliner: Tom, are you going to take that question? [laughs] I think that there are different ways. You could talk to your kids about, ""One day, we as a family are going to go to Disneyworld or Europe and we're going to have to save for that. And we have three or four years before we can go, and if we save this amount, we're not going to eat out as much,"" having concrete goals and examples, I think, is a wonderful way to make it clear, to start putting that message in kids' minds. Also, some kids who really like math, you can go to investor.gov, and if you plug in different interest rates and you save 20 years or 40 years, it's so fun to look at that number. ""If I start at 16 and I save every year for four years with my summer earnings of $1,000, I'll have $100,000 by the time I'm 65."" Or, if you save $1 a day starting at age 10, and you do that to age 65 and earn 7%, you'll have $200,000. Just, numbers like that can motivate, and anecdotes. I learned from my parents, my mom would say, ""If you want to teach your kids a message, tell them a story."" I was like, ""What if I don't have a story?"" She said, ""Make it up."" But, telling kids, ""Our old neighbor, he didn't have a lot of money, but he saved $100 a month, because he always wanted a boat. And he was able to save up that money."" That kind of concrete goal I think is really critical, and gets the message across to kids. You have to say it a million times. Just like vegetables, they have to try it eight times before they like it. You could probably say it 800 times. Hartzell: I like the idea of having something fun, and a way to celebrate your savings, too. I think one of the things that some folks here, Robert Brokamp, some folks at The Fool talked about having different savings jars or buckets for different things. One of them could be college, and that's a longer-term goal, and there's another shorter-term goal, it could be, ""I want to buy a new football,"" or, ""I want to celebrate by buying something that I really like."" And that's the way, I think, maybe, to get people delaying buying something today with buying something even nicer a little bit down the line. So, work ethic is a topic that comes up a lot. Certainly with your parents, Depression-era, and being around there, is an important thing. I'll ask this question, and I'll share an anecdote with somebody here. One of the Hartzell kids' favorite thing to do is, when we get snow around here, which isn't very often, they've realized that's actually money laying around on the sidewalk -- Kobliner: I made so much money shoveling snow. Hartzell: Yeah! And there are a lot of people in our neighborhood that are old or don't want to shovel their own snow, so as soon as the snow hits they're out early, the crack of dawn, and shoveling snow in driveways. And one of their friends happened to be over and found out about this, and they were like -- Kobliner: Uh oh, competition. Hartzell: ""This is great, there's money out there waiting to be shoveled up."" Kobliner: Literally. Hartzell: So, they went out and knocked on door around their neighborhood, and one gentleman in the house came out and was so amazed, he said, ""I've been waiting,"" he happens to own a business, owns a company, and he said, ""I've been waiting for 10 years for some kid in our neighborhood to come around and ask me if he wants to shovel my snow. So, I'm going to pay you to shovel the driveway, and here's a $100 tip."" And they were like, oh my gosh! This was unbelievable for them. So, the question for you is about work ethic. Are we making kids lazy today? Are we enabling them to be lazy? Or is that just my impression, that kids are different today than they were maybe a long time ago? Kobliner: I love that story. That's a great story. I made a bundle. I remember so clearly. It was like, $5. They would ask how much do you charge, and we're like, ""Well, whatever you think,"" and that was a mistake because people would say, ""Oh, $2,"" and we were sweating. But, I think that today, take high school. If you look at the statistics, it's not that kids necessarily have that much more homework, at least according to the research I've looked at, although I think my kids have so much more homework than I did back in high school. But the pressures to do well, to take SAT prep courses, to take SAT II prep courses, all these things that didn't exist. When I was working, I had four jobs in high school, I worked at a diner, I worked at a grocery store, I worked at a pharmacy, and I think that there are more pressures and there are more demands on kids' time, the idea that you need to be on a team, all these resume-building items. And, also, we know, in some ways, it makes logical sense, because research shows that if a kid works over 10 to 15 hours a week in high school, kids who work more than that are likely to not graduate from high school, they're more likely to not graduate -- in other words, it's OK to work around 10 to 15 hours a week, but once you pass that mark, that's a dangerous sign, if your kid is working much more than that, because they're not spending enough time on their school work. But I do think working over the summer, the internship versus paying summer camp job that your kids are doing -- I think it's smart what you're doing because you're starting younger. And I think when kids are in middle school and high school, having those summer jobs, it is important. But the year or two before high school, I don't know what you would do, if your kid either had an internship working in a lab with a scientist or whatever, versus working bagging groceries. As a parent, it's a tricky equation to figure out. Hartzell: Yeah, it's definitely a balance, for sure. I know we're getting ready to go on a family vacation here in a couple of days to Europe, and our kid missed out on an internship that he got for going, because we're going to be away. Kobliner: Can I come? [laughs] Hartzell: But, you have to balance some of those things out. On investing, and you've talked about mutual funds and indexing and keeping your costs low, we totally agree with that and love that idea. You didn't seem as enamored with owning individual stocks for children, so I wanted to talk a little bit about that. My kids own stocks, they have their own portfolio, and I think it's fun to follow individual companies. You learn a lot of lessons around those. What are your thoughts on owning individual stocks versus an index fund or an ETF or something like that? Hartzell: Yeah. And low expense ratio, as you mentioned. You get exposure right away off the bat to all those 500 companies. Kobliner: Right, diversification, exactly. Hartzell: We also like the idea, and I think a fun thing to do, sometimes, for kids, when they own some stock, is go to an annual meeting and make that an event and have it fun. Kobliner: Isn't he a fun dad? [laughs] Hey, kids! Hartzell: Usually those annual meetings are on weekdays and you get out of school, so that's a bonus right there. And some of them actually serve chocolate covered strawberries and things afterwards, so there's some rewards in there. So, let's talk a little bit more here about, how can we make money just fun? I think that's one of the things, my oldest son is 16, he's taking a course online on personal finance, he doesn't exactly enjoy it. This is the same person who goes to an annual meeting. He'll tell you everything about Apple, he knows everything about them. But it's just not that fun. How do you put the fun back in finance, how can we do that? Hartzell: Thank you. Kobliner: He's 87. But, that idea of, this is something that's important. And there's no question your kids are going to grow up and say, ""This is something that's important. Lord knows he pretended to like all those annual meetings."" [laughs] To make dad happy. But that's setting the tone for what you think is important as a parent, and that does so much, it goes such a long way. Hartzell: Speaking of not real. College is one of the most expensive things most people will buy. To a lot of them, it doesn't seem like a real expense, a lot of them will borrow an immense amount of money to go there. You talk positively about college, too, about how important it is to get an education for your future earnings potential. So, the question for you is, how much is college worth? An Ivy League school nowadays is probably north of $300,000 if you want to do four years of school. As good consumers, as frugal coupon clippers and everything else, what's the amount that somebody should be willing to pay when they're looking around at schools? What's the right amount? Kobliner: I think this is a huge issue, and more and more, hopefully, I don't think it'll happen in the next 3.5 to 4 years, but I think paying attention to the cost of college. One rule of thumb that I heard of from this guy Mark Kantrowitz, who's this guru on student loans, is, don't have your kid borrow more than the first year's income. If the kid makes $40,000, try not to have him or her borrow more than $40,000. Which is still a big chunk of money. The average right now is $37,000. The median -- it's hard to get the numbers exactly, which in itself is a crime, that we don't have really good statistics -- is $20,000 for kids graduating from college. And the reliance of private student loans, which is only going to get worse because the rules have already been loosened up, that private student loans are usually much higher interest rates than federal student loans, which are still about 4-4.25% right now. Private student loans can be double digits, 15-16%, and they're harder to pay back as well. And I think, we're getting to, I'll meet someone who says, ""I'm a philosophy major."" I mean was an English major at Brown, don't get me wrong. But I think there really was, back in the day, you could be a great writer and come out and get a job. Or start The Motley Fool. [laughs] What was your major? Tom Gardner: English. Kobliner: English! Woo! [laughs] Hartzell: I was sociology. Kobliner: Ah, there you go! But I think it's much more difficult now for kids, and grad school. So many young people are thinking, ""I'm going to grad school, they would be like $200,000 to get my PhD in philosophy."" And as much as that's brilliant, there are no jobs. Even if you come out of Harvard philosophy school, if there's such a thing, there's still one or two jobs in the whole country. So, you have to be much more pragmatic. It makes me so sad, I've met so many parents over the last year who say, ""We scrimped and saved because our kid got into this school, and we thought it was so great, but after the first year our kid was miserable, we forgot to include travel costs, and we're going to send them to the local public school and we realized we had three more kids down the line."" It's so expensive and so mystifying, the whole financial aid form. And I'm a little bit depressed by this because when I was on President Obama's Council, they really made an effort, and Arne Duncan, who's the education secretary, really tried to make the FAFSA form, the free financial aid form, a little simpler. And they really tried to take some steps. But, it's really hard for parents. Hartzell: And a lot of kids get in -- I paid a visit to my financial aid office where I went to undergraduate school and asked them a little bit about what they see coming through the office, what are the challenges and problems? And they were saying, it used to be that parents would come in and co-sign for these loans, but now they aren't, because although the parents earn in plenty to co-sign, they have a lot of debt, so they're not co-signing. And I think a lot of the students don't necessarily realize, these aren't loans you can walk away from. They're going to be with you a long time. Over $1 trillion in student debt now, I think being pragmatic probably makes sense. You have a great point that I love in the book. It's called your 10 investment rules. I'm not going to go through all 10 of those, but if you could just riff on a couple of those I'd be interested to hear them. One is, you don't need to be a perfect investor to be a good investor. What do you mean by that? Kobliner: I think it's something I've heard throughout my 30 years writing about personal finance. What? It's been 30 years doing this? I'd better be damn good at it. [laughs] But, I think it's that, if you have money in the market -- you need to have money in the stock market. And whether you feel like, ""I'm really good at this, picking stocks,"" just putting some money in the stock market, ideally it might be in an index fund, you will do better than not being in the market at all. And as the saying goes, perfection is the enemy of the good, people are like ""Oh, I don't know, I'm not sure, I'm not going to sign up for a 401(k) because I don't really know what investment to choose,"" that procrastination, life goes on and you miss out. So, I think just making sure you're in the stock market, and making a choice, and hopefully a low-cost one. We know, research shows, it's much better than staying out of it completely. Hartzell: We see that with a lot of new investors, that fear of failure. And I think of it like the person who has all straight A's never want to get a B, they never want to fail. And the reality is, in investing, if you're the best in the world, you're going to be wrong 40% of the time. It's OK. It's OK to buy a stock that goes down or doesn't work out, because of the successes you're going to have over the course of your lifetime are going to far outweigh some of those losses. So, that fear of failure is something we talk a lot about here at The Fool. Kobliner: At least, statistically speaking. We don't know, we can't promise for the future of stocks or the stock market. But we know, if we use past history, as a group of stocks, predictably, we think it will do better over the long time. I meet so many people who might get a financial, personal finance, in your 20s and 30s, and you meet people in their 40s and 50s, and now I met someone who was 60s, and they were like ""I read your book when I was younger."" I'm like, am I 112 years old? How does that math work? But people have said, they did put a little bit in. And I said, ""Put 10%, just put 10%, I know you can afford it, just do it."" And then they said, and I'm sure you get the same thing, ""I look back and I have hundreds of thousands of dollars that I wouldn't have otherwise."" And I think of it like, you drink three cups of coffee a day and you cut back to two, and the first week you have headaches and it's so hard, but after a while, it's OK. I think the same with money, you just force yourself, if you earn $20,000, $50,000, $200,000, you have to put 10% away. And your lifestyle, just live off the rest, the 90%, and your lifestyle adjusts, and you don't buy certain things, and it works out. And I think that mentality is just important. Hartzell: Another rule is, be lazy and trade less. Does it pay to be lazy? Hartzell: Yeah. And one of the dangers of the ETFs now, which proliferate all over the place is, you can buy and trade them like stocks, which is a double-edged sword for a lot of us, because we see people trading in and out of sectors and doing all those things that hurt them in stocks, but now they can do them in ETFs and they feel safer, but it's not necessarily safer because they're doing the same thing, you're churning them, you're paying commission. Kobliner: Not at all. You just buy the broad-based index, and you put maybe 20% of it internationally. I do think that money is one of those things that, you can be lazy. You can set it and forget it, putting whatever you can into your company 401(k) and making sure that over time that you put the maximum in, or putting money into an index fund. I think those are those set it and forget it things, and they're so beneficial for people. And it's counterintuitive. You think the smart people are actively trading. No, actually, they're doing worse. Hartzell: There's one point in this book that made me a little bit sad. I have a daughter, she's in the middle, 14 years old. You mentioned that parents or more open and more likely to talk to their boys about money and finance than they are to their daughters. And one of the things we see when I go out and talk to colleges, if you go to an investing club, it's probably 80-90% males. We see, not to that great of a degree, across our services. We certainly see more males that are interested in money. So, my question is, do we just not talk to the girls about money and finances? Or is it that we need to talk to them in a different way, maybe, than we talk to boys about money and finance? Hartzell: I have a couple more questions, and I want to do a short section on buy, sell, or hold, and then we'll take any questions from people in the audience. In your opinion, as an expert in this field, what's the most important thing that we can do as parents to teach our children? What's the most important thing? If you had to take one thing away, go home and do this with your kids, what would that be? Kobliner: I would say, no matter your child's age, teach them that credit card debt is a bad thing. I just heard that Warren Buffett says that, too. I wish he would stop copying me. It's, the notion that, if you have a credit card, and there's certainly less credit card debt, like I said, among young people, because they couldn't get credit cards in high school, the rules changed in 2009, you had to either have an income or be 21, or have a parent co-sign to get a credit card. Which is a mistake, never co-sign a credit card with your kid. But, I think, teaching a kid, do not spend more than you have in your savings, do not buy things you cannot afford, is a concept that people still don't get. And I think that's a lesson that I knew, by osmosis coming from parents who were Depression-generation, and my father said, he's 87 years, so, I don't know how long he's had a credit card, but he never paid a late payment, he always paid in full. I think, if you have a credit card that's charging 15%, paying it off is equivalent of earning 15% guaranteed on your money after taxes. And that's still basically the best. You can't get 15% guaranteed after taxes anywhere, except a 401(k) with matching, which is 100%. Hartzell: And stocks have only done about 9% over their history. Kobliner: Right. So, don't get into credit card debt. Teaching it to kids. Because, I think kids see it as magic. ""My parents swoosh this card and they get something."" And it's very confusing for kids, and that's debit cards, but I think credit is really such an insidious thing, credit cards can be so problematic for people down the line, that I would say, that would be it, if I had to take just one financial lesson. Hartzell: On the flip side, the mistakes. We all make mistakes as parents in different things. What's the biggest mistake that you see across parents that they need to eliminate in order to help their children be better with their finances? Kobliner: I think it's lying. [laughs] Whether you have a lot of money and you don't want to confront it because you don't want your kids to know how you feel, or you have very little money, so you might overcompensate, and think, ""I'm going to buy my kid that because I don't want them to miss out."" I think both of those are problems. You don't have to tell your kids everything. You don't have to tell them your income, who makes more, mommy or daddy. I don't think you have to tell them how much you have in your 401(k). There are a lot of questions you don't have to answer, and I have a list of them in my book. But I do think we have to try to be someone honest about the things we do answer. As simple as, you walk in a store, ""Can I have that?"" ""Oh, I don't have any money on me,"" and then you use your card and they see you using your card and they're like, ""Wait, you don't have money on you."" A woman I know told me a story where, just recently, she went out with her kids and forgot her credit card and she had cash and they went to the Gap and they went out to lunch and they said, ""Can we go to the movies, mom?"" And she said, ""I ran out of money."" And they were like, ""Does that mean we're homeless? What do you mean, we've run out of money."" They were little kids, they didn't get that concept of running out. Hartzell: That's great. We'll take your questions here. I have a quick round. We call it a buy, sell, or hold round here. I'll throw out the idea, and you'll let me know whether you going to buy, sell or hold. The first one is autonomous driving vehicles. Would you buy them, sell them, or hold them? In our near future. Kobliner: [laughs] I don't know! What's the expense ratio? Buck Hartzell: Google, Apple? Kobliner: Sure, I guess, it's a good thing to hold. Hartzell: OK, she's a hold on that one. Bitcoin, or other blockchain types of new currencies are you a buy, sell, or hold on these new currencies? Kobliner: I would only say buy because I think they've had such a bad time and they're probably down and probably eventually, maybe, so it's a value -- I don't know any of this. I don't know. Index funds. Ask me another one. Hartzell: OK, the last one. A degree at the University of Michigan for $250,000. Are you going to buy, sell, or hold the Wolverines? Kobliner: I would get a scholarship. My dad, I look back, he got a 0% interest rate loan from this thing called the Hebrew Loan Society. I don't even know what that is, but they gave a 0% interest rate loan for my college. He was a veteran, so he got a VA scholarship for me. I think getting creative and trying to really figure out how you can not get yourself or your kids into huge debt. I'm afraid of the parents who borrow for their kids' college, and the PLUS loan, the parent loan, which allows you to borrow as much as you can, as much as you need. It's really a problem. So, I don't know. I'm like a bad juror, I can't say guilty or not guilty unless I get to -- Hartzell: Well, I'm going to say that's a sell, because Andy Cross, our chief investment officer, went to Michigan, and Ron Gross's daughter, who sits right behind me, is going to Michigan. So I'm going to say it's a sell. Kobliner: It's a great school. Hartzell: No. My wife went to Ohio State, they're rivals. So, that's it for buy, sell or hold. Questions from anybody else in the audience about how to make your children money geniuses? Yes? Audience: You said one of the biggest influences is osmosis, kids watching what you're doing. But if the osmosis is of the wrong kind, how could I as another relative try to overcome that, especially when they live on the other side of the country? Hartzell: Let me ask that, in case they don't hear it. Sometimes kids don't have the right role models what if you're a relative, but not there with them all the time? How can you help out? What can you do to be a good role model from a distance? Kobliner: Right, that's a great question. And you're right, that's an inherent contradiction. You don't need to be a money genius to make your kid a money genius. But it sure is helpful if you're good at money and responsible, to make that. I think, whatever chance you get, talking to the kid. You can't bad mouth their parents, because that's a disaster. But you can say, ""I've been saving."" Again, anecdotes and stories. And saying, ""I'm going to set up a college plan for you,"" and the reason is, we know from research, and this is my favorite piece of research, that when you tell a child that you're saving for their college, they are seven times more likely to go to college, regardless of how much money is in that account. So whether you have $100 or $100,000, kids are more likely. It's the expectation, that you know someone believes in you and is saving for your college. And that's very powerful, and I know of a lot of philanthropic efforts that are starting with that, the notion that the kid knows someone is saving for them and they're more likely to go. And hopefully, they won't get into debt in the process. But, I think, using that, whether, these kids are not in college yet, and encouraging them to, you're going to match, for every $1 they put in, you'll put in $1 or $0.50. Maybe that does go back to making it fun. Having it more like a game. You put in a certain amount and I'll match it. And I think that can be very motivating to kids, without making it like, ""I think your parents are doing a lousy job."" Hartzell: Other questions. Tom? Gardner: We have Foley these two days, she's a 10 year old -- Kobliner: I met her already. She's a little intimidating, but she's very nice. Gardner: A soccer star. She's also somebody who saves what she earns. But, what about the child that saves too much, who maybe doesn't learn how to spend or what to spend on? [...] How do you encourage a child who's very thoughtfully saving, which is so rare, to also use that? Kobliner: To spend it. Hartzell: I should say, the question is, stop and smell the roses. Foley is a great example of somebody who's diligently saving all her money. How do we also enjoy it? Kobliner: OK, can I just ask whose kid is Foley? I met her during my interview, my podcast. Do you know what you're saving for, Foley? Or are you just saving? Good for you, that's awesome. Hopefully you'll hire me one day. [laughs] I'll come to you and you'll be like, ""No, I'm sorry."" I've gotten that question a lot. My husband was worried about our own kids. I would bring them to talks since they were little. My little one was like, ""Oh, I'm so worried!"" I was like, ""What's the matter?"" ""I don't know if I can afford health insurance, mommy, it's so expensive!"" when he was like six. It really was that level. So, in the end, that instinct to save money, at some point, breaks. I think some little kids love to just save. And I don't think that they have to spend when they're little, because instinct kicks in at one point, whether it's when they're in college or out of college. So, I don't worry about that. I look at all three of our kids, they were all voracious savers, and now, my oldest is 21 -- although, one thing that I think we did do well is, for college, we do pay for college for her, and she does work a very little bit in college, but, we've given her spending money, but it's a set amount, and we said, ""This is money."" And sometimes I'm very cynical about it, because I think, when I was a kid, I had four jobs, I worked at the Brown cafeteria, I worked in the Brown student agency doing dry cleaning and so on. And sometimes you have to step beyond yourself and say, ""My kids, we're going to give them some spending money, but that's it. We pay for your books, your college, your healthcare. If you want to take an Uber rather than the New York subway or walk to class, that comes from your money. If you want to go on a vacation with your friends who live in Australia,"" which she wanted to do, she figured out the cheapest flights. So, giving kids ownership of some money as they get older, I think, it makes them -- this is sort of the opposite of what you're asking, but it makes them more careful about spending. But, I've never met a 30 year old -- I mean, I guess there's a rare case of the hoarder who never spends money. But, I think life gets so tempting. Gardner: Why are we laughing in the front row? Audience: Because she's here. Hartzell: Next year is the year, Megan. Kobliner: I think it's great. I would embrace your hoarding tendencies. If you're saving, you have a chunk of money that, one day, there will be a reason. Do you own a home? Audience: No, not anymore. Kobliner: Not anymore. But you will one day. I just think that, having a huge amount of savings is never a bad thing. I was just on a show, I was on ABC or CBS this morning, and the woman said, the host, she was so cute, she took off her shoes and like, ""Look! $24, my shoes! And I got them 20% off!"" And I was like, ""Good for you!"" And she said, ""Do you know why my nail polish just chipped? Because I'm saving money!"" I'm like, ""Good for you!"" We save money, and there will be something that comes along, and you'll know when you want to buy it. I don't know, I have a bias toward saving. Hartzell: There'll be something you want, Foley. I trust you. It could be a shiny gold fidget spinner. Someday. OK, great. Thank you very much, Beth, for joining us. Kobliner: Thank you! These were great questions. Hartzell: And thank you all for coming today. ","

                                   , calling it “the one to own.” Skolnick rates UnitedHealth — scheduled to report second-quarter earnings Tuesday before the bell — a buy with a price target of $200, compared with the company’s share price of $186.69 as of Wednesday’s close. Investors and Wall Street analysts are watching UnitedHealth’s Optum health-care services arm, which they believe should drive growth for the company. “The key here is the long-term growth of Optum, OptumCare and our strong view that UNH is the leading agent of change in health care, driving the transformation from a broken system to a modern, effective and efficient patient-centered, value-based model of health care payment and delivery,” Skolnick said.

Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Analysts expect UnitedHealth to report earnings of $2.38 per share, up from $1.96 per share in the year-earlier period, according to FactSet. UnitedHealth has beat the FactSet earnings consensus in all but one quarter over the last five years. The software platform Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from buy-side and sell-side analysts, hedge funds, academics and others, has the company earning slightly more, or $2.40 per share.

                                   . The company’s average rating is buy with a $195.48 price target, according to a FactSet poll of Wall Street Analysts. What to watch for: Despite UnitedHealth’s exit from most of the ACA exchanges, the GOP effort to repeal and replace the ACA could still affect the company, including through such things as taxes, said Mizuho’s Skolnick. “Political/health policy risks could be significant and future national health policy remains highly uncertain,” she said. Other risks include missteps in estimating cost trends and other actuarial calculations and in the Optum services business, Skolnick said. The company could be affected by reimbursement and regulatory risks, although “the timing and extent of such changes are usually out of the company’s control and therefore could represent exogenous events with negative earnings and stock price implications,” she said. Pressure on UnitedHealth’s medical-loss ratio, or the amount of a premium that health insurers spend on improving quality, could also be an important factor, said Credit Suisse’s Fidel. UnitedHealth is also being investigated by the Justice Department over its Medicare risk adjustment practices.

Philip van Doorn,07202017,MarketWatch,07132017,"Published: July 17, 2017 8:56 a.m. ET Ziad Bakri, manager of the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences Fund, looks for three main themes in his stock picks By Ziad Bakri steered the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences Fund to a 20% return in the first half of the year with big bets on biotechnology stocks. A change in the political climate in Washington might make his job easier, he said. Bakri said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had a “more accommodating” approach to approvals of new drugs, which began under the Obama administration and has become even more of a trend with President Trump. Dr. Scott Gottlieb was confirmed as commissioner of the FDA in May, after having served as the agency’s deputy under President George W. Bush. He’s done consulting work with drug companies, yet is also viewed as an independent thinker. “Starting on the generic side, there are processes in place to speed up approval for drugs that have very few competitors in the market,” Bakri said. “So there are things influencing how we think about the business.” The T.

Here’s detail on how the fund’s returns have measured up: Bakri took over as the fund’s portfolio manager in April 2016 and before that worked as a biotechnology analyst for T. Rowe Price since 2011. He is a medical doctor and also a certified financial analyst. In an interview July 12, Bakri attributed the fund’s success to a strong team of analysts in the U.S., Europe and Japan, including “MDs and PhDs” who attend medical conferences. “We do a lot of analysis of clinical trials and outcomes, making educated bets,” he said. While stocks in some sectors, such as energy or utilities, have a tendency to move in line as commodity prices or other environment factors change, the biotech industry is very “stock-specific,” he said. Those “educated bets” can even include privately held companies with drugs under development. Don’t miss:  Scared of tech stocks?

Gilead’s sales more than doubled in 2014 after Harvoni was introduced, with revenue up another 31% in 2015. But sales declined 7% last year, with lower demand and reduced prices. Gilead has recently been a victim of its success in curing so many people who were suffering from hepatitis C, and Bakri said he had greatly reduced the fund’s position in the stock. But he still feels good about the company’s long-term prospects, because of the strength of its management team and its HIV medication business, “which is a growth area for the company over the next 10 years.” Another theme Bakri talked about was “investing in companies that improve the delivery of care and allow it to be delivered at a lower cost.” He said UnitedHealth Group Inc.

Mengjie (Jessie) Jiang,07202017,MarketWatch,07132017,"Published: July 20, 2017 2:58 p.m. ET By WASHINGTON — Negotiations for a new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement should give President Donald Trump “a victory,” but not at the expense of Mexico and Canada, Canadian Ambassador David MacNaughton said Thursday. MacNaughton, speaking at a forum sponsored by the Washington International Trade Association, acknowledged the necessity to revamp the 23-year-old accord given the transformation of businesses, but emphasized a successful revamp should be flexible and “do no harm.” Mexican Ambassador Gerónimo Gutiérrez agreed, saying said Mexico has benefited tremendously from the three-nation trade pact and is looking for a “win-win-win” solution. The Trump administration said Monday its top priority for the talks was to shrink the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada. In an 18-page summary of objectives, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he would work to reduce the trade imbalance by improving access for U.S. goods exported to Canada and Mexico. Gutiérrez said the overarching objective would not be simply U.S. trade deficit reduction -- the three governments are interested in creating more and better jobs. “We have to move away from talking about the macroeconomic impacts of NAFTA, and emphasize the local impact on people,” said Gutiérrez. “We must listen to what people have to say. I think there are people in America who feel left out from benefits of Nafta.” Gutiérrez noted that Mexico proposed an anticorruption addition to Nafta. The newly released U.S. objectives include renegotiating intellectual property rights, stricter labor laws, enhanced environmental laws and tougher rules on the origin of products. The U.S. also reportedly wants to get rid of a system under Nafta that prevents the U.S. from pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Mexico and Canada. “It makes sense to have a dispute resolution mechanism,” said MacNaughton. “We have to find ways where President Trump can claim victory without it being a loss to Canada or Mexico.” The first round of talks will take place Aug.16 to Aug.20 in Washington, Lighthizer’s office said in a statement Wednesday. Officials from the three countries plan to hold seven round of talks at three-week intervals to finish the Nafta renegotiation rapidly. Lighthizer has said he hopes the negotiations could be wrapped up by the end of the year, which he called a “very, very quick” time frame, but added that “we’re not going to have a bad agreement to save time.” When Nafta was created in 1994, the U.S. ran a small trade surplus with Mexico and Canada. In 2016, the United States had a nearly $11 billion trade deficit in goods with Canada and a $64 billion gap with Mexico. Trump called the trade agreement “the worse trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere” and threatened to pull out if he can’t push the trilateral trade accord to the best interest of the U.S. “I think people don’t understand how close we were [to withdrawal from Nafta],” said Gutiérrez. “Every political actor in the United States who understands the importance of Nafta needs to be vocal about it.” ",What Mexico and Canada want from the Nafta renegotiation - MarketWatch
 ,07202017,MarketWatch,07132017,"Supported by By Keith Bradsher SHANGHAI — China’s top leaders have gathered every five years since 1997 for a National Financial Work Conference. At past gatherings, they have created entire regulatory agencies and rearranged the rules for huge markets, almost overnight. So economists and regulators have been almost breathlessly speculating about this summer’s work conference. Would the regulatory commissions overseeing the banking, securities and insurance industries be merged into the central bank? Would the legal definition of securities be broadened to shed some regulatory daylight on widespread activities like shadow banking, peer-to-peer online investment networks and off-balance-sheet wealth management products? But the actual results of the two-day work conference, which ended on Saturday afternoon, were much more, well, modest, to put it politely. The biggest accomplishment of the conference appeared to be an announcement that a commission would be established under the auspices of the cabinet. The commission would meet regularly to discuss issues of financial stability. But the leaders of the various financial regulatory agencies already meet regularly at the offices of the State Council, which is China’s cabinet, although these meetings are not officially at the level of a commission. Some economists speculated in the final days before the two-day conference that at least the State Council meetings would be moved to the central bank. Allowing the central bank to serve tea and provide a conference room might give the central bank staff a little extra confidence by allowing them to negotiate as hosts. The central bank also has a history of advocating broader financial reforms than the other principal financial regulatory agencies: the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission. But the leaders did not even move the meetings away from the State Council’s offices to the central bank. And the result of the conference fell far short of predictions that the regulatory agencies might become clearly subservient to the central bank. The statement that accompanied the end of the conference did mention that the central bank had a role to play in preventing systemic financial risk. That is already the role of central banks in many countries. But Gary Liu, the president of the China Financial Reform Institute, a research group based in Shanghai, said that the specific mention of it in the statement might strengthen the central bank’s hand somewhat. But he was skeptical of the new commission, noting that it would lack legal powers and have very few staff members. “China failed to achieve a real breakthrough in financial regulatory reform, and the rising conflicts between financial regulation and financial realities will continue to create troubles in the coming years,” Mr. Liu said. Overall debt has been soaring in China, and Moody’s Investors Service downgraded China’s sovereign debt rating by a notch on May 24 on concerns that China has struggled to contain further increases in that debt. Chinese officials are quick to acknowledge the importance of financial health to the Chinese economy, which has become the world’s second-largest economy after the United States’, with extensive links to practically every other country around the world. State-controlled media carried a statement that described President Xi Jinping of China as having said at the conference, “Finance is an important core competitiveness of the country, financial security is an important part of national security, and the financial system is an important economic and social development of the basic system.” The apparently meager results from the conference underline not just bureaucratic resistance to change, which Mr. Xi probably has the political muscle to overcome, but the very real and complex policy dilemmas facing China. One example lies in the vast, lightly regulated off-balance-sheet activities of Chinese banks, which Mizuho Securities calculated on Friday to be roughly equal to the entire assets on the balance sheets of the banking industry. Regulators in the West would probably force banks to move these activities as quickly as possible onto their balance sheets, which would probably have the effect of curtailing them. But many of these off-balance-sheet activities, like various kinds of loan guarantees, are crucial to providing financing for China’s vigorous small and medium-size enterprises. These smaller businesses have had little luck competing with large, state-owned enterprises for conventional bank loans. But they account for the bulk of the job creation in China, at a time when the government is trying to slim down chronically loss-making industries like steel manufacturing and coal mining that are also big employers. Other financial regulatory disputes in China involve bureaucratic turf issues. One question lies in how to modernize China’s antiquated securities law, which still applies only to stocks and bonds and lacks provisions to cover the more complex instruments issued these days by insurance companies, banks, online lenders and other types of financial institutions. The China Securities Regulatory Commission has pushed hard for the broadest possible definition of securities, which would give it much greater influence. The banking and insurance regulators have resisted this, contending that many of the new financial instruments are extensions of banking and insurance. One mystery left unresolved by the statement at the end of the conference lies in who will run the top financial regulatory agencies in the years ahead, particularly the central bank. Zhou Xiaochuan has been the governor of the central bank, the People’s Bank of China, since 2002, making him one of the world’s longest-serving central bankers. Mr. Zhou is already more than two years past the usual retirement age for Chinese officials at his level. He received a special dispensation from the usual age limits by being allowed to join a senior government advisory body that is exempt from age limits. Central banking specialists in China cite two likely front-runners to succeed him. One is Jiang Chaoliang, the Communist Party secretary of Hubei province and a former chairman of the Agricultural Bank of China. The other is Guo Shuqing, a former governor of Shandong province who in February became the chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission. Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsher.

George Friedman,07202017,MarketWatch,07132017,"Published: July 17, 2017 8:40 a.m. ET Diverse interests and regional divides threaten social stability By China’s actions so far in the ongoing North Korean affair have been ambiguous. In order to try to understand China’s strategy toward North Korea, it is necessary to understand China’s strategy in general. To do that, it is important to recognize the imperatives and constraints that drive the country. First, we need to outline China’s basic geographical parts. The country has four buffer regions that are under its control. Tibet in the southwest has seen some instability and is vulnerable to outside influences. Xinjiang in the northwest is predominantly Muslim, with a significant insurgency but not one that threatens Chinese control. Inner Mongolia in the north is stable. Manchuria in the northeast is also stable and of all four buffers is the most integrated with the Chinese core. These last two regions are now dominated by the Han Chinese, China’s main ethnic group, but they are still distinct. When you look at a map of China, you will see that a good part of what we think of China is not ethnically Chinese. Within Han China, there are also divisions. The population is concentrated in the east because western China has limited rainfall and can’t sustain extremely large populations. In this sense, China is actually a relatively narrow country, with a highly dense population. The interests within Han China are also diverse, and this has frequently led to fragmentation and civil war. The most important distinction is the one between coastal China and interior China. Coastal China, when left to its own devices, is involved in regional and global maritime trade, while the interior has fewer commercial opportunities. Coastal China’s priority is reaching its customers, whereas the interior wants Beijing to transfer the wealth from the coast to help support the poor interior. Many other regional disagreements exist of course, but this is the source of discord between the two regions. It is not a new problem, and left to fester, it can result in internal conflict, with coastal interests frequently seeking intervention by their customers. This was the case from the British intervention in the mid-19th century until 1947. During this time, there was endless internal conflict in China and constant foreign involvement. Mao Zedong tried to solve the problem by closing China to trade (at least somewhat), crushing the coastal elite, and imposing a dictatorship. Like emperors before him, he imposed a powerful state on a unified but nonetheless very poor country. After Mao died, China embarked on a traditional Chinese strategy: It tried to build its economy by selling low-priced manufactured goods to the world without allowing divisions to arise — in other words, it wanted to have its cake and eat it too. This worked for a generation; once the state stopped undermining economic development, China surged. By 2006, exports, particularly to the United States and Europe, accounted for 37% of China’s gross domestic product. The coastal region became relatively prosperous, while the rest of China and the buffer regions lagged far behind, as they always have. But the surging economy helped raise living standards, even if it also created inequality. 2008 was a turning point. China’s major customers, Europe and the U.S., went into recession, and their appetite for Chinese goods declined. Economic growth slowed dramatically, and by 2016, exports only contributed 19% of China’s GDP. Although internal consumption increased, the coastal region was focused on markets in advanced industrial countries, which the interior couldn’t replace. In the process of maintaining weakening businesses, saving jobs, and increasing domestic demand, the cost of production rose. China faced competition from other countries for markets, and the pressure on its internal system intensified. Coastal and regional interests diverged again, and each advocated different policies in response to the crisis. The Chinese government tried to accommodate all but accommodated none. In 2012, President Xi Jinping took office and sought to put the genie back in the bottle. He imposed a dictatorship that had two goals: to take control of the Communist Party and to impose party rule over the country. His anti-corruption campaign was intended to take control of the economy and to convince the interior that he was not a pawn of the coastal region. Xi sought to maintain exports as much as possible and to re-establish centralized control with minimal effect on the economy. Xi also had to deal with the U.S. — a major engine of China’s export-driven economy. At the same time, the crackdown on government and business officials — an essentially political act — would affect American investments and other interests in China. China had to take greater control of the economy without losing U.S. investment or imports. But in case the worst happened, China developed a fallback strategy. It began producing a new class of high-tech products. It also had to find new markets outside the U.S. China’s economic solution posed a military problem. In the event there was an economic falling out with the U.S., China had to consider the possibility of a military confrontation. But the key issue was the ability to guarantee China’s access to sea lanes. In this, China has a major geographic problem. The South- and East China seas are ringed with small islands, spaced in such a way that passage between them can be blocked with relative ease. The U.S. Navy is far superior to the Chinese navy, and the Chinese were concerned that in some unforeseen crisis the U.S. would block access to their much needed sea lanes. Those small islands were now at the center of Chinese national interest. The Chinese could claim the entire region, but they were not in a position to seize it. At the same time, the Chinese devised a political solution to their strategic concern. If a country like Indonesia or the Philippines aligned with China instead of with the U.S., access to the global sea lanes would be assured without having to confront the U.S. The dilemma here is that the two strategies undermined each other. Aggressive assertion of Chinese power in the regional waters and finding accommodation with regional powers were inconsistent approaches. What’s more, they could only work if the United States was not present. And, of course, it was. China had one other option for getting around potential U.S. actions: creating an alternative export route through Asia to Europe. This was the so-called One Belt, One Road concept. But it, too, was flawed. First, the cost of building the requisite infrastructure was staggering. Second, it would run through countries that were unstable and, for the Chinese, unimportant customers. Add to that the speed with which One Belt, One Road needed to be enacted, and this was more posturing than policy. China, therefore, is caught in a set of interlocking problems. Its economic miracle has matured into more normal growth rates. It has a vast population that lacks the ability to consume all that it produces. It has to contend with global stagnation and competition from other producers — and competing with high-tech producers is no small task. China is therefore afraid of internal instability and has imposed a dictatorship designed to maintain a vibrant economy without social costs. To do that, it must increase exports and control access to China’s economy, a move designed to alienate a large and dangerous power, the United States. But it can’t afford to confront the U.S., whose navy it can’t defeat. The Chinese are caught between the need to placate the U.S. and to distract it with as many problems as possible. North Korea is a perfect diversion, but siding with Pyongyang is not an option. China can appear to be helping the United States while keeping the U.S. focused on Pyongyang. This is a strategy that emerges not from a position of strength but from one of fundamental weakness. China’s internal contradiction is that prosperity creates instability, and stability is incompatible with prosperity. There are complexities and nuances of course, but this is the root of China’s problem. China is therefore trying to maintain what prosperity it can without destabilizing the system. In doing this, it is jeopardizing its overseas markets, particularly the United States, creating the opportunity for a conflict it can’t win and opening the door to regionalism and warlordism. Unlike Japan, which moved from being a high-growth country to a low-growth country without social upheaval, China may not be so lucky. Japan had a homogeneous, socially integrated society. China is not homogenous, and it has irreconcilable social differences. Its global strategy reflects these contradictions and ultimately poses a greater risk to China itself than to others. In such a situation, the key is to look confident and try to keep others off balance. But this can only work for so long.

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has broken out, reaching record territory. The June peak (2,453) pivots to support, and is followed by the former range top, circa 2,442. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has sustained a break to all-time highs. Here again, the June peak (21,535) marks an inflection point, and is followed by a deeper floor, circa 21,450. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has knifed from six-week lows to its second-best close on record. Tactically, the 6,280 area marks an inflection point, and is followed by support matching the former range top, circa 6,243. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has knifed from a double bottom — the jagged W formation, defined by the June and July lows — to its second-best close on record. The Nasdaq’s record close (6,321.76) and absolute record peak (6,341.70) rest just overhead. Conversely, the late-June peak (6,303) marks an inflection point, and is followed by potential floors better illustrated on the hourly chart. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has sustained the July breakout. Recall that it had notched three consecutive record closes before Monday’s slight eight-point downturn. The breakout opens the path to a near-term projected target, circa 21,780. Conversely, the June peak (21,535) pivots to notable support. Similarly, the S&P 500 is acting well technically. Here again, the index has reached uncharted territory, punctuating consecutive tests of the 2,405 breakout point. The June low (2,405) and July low (2,407) closely matched support. As detailed above, the major U.S. benchmarks are off to a bullish third-quarter start. The S&P 500 and Dow industrials have reached all-time highs — uncharted territory — while the Nasdaq Composite has concurrently registered its second-best close on record. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF

                                   is rattling the cage on a breakout. Its record close (142.10) and absolute record peak (142.90) remain firmly within view following a successful test of the 50-day moving average. (The Russell 2000 itself, not the ETF illustrated above, has registered a nominal all-time high. The IWM missed a record close Monday by four cents.) Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 is pressing uncharted territory amid seasonally lackluster volume. Its corresponding record close (322.45) and absolute record peak (322.75) remain within striking distance. More broadly, recall that the small- and mid-cap benchmarks are rising against a bullish longer-term backdrop, illustrated on the three-year chart. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 is setting up well technically. Consider that the June/July range had been comparably flat, versus the preceding rally, and underpinned by the 2,405 support. Moreover, the prevailing breakout technically projects to the 2,500 mark, as detailed last week. (Take the S&P’s June peak: 2,453 - 2,405 = 48 points. Then, add back to the breakout point: 2,453 + 48 = 2,501.) All told, technical price action within a strong uptrend is constructive, and the third-quarter start fits the description. The S&P 500’s intermediate-term path of least resistance continues to point higher pending more aggressive selling pressure.

                                   has reached a notable technical test. Two inflection points stand out: Tactically, a rally atop the 66.50 area would mark a “higher high” — combined with a break from the 50-day moving average — raising the flag to an intermediate-term trend shift. Such a move would also resolve a mini double bottom, a bullish reversal pattern, defined by the June and July lows. Based on today’s backdrop, the group’s intermediate-term downtrend is intact. Still, the latest trendline test is underway, and the next several sessions may add color. Separately, the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF is also pressing trendline resistance, as detailed Monday.

Technically, the shares are rising from a jagged double bottom — the W formation — defined by the June and July lows. The pattern is defined by consecutive successful tests of the breakout point, and an intervening mid-June spike, fueled by Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Monday’s close, just one point under a record close, positions the shares for a potential breakout. Tactically, a rally atop the July peak (1,017.00) opens the path to uncharted territory, and an intermediate-term projected target, circa 1,080. D.R.

Earlier this month, the shares knifed to 11-year highs, rising after the monthly U.S. payrolls report signaled hiring strength in the construction industry. The ensuing pullback has been flat, fueled by decreased volume, positioning the shares to build on the initial spike. Tactically, first support matches the post-breakout low (36.20) and is followed by the breakout point, circa 34.40. A posture higher supports a bullish intermediate-term bias.

That is: If the Republicans can’t make headway with President Trump’s top legislative priority, the so-called repeal and replace (or even mere repeal) of the Affordable Care Act, then what are the odds for the enthusiastically anticipated project of stimulating the economy? That should be a concern for stocks, though they are a bit preoccupied right now with earnings. Goldman Sachs has taken some of the air out of futures after posting a trading slump.

                                   , which is ready to bust higher after another batch of crowd-pleasing results. That brings us to our call of the day, which suggests — gulp — that it may be time for investors to cash in on some of the streaming-media company’s good fortune. “While we remain positive in the long-term fundamental outlook of the business, including its ability to disrupt the traditional incumbents and grow international, our analysis also suggests that the current price already reflects this view,” wrote Citi’s Mark May in a note this morning. He upped the share-price target to $180 from $160, with the stock set to open not far from there — and at record heights. Note that plenty of other analysts were lifting their price targets on Netflix this morning, with several pushing them past the $200-a-share level. There’s more on that view from David Butler, a contributor for Seeking Alpha, who observed that chasing Netflix now is an “expensive affair.” “It seems to be following the same mania as Tesla and Amazon, where investors will run the price up on speculation alone, regardless of actual earnings,” he wrote. Netflix shareholders right now https://t.co/D5UxMDJ8ZY$NFLX pic.twitter.com/l4BBJQEI2o Note that Tesla CEO Elon Musk felt compelled to turn a cooling fire hose on his own investors over the weekend, saying the electric-car maker’s share price is “higher than we have the right to deserve.” Those shares have come off this week, but are still up around 50% in 2017. A noted hedge-fund manager also said it’s time to short Netflix, which is up about 30% so far this year. Flick through StockTwits, and you’ll find plenty of caution over Netflix shares. One worry: The forward price/earnings ratio for Netflix is currently hovering at 197 times (according to FactSet), which is higher than the 190 times for Amazon.

                                    intentions in the food space, but were nervous that Amazon could pose a large competitive threat. Amazon applied July 6 to trademark the phrase “We do the prep, you be the chef.” The filing says the phrase is related to “Prepared food kits composed of meat, poultry, fish, seafood, fruit and/or and vegetables and also including sauces or seasonings, ready for cooking and assembly as a meal.” The filing is under 1B status, meaning it’s an application “based on intent to use,” according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Going up against the internet giant does not necessarily mean it’s the end for Blue Apron, but it “makes life hard,” said Max Wolff, market strategist at 55 Institutional. Amazon has a large economy of scale, meaning that the company can likely produce products at a lower cost, and has an advanced distribution network, which could be enhanced by its acquisition of Whole Foods. Read more: Every time this happens, Amazon crushes another legacy retailer Blue Apron appeared to acknowledge the threat from Amazon as it added a risk factor to its filing ahead of the IPO and around the timing of Amazon’s bid around the consolidation of companies. “Business combinations and consolidation in and across the industries in which we compete could further increase the competition we face and result in competitors with significantly greater resources and customer bases than us,” the company said in its prospectus. On the other hand, Judge Graham, chief marketing officer of Ansira, a marketing agency, said while he’s generally “an optimistic guy,” he does see Amazon’s entrance into the space as a “potential death sentence” for Blue Apron. “Amazon continues to dominate the direct consumer space,” Graham said. “This is just one more avenue Amazon is going to go in and dominate.” Still, Wolff said he believes Blue Apron could combat the threat by becoming more “niche focused” or teaming up with another player, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Graham also sees potential if Blue Apron delivers better recipes or better quality of food, which is something the company touted in its prospectus. Meanwhile, the company needs to communicate better and prove to the public and investors that its business model will not be affected by Amazon. “I think the confidence is broken, so every possible setback gets an exaggerated importance,” Wolff said. Analysts have also been cautious on Blue Apron because of its subscription model, which has yet to prove whether it’s sustainable. It also has a high customer acquisition cost, which is a cost Amazon is unlikely to face as it already has an established base of Prime customers. A meal-kit offering would likely do well with this base of customers, who likely are already focused on convenience and quick delivery, said Jim Fosina, chief executive of Fosina Marketing Group. That base, in addition to Amazon’s ability to market should make Blue Apron and others “very concerned,” he said. “They have a installed base that mirrors the population of customers that are in the sweet spot of those interested in these services,” Fosina said.

,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"(Reuters) - Mediware Information Systems Inc [MEDWI.UL], a healthcare technology company owned by private equity firm TPG Capital LP, has hired Bill Miller to lead the company as it looks to build out its presence in post-acute care and human services, the company said on Thursday. Miller was previously the chief executive officer of OptumInsight, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group Inc, the world’s largest healthcare services company. He will replace Kelly Mann, who has been CEO of Mediware since 2007. “I am excited about their strong position in the expanding markets they serve, and look forward to working with TPG and the Mediware team to build on the momentum that the company has achieved to-date,” Miller said in a statement. TPG Capital completed its acquisition of Mediware from buyout firm Thoma Bravo LLC earlier this year for an undisclosed sum. Mediware sells software programs that help with administration and costs savings to healthcare providers including blood banks, behavioral health providers, home healthcare providers and more. It is poised to grow significantly in the coming years, as healthcare providers aim to cut costs through the use of new technologies and increasingly rely on outpatient care centers rather than traditional hospitals. As chief executive of Mediware, Miller told Reuters he plans on pursuing a balanced growth strategy across its various areas of focus, ranging from human services to home health and more. He added that he Mediware will rely on a blend of organic growth and acquisitions. Earlier this year, Mediware acquired Kinnser Software, which provides software for home health and hospice providers. Thoma Bravo took Mediware private in 2012 for $195 million and built it out with acquisitions including Bowman Systems, which focuses on homeless management. TPG has previously invested in other healthcare technology companies including Evolent Health and IMS Health. ","

,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans narrowly agreed on Tuesday to open debate on a bill to end Obamacare, but the party’s seven-year effort to roll back Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law still faces significant hurdles. The Senate deadlocked 50-50 on moving forward with the healthcare debate, forcing Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie-breaking vote. Senator John McCain, who was diagnosed this month with brain cancer and has been recovering from surgery at home in Arizona, made a dramatic return to the U.S. Capitol to cast a crucial vote in favor of proceeding. The outcome was a huge relief for President Donald Trump, who had pushed his fellow Republicans hard in recent days to live up to the party’s campaign promises to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. Minutes after the vote, Trump called it “a big step.” But the narrow victory on a simple procedural matter raised questions about whether Republicans can muster the votes necessary to pass any of the various approaches to repeal. Moderates are worried repeal will cost millions of low-income Americans their insurance and conservatives are angry the proposed bills do not go far enough to gut Obamacare, which they consider government overreach. In a first vote of the many likely to come this week, the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare that Senate Republicans have been working on for months failed to get the 60 votes needed for approval on Tuesday night. The vote was 43 in favor and 57 against. Nine Republicans, ranging from moderates such as Susan Collins of Maine to conservatives such as Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against the bill, which would have made deep cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, and reduced Obamacare subsidies to lower-income people to help them defray the cost of health insurance. Earlier McCain, 80, received an ovation from his fellow senators when he entered the chamber to cast a vote to open debate. After that vote, he decried growing partisanship in the Senate and urged members to learn how “to trust each other again.” Collins and Senator Lisa Murkowski were the only Republicans to oppose the measure to open debate, and with Republicans controlling the Senate by a 52-48 majority, those were the only votes the party leadership could afford to lose. Democrats were united in opposition to the motion to proceed. Republican Senator Ron Johnson, who cast the last and deciding vote to open debate, engaged in a heated discussion with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell before casting his vote and ending the suspense. A loss on the vote to open debate on Tuesday could have been a death blow for Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare and cast doubt on Trump’s prospects to achieve any of his other top legislative agenda items, including tax reform. “We have a duty to act,” McConnell told senators before the vote, reminding Republicans they had promised to repeal Obamacare in four straight elections. “We can’t let this moment slip by.” Republicans have found it difficult to fulfill their campaign promises to repeal Obamacare, which enabled 20 million more Americans to get health insurance. Polls show Obamacare is now far more popular than the Republican alternatives. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the Senate’s replacement bill could lead to as many as 22 million fewer Americans being insured. The health industry has watched the debate nervously, and after the vote some groups urged the Senate to reconsider its approach. America’s Essential Hospitals, a group representing safety-net hospitals, said in a statement it strongly opposed all the Republican plans and feared the big cuts in Medicaid in the bills “would jeopardize the health and financial security of millions of working people and families.” As the debate vote opened, more than two dozen protesters in the Senate chamber chanted “kill the bill” before they were removed. Senators said several approaches have been discussed, including a straight repeal of Obamacare with no replacement plan, or repealing and replacing the law while also overhauling Medicaid. Senate Republicans also could consider a shortened version of repeal, called a “skinny repeal,” which would end the mandates in Obamacare on individuals and employers to obtain or provide health insurance, and a medical device tax, a Senate aide and a lobbyist said. “Some of us want clean repeal, some of us want the Senate leadership bill, they’re both going to get a vote early on and I think that’s a fair way to do it,” Republican Senator Rand Paul said. “If either one of them fails and another one succeeds, maybe we can find something in between that actually succeeds.” Republican Senator Bob Corker said the goal was to gain enough votes to get a bill through the Senate and send it to the House of Representatives, which passed its own bill to replace Obamacare in May, for negotiations. “Everybody understands this is just a first step,” he said. Several of the Democrats opposing the motion for debate were from conservative states that backed Trump in 2016 and face tough re-election bids next year, including Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Jon Tester of Montana. “We have a good chance to beat this,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters after the vote. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, praised Collins and Murkowski for taking a principled stand against the Republican move to open debate. “That wasn’t easy,” Durbin said. “That was an act of political courage on their part; I’m sure they were under tremendous pressure.” ","

,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"ASPEN, Colorado (Reuters) - The Trump administration is developing the first comprehensive strategy to defend the United States against disease pandemics and biological attacks by terrorists, the top White House homeland security official said on Thursday. “We have not had as a country a comprehensive bio-defense strategy ever,” White House homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert told the annual Aspen Security Forum, in Aspen, Colorado. “It’s high time we had a bio-defense strategy.” The effort involves retired Admiral Tim Ziemer, who oversaw the Obama administration’s initiative to fight malaria in Africa, and the White House hopes to publish the new strategy “as soon as we can,” said Bossert, who provided no further details. Bossert noted that the Bush and Obama administrations took steps to address biological threats after letters containing anthrax spores were sent to two Democratic senators and several news organizations in the weeks following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The spores infected 22 people, five of whom died. But, he added, “There have been a lot of fits and starts in our investments.” “At this point, we need to look clear eyed at the fact that we may have a devastating pandemic influenza or an intentional anthrax attack,” said Bossert. He noted recent news reports that scientists in Canada used commercially available genetic material to construct the extinct horse pox virus, a relative of the small pox virus, which claimed tens of millions of lives before being wiped out. “That’s (horsepox) not going to kill any of us, but that suggests that somebody might now in the future possess the ability to produce synthetic small pox without a live virus and that scares me to death,” he said. The threat of disease pandemics demands global attention, he said. Some experts have criticized the Trump administration for seeking reductions in funding for global health programs that they contend would hurt the country’s ability to prevent and respond to biological threats like pandemics. Bossert, however, said that the administration plans to give “full-throated support” to the Global Health Security Agenda, a partnership of more than 50 nations and international organizations that works to build countries’ capacities to prevent and fight infectious diseases.

,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Genital surgery should be banned on children whose sex characteristics are ambiguous because the procedures can scar young patients for life and be considered human rights violations, a leading rights group said on Tuesday. Several hundred so-called intersex children in the United States have undergone sex reassignment surgery in recent years, and worldwide, doctors recommend surgery for an estimated one in every 2,000 intersex babies, U.S.-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) and interACT, an advocacy group, said. Surgeries to make them resemble more typical boys or girls include removal of testes or ovaries, deepening shallow vaginas and enlarging small penises, they said in a report. They called for a U.S. moratorium on all surgical procedures on intersex children too young to participate in the decision. The surgeries amount to “human rights abuse taking place in a medical setting,” said Kyle Knight, a HRW researcher. “These surgeries are medically unnecessary, they are harmful and they haven’t delivered on the outcomes that were originally theorized,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview. The report said the benefits of sex reassignment surgery remain unproven but the resulting harm can be catastrophic. Surgery can cause life-long pain, sterilization, loss of sexual sensation and health complications, it said. Some 1.7 percent of the world’s population, or 127.5 million people, is thought to be born intersex, according to the report. But detailed data on the U.S. intersex population, once called hermaphrodites, is largely lacking, Knight noted. The surgeries’ popularity dates back to 1960s’ research which concluded intersex people could be assigned typical male or female genitals if operated on early in their infancy, HRW and interACT said. In a recent open letter cited by the report, three former U.S. Surgeons General said plastic surgeries on genital organs “can cause . . . emotional distress.” Efforts to warn medical doctors about the risks have been ongoing since the 1990s but met with mixed success, the report said. It did find that a growing number of doctors are opposed to recommending surgery on intersex babies unless medically necessary, the report said after interviewing nearly two dozen health care practitioners. Various United Nations’ agencies have condemned the practice as violating fundamental human rights. In 2015, Malta became the first nation to ban non-consensual medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex children.

,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"Once again, the U.S. Navy has opened fire on an Iranian vessel in the Gulf. U.S. sailors fired warning shots Tuesday after the Iranian patrol boat – apparently operated by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – came within 150 yards of the USS Thunderbolt. U.S. and Iranian ships have had tense encounters before, but these confrontations could become even more common - and potentially dangerous - if Washington intensifies its efforts to put more pressure on Tehran in general and the Revolutionary Guards in particular. Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire to dismantle the Obama administration’s multilateral nuclear agreement with Tehran, describing it as “the worst deal ever.” On July 17, the U.S. president reluctantly certified, for the second time since his election, that Iran is complying with the terms of the nuclear pact known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). A day later, his administration imposed new sanctions against Tehran over its ballistic missile program, targeting 18 new entities and individuals for involvement in what it described as Iranian “malign activities” in the Middle East. Those sanctioned included backers of the IRGC, Iran’s powerful military and security organization. Founded in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution and acting independently of the regular army, the IRGC is also one of Iran’s most powerful economic institutions, controlling several of its strategic industries as well as some of its armed forces. Washington’s ongoing efforts to put more pressure on the IRGC and proposals to designate it as a terrorist entity have raised tensions between the two old nemeses to a new level in the post-JCPOA era. READ MORE COMMENTARY FROM REUTERS Michael Rosenbaum: Want Congress to fast track health reform? Write bills to support business rather than people. Peter Van Buren: Drinking rum until I understand the Cuban embargo On the day that Trump confirmed Tehran’s nuclear observance, Iranian armed forces chief of staff Major General Mohammad Baqeri warned that incorporating IRGC in the blacklist of terrorist organizations could pose “a big risk for American and its bases and forces” in the region. In a similar reaction and shortly after the new U.S. penalties were announced, IRGC commander Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari warned that should Washington want to press ahead with the terrorist designation scheme, “it should [first] dismantle its bases within up to 1,000 kilometers of Iran.” Details of Tuesday’s maritime confrontation are still murky, and threatening bluster by officials on both sides is not new. However, the incident does underscore that Tehran can employ a number of options to jeopardize U.S. interests in the Middle East. However, Tuesday’s incident underscores that the Revolutionary Guards can resort to aggressive behavior against U.S. vessels in the Persian Gulf. In the starkest instance, Guard members embarrassed Washington by seizing 10 American crew members from two Navy boats that blundered into Iranian territorial waters in January 2016. The IRGC could also target U.S. forces without directly confronting them by deploying the proxy networks it has cultivated across the Middle East since the early 1980s. In the absence of reliable conventional allies, these networks typically form a key component of Iran’s “deterrence” strategy. The IRGC has particularly close ties with Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah group. Tehran has traditionally relied on Hezbollah to confront Israel, but has also used its fighters for high-profile missions. On 18 July 2012, a suicide bomb attack on a tourist bus in the Bulgarian resort of Burgas killed five Israelis. U.S. intelligence officials believe that the allegedly Hezbollah-led attack was retaliation for the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists, which Tehran suspected was orchestrated by Israel. The IRGC could also use its surrogates to exploit U.S. vulnerabilities in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tehran could also increase the pressure on American forces in Afghanistan by doubling down on military backing of the Taliban. As tensions have flared between the United States on the one hand and Iran and Russia on the other, the latter have already boosted support for the Taliban insurgents. With the growing engagement of the United States in the Syrian civil war under the Trump administration, Tehran could pursue a similar course in Syria too. U.S.-backed forces fighting Islamic State militants in the northeastern and eastern regions of the country would be particularly vulnerable. A Washington designation of the IRGC as a terrorist entity is unlikely to restrain the group. On the contrary, the label could even embolden the Corps to behave more aggressively by removing its reason for restraint. And that, in turn, could further destabilize the region.

,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"(Reuters Health) - Being overweight or obese as a teenager may increase a person’s risk of developing colorectal cancer as an adult, suggests a large Israeli study. Long-term follow-up of 1.79 million Israeli men and women examined for military service as teenagers showed that overweight and obese teens were over 50 percent more likely to develop colon or rectal cancer by middle age, compared to normal-weight peers. “The findings from the study show evidence that being overweight and obese in adolescence are associated with an increased risk of subsequent colon cancer in both men and woman,” said Dr. Avni Desai, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York who wasn’t involved in the study “Obesity was also noted to have an association with an increased risk of rectal cancer in men,” she told Reuters Health by email. “Other smaller studies have shown a possible association with obesity and adolescence and future risk of colorectal cancer, but this is the largest study to show the association,” Desai said, adding that in past research the association has been stronger for men. For the study, published in the journal Cancer, Dr. Zohar Levi, a researcher at Rabin Medical Center and Tel Aviv University and his team analyzed data from millions of Israeli adolescents who underwent compulsory examinations to determine their fitness for military service from 1967 to 2010. The young men and women were between the ages of 16 and 19 at the time of the examinations, and Levi’s team used a national cancer registry to track who was diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer through December 2012. The average follow-up was 23 years and the researchers identified almost 2,967 new cases of colorectal cancer in the study group. Among men, there were 1,403 cases of colon cancer and 574 cases of rectal cancer, and among women, 764 colon cancers and 226 rectal cancers. Being overweight or obese at the initial military examination was associated with 53 percent and 54 percent higher risks of colon cancer for men and women, respectively, compared to normal-weight peers. In men, obesity was associated with a 71 percent increased risk of rectal cancer, and in women, being obese more than doubled that risk. Levi did not respond to a request for comments. This study does have some limitations, said Desai. “It is looking at a specific group, Israeli Jewish men and women, the studied group included predominantly men.  As such it is unclear if the results would be similar in the general U.S. population,” she said. Additionally, the researchers didn’t have information about adult body weights, so it is unclear whether obese or overweight teens stayed heavy or slim teens gained weight in adulthood. “The study could not assess whether risk of colorectal cancer was related to adult obesity independent of adolescent obesity,” Desai said. “Also, other risk factors that may affect risk of colorectal cancer such as family history, level of physical activity, diet, and smoking were not reported in the study. Family history is a risk factor for diagnosis of colorectal cancer, especially at a young age.” Desai noted that although the participants were followed for at least 10 years, they were still fairly young at the end of the study. “The median age of colorectal cancer diagnosis in the study was 49.4 years, which is younger than the average age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer,” she said, adding that 90 percent of colorectal cancers are diagnosed after the age of 50. The average age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer in the United States is age 72, she added. “Again, it is hard to pinpoint the exact causes of colorectal cancer in young patients, what we do know is a healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of developing cancer.  This includes regular exercise, and a healthy diet, low in fat, high in fiber, with less red meats and processed meats,” she said. SOURCE: bit.ly/2tDgJgk Cancer, online July 24, 2017. ","

 ,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"SANAA (Reuters) - Yemen’s cholera outbreak is so widespread that just drinking water can lead to death. Nearly 2,000 people have already succumbed to one of the worst recorded outbreaks of cholera in modern history, with over 400,000 having contracted the disease, according to the World Health Organization. Cholera, a diarrheal disease spread by ingestion of food or water tainted with human faeces, can kill within hours if untreated. It has been largely eradicated in developed countries equipped with sanitation systems and water treatment. But Yemen’s devastating civil war, pitting a Saudi-led military coalition against the armed Houthi group, and economic collapse has made it extremely difficult to deal with catastrophes such as cholera and mass hunger. With stinking green watery filth mingled with trash being a common sight in the capital Sanaa, the government is struggling to control the spread of the disease. Pumps to sanitize the water supply sit idle for lack of fuel, while maintenance agencies tasked with chlorinating aquifers go without salaries and supplies. Since Yemen’s government took control of central bank funds, it no longer pays most civil servants in Houthi-held lands. This means that most of those working in and around Sanaa have not been paid for six months, ruining the lives of hospital and sanitation workers. Meanwhile, the parched and mountainous country is in danger of running out of water, leaving its 28 million mostly impoverished citizens facing another crisis. A dearth of clean water has forced many residents to queue up and fill jerry cans from water trucks. The United Nations estimates that in Yemen a child under the age of five dies every 10 minutes from preventable causes, two million people have fled fighting near their homes and only half of hospitals have staff and supplies to function normally.

 ,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has outlined plans to become a world-leader in artificial intelligence by 2025, laying down a challenge to U.S. dominance in the sector amid heightened international tensions over military applications of the technology. China released a national AI development plan late on Thursday, aiming to grow the country’s core AI industries to over 150 billion yuan ($22.15 billion) by 2020 and 400 billion yuan ($59.07 billion) by 2025, the State Council said. With this major push into AI, China is looking to rival U.S. market leaders such as Alphabet Inc’s Google and Microsoft Corp, as it is keen not to be left behind in a technology that is increasingly key from smart cars to energy. “The local and central government are supporting this AI effort,” said Rui Yong, chief technology officer at PC maker Lenovo Group, speaking on the sidelines of an AI conference in Shanghai on Thursday. “They see this trend coming and they want to invest more.” Beijing’s AI plan comes as the United States is poised to bolster its scrutiny of investments, including artificial intelligence, over fears that countries including China could access technology of strategic military importance. China’s State Council said the “situation with China on national security and international competition is complex”, which was part of the incentive for making a domestic AI push. “We must take initiative to firmly grasp this new stage of development for artificial intelligence and create a new competitive edge,” it said. China’s plan follows a similar national AI development plan released by the United States in October 2016. The roadmap says China aims to catch up to global leaders by solving issues including a lack of high-end computer chips, software and trained personnel. Beijing would also play a bigger role via policy support and regulation. China has already invested heavily in AI, while Chinese Premier Li Keqiang named it as a strategic technology in an annual report earlier this year. In February, the country’s powerful state planner opened an AI lab in partnership with Baidu Inc, the country’s top search engine, which is making a major push in to AI. Lenovo’s Rui said official support for AI was because it was seen as the latest “industrial revolution” akin to the advent of the combustion engine, electricity or the Internet. “They see the fourth industrial revolution as coming, (and think) we better invest and support and build a very strong ecosystem,” said Rui.

 ,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A crisis between Qatar and four Arab countries is straining a Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen’s government in a two-year war against Iranian-aligned Houthis and slowing the alliance’s military advances. At the heart of the crisis is the accusation that Qatar supports the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement that coalition mainstays Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have designated a terrorist group. But Yemen’s government is packed with supporters of the Islah party, an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood, threatening the unity of the alliance which has already been weakened by the withdrawal of Qatar’s forces after the row erupted on June 5. “The Gulf rift has cast a shadow on the government and could split it as ministers linked to Islah sympathise with Qatar,” a senior official in the Yemeni government, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. The coalition is seeking to restore the internationally-recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and backs forces fighting Houthi rebels and troops loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Fighting near the Red Sea port city of al-Mokha, where a UAE-backed offensive was being prepared on the port of Hodeidah which handles most of Yemeni food imports, has slowed. “The fighting has been frozen since the start of the dispute with Qatar, which reflects the extent of the UAE concerns over the strength of Islah in the province,” a local official told Reuters. UAE officials did not respond to requests for comment. Saudi Arabia currently hosts the exiled Yemeni government which includes five cabinet ministers from the Islah party. The chief of staff also belongs to Islah and Vice President Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar is a close Islah ally. The party also has thousands of followers fighting against the Houthi forces who control the capital Sanaa with Saleh loyalists. Unusually in Yemen’s fractured political landscape, Islah has supporters in the north and south of the country. Since the Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, Islah has tried to distance itself from the Brotherhood, in deference to the government-in-exile’s Saudi hosts. The coalition depends heavily on Islah fighters on the ground. “Whatever Saudi Arabia’s current view of the Muslim Brotherhood in other countries, in Yemen they are natural allies against the Houthi-Saleh alliance,” April Longley Alley, a senior Arabian Peninsula analyst for the International Crisis Group (ICG) said. “In many fighting fronts in the north, tribesmen or soldiers associated with Islah are a critical, if not the most important, part of the anti-Houthi fighting force.” Saudi officials were not immediately available for comment. The Brotherhood has posed a big challenge to Arab rulers in the Middle East, where it has built a strong base opposed to the principle of dynastic rule. While Qatar has supported the movement, Gulf monarchies and emirates, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have spent billions trying to prevent the Brotherhood holding power in the Arab world since 2011 uprisings swept the region. The UAE, a crucial member of the coalition and which is more hostile to the Brotherhood than other members, appears to have been the most uncomfortable about its military fighting alongside Brotherhood-linked Islah forces. The UAE has also built a southern army that remains under the influence of southern Yemeni politicians who are hostile to the Brotherhood’s ideology and want to break with the north. On the frontlines in the south, the offensive against the Houthis and Saleh forces has slowed down because of the UAE position on Islah, local officials said. UAE officials were not available to comment. Fighting in the two strategic provinces of Taiz and Marib has halted for more than a month, except for occasional air strikes and naval shelling on the rebels. Cracks in the Yemeni government on the Qatar crisis were  highlighted when the quarrel broke out with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates imposing travel and diplomatic sanctions on Qatar. Yemen’s government rushed to express solidarity with Qatar on the state news agency website. Within two hours that message of support was wiped off. The next day the government cut ties with Doha, falling into line with Saudi and the others. ","

,07272017,Investopedia,07202017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A minimum wage is the lowest wage per hour that a worker may be paid, as mandated by federal law. The minimum wage is a legally mandated price floor on hourly wages, below which non-exempt workers may not be offered or accept a job. As of 2017, the federal minimum wage rate in the United States is $7.25 per hour. This means that it is illegal for an American worker to sell their labor for less than $7.25 per hour unless the worker falls into a category specifically exempted from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Minimum wage laws were first used in Australia and New Zealand in an attempt to raise the income of unskilled workers. Most modern developed economies and many underdeveloped economies enforce a national minimum wage. Examples of countries with no established minimum wage include Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Singapore. Even though the United States enforces a federal minimum wage, individual states, cities, and localities may also pass different minimum wage requirements as long as the stipulated hourly wage is not lower than the federal minimum wage. An employer who is subject to the federal and state minimum wage requirement must pay the higher of the two. States will usually set a minimum wage that is reflective of the cost of living in the region. For example, the state of Massachusetts has a minimum wage of $11 per hour, compared to Arkansas which has a minimum wage rate of $8.50. As of 2017, minimum wage rates exceeded the federal rate in 29 of the 50 states, led by Massachusetts and Washington at $11 per hour. Some states like Alabama, New Hampshire, and South Carolina have no state minimum wage. Cities and municipalities may also set a minimum wage for their residents which must be higher than the federal minimum wage. For example, even though the state of Illinois set its minimum wage at $8.25, the city of Chicago has a minimum wage of $11.00. The government periodically assesses the federal minimum wage level for changes in inflation or cost of living. The table shows the minimum wage set at each state level. Some states have set their minimum wage higher than the federal minimum wage, others have set the same minimum wage as the federal rate, and a select few don't have a minimum wage requirement. In the latter case, the federal minimum wage of $7.25 will apply. Like all price floors, a minimum wage law only has a measurable effect when set above the market clearing price for a transaction. For example, a minimum wage of $10 per hour will have no effect for workers whose marginal productivity in a given line of work is greater than $10 per hour. The legal supply and demand remains unchanged for such labor. For those with a marginal productivity less than $10 per hour, however, a $10 per hour minimum wage creates an artificial shortage of profitable labor. An unskilled worker with a marginal productivity of $8 per hour in California or Massachusetts can only offer to work at a loss to his or her potential employer — that is, the employer can only hire the worker if they are willing to pay more in salary than marginal revenue produced by the worker, or unless the employer incorrectly estimates the worker’s marginal productivity to be above $10 per hour. Several groups of individuals are exempt from being paid the minimum wage. Individuals that fall into these groups are usually paid below the minimum wage in order to incentivize companies to hire them. Low-skilled laborers in the United States can be exempted from the minimum wage if a sizable portion of their income is derived from tips. If exempted, a lower minimum wage of $2.13 per hour applies to tipped employees who regularly receive more than $30 in tips per month, or if the total tips retained in addition to the hourly wage rate is equal to or greater than the federal minimum wage. In a case where the employee’s total tips and hourly rate falls below the minimum wage, the employer is expected to compensate the employee for the shortfall. A full-time student working for a university, retail store, or service establishment can be paid not less than 85% of the minimum wage. Although students may work up to 8 hours per day, they cannot work more than 20 hours per week when school is in session. In addition, students in a technical or vocational program can be paid not less than 75% of the minimum wage throughout their active enrollment in the program. Workers below 20 years of age may be paid $4.25 per hour by federal law, until they pass the three-month probationary period, after which the employer must convert their pay structure to the federal minimum wage rate. Finally, workers with physical or mental disabilities can be paid less than the federal minimum wage according to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Disabilities which can affect production capacity include blindness, cerebral palsy, alcohol and drug addiction, mental illness, and developmental disabilities. There is a high elasticity of demand for low-skilled labor. This means that a small change in the price for low-skilled labor tends to have a large effect on its demand. For these reasons, too high a minimum wage can lead to increasing unemployment among the low-skilled. In modern times, the proliferation of improved technology also increases the marginal rate of technical substitution for low-skilled labor. When the cost of labor increases, companies find it increasingly profitable to switch to labor-replacing technology, such as the decision made by Wendy’s Co. in 2016 to introduce self-serve kiosks in response to higher minimum wage laws.

Everett Rosenfeld,07272017,CNBC,07202017,"Sen. John McCain's office said Monday evening that he would return to the U.S. Senate on Tuesday. That follows the news last week that the Arizona Republican had been diagnosed with a brain tumor. Health-care reform is an issue of critical importance for Republicans, who have campaigned for years on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare. But despite control of the House, the Senate and the White House, the GOP has struggled to push through a replacement plan, repeatedly hitting legislative roadblocks from members of their own party. Republican action on the health care bill will also be important to the millions of Americans who receive their coverage through Obamacare. Beyond that, investors are closely watching the progress of health-care reform because the GOP explicitly chose to address the issue before it took on taxes. That is, every setback for the Obamacare overhaul is seen as delaying the party's broader fiscal agenda. ","Senator John McCain will return to Senate for health-care vote, his office says"
Dan Mangan,07272017,CNBC,07202017,"Even an Obamacare plan won't cover this health-care headache. Senate Republicans on Thursday threw a curveball into the already complicated Obamacare repeal game when they introduced yet another amendment to their bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. The new version, posted on a Senate website, strips out the so-called Cruz amendment that would allow insurers to sell much-less-generous, and hence less expensive, individual health plans. But it is not clear that that amendment, crafted by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, will remain out of the bill as Senate Republican leaders continue to struggle for a vote on legislation that would undo much or all of Obamacare. The Congressional Budget Office, in an analysis of the new version of the bill, estimated Thursday that it would lead to 22 million more Americans lacking health insurance by 2026 than would be uninsured if Obamacare remained in its current form. Fifteen million more people would become uninsured by next year, and then there would be 19 million more uninsured by 2020, CBO said. Those projections for the number of uninsured people are identical to estimates the CBO made for the first version of the bill, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act, and come as GOP leaders in the Senate have become increasingly desperate to pass some kind of health-care reform. The CBO also found similar effects from the new bill on insurance premiums, which are projected to end up in 2020 being 30 percent lower for individual health plans than would be the case under current Obamacare law. However, as in the original bill, the insurance plans expected to be sold then would cover a smaller share of the total cost of health benefits than under Obamacare now. And before 2020, average premiums for key Obamacare plans are expected next year to spike 20 percent higher than under the current law, and 10 percent higher in 2019 if the bill is passed into law. However, the new version is projected to lead to $420 billion in savings to the federal budget deficit, almost $100 billion more in savings than estimated by the CBO for the first bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has so far failed in his effort to corral the 50 votes necessary to pass a health-care reform bill, of any kind. McConnell cannot even muster enough Republican senators to support a procedural motion that would allow the bill to head toward a final vote. But he nonetheless plans to try to do so next week. The CBO's report is the second projection related to Obamacare released by the nonpartisan agency within a 24-hour period. On Wednesday, the CBO issued a report that estimated the effects of another Senate bill, which would repeal most of Obamacare without immediately replacing it with a new health-care law. That report said such a repeal by 2026 would increase the number of people without health insurance by 32 million people above the number that would be uninsured if the current law remained in place. The repeal bill also would double insurance premiums in the individual plan market and leave up to three-quarters of the United States without an insurer selling such plans by 2026. An earlier CBO analysis of an Obamacare replacement bill passed by the House found that 23 million more people would be uninsured if that bill became law. The Protect Our Care Campaign, a leading Obamacare defense group, criticized Republicans for continuing to try to pass a new health-care law. ""It doesn't matter what version of health care repeal Republicans put forward, they've each proven to be completely devastating for the American people — cutting coverage, raising costs, gutting Medicaid and weakening protections — just to give the wealthy and drug and pharmaceutical companies another tax break,"" the campaign said in an emailed statement. ""The newly-released CBO report on their latest health care repeal attempt proves it yet again — 22 million people lose coverage, premiums go up 20 percent and 26 percent is gutted from Medicaid while giving $541 billion in tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations,"" the campaign said. ""They keep promising it will get better but there is no way to fix repeal. It is always devastating,"" the group said. President Donald Trump earlier in the week called for a full repeal of Obamacare. On Wednesday, Trump pushed Senate Republicans to reach agreement on health-care legislation before leaving Washington for the August recess. ""We have to stay here. We shouldn't leave town, and we should hammer this out and get it done,"" Trump said. ",GOP throws another curveball into Obamacare repeal debate
 ,07272017,CNBC,07202017,"Sperm counts in men from America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand have dropped by more than 50 percent in less than 40 years, researchers said on Tuesday. They also said the rate of decline is not slowing. Both findings -- in a meta-analysis bringing together various studies -- pointed to a potential decline in male health and fertility. ""This study is an urgent wake-up call for researchers and health authorities around the world to investigate the causes of the sharp ongoing drop in sperm count,"" said Hagai Levine, who co-led the work at the Hebrew University-Hadassah Braun School of Public Health and Community Medicine in Jerusalem. The analysis did not explore reasons for the decline, but researchers said falling sperm counts have previously been linked to various factors such as exposure to certain chemicals and pesticides, smoking, stress and obesity. This suggests measures of sperm quality may reflect the impact of modern living on male health and act as a ""canary in the coal mine"" signalling broader health risks, they said. Studies have reported declines in sperm count since the early 1990s, but many of those have been questioned because they did not account for potentially major confounding factors such as age, sexual activity and the types of men involved. Working with a team of researchers in the United States, Brazil, Denmark, Israel and Spain, Levine screened and brought together the findings of 185 sperm count studies from 1973 to 2011 and then conducted a so-called meta-regression analysis. The results, published in the journal Human Reproduction Update, showed a 52.4 percent decline in sperm concentration and a 59.3 percent decline in total sperm count among North American, European, Australian and New Zealand men. The former measures the concentration of semen in a man's ejaculation, while the latter is semen concentration multiplied by volume. In contrast, no significant decline was seen in South America, Asia and Africa. The researches noted, however, that far fewer studies have been conducted in these regions. Experts asked to comment on the work said it was a comprehensive and well-conducted analysis and did a good job of adjusting for confounders that could have skewed its findings. Daniel Brison, a specialist in embryology and stem cell biology at Britain's Manchester University, said the findings had ""major implications not just for fertility but for male health and wider public health"". ""An unanswered question is whether the impact of whatever is causing declining sperm counts will be seen in future generations of children via epigenetic (gene modifications) or other mechanisms operating in sperm,"" he said in an emailed comment. Richard Sharpe at Edinburgh University added: ""Given that we still do not know what lifestyle, dietary or chemical exposures might have caused this decrease, research efforts to identify (them) need to be redoubled and to be non-presumptive as to cause.""

 ,07272017,CNBC,07202017,"A secretive U.S. government panel has objected to at least nine acquisitions of U.S. companies by foreign buyers so far this year, people familiar with the matter said, a historically high number that bodes poorly for China's overseas buying spree. The objections indicate that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews acquisitions by foreign entities for potential national security risks, is becoming more risk-averse under President Donald Trump. Chinese companies and investors eyeing U.S. assets could face more roadblocks as a result, at a time when the Chinese government is also restricting the flow of capital out of China following a bonanza of Chinese overseas deals. There have been 87 announced acquisitions of U.S. companies by Chinese firms so far in 2017, the highest on record and up from 77 deals in the corresponding period in 2016. CFIUS's more conservative stance towards deals coincides with growing political and economic tensions between the United States and China. On Wednesday the two countries failed to agree on major new steps to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China. Since the start of the year, CFIUS has sent letters to companies involved in at least nine deals to say they would be blocked based on measures they have proposed to address potential national security risks, the people familiar said. Many of these deals are in the technology sector, the sources said. A rise in cyber security threats and rapid advances in technology makes it more difficult to establish whether a deal poses any threat, lawyers who represent companies before CFIUS said. An initial objection by the watchdog does not necessarily kill the deal immediately. Some companies this year have chosen to keep their CFIUS filings alive by proposing new mitigation measures, while others have pulled their applications and canceled their deals, the people said. They asked not be identified because interactions between CFIUS and the companies are confidential. ""CFIUS decisions are highly sensitive and we are not going to comment on rumors of their outcome,"" a White House spokeswoman said. A spokesman at the Treasury Department declined to comment. Treasury leads CFIUS with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin serving as chairman. Most of the deals that CFIUS has sought to block this year have not been announced. Among the companies that have disclosed they have withdrawn their CFIUS applications and canceled their deals are U.S. electronics maker Inseego Corp, which tried to sell its MiFi mobile hotspot business to Chinese smartphone maker TCL Industries Holdings, and Texas oil producer ExL Petroleum Management LLC, which sought to sell its assets to Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman's L1 Energy. By comparison, in the entirety of 2014, the last year for which CFIUS has released official data, nine deals were withdrawn after CFIUS began an investigation. Several more companies face protracted CFIUS reviews amid delays after Trump took office in filling important mid-level political positions at several of the 16 government departments and agencies that comprise CFIUS. CFIUS is on track to review a record-setting 250 to 300 transactions in 2017, according to Anne Salladin, a CFIUS expert with the law firm Stroock and Stroock and Lavan LLP - up sharply from 147 deals in 2014. The backlog is leading many companies that fail to gain CFIUS clearance within the standard 75 days allocated for review to refile their applications. Refiling resets the clock and gives up to another 75 days to complete the national security review and try to resolve potential issues. A number of companies have said in regulatory filings that their high-profile deals are before CFIUS. They include Chinese payments company Ant Financial's $1.2 billion acquisition of U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International and China-backed buyout fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners' $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. chip maker Lattice Semiconductor. In addition, investment firm China Oceanwide Holdings Group's $2.7 billion acquisition of U.S. life insurer Genworth Financial and China-based semiconductor investment fund Unic Capital Management's $580 million acquisition of U.S. semiconductor testing equipment company Xcerra are also with the watchdog. Ant Financial has refiled its MoneyGram deal with CFIUS once, while Canyon Bridge and China Oceanwide have refiled their deals twice, according to company disclosures and Reuters reports. Unic is still on its first filing with CFIUS on its Xcerra deal, company disclosures and Reuters reports showed. Of the two dozen political appointee positions in the Treasury Department just three have been confirmed by U.S. lawmakers. A key CFIUS nomination is that of former Allen & Overy LLP lawyer Heath Tarbert, who has been appointed as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for international markets and development, and has yet to be confirmed. The U.S. is not alone in concerns about foreign dealmaking: Germany, for one, raised the bar on criteria for overseas acquirers seeking to snap up domestic targets in tech-heavy industries.

"Alexandra Ossola, special to CNBC.com",07272017,CNBC,07202017,"In a twist of fate, there is new hope for developing a vaccine to protect people from the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea, a disease eluding the medical community that has now become a sex superbug. The vaccine, called MeNZB, was developed to control a meningitis epidemic in New Zealand from 2004 to 2006 and is no longer available. Researchers found that people vaccinated with the MeNZB were 31 percent less likely to get gonorrhea than those who weren't. In the study, 1 million people who had been diagnosed with gonorrhea or chlamydia received the vaccine in a mass immunization program. Nearly 15,000 people were included in the analysis. It's not clear yet how long the immune response from this vaccine might last, but this is an important breakthrough. According to the World Health Organization, there are about 78 million new cases of this STD worldwide each year. Around 400,000 Americans were diagnosed with gonorrhea in 2015. Preventing infection in the first place seems to be the best option, ""and the most proven, reliable and cost-effective method of prevention would be the implementation of an effective vaccine,"" according to a 2016 study. Though the bacteria's biology makes it a particularly difficult adversary, scientists are optimistic about their prospects. Several hope to get a gonorrhea vaccine into clinical trials within the next decade. So far, mice have retained immunity for up to six months with this technique. Russell speculates that his lab could have a vaccine in clinical trials in the next five to 10 years, but there are some important questions to answer first. They want to better understand the mechanisms that make their vaccine successful, and make sure the immune response the technique elicits doesn't itself cause damage.

Fat freezing helps doctors enhance physiques, and their revenue Russell believes the work in his lab is the most mature and stands a good chance of being the first to the clinic. But to Gray-Owen, in practice the techniques would be complementary, perhaps providing immunity to different groups of people within the larger population. Once a vaccine becomes available, there might be hurdles in getting people to use it. One element might be the delivery method — Russell's treatment is administered vaginally in the mouse models, and he thinks that probably wouldn't be acceptable in humans, ""in part because it's not applicable in 50 percent of the population to start with,"" he says. There might be ethical issues to address, like if everyone should get it or only those at the highest risk, or if it's acceptable to put out a vaccine that only works on men or women but not both. Parents also might be wary of vaccinating kids against a sexually transmitted infection, as was the case with the HPV vaccine, Gray-Owen says. ""It might be difficult to convince parents that their young child should get a vaccine for gonorrhea. But as [the children] get older and start to realize the concern, if gonorrhea becomes untreatable or if the prevalence goes up in North America, I think that makes it not a crazy idea anymore,"" he says. Researchers in this field are overwhelmingly optimistic. Whereas their work might have seemed Sisyphean or irrelevant in the past, a successful vaccine seems closer at hand than ever. ""There are a lot of potential vaccine targets that have been identified, and we really need to get data from human trials as soon as possible. Given the high cost of clinical trial, it is likely that public–private partnerships will be required to drive development of a gonococcal vaccine,"" says Seib of Griffith University. ""I think it's going to be possible. I can't tell you exactly when it will be, but I think the findings that have emerged from our lab and elsewhere in recent years have made it likely to be feasible. There's been a lot of pessimism around for many years, but I think the tide is beginning to turn,"" Russell says. Given the current trend in gonorrhea infections and resistance, a vaccine like this could come just in time. The effectiveness of the flu shot wanes over time so it's best not to get it too early in the season, according to several recent studies. It takes 10 to 14 days to get the vaccine levels in your system so you are protected. Testosterone replacement therapy is gaining wider use, but there are potential health risks.

Moreover, if those competitors' low-cost imports continue to pressure U.S. steel producers that supply materials for everything from tractors to appliances, Ferriola said they would eventually engulf the whole U.S. market. ""There's no doubt, when you have predatory countries like China, as an example, they will take care of their own appliance [and] tractor industries in China before they worry about supplying steel to those American manufacturers here,"" the CEO said.

McCormick & Company Inc. (NYSE:MKC) recently announced it will acquire the food division of British consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser Group plc in a $4.2 billion deal that is expected to close later this year. Many products familiar to U.S. shoppers will join McCormick, including Frank's RedHot hot sauce, French's ketchup, French's mustard, and Cattleman's barbecue sauce. The deal will make McCormick the largest supplier of condiments in the United States. Image source: McCormick. Health, hygiene, and home products produced the lion's share of Reckitt Benckiser's more than $12 billion in 2016 revenue. Its food division was expected to provide $581 million in 2017 sales and the business has been growing in the mid-single digits, according to McCormick's management. The way McCormick CEO Lawrence Kurzius described it, Reckitt Benckiser's food division was a ""food asset trapped inside a nonfood company. ... For us, this is going to be a core business, and we're going to treat it accordingly."" McCormick believes it can give the acquired brands a friendlier base of operations as its $4.4 billion in 2016 revenue came entirely from food products. Management feels the company's expertise in the food business can result in increased sales due to more exposure to both the industrial segment of the market (which includes customers like restaurants), where McCormick sold 40% of its products,  and internationally, where McCormick sold 42% of its products in 2016. McCormick is a leader in spices and seasoning, with about 20% market share in the packaged retail spices and seasoning category of foods on a global basis. The key brand that drove McCormick to make the acquisition is Frank's RedHot Sauce, the product with the largest growth potential in the portfolio of brands that came with the acquisition. McCormick sees Frank's RedHot Sauce as a ""liquid spice"" that's very popular with millennials and has a runway for growth. ""... the hot sauce category and the Frank's RedHot brand, in particular, really drive the growth of the whole portfolio,"" said Kurzius. Management believes it can expand Frank's brand beyond the United States and Canada by increasing its presence in the Asian marketplace, where Western condiments have become quite popular, particularly for table-top usage in restaurants, not a distribution channel that current ownership has access to. McCormick management stated that their goal is to Make Frank's RedHot sauce the No. 1 global hot sauce brand. The company is also quite keen on French's mustard, the No. 1 brand in the U.S. and Canada. The price tag was $4.2 billion, which is over seven times the food division's estimated 2017 revenue of $581 million. The chart below shows McCormick's price to sales multiple over the past three years, which barely ever reached three. MKC PS Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts The price tag of $4.2 billion will be paid all in cash. McCormick will finance the deal in two ways. The company will work with lenders to borrow $3.7 billion. The other $500 million will come in the form of an equity offering of the company's stock. The company also announced, in light of the deal, it will suspend its share buyback program to conserve cash. Management reiterated that the company plans to continue issuing its quarterly dividend. The additional debt the company will take on will increase its borrowings from $804 million at the end of last quarter to a projected $4.5 billion when the deal closes. The company said it will update shareholders once the deal closes toward the end of this year. Until then, management will continue to focus on the current brands under the McCormick umbrella. The company sees French's products being its No. 2 brand and Frank's RedHot Sauce as its No. 3 brand, both of which will help McCormick move up from its current position as the No. 10 condiments supplier in the United States to No. 1 stateside and No. 3 on a global basis. This is a big investment for the company; the largest acquisition it has ever made. It is taking on a lot of debt to make the purchase. Time will tell if management is able to integrate the business, execute its plan, and reward shareholders with a higher stock price. ","

Martin Feldstein,07272017,MarketWatch,07202017,"Published: July 26, 2017 4:24 p.m. ET Study shows enrollment drops may not harm patient heath, but could inflict financial pain By CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Project Syndicate) — Health-care reform is the major policy issue commanding attention in the United States. A crucial feature of the debate is the official estimate of the number of individuals who would lose their health insurance under the various plans that have been proposed to repeal and replace the existing Affordable Care Act (better known as “Obamacare”). The prospect that repealing Obamacare would cause more than 20 million people to lose their formal insurance coverage, as the Congressional Budget Office has estimated, is understandably a serious barrier to legislative progress. It is important, therefore, to understand just what that would mean in practice, and how much it would actually affect the health of those who lose their formal insurance. The primary reason for the loss of insurance in the proposals to repeal and replace Obamacare is the projected decline in Medicaid coverage. Medicaid is the joint federal-state health-care program in which the federal government defines who is eligible, stipulates which benefits must be provided, and finances those benefits based on a formula whereby states with low average incomes receive a larger share of federal funding. People who qualify for Medicaid do receive substantially more care than those without formal insurance — more doctor visits, prescriptions, hospital admissions, etc. They also have substantially lower out-of-pocket medical costs than the uninsured, including the elimination of “catastrophic” out-of-pocket costs. As a result, they are also much less likely to skip paying other bills because of medical debts or to have nonmedical bills sent to collection. If reform legislation reduces Medicaid benefits, the individuals who lose benefits would continue to receive free care in outpatient departments, emergency rooms, and as hospital in-patients. In general, this is paid for by the states through their “free care” programs. And individuals who are billed for services understand that providers generally do not attempt to collect from low-income patients. Moreover, those who are no longer in the Medicaid program do not lose care from the many doctors who now refuse to serve Medicaid patients because of the low fees allowed in the program. The most important fact to bear in mind is that enrollees in Medicaid show no significant improvement in clinical physical health outcomes. This was the main finding of a large “natural experiment” supported by the federal government. The experiment occurred when the state of Oregon opened enrollment to Medicaid in 2008, after the opportunity had been closed for many years. Because the state did not have enough funds to accept all 90,000 individuals who wanted to enroll, it conducted a lottery to select about 30,000 individuals who were given the opportunity to apply for Medicaid. A federally financed research team of physicians and health-care economists examined hospital records and other clinical information and also spoke with the enrollees and with those not admitted. The researchers concluded that self-reported overall health and depression improved among those who enrolled in Medicaid, and that there was an increase in the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes for this group. But there was no significant improvement in clinical physical outcomes for conditions including hypertension, high cholesterol, or diabetes. Although the evidence indicates that the proposed cutbacks in federal dollars for Medicaid would not harm the physical health of those who lost their coverage, the reduction would force states to increase spending on their free-care programs. The cuts would also increase the costs to hospitals that provide care that is not reimbursed. It is not surprising that the prospect of adding these costs for tens of millions of patients to states’ budgets and to hospital costs causes state governors and hospital administrators to protest when Congress proposes cutting back on the Medicaid program. But it is important for the public and members of Congress to understand the real reason for their opposition.

Mengjie (Jessie) Jiang,07272017,MarketWatch,07202017,"Published: July 20, 2017 2:58 p.m. ET By WASHINGTON — Negotiations for a new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement should give President Donald Trump “a victory,” but not at the expense of Mexico and Canada, Canadian Ambassador David MacNaughton said Thursday. MacNaughton, speaking at a forum sponsored by the Washington International Trade Association, acknowledged the necessity to revamp the 23-year-old accord given the transformation of businesses, but emphasized a successful revamp should be flexible and “do no harm.” Mexican Ambassador Gerónimo Gutiérrez agreed, saying said Mexico has benefited tremendously from the three-nation trade pact and is looking for a “win-win-win” solution. The Trump administration said Monday its top priority for the talks was to shrink the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada. In an 18-page summary of objectives, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he would work to reduce the trade imbalance by improving access for U.S. goods exported to Canada and Mexico. Gutiérrez said the overarching objective would not be simply U.S. trade deficit reduction -- the three governments are interested in creating more and better jobs. “We have to move away from talking about the macroeconomic impacts of NAFTA, and emphasize the local impact on people,” said Gutiérrez. “We must listen to what people have to say. I think there are people in America who feel left out from benefits of Nafta.” Gutiérrez noted that Mexico proposed an anticorruption addition to Nafta. The newly released U.S. objectives include renegotiating intellectual property rights, stricter labor laws, enhanced environmental laws and tougher rules on the origin of products. The U.S. also reportedly wants to get rid of a system under Nafta that prevents the U.S. from pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Mexico and Canada. “It makes sense to have a dispute resolution mechanism,” said MacNaughton. “We have to find ways where President Trump can claim victory without it being a loss to Canada or Mexico.” The first round of talks will take place Aug.16 to Aug.20 in Washington, Lighthizer’s office said in a statement Wednesday. Officials from the three countries plan to hold seven round of talks at three-week intervals to finish the Nafta renegotiation rapidly. Lighthizer has said he hopes the negotiations could be wrapped up by the end of the year, which he called a “very, very quick” time frame, but added that “we’re not going to have a bad agreement to save time.” When Nafta was created in 1994, the U.S. ran a small trade surplus with Mexico and Canada. In 2016, the United States had a nearly $11 billion trade deficit in goods with Canada and a $64 billion gap with Mexico. Trump called the trade agreement “the worse trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere” and threatened to pull out if he can’t push the trilateral trade accord to the best interest of the U.S. “I think people don’t understand how close we were [to withdrawal from Nafta],” said Gutiérrez. “Every political actor in the United States who understands the importance of Nafta needs to be vocal about it.” ",What Mexico and Canada want from the Nafta renegotiation - MarketWatch

Ciara Linnane,07272017,MarketWatch,07202017,"Published: July 27, 2017 7:39 a.m. ET AK Steel slides 8% after President Trump signals a possible change of heart on tariffs and import restrictions By Shares of United States Steel Corp. rallied Wednesday to buck the broader trend among steel stocks, after the company swung to a profit in the second quarter from a massive first-quarter loss. The earnings seemed to offset comments from President Donald Trump on Tuesday that signaled a possible change of heart on a plan to impose additional tariffs and restrictions on cheap steel imports. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said “we don’t want to do it at this moment.” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has been working on a seldom-used Section 232 investigation to determine whether steel imports are harming U.S. national security. Ross had intended to complete the report by the end of June, but the effort was braked because of objections from trading partners and some of Trump’s aides. Trump told the paper the issue was still on the table, and reiterated his view that dumping is “a very unfair situation.” But he said a final decision may have to wait until other stalled initiatives, including health-care reform and tax reform and even infrastructure, are completed. Read the WSJ interview here. The comments sent other steel stocks into a downward spiral.

Under Burrit’s leadership, the company posted net income of $261 million for the second quarter, or $1.48 a share, after a loss of $180 million, or $1.03 a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose to $3.14 billion from $2.73 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting earnings of 36 cents a share on revenue of $2.98 billion. U.S. Steel expects full-year earnings of $1.70 a share, while analysts estimate earnings of 84 cents a share. J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Gambardella said the beat was driven by flat rolled realized prices and costs. Flat steel products are used in the automotive, domestic appliance, shipbuilding and construction industries. “Costs were lower due to the benefits from the restart of the Keetac facility and typical seasonal improvements in the mining operations,” he wrote in a note ahead of the company’s earnings call. “Tubular posted a smaller than expected loss with higher shipments and average selling prices as well as lower costs.” Gambardella said he expected Section 232 to be a key topic on the Wednesday earnings call. CEO Burritt said he was confident the Trump administration ‘would come to the right conclusion.” “In order to have a strong U.S. manufacturing base, we must have a strong steel industry,” he told analysts. “ So goes our manufacturing base, so goes our country and we firmly believe that this administration understand the importance U.S. deal to this country.” U.S. Steel shares have fallen 39% in 2017, while the S&P 500

MarketWatch,07272017,MarketWatch,07202017,"Published: July 26, 2017 6:45 p.m. ET By Foxconn, a global electronics manufacturer best known for building Apple’s iPhones, will open a new factory in southeastern Wisconsin that the company says will initially employ 3,000, a figure that could eventually grow to 13,000 jobs. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s office said the plant represents a $10 billion investment, “the largest new greenfield investment made by a foreign-based company in U.S. history.” Foxconn CEO Terry Gou announced plans for the new facility in a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House attended by President Donald Trump, Wisconsin’s Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, House Speaker Paul Ryan, who represents the district in which the plant will be constructed, and Walker. “I would see Terry, and I would say ‘Terry, you have to give us one of these massive places you do great work with,’” Trump said, later telling Gou “the American worker will not let you down.” Employees at the new facility will manufacture state-of-the-art liquid crystal display screens which will be used in everything from self-driving cars to aircraft systems and in the fields of education, entertainment, health care, safety and surveillance, advanced manufacturing systems, and office automation, among others, Walker’s announcement said. “We are thrilled to build a state-of-the art display fabrication plant in America’s heartland, which will be the first of a series of facilities we are building in several U.S. states as part of a robust 8K+5G ecosystem in the United States,” Gou said. Gou said the U.S. does not currently have the capabilities “to produce a complete 8K system,” referring to the highest high definition television resolution. “We are going to change that and it starts today with this investment in Wisconsin,” Gou said. Foxconn first established operations in the United States in 1988 and has facilities and offices in Alabama, California, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia. Their operations include manufacturing, assembly and R&D facilities, as well as offices which are involved in sourcing from U.S. supply chain partners, product servicing and manufacturing sales. The company, which has been the subject of protests in the past over working conditions at its facilities, also has operations in Asia, Europe and Latin America.

MarketWatch,07272017,MarketWatch,07202017,"Analysis  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events Early Saturday morning, President Trump declared via tweet that “all agree the U.S. President has the complete power to pardon.” It will come as little shock that many do not agree on this point, especially when it comes to the question of whether the president can pardon himself. In fact, a new wing of the Internet has been opened to debate this point. The pardon power is exceptionally broad It is true that the pardon power is, indeed, one of the strongest unilateral authorities of the presidency. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution says that the president “shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.” That language carves out two quick exceptions to the notion of “complete” pardon power. Presidential pardons cannot derail or overrule the impeachment process. And they can be used only for federal crimes, not for crimes that violate state law. But those are relatively small limitations. Most presidential powers come with an asterisk of sorts. Appointees require Senate confirmation, for instance; vetoes can be overridden. The pardon power does not. Justice Stephen Field, writing for the Supreme Court in the 1866 case Ex parte Garland (not Merrick), held that the pardon power was, except as already noted, “unlimited. … It extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission.” Thus pardons can indeed be issued even before someone is formally charged with an offense. And the pardon “cannot be fettered by any legislative restrictions.” Pardons can be individually merciful Field also called the power “the benign prerogative of mercy,” highlighting one of the reasons for its existence. Seen this way, the power is a check against judicial overreach, against a miscarriage of justice, available as an act of compassion. For instance, past presidents routinely commuted the sentences of elderly prisoners at death’s door (or said to be. William Howard Taft wrote in his memoir about two of his commutations along these lines: “One man died and kept his contract. The other recovered at once, and seems to be as healthy and active as anyone I know.”) Without the pardon option, Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 74, “justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel.” Pardons can be granted in the public interest But as Jeffrey Crouch’s 2009 book about the pardon power notes, “mercy” is not the whole story: The other traditional rationale for including the power in the Constitution is as a tool to serve a broader public interest. Hamilton covered this, too, with the example of a “well-timed offer of pardon” to insurgents that “may restore the tranquillity of the commonwealth.” George Washington used the power in this manner when in 1795 he set aside the death sentences of two ringleaders of the Whiskey Rebellion. In a rather different application, Thomas Jefferson pardoned all those convicted under the Alien and Sedition Acts. Both Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson issued proclamations of amnesty relating to the Civil War. Jimmy Carter granted a blanket pardon to more than 200,000 men charged with evading the Vietnam draft. And much more recently, in lieu of hoped-for legislation on criminal sentencing reform, Barack Obama used his clemency powers to shorten more than 1,700 prison terms he thought were harshly skewed by mandatory minimum sentences that punished nonviolent crimes. Sometimes, of course, presidents use the “public interest” rationale to pardon specific people rather than groups. In late 1921, for instance, Warren Harding commuted the prison sentence of Socialist presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs, who had been convicted of violating the Espionage Act by criticizing the U.S. government during World War I. And in September 1974, in what Crouch calls “the most notorious pardon in U.S. history,” Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon, who had resigned the presidency in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Ford explained that “the tranquility to which this nation has been restored by the events of recent weeks could be irreparably lost” by what could be a years-long prosecution of the former president. [What can Watergate teach us about the Trump White House?] Over time, many came to agree with Ford’s rationale. But the pardon had huge political consequences across several years. Ford’s approval rating rapidly dropped from above 70 percent to below 50 percent. His press secretary resigned in protest. The suspicion that he may have cut a deal with Nixon (with the latter agreeing to resign, if pardoned) prompted Ford to become the first sitting president in more than a century to travel to Capitol Hill to testify before a congressional committee. Republicans lost nearly 50 House seats in the 1974 midterm election and Ford lost his bid for election in 1976. And pardons can be very controversial Thus, although the word “amnesty” comes from the same root as “amnesia,” people don’t tend to forget even the perceived misuse of the pardon power — that is, applied for neither reasons of mercy nor public policy, but rather out of self-interest. A long sequence of presidents have discovered this — as political scientist P.S. Ruckman notes, “Every generation of Americans has seen its controversial pardon … or nine.” In recent administrations, George H.W. Bush’s lame-duck pardon of six officials caught up in the Iran-contra scandal prompted accusations that Bush was seeking to conceal his involvement in the matter. George W. Bush spared I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby a 30-month jail sentence after Libby was convicted of perjury charges related to the leak of a CIA officer’s identity. (Bush, however, declined to grant a full pardon, angering Libby’s immediate boss, Vice President Richard B. Cheney.) Bill Clinton granted clemency to 176 people just two hours before leaving office in 2001. Among them were his half brother, Roger Clinton, (for a 1985 drug conviction) and, most controversially, Marc Rich and Pincus Green, who had fled to Switzerland after a 1983 indictment for tax evasion. That decision was further tainted by the fact that Rich’s ex-wife had given close to half a million dollars to the Clinton presidential library fund (and more than $1 million to Democratic candidates since 1993.) If a president is ‘himself a party to the guilt, he can be impeached and prosecuted.’ The category of self-serving pardons brings us back to the present day. Objections to the pardon power at the constitutional convention centered on the fear that a president guilty of treason would use it to shield his accomplices from punishment. But, James Wilson assured his fellow delegates, if the president “be himself a party to the guilt he can be impeached and prosecuted.” Whether that implies the president cannot pardon himself, or simply that the framers could not conceive Americans electing a president who would need to, remains a question. As the links at the top of this post highlight, there is no consensus on the legality of such an act. By contrast, history suggests that the political implications are quite clear. Trump may find out that something can be both legal and, simultaneously, an impeachable offense. [So what exactly counts as an impeachable offense?] ",Here’s what you need to know about the presidential power to pardon - The Washington Post
John Coumarianos,07272017,MarketWatch,07202017,"Published: July 24, 2017 3:36 p.m. ET Investors in Russia deal with uncertainty and shadowy companies By Russia’s stock market sure looks cheap, trading at a CAPE ratio (price relative to its past decade’s worth of average real earnings) of 4.9. By contrast, U.S. stocks trade at a 30 CAPE. If you were investing strictly on the numbers, you’d certainly consider putting long-term money in Russian stocks right now. Of course, a moment’s reflection regarding Russia reveals why you might think twice about investing strictly on the numbers. Former hedge fund manager Bill Browder’s thriller of a memoir, “Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man’s Fight for Justice,” published in 2015, suggests why investors are so down on Russian stocks. It may also offer clues into the Trump-Russia saga. Browder, founder of Hermitage Capital Management, was among the first Western investors in Russia when communism fell. With the backing of influential financier Edmond Safra, he bought Russian stocks trading at ridiculously low prices. As Browder tells it, vouchers that the Russian government gave citizens as claims on businesses shifting from government-run to privately owned traded at prices that valued all of Russian industry at just $20 billion. Browder estimates that Gazprom

                                    which itself has a current market capitalization approaching $350 billion. After the turbulent transition from the Soviet Union to Boris Yeltsin’s Russia, and the suspicious acquisition by various oligarchs of large swaths of Russia’s industry, Browder viewed President Vladimir Putin favorably; perhaps Putin could clean up the corruption. It turned out that Putin did take on the original oligarchs, but, according to Browder, also seized large pieces of Russian industry for himself and his cronies. Putin led a group that, in Browder’s opinion, became the new oligarchs or kleptocrats. Browder did a kind of forensic accounting and ownership analysis of various Russian businesses, and surmised that government officials had stolen or re-titled 10% of Gazprom’s assets. Browder became an activist shareholder, was deemed a threat to Russian national security in 2006, and no longer permitted to enter the country. His attorney, Sergei Magnitsky, was charged with a $290 million tax fraud that he and Browder had originally uncovered on the part of others, and was imprisoned for almost a year. Magnitsky died during his pre-trial detention, likely from being denied medical treatment. With his hedge fund now closed, Browder spent the next few years lobbying Congress to pass the Magnitsky Act, prohibiting those responsible for Magnitsky’s death from entering the United States and gaining access to the U.S. banking system. The law was signed by former President Barack Obama on December 14, 2012. A reportedly infuriated Putin retaliated by banning the adoption of Russian children by U.S. citizens, and also by banning certain U.S. citizens from Russia, including former U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara. President Trump fired Bharara soon after taking office. That’s why it’s plausible Russia sought to discuss both adoptions and the Magnitsky Act, at the June 2016 meeting between a Russian delegation and representatives of the Trump campaign, as the Washington Post’s Anne Applebaum has suggested. Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, who attended the meeting, has advocated against the Magnitsky Act, including keeping Magnitsky’s name off the law. She also represented former vice governor of the Moscow region Pyotr Katsyv’s son, Denis, whom Bharara charged with laundering money in Manhattan real estate stolen from Browder’s fund. Against such a backdrop, investors, suspecting fraud and theft, have been wary of Russian stocks. Indeed, Russia’s market has traded at single-digit multiples for years. Russian companies pose more than the ordinary uncertainty investors face around future asset values and earnings. Investors should understand that when you buy Russian stocks, it’s hard to know what — or who — will support or derail your investment. Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

In fact, the issue now is that the euro is too strong — not that it is too weak. But hold on. There is a problem with investors’ sudden love affair with the euro, and one they need to wake up to fast. They are reckoning without European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. In fact, a strengthening euro is absolutely the last things he needs as he kindles the fragile flames of an economic recovery. Can he send it back down again? Sure he can. And traders would be foolish to try and fight him. Over the last month, the euro has started to power ahead on the currency markets. At the start of this year, it was down to $1.04 against the dollar, and with difficult elections scheduled in France and the Netherlands it was not hard to see it going to parity or even below. And now? Over the last few months, it has steadily climbed to $1.16, and it is still going up. In the last three months alone, it has put on more than 6%. In the markets, bullish bets on the currency have hit their highest level in more than a year, according to an analysis by Rabobank.  A $1.20 rate looks like an easy target – and $1.30 may be possible by the autumn. It is not likely to hit the $1.59 it peaked at back in 2008, but there is no reason why it can’t keep climbing. It is not hard to understand why the euro is suddenly strong again. With the victory of President Emmanuel Macron in France, the continent looks a lot more stable. Not only does he have a huge mandate, but if he can push through reforms to the way the currency works, he can take the risk of a break-up splintering off the table. The ECB’s €2.2 trillion of quantitative easing has finally started to feed through into higher growth figures. Only this week, the International Monetary Fund upgraded its 2017 forecasts for most of the zone’s major economies — Germany by 0.1%, France by 0.2%, and Spain and Italy by 0.5%. Indeed, with a 3.1% expansion forecast for this year, Spain will have one of the fastest growing major economies in the world. At the same time, with Donald Trump’s presidency looking more and more chaotic, the dollar

                                   is far less attractive than it was. The euro is a far better home for spare cash than most of the major alternatives. The trouble is, a stronger currency is the last thing Europe needs right now. Exports are the foundation of most of the major European economies, and as the currency gets stronger they will inevitably get hit. In peripheral Europe, where exports are based on price more than anything else, and where the recovery is most needed, they will be hit especially hard. Indeed, stock markets across the continent have already started to suffer as investors figure out that the currency will hurt company profits and then jobs as well. The recovery needs to put down deep roots to repair the damage of the last decade — but a strong euro will stop that. So what could Draghi do to turn that around? True, managing the foreign-exchange markets is an impossible task. But that does not mean he is completely powerless to influence the direction of the currency. First, he could extend QE. With the economy recovering, and with the threat of outright deflation banished at least for now, there is lots of speculation that the ECB will start tapering its program of printing fresh money. In fact, that is one reason why the euro has been climbing. So far, Draghi himself has been fairly neutral on the issue, giving few clues one way or the other. But a strongly worded statement extending the scale and duration of QE would quickly have the trading desks unwinding all those bullish euro bets. Next, change the asset mix. One reason there has been so much speculation about tapering QE is because the ECB may soon run out of government bonds it is allowed to hold. So buy something else. A powerful move into buying equities directly, or even an experiment with — and send the currency hurtling back down again. Three, line up a dove as the next president. Draghi’s term does not end until 2019 but there is already jockeying to succeed him. The assumption is that a German will get the job next time. After all, it is their turn — and that means a stern Bundesbank hardliner. But making it clear it is likely to be a dove from peripheral Europe — Ireland’s Philip Lane is one possible candidate — would send a powerful signal the ECB is not going to change course. In his six years in the presidency, Draghi has proved himself a smart operator. When the history books are written, he may well go down as the man who saved the euro, and with it the European project. He surely knows, however, that a stronger euro is the one thing that could prevent his recovery lasting, especially in peripheral, Southern Europe where it is most needed. At some point, he will decide to bring the currency under control — and you won’t want to be on the other side of that trade when it happens. Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

 ,07272017,MarketWatch,07202017,"Supported by By Stanley Reed When major oil producers met in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Monday, the talk was tough. Officials hoped to show they were following through on plans to cut production and, in turn, bolster prices. The oil minister of Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest exporter, even cut short his summer vacation to attend. The result? Meh. Markets appear to have shrugged off a raft of announcements meant to address concerns that production cuts agreed upon last year are failing to achieve their goal of soaking up excess oil supply and pushing prices higher. “Did Saudi pull a rabbit out of the hat?” wrote Helima Croft, an oil analyst at the investment bank RBC Capital Markets. “No.” The meeting on Monday brought together the 14-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, and several other major producers, including Russia and Oman. In a statement after the meeting, the group seemed content with mildly tough talk, chastising (unidentified) countries for failing to follow through with promised cuts to output. “There is still room for improvement by some participating producing countries,” the group said. “All participating producing countries must promptly reach full conformity.” Those comments appeared to target, among other nations, Iraq, a major OPEC producer that is producing well above its quota. But it is not clear how easy it will be for the Saudis and others to bring the war-torn country, which desperately needs revenue to address an array of problems, in line. The meeting also did little to fix the problem of rapid production increases by Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC members exempt from the cuts. Nigeria did agree to carry out some “adjustments,” but only once its sustained output reaches 1.8 million barrels a day. (It is currently well below that level.) Saudi Arabia said it would cut exports to 6.6 million barrels a day for August, about 700,000 barrels below the levels of a year ago. Analysts said that move represented yet another attempt to influence markets, especially in the United States, a highly visible destination for Saudi crude. Summer is when Saudi Arabia typically diverts oil from exports toward domestic use, to help generate electricity for air-conditioning during the Arabian Peninsula’s searing heat. Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s. Taken together, the various moves helped push crude prices up about 1 percent on Monday, to more than $48.50 a barrel. But the relative lack of an effect on oil prices suggested that the agreement was not working, and the tough talk has raised concerns that unity in the group is fraying. And if this maneuvering has few lasting effects, the whole output-cutting exercise could start looking like a mistake. “I think the meeting revealed that there are some tensions starting to grow within the group,” said Robert McNally, president of the Rapidan Group, a market research firm. The oil producers’ group acknowledged that while it wants to cut excess supplies, they remain elevated. If that situation continues into November, when OPEC is scheduled to meet, those tensions could mount and jeopardize the whole effort, Mr. McNally said.

Prices continued to climb in electronic trading late Tuesday, topping $48 a barrel, after data from an industry group reportedly showed a hefty drop in weekly supplies for U.S. crude. Early Wednesday, oil prices were extending those gains. On Monday, Saudi Arabia said at a meeting in Russia that it would cut August exports to 6.6 million barrels a day—a million barrels less than a year earlier. Separately, Nigeria, which isn’t part of the production-cut agreement led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, also promised to limit its daily production to 1.8 million barrels. Traders have taken these developments as bullish for prices, though many do point out that the Saudis normally lower exports at this time of year because of stronger domestic demand for oil, and Nigeria’s output would still have to rise from its current level of just over 1.6 million barrels a day before the West African nation would cap its output. Still, at the meeting Monday, which include some major non-OPEC nations such as Russia, oil producers were upbeat. “OPEC and non-OPEC members displayed optimism over the current production cut deal and seemed confident that the path they were treading would eventually rebalance the markets,” said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, in an note Tuesday. Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said Monday the coalition’s compliance with the production deal was strong, while OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said the rebalancing of oil-market supply and demand is “bound to accelerate in the second half,” according to The Wall Street Journal. On Tuesday, United Arab Emirates followed Saudi Arabia’s lead, with its energy minister Mohamed al-Mazrouei announcing on Twitter that the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company will cut its crude exports by about 10% in September. Adding further support to oil prices, James Williams, energy economist at WTRG Economics, pointed to “Halliburton’s expectation of a flat rig count” as well as “Anadarko Petroleum Corp.’s losses and plans to reduce exploration.” After posting a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss, oil-and-gas exploration and production company Anadarko Petroleum Corp.

Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts expect the Energy Information Administration to report on Wednesday a decline of 2.5 million barrels for crude stockpiles in the week ended July 21. “U.S. oil stocks, while still higher than we need, are down 45 million barrels from the end of March,” said Williams, citing EIA data. Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, reported a whopping 10.2 million-barrel decline in last week’s U.S. crude stockpiles, according to sources. That sent prices to a high well over $48 in electronic trading. “We are seeing the fact that OPEC cuts are starting to matter,” Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, told MarketWatch late Tuesday. The “draw erases the myth that shale can offset OPEC and non-OPEC cuts barrel for barrel.” Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

Myra P. Saefong,07272017,MarketWatch,07202017,"Published: July 26, 2017 8:31 a.m. ET NEW YORK, Jul 26, 2017 (PR Newswire Europe via COMTEX) -- NEW YORK, July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Mounting research from around the world suggests marijuana's potential to treat multiple medical conditions ranging from chronic pain to cancer, epilepsy, HIV/AIDS, anxiety and more. Predicted to reach $55.8 billion by 20251, the global medical marijuana industry presents to investors a wide array of investment opportunities, driven by increasing demand for therapeutic applications of the drug. In turn, funds raised through the public market give marijuana companies the chance to raise capital to build stronger portfolios, increase their market reach and revenue, and offer cannabis-based alternatives to traditional medicine. Companies such as ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. , Medical Marijuana, Inc. , CV Sciences, Inc. , Terra Tech Corp. , and Marijuana Company of America, Inc. are operating in the medical marijuana scene and are steadily building a strong reputation as leading providers of cannabis-based health and wellness products and services. Created as a premier source of financial information for Chinese-speaking investors, ChineseInvestors.com [https://www.networknewswire.com/clients/chineseinvestors-com-ciix/?symbol=ciix ] (otcqb:CIIX) is carving for itself a hefty portion of the cannabis market through diversified entry points. Adding to its current operations, CIIX earlier this week announced (http://nnw.fm/3nlZM) its entry into China's skincare industry though the impending launch of a new line of cannabidiol-based skincare products. ""Although ancient Chinese recognized the medicinal properties of the cannabis plant, CBD extract appears to be largely unrecognized in China today for its benefits, including but not limited to, its potential benefits to the largest visible human organ, the skin. The effects of increased air pollution on the human body are a growing concern for many in China. With regard to our skin, toxins in air pollution promote the production of free radicals, causing premature aging including coarse wrinkles and dark spots. However, some dermatologists believe that the anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory agents in CBD can potentially have anti-aging effects on the skin,"" the company stated in the press release. The opportunity here is significant, as you look at the broader market. China is currently the second largest consumer of skincare products, generating annual retail sales of more than $29.6 billion2. Research from ReportLinker estimates that Chinese skincare product retail sales will reach $36.3 billion this year. The CBD Magic Hemp Series, to be launched by early September by CIIX's wholly-owned CBD Biotechnology Co. Ltd. subsidiary (http://nnw.fm/VC7oZ), will position CIIX as a first mover in this previously untapped sector of the Chinese skincare industry. CIIX has filed a record of the product line with the Chinese Food and Drug Administration, and the company anticipates capturing, ""100% of China's market share in this novel skin care products category,"" since, to its knowledge, other manufacturers have not yet entered the cannabis skincare product market in China. Again targeting an untapped niche of the marijuana market, CIIX operates the first Chinese-language online store selling cannabidiol (CBD) products. In December 2016, CIIX launched www.ChineseCBDoil.com [https://www.networknewswire.com/?s=ChineseCBDoil ] in Shanghai, catering to a growing audience of Chinese people interested in the benefits of CBD-based products for the treatment of various medical conditions such as stress, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, and others. In conjunction with the launch of the website, CIIX introduced the first Yelp-style social media app in Chinese. The app, approved by the Apple store, is a platform for reviews and discussions about cannabis products and provides a comprehensive database of dispensaries and marijuana strains, all in the Chinese language. CIIX is also getting ready to open its first retail store, primarily targeting the Chinese community in San Gabriel, California. The store will sell the company's new OptHemp product line, launched by subsidiary ChineseHempOil.com, Inc., to treat pain and inflammation. In July, CIIX announced (http://nnw.fm/6ThNn) that www.ChineseHempOil.com [https://www.networknewswire.com/?s=ChineseHempOil ] will accept bitcoin payments for its health products, food and beverages. Another recognizable marijuana company focused on market firsts is Medical Marijuana, Inc. . MJNA was the first publicly-traded marijuana company in the United States; the first to make cannabidiol available domestically and abroad; and the first to establish a global CBD pipeline that made beneficial cannabinoid products available to people all over the world. In addition to establishing an international CBD pipeline, providing support services to the cannabis industry and working to develop new markets, MJNA is focusing on the development and distribution of CBD hemp oil health products such as HempMeds(R) and Kannaway(R), in addition to developing cannabis medication via subsidiaries AXIM Biotechnologies, Kannalife(TM) Sciences, and HempMeds(R). The companies are looking into different delivery methods for marijuana-based therapies and are targeting a wide range of conditions including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, chronic pain and more. Medical marijuana player CV Sciences (otcqb:CVSI) operates its corner of the market via two different business segments: pharmaceuticals and consumer products. Its pharmaceutical division is developing synthetic CBD-based medicines for various medical conditions, with approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Its pipeline currently includes a CBD-based product designed to support cessation of tobacco addiction. The consumer products division manufactures and distributes plant-based CBD products designed to enhance quality of life. CVSI's flagship consumer products, PlusCBD Oil and Purified Liquids vaping blends, are already distributed nationwide via health care providers, health food stores and online. Terra Tech (otcqx:TRTC) is a vertically-integrated cannabis agriculture company that owns multiple subsidiaries in the medical marijuana space. One of these subsidiaries is Bluem(TM), a retail medical cannabis company that provides medical cannabis as an alternative treatment for patients with chronic conditions. Also offering cannabis to the adult-use market in Nevada, where the sale of marijuana for recreational purposes is legal, Bluem offers recreational and medicinal consumer products such as flowers and concentrates produced according to the highest standards of potency and purity. Terra Tech is committed to cultivating only high-quality medical marijuana and providing it to qualified and registered medical marijuana establishments throughout the United States. At the same time, the company is continuing research to cultivate and cross-breed medical marijuana strains for the treatment of many different medical conditions. As demand for medical marijuana grows, so does the need for grow space. Marijuana Company of America is primarily focused on the marketing and distribution of hemp via a diverse portfolio of companies, brands, joint ventures and investments such as hempSMART, Club Harmoneous, GateC Research, Bougainville and MoneyTrac Technology. The company earlier this month said it has received financing that it will use to develop a state-of-the-art 30,000-square-foot greenhouse grow facility in Oroville, Washington, with joint-venture partner Bougainville Ventures, Inc. At full capacity, the facility is expected to accommodate cannabis production and processing of its tenant, a Tier 3, I-502 licensed grower. MCOA said it plans to replicate this business model to build its real estate portfolio and increase revenues. These public companies, expanding their market reach and brand recognition in their respective niches of the medical marijuana market, provide ample opportunities for investors looking for an entrance into the booming medical marijuana market. Proponents of marijuana for medical purposes point to a growing number of studies that confirm the health benefits of cannabis, setting the industry on track to continue its strong performance and become a key industry and engine of economic growth.

TPG Capital completed its acquisition of Mediware from buyout firm Thoma Bravo LLC earlier this year for an undisclosed sum. Mediware sells software programs that help with administration and costs savings to healthcare providers including blood banks, behavioral health providers, home healthcare providers and more. It is poised to grow significantly in the coming years, as healthcare providers aim to cut costs through the use of new technologies and increasingly rely on outpatient care centers rather than traditional hospitals. As chief executive of Mediware, Miller told Reuters he plans on pursuing a balanced growth strategy across its various areas of focus, ranging from human services to home health and more. He added that he Mediware will rely on a blend of organic growth and acquisitions. Earlier this year, Mediware acquired Kinnser Software, which provides software for home health and hospice providers. Thoma Bravo took Mediware private in 2012 for $195 million and built it out with acquisitions including Bowman Systems, which focuses on homeless management. TPG has previously invested in other healthcare technology companies including Evolent Health and IMS Health. ","

,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed over the 22,000 mark for the first time on Wednesday, but investor fears about the sustainability of the gains took the shine off the round number milestone. The rally lost momentum during the day’s trading and despite the recent run up, helped by strong earnings from Apple Inc and Boeing Co, some technical indicators were flashing warning signs. “The market gain has been built on a narrow group of issues. That typically is not indicative of great health,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “I would not be shocked ... if we saw a pullback.” And with the Dow industrials at a record high, Dow theory suggests that the Dow Transportation Average index should also hit a record in order to confirm the market’s march higher. But that index trails the Dow industrials’ year-to-date performance by almost 10 percentage points and is nearly 6 percent below its own July 14 record high. Also, overall market breadth, or the number of winning stocks relative to losers, is weakening even as the major U.S. indexes hover near record highs. That means the broad gains have been driven by advances in a declining number of companies, and market watchers fear they could be hard to sustain. The number of 52-week lows among NYSE- and Nasdaq-traded stocks is at its highest since late June while the number of 52-week highs has dropped sharply since mid-July. (For a graphic on 'U.S. stock market breadth' click reut.rs/2hnL4Ob) Apple, McDonald’s Corp and UnitedHealth Group Inc have each added more than 200 points to the index. The Dow is a price-weighted index, meaning names like Apple, with its $157 price tag, and Boeing, which closed Wednesday near $238 per share, will generally have more of an influence over the index than components like the roughly $25 per share General Electric Co. The lack of breadth as well as the underperformance by the Dow transports could be a signal that the market rally could be sputtering out, at least for now. Julian Emanuel, executive director of U.S. equity and derivatives strategy at UBS in New York, said the weakness of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday versus the strength of Apple shares showed an “underlying fatigue in the rally.” The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite traded flat on Wednesday, even as Apple jumped nearly 5 percent. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets in London, said the Dow milestone was “a remarkable thing for investors ... but at the same time, this could also be a trap if the momentum does not follow.” The more than eight-year-old bull market in U.S. stocks got a second wind after last year’s election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, on expectations that his business-friendly policies including tax cuts and deregulation would boost corporate gains and economic growth. But tax cuts and other parts of the Trump agenda have not materialized, leaving earnings growth as the real engine of the market. “Earnings growth allows the market to be patient about Washington. It allows the market to be patient about fiscal reform,” said Steven Chiavarone, portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York, who said they would “be buyers on any weakness.” Fundamentals remain strong. With 350 of 500 companies’ reports in, the S&P 500 index is on track to post back-to-back double-digit quarterly earnings growth for the first time in almost six years. Still, the market is expensive by historical standards. Investors are paying $18 for every $1 in expected S&P 500 earnings over the next 12 months, near the highest since 2004 and above the long-term price-to-earnings average multiple of 15. “The market isn’t without issues as it relates to valuations which are full if not somewhat expensive,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. He expects the Dow to go beyond 22,000, however. There is also summer seasonality to take into account. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital in London, said the Dow’s run up past 22,000 was “indicative of a bull market speeding to a top.” “August is usually not a great month for stocks, up five times in the last 20, so there is caution about how long this can be sustained beyond earnings season euphoria,” Wilson said.

,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"With John McCain’s dramatic “no” vote, the Health Care Freedom Act (HFCA) died early last Friday morning and with it any hope of repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for the foreseeable future. While conservatives might prefer to blame incompetent vote-whipping in the Senate, the ACA could prove resilient for the same reason Medicare and Social Security have: most voters prefer not to wonder if they will be able to eat when hungry or see a doctor when sick. Any program that gives more economic security to a broad, politically powerful group will be dangerous to meddle with, even in these polarized times. Conservative activists and pundits who don’t want to contend with that reality may point to the president they were dealt: Donald Trump knew essentially nothing about health care and he alternated between disengagement and crude bullying of wavering senators ahead of the vote. Blaming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is less convincing. McConnell is a masterful legislative strategist and it took his maneuvering to bring a bill supported by less than 30 percent of the public to within one vote of passing. Indeed, McConnell may only have come even that close because he skipped the normal committee hearing process, protecting the proposal from more public and media scrutiny. The real lesson here is that once major social programs are in place, it’s simply very hard to eliminate them. In his 1994 book “Dismantling the Welfare State?”, the political scientist Paul Pierson showed that major social welfare programs were very resilient, and conservative attempts to repeal them generally failed. This was true even in parliamentary systems with fewer choke points to stop repeal than the American system. In the United States, the clearest example is Social Security. Before becoming president, Ronald Reagan had repeatedly expressed a desire to make it a voluntary program, but he quickly abandoned any thoughts of radically restructuring the program after taking office. Instead he oversaw a bipartisan plan to protect the program’s solvency through a combination of regressive tax increases and benefit cuts. When the Republican controlled-Senate narrowly passed a one-year freeze to seniors’ annual cost-of-living adjustment freeze during Reagan’s second term, the president abandoned the unpopular proposal, letting it die in the House of Representatives. George W. Bush, after winning re-election in 2004, made Social Security privatization his signature domestic issue. Bush travelled the country, making the case for a system of voluntary private accounts to partially replace Social Security for young workers. But the idea was politically toxic, actually becoming less popular the more Bush discussed it. Congressional Democrats, who had collaborated with Republicans on major domestic legislation during Bush’s first term, came out against the proposal en masse. Republicans controlled both houses of Congress but they refused to take responsibility for highly unpopular changes to a cherished program. No Social Security privatization bill came close to a vote. Republicans have not actively pursued the goal since. Nor have Republicans had any success at attacking the Great Society’s cornerstone health policy, Medicare. Sometimes they actively go in the opposite direction. In George W. Bush’s first term, Bush worked with Republicans to pass a corporate-friendly expansion of Medicare to partially cover payments for prescription drugs. Tea Party activists consider this one of the Bush era’s major betrayals of small government conservatism. But even arch-conservatives like Rick Santorum voted for the law. The politics were irrefutable: senior citizens vote, mostly Republican, and they fill a lot of prescriptions. In 2011, now-Speaker of the House Paul Ryan proposed a plan to convert Medicare into a system in which seniors received vouchers (whose value would decrease over time) to purchase health insurance on private markets. The proposal was extremely unpopular and created a major backlash. Ryan has never officially abandoned some form of vouchers as a goal, but he has not put any Medicare restructuring on his legislative agenda since taking the Speaker’s gavel. The Ryan budget’s threat to Medicare, however, proves a reliably spooky specter for Democrats to invoke when sending fundraising emails or appealing to older swing voters. Social programs are often not fully appreciated by their beneficiaries until someone proposes getting rid of them. Facing an existential threat made the Affordable Care Act much more popular – as then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi predicted, support for it increased once people found out what was in it. The Republican proposals to replace the ACA, conversely, are staggeringly unpopular. As recently as last year, more Americans disapproved of the ACA than supported it, but its approval ratings are now over 50 percent, while the repeal bills started out unpopular and became more so. The majority support for the ACA wasn’t soft, either. Supporters of the ACA were far more motivated than its opponents during the repeal struggle, putting their time and sometimes their bodies on the line, such as when disabled people were ejected from the offices of members of Congress. This helps to explain why moderate Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska (not to mention Democratic senators representing states that Trump won in landslides such as West Virginia and Montana) were unwavering in their opposition. The weekend after the HCFA was voted down, Murkowsi was repeatedly greeted by supporters, some in tears, thanking her for her no vote, while Nevada Senator Dean Heller was rewarded for his “yes” vote by seeing his approval rating plummet to 22 percent. This doesn’t mean that supporters of the ACA should be complacent. Even when Republicans have failed to eliminate major social programs, they have been able to make them less generous in ways that caused real harm, Reagan’s Social Security adjustment included. Trump is signaling that he will damage the ACA administratively, and 19 states are still refusing the ACA’s generous Medicaid expansion. Moreover, the failure to eliminate major welfare programs is a tendency, not an iron law. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed a welfare “reform” bill that led to more than 6 million mothers with children losing welfare benefits. That was possible partly because welfare, unlike Obamacare, only benefits the poor, who are politically disempowered. Still, Republicans just came closer to passing a partial repeal of the ACA than many would have thought possible. The battle over healthcare is far from over, but the repeated failures of the GOP efforts to repeal it prove the political durability of the social safety net.

,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"(Reuters Health) - Being overweight or obese as a teenager may increase a person’s risk of developing colorectal cancer as an adult, suggests a large Israeli study. Long-term follow-up of 1.79 million Israeli men and women examined for military service as teenagers showed that overweight and obese teens were over 50 percent more likely to develop colon or rectal cancer by middle age, compared to normal-weight peers. “The findings from the study show evidence that being overweight and obese in adolescence are associated with an increased risk of subsequent colon cancer in both men and woman,” said Dr. Avni Desai, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York who wasn’t involved in the study “Obesity was also noted to have an association with an increased risk of rectal cancer in men,” she told Reuters Health by email. “Other smaller studies have shown a possible association with obesity and adolescence and future risk of colorectal cancer, but this is the largest study to show the association,” Desai said, adding that in past research the association has been stronger for men. For the study, published in the journal Cancer, Dr. Zohar Levi, a researcher at Rabin Medical Center and Tel Aviv University and his team analyzed data from millions of Israeli adolescents who underwent compulsory examinations to determine their fitness for military service from 1967 to 2010. The young men and women were between the ages of 16 and 19 at the time of the examinations, and Levi’s team used a national cancer registry to track who was diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer through December 2012. The average follow-up was 23 years and the researchers identified almost 2,967 new cases of colorectal cancer in the study group. Among men, there were 1,403 cases of colon cancer and 574 cases of rectal cancer, and among women, 764 colon cancers and 226 rectal cancers. Being overweight or obese at the initial military examination was associated with 53 percent and 54 percent higher risks of colon cancer for men and women, respectively, compared to normal-weight peers. In men, obesity was associated with a 71 percent increased risk of rectal cancer, and in women, being obese more than doubled that risk. Levi did not respond to a request for comments. This study does have some limitations, said Desai. “It is looking at a specific group, Israeli Jewish men and women, the studied group included predominantly men.  As such it is unclear if the results would be similar in the general U.S. population,” she said. Additionally, the researchers didn’t have information about adult body weights, so it is unclear whether obese or overweight teens stayed heavy or slim teens gained weight in adulthood. “The study could not assess whether risk of colorectal cancer was related to adult obesity independent of adolescent obesity,” Desai said. “Also, other risk factors that may affect risk of colorectal cancer such as family history, level of physical activity, diet, and smoking were not reported in the study. Family history is a risk factor for diagnosis of colorectal cancer, especially at a young age.” Desai noted that although the participants were followed for at least 10 years, they were still fairly young at the end of the study. “The median age of colorectal cancer diagnosis in the study was 49.4 years, which is younger than the average age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer,” she said, adding that 90 percent of colorectal cancers are diagnosed after the age of 50. The average age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer in the United States is age 72, she added. “Again, it is hard to pinpoint the exact causes of colorectal cancer in young patients, what we do know is a healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of developing cancer.  This includes regular exercise, and a healthy diet, low in fat, high in fiber, with less red meats and processed meats,” she said. SOURCE: bit.ly/2tDgJgk Cancer, online July 24, 2017. ","

,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"SANAA (Reuters) - Yemen’s cholera outbreak is so widespread that just drinking water can lead to death. Nearly 2,000 people have already succumbed to one of the worst recorded outbreaks of cholera in modern history, with over 400,000 having contracted the disease, according to the World Health Organization. Cholera, a diarrheal disease spread by ingestion of food or water tainted with human faeces, can kill within hours if untreated. It has been largely eradicated in developed countries equipped with sanitation systems and water treatment. But Yemen’s devastating civil war, pitting a Saudi-led military coalition against the armed Houthi group, and economic collapse has made it extremely difficult to deal with catastrophes such as cholera and mass hunger. With stinking green watery filth mingled with trash being a common sight in the capital Sanaa, the government is struggling to control the spread of the disease. Pumps to sanitize the water supply sit idle for lack of fuel, while maintenance agencies tasked with chlorinating aquifers go without salaries and supplies. Since Yemen’s government took control of central bank funds, it no longer pays most civil servants in Houthi-held lands. This means that most of those working in and around Sanaa have not been paid for six months, ruining the lives of hospital and sanitation workers. Meanwhile, the parched and mountainous country is in danger of running out of water, leaving its 28 million mostly impoverished citizens facing another crisis. A dearth of clean water has forced many residents to queue up and fill jerry cans from water trucks. The United Nations estimates that in Yemen a child under the age of five dies every 10 minutes from preventable causes, two million people have fled fighting near their homes and only half of hospitals have staff and supplies to function normally.

,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters) By Mark Miller CHICAGO (Reuters) - If you are hovering around retirement age today, you will be closing in on your eighties in the year 2030. With any luck, you will be healthy and mobile - but imagine for a moment that you are not. Let’s say a debilitating illness requires that you receive care in a nursing home. It is an unsettling future to imagine. But now ask yourself this - who will take care of you? The United States is headed toward a severe shortage of caregivers - paid and unpaid - in the decades ahead, according to human resources expert Paul Osterman. A professor of human resources and management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management, Osterman is the author of a new book, “Who Will Care for Us: Long-term Care and the Long-Term Workforce” (Russell Sage Foundation, 2017), which examines trends in the labor force market for caregivers. His conclusion? “It’s an absolute train wreck waiting to happen.” Our aging population will push up demand, although Osterman notes that roughly half of demand for care will come from younger, disabled people. He examines the projected rising demand for care in the coming decades, and then matches up the demand side with trends in the labor force for paid certified nursing assistants (CNAs) and home care workers, including the availability of unpaid family and friends - the most common source of care for many people. He finds that in 2030 there will be a national shortage of 151,000 paid direct care workers and 3.8 million unpaid family caregivers. By 2040, the shortfall will be much larger: 355,000 paid workers, and the family and friends shortfall will be a shocking 11 million. “These are conservative estimates,” Osterman said in an interview. “They assume no changes in immigration policies, and that family members will be willing to provide care at the same rate they do today - that’s not likely, due to smaller families and more geographic dispersion.” If family caregivers become more scarce, that can only put further pressure on demand for paid care. The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration in the United States will only worsen the situation. In 2015, 18 percent of CNAs and 27 percent of home care aides were immigrants, Osterman estimated, citing Census data. Among immigrant home aides, 24 percent each come from Central America and Asia, 23 percent come from the Caribbean and 10 percent are from Africa. But he cautions that the impact of a shrinking immigrant labor pool will be uneven, due to the huge variation in immigration patterns among the states. “New York and California have very large immigrant populations, but it would probably have very little impact in a state like Ohio,” he said. The highest percentages of home care aides who are immigrants are found in New York (64 percent), New Jersey (47 percent) California (46 percent), Florida (38 percent) and Texas (22 percent). By contrast, just 8 percent of the home care aide workforce in Ohio are immigrants; in Georgia, the figure is 12 percent. Osterman also does not believe a crackdown on undocumented workers would affect the caregiving labor market much. Young men make up a very large part of the undocumented population and nationally, nearly 90 percent of direct care workers are female. “Undocumented workers as a group are unlikely to be a dominant source of labor for these jobs,” he said. Caregivers earn very low wages - median income for CNAs in 2015 was $20,000, and home care aides earned a median of $15,000, according to Census data. Normally, a labor shortage would resolve itself by putting upward pressure on wages - which would bring more workers into the field. But in this case, the impact on wages - and the caregiving shortage - will be uneven, Osterman said. Two-thirds of long-term care in the United States is funded by the federal Medicaid program, with the remainder paid through private commercial insurance or out of pocket. Medicaid payment policies vary widely among the states, but Osterman worries that in many states, care facilities funded by cash-strapped Medicaid programs will not be able to boost wages. “It’s difficult for wages to rise because they are set bureaucratically according to Medicaid reimbursement rates,” he said. Meanwhile, wages in the high-end private payer market will rise, with a corresponding impact on the cost of care and insurance. Osterman’s book is not completely doom and gloom. He holds out hope that we can attract more workers to caregiving by making the occupation more attractive. One needed change, he said, is attitudinal. Many key actors in the profession - doctors, hospitals, regulators, legislators and insurance companies - simply do not demonstrate respect for direct care workers, which is an obstacle to improving the job. The second challenge, he writes, is the complexity of our care delivery system and its financing mechanisms, both of which make reforms difficult to implement. Osterman also argues for restructuring the roles of caregivers. Currently, new caregiving workers receive only about two weeks of job training; expanding that could open the door to broader responsibilities. “In some states, a caregiver can’t administer eye drops, or help with wound care,” he said. He thinks caregiving workers could be trained to help with responsibilities like physical therapy, or coaching people with diabetes on eating and exercise. That could attract more workers, he thinks, and save money in the healthcare system by shifting tasks away from higher-paid workers such as nurses. “The point of my book is not to be nice,” he said. “It’s really a financial case for doing this, and an argument for an important social policy.” ","

,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"Investors have been wondering about Siemens’ plans for Healthineers, valued at up to 40 billion euros ($47 billion), since Chief Executive Joe Kaeser announced last November he planned some kind of listing but gave no details. The delay, along with quarterly results that were dragged down by the group's energy-related businesses, sent Siemens shares down more than 3 percent to the bottom of the blue-chip DAX .GDAXI and an eight-month low on Thursday. Kaeser pronounced himself partially satisfied with the quarter, which was however overshadowed by a controversy about Siemens gas turbines that were transported from Russia to Crimea, the subject of energy-technology sanctions. “Everything is not perfect at Siemens,” Kaeser, who extended his contract until 2021, told reporters on a conference call. “The Crimea affair has cost us much time and effort. We have to ask ourselves what this means for our future business processes and relationships.” Siemens said last month it had credible evidence that all four gas turbines it delivered a year ago for a project in southern Russia had been illegally moved to Crimea, confirming a series of Reuters reports.. A review of Siemens business practices in Russia could cost 100-200 million euros in sales, Kaeser said. The Power and Gas business faced challenges from a global trend away from the large turbines in which Siemens specializes. It reported a 41 percent drop in orders and a worse-than-expected 23 percent fall in profit. Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas said competition in that business remained intense. “We have a tough year before us and also a very difficult 2018. Structural changes will be unavoidable,” he told reporters on a conference call. “Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy was responsible for 90 percent of the consensus miss regarding orders,” Baader wrote in a note, keeping its “buy” rating. “Furthermore, the order decline in Power and Gas was more pronounced than expected.” Thomas said Power and Gas was unlikely to hit its profit margin target range in the year to the end of September. Siemens’ overall industrial profit margin fell to 10.4 percent from 10.8 percent due to acquisition-related effects. The company wants to get closer to the profitability of rivals, as Kaeser moves the trains-to-turbines group gradually away from its conglomerate structure. Kaeser, a former Siemens finance chief who seized power in a boardroom coup in 2013, is popular with investors for eliminating the nasty surprises that used to plague the group and slimming down its portfolio. Alongside Healthineers, Siemens’ profits were supported by automation software unit Digital Factory and transportation unit Mobility, which beat expectations. Siemens’ overall profit from its industrial businesses was 2.25 billion euros, below a Reuters poll average of 2.41 billion. Orders fell 9 percent and sales rose 3 percent. The company confirmed its full-year forecasts, which include moderate sales growth, a book-to-bill ratio above 1 and an industrial profit margin of 11-12 percent. Siemens wants Healthineers to have its own currency for acquisitions and investments as the global healthcare market shifts focus from Siemens’ core business of imaging to molecular diagnosis and patient self-management. But Michael Sen, the board member with responsibility for Healthineers, said there was no list of M&A targets as such. “The equity story begins with a highly attractive portfolio, which we already have,” he told reporters. Sen highlighted the attractions of a listing in the United States rather than Germany. Siemens has so far left it open where it will list Healthineers. “Most peer group companies... are listed in the USA,” he told reporters. “One has to ask where will one get the best research and coverage... and sufficient market making capacity and liquidity.” ","

,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"KUALA LUMPUR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The United Nations urged Thailand on Tuesday to drop criminal cases against female activists who campaign for the rights of their communities, amid concerns they face increasing harassment. The call came after the wife of a prominent Thai land rights activist was jailed last week and a separate group of female activists who protested against a gold mining operation were indicted for breaching public assembly laws. The U.N. Human Rights Office for Southeast Asia expressed concern over the two cases and said the female activists must be allow to campaign “without fear or threat of lawsuits, harassment, violence or intimidation”. “The crucial work of women human rights defenders in Thailand should be enabled and protected, not prevented,” its acting deputy representative Katia Chirizzi said in a statement. Supap Kamlae, wife of missing rights campaigner Den Kamlae, was sentenced to six months in prison last Thursday for forest encroachment in a land dispute involving her community in northeast Thailand, the United Nations said. Before his disappearance in April 2016, Den had been fighting for his community to be awarded legal title to land they occupy in a wildlife sanctuary. Authorities have denied any knowledge of his whereabouts. In another case, seven women activists in the northeastern province of Loei face up to five and a half years in jail after they were indicted on July 25 for violating public assembly and criminal laws, according to the statement. The women had led local residents in opposing a gold mining operation which they fear might jeopardize their health and the environment. Thailand has a history of land rights activists disappearing or being killed. Rural women at the forefront of rights issues related to land, environment and natural resources have been at increasing risk of violence, threats and harassment since Thailand’s military seized power in a 2014 coup, according to a study last month by several rights groups.

 ,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. aviation authorities were ordered back to the drawing board on Friday to solve what a federal appeals judge called “The Case of the Incredible Shrinking Airline Seat.” Judge Patricia Millett told the Federal Aviation Administration to take another look at an advocacy group’s assertion that shrinking airline seats are imperiling passenger safety. The judge rejected the FAA’s argument that seat size was unimportant to getting off the plane in an emergency. “That makes no sense,” she wrote for the three-judge panel, likening the rationale to doing “a study on tooth decay that only recorded participants’ sugar consumption” but did not look at brushing and flossing. All three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed the FAA must conduct a new review of the request for regulations setting a minimum airline seat size, but Judge Judith Rogers dissented from part of the court’s rationale. Airline seats have steadily decreased in size over the last several decades. Economy-class seat pitch has decreased from an average of 35 inches (89 cm) in the 1970s to 31 inches (79 cm), and in some airplanes to 28 inches (71 cm). Average seat width has narrowed from about 18 inches (46 cm)to 16.5 inches (42 cm) over the last decade. Critics accuse the airlines of being more interested in profit than passenger health and safety. FAA spokesman Greg Martin wrote in an e-mail the agency “does consider seat pitch in testing and assessing the safe evacuation of commercial, passenger aircraft. We are studying the ruling carefully and any potential actions we may take to address the court’s findings.” An airline trade group declined to comment. Seat pitch is the distance from one seat to the same spot on the one in front or behind. The ruling was limited to the question of whether smaller seats and larger passengers could have an impact on emergency egress. It did not require the FAA to look at the impact on comfort and health. A U.S. House of Representatives bill under consideration would require the FAA to set minimum seat sizes on U.S. airlines and a minimum distance between rows to “protect the safety and health of airline passengers.” Last month American Airlines Group Inc said it would reduce leg room by one inch to 30 inches instead of two as originally planned on some seats in its Boeing 737 MAX jets. United Airlines President Scott Kirby told a congressional hearing in May the airline had yet to decide whether to cut pitch to 29 inches in some seats. Nearly all United seats have at least 31 inches of pitch. ","

Ylan Mui,08032017,CNBC,07272017,"Faced with deep divisions within the Republican party, the White House and some conservative groups are targeting red-state Democrats in hopes of winning support for a sweeping rewrite of the nation's tax code and salvaging their economic agenda. White House legislative director Marc Short told reporters Monday that he is making the case for tax reform to Democratic lawmakers in the Upper Midwest and from states with strong manufacturing industries, such as Pennsylvania. Americans For Prosperity President Tim Phillips said his group, a conservative advocacy shop funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, will pressure Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana. Its sister group, Freedom Partners, has called out West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin for previously supporting lower tax rates. The strategy is an acknowledgement that Republicans' fractious caucus has been unable to reach consensus on key issues—most notably the long-sought effort to repeal and replace Obamacare—but also the budget and raising the debt ceiling. In the House, Short said he has met with the centrist Blue Dog Democrats and the Problem Solvers Caucus, which is spearheading a bipartisan health care bill. Even in the Senate, where Republicans only need a simple majority to pass tax reform using special parliamentary rules, victory is far from guaranteed. Republicans hold a narrow control of just 52 seats, turning the backing of just one or two Democrats into a possible game-changer. ""We've learned how difficult it is to thread the needle with 52 senators,"" Short said at an tax reform event Monday sponsored by the Koch groups. Even the event's theme—""Unrig the Economy""—mirrored language that Democrats have been using as they roll out their platform for 2018. On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer outlined the party's priorities in any rewrite of the tax code in a letter to the White House and GOP leadership that was signed by all but three Democratic senators, Donnelly, Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, all of whom hail from red states and are up for re-election next year. ""Senator Heitkamp is approaching tax reform with an open mind, and she wants work across the aisle to help make reforms that will grow the economy and support working families,"" a spokesperson said. An aide to Donnelly said he supports a bipartisan process for tax reform and is ""ready to exchange ideas with others in Congress and the Trump administration."" Manchin did not return a request for comment. Democrats were united in opposing the health care bill, which not only would have left millions without insurance but was also viewed as an attack on one of President Obama's signature achievements. Tax reform does not carry the same political symbolism, however. Holding the line could test the strength of Democratic leadership. Schumer's letter listed three requirements for cooperation on tax reform: preventing a tax hike on the middle-class, passing legislation through regular order rather than special rules known as reconciliation and ensuring that tax cuts do not add to the deficit. ""We are confident that, by working together, we could modernize our tax system to increase working families' wages, improve middle-class job growth, promote domestic investment, modernize our outdated business and international tax systems and put in place sound fiscal policy that raises the revenue needed to meet the needs of our country,"" the letter states. Jim Manley, a former top aide to Sen. Harry Reid, said the bar for winning over any members of the other party is high—even for the letter's holdouts. The chaos surrounding the Trump administration has chipped away at the president's leverage, he said, making it harder for Republicans to woo red-state Democrats. ""No one's afraid of the guy anymore. No one sees the need to try to cut deals with him,"" Manley said. ""No one's afraid of getting on the wrong side of a Trump tweet storm anymore.""

Jake Novak,08032017,CNBC,07272017,"An unwritten rule in politics is: If you can't get the public to like you, help them find someone they like even less. President Donald Trump may have done just that in the health-bill wars by shining a light on health insurance companies and members of Congress. He hit those two birds with one stone in this single tweet Monday morning: tweet President Trump is referring to the massive direct and indirect subsidies the health insurance companies have enjoyed thanks to the Affordable Care Act and the employer-provided funds members of Congress and their staffs receive to buy health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges. Let's start with the health-insurance companies. The bottom line is that the industry has been enriched significantly by Obamacare. The shares of Aetna, Anthem, Centene, Cigna, Humana, and UnitedHealth have all outperformed the overall stock market, which has had a solid run, since 2010. But even before those new profits came pouring in, health insurers weren't exactly loved. Premiums were rising faster than income growth in America for years and those costs were increasingly becoming a middle class problem.  Doctors and medical staffs were becoming more and more frustrated with the way insurance companies were taking control of how patients were treated and basically how much everyone in the medical industry was paid. That frustration is still very much out there today. But during this Obamacare repeal and replacement process, the insurers have more than secured their financial position — they've assumed such a supreme level of undeserved importance in America that politicians on both sides of the partisan aisle act as if propping them up is of the greatest national importance. To be fair, health insurance can and should serve a role in providing healthy and relatively healthy people some kind of hedge against an unexpected major or emergency medical cost. But its usefulness as a middleman industry to cover costs for routine check-ups and procedures is dubious at best. In short, it's the wrong fit for customers, providers, and a road block for a natural free market price-reduction process. President Trump's decision to question special government payments to insurers will gain traction if he keeps it up. Remember, he's not bashing the doctors many Americans trust or the hospitals we rely on. He's going after an entity most of us never really see with employers most of us never meet. But even if you don't buy the idea that most Americans will get behind President Trump bashing or at least questioning the health insurers, it's much easier to see the wisdom of shining a light on and threatening any and all special perks members of Congress enjoy compared to the rest of us. Just to clarify things, President Obama's Office of Personnel Management made a controversial move in 2010 to direct members of Congress and their aides to buy insurance from a part of the District of Columbia exchange designed for small businesses. They pick from a selection of the most generous small group plans on sale in that exchange, but only pay about 25 percent of the premium themselves. The rest of the cost is covered by the House and Senate budget. It's a nice perk and really no change from the cushy health-care benefits Congress and congressional staffers enjoyed before Obamacare. By threatening that perk, President Trump has broken an unofficial agreement within the political class not to mess with professional courtesies. It's that agreement that guarantees automatic pay raises for members of Congress and other cases of special treatment. But it's a good bet a major section of the American people will join in his scrutiny of Congress, even if they don't also start to back the White House generally. And while the public may just want this debate to go away, leave Obamacare in place, and move on, there is no moving on from this issue. Because right now, insurers are demanding to know what kinds of subsidies and other government aid they'll be getting to remain in the Obamacare exchanges for 2018. And lots of members of Congress from both parties are as eager as ever to secure those subsidies and aid in all their crony capitalist glory. Now, President Trump has at least started to use a weapon that can not only reopen the Obamacare repeal process, but do so in a way that gives all members of the House and Senate a new sense of urgency. Let's see if Capitol Hill gets the message. ",Trump has a new winning message in Obamacare battle—commentary

Catherine Clifford,08032017,CNBC,07272017,"Friday night, the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk appeared in front of a cheering and adoring audience, much like a rockstar appears on stage before performing a show, to unveil the new Model 3 Tesla. The event was to celebrate the first 30 customers (all Tesla employees) getting their Model 3's. Early production has been slow, but Musk expects to be able to produce 20,000 Model 3 Teslas per month by December. Ramping up production is going to be brutal, Musk warned. ""We're going to go through at least six months of manufacturing hell,"" the Tesla CEO told a group of journalists ahead of the Model 3 event. On stage, Musk echoed the sentiment. According to the Fremont, Calif., factory workers, Tesla is already putting its employees through a lot. ""One of the most serious issues concerns our health and safety,"" says a letter a group of factory workers from Tesla's main Fremont, Calif., facility submitted to the independent board members of Tesla on Monday, just three days after the Model 3 event and amid an ongoing effort to unionize. ""Accidents happen every day. Severe incidents frequently impact morale and cause delays in production. We are losing great workers who are valuable to both our production team and to their families while they spend time on medical leave, recovering from preventable injuries."" In May, California-based worker safety organization Worksafe published an extensive report after it analyzed the log of work-related injuries and illnesses at Tesla. It found that Tesla's ""total recordable incidence rate"" was 8.8 percent (8.8 injuries per 100 workers) in 2015, the last full-year that data is available for. That's 31 percent more than the 6.7 percent total recordable incidence rate for the automobile industry as a whole, the report found, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That 8.8 percent injury rate is higher than the similar injury rates of both sawmills and slaughterhouses, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Sawmills have an injury rate of 7.3 percent and slaughterhouses have an injury rate of 5.1 to 7.3 percent, depending on the type of processing. The issue of worker safety at Tesla manufacturing facilities is not new. Tesla factory worker Jose Moran wrote a post on Medium in February detailing the conditions and proposing a union. ""We are working hard to build the world's #1 car  —  not just electric, but overall. Unfortunately, however, I often feel like I am working for a company of the future under working conditions of the past,"" Moran wrote. ""Just as CEO Elon Musk is a respected champion for green energy and innovation, I hope he can also become a champion for his employees."" The workers say they want access to information about the dangers of the jobs they are doing, and they want a voice in the conversation about how to fix the safety issues. Thank you to all our employees for your hard work making Model 3 a reality Beyond safety concerns, the group wants clear guidelines on what is required to be promoted at the company. ""Many of us have worked hard for years with the vague promise of a raise, to no end,"" the letter states. Pay at the Fremont production facility starts at $18 per hour, which is below both the national average for auto workers ($25.58), according to The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW). ""We strongly believe that a defined understanding of success and reward will have an impact on product quality,"" the letter says. Additionally, the Tesla employees say they want to be free to express themselves without fear of retribution. Musk reportedly works to build a culture where employees are encouraged to speak up, specifically for safety reasons. Yet the Tesla employees request ""neutrality and non-retaliation agreements with workers, which protect workers' ability to speak freely. Such agreements help build positive relationships between management and frontline workers."" An email to Tesla seeking a response to the factory workers' letter had not been responded to by the time this story was published. However when the Los Angeles Times wrote about the safety numbers in May, Tesla acknowledged the problems and said it had made improvements to the factory conditions. ""We may have had some challenges in the past as we were learning how to become a car company, but what matters is the future,"" a company spokesman told the Times. ""With the changes we've made, we now have the lowest injury rate in the industry by far."" Like this story?

In the second quarter, the tobacco giant’s smokeable products (cigarettes and cigars) volume declined by 2.7%, but this segment’s revenues after excise taxes grew by a little over 3%, driven by increases in the product price. This factor has also helped to boost the margins of the company, which improved by 96 basis points in the quarter. Its smokeless products segment, which contributed to roughly 10% of the revenues in the quarter also posted strong growth rates. A factor that will continue to boost the earnings in the future are the significant buybacks the company has authorized. In the second quarter alone, Altria repurchased $1.05 billion worth of shares, reducing its share count by 14.4 million. This week, the Board authorized buybacks of another $1 billion, taking the total up to $4 billion, which is set to be completed by the second quarter of FY 2018.

Jeff Daniels,08032017,CNBC,07272017,"Big Tobacco is feeling the sting not only from federal action but also from California tripling cigarette taxes in April, with some retailers indicating cigarette purchases are down as much as 50 percent. On the federal front, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday indicated it plans to slash nicotine levels in cigarettes to bring them to non-addictive levels. The FDA news is causing a sell-off in shares of tobacco companies, including Altria Group, owner of Philip Morris USA and the leading U.S. cigarette brand — Marlboro. In California, tobacco also is facing challenges due to April's steep increase in cigarette excise taxes. Several independent retailers interviewed for this story say the decline in sales was steeper than they had expected. However, some report that coupons provided by the tobacco companies are helping to cushion the blow. ""We're down 50 percent,"" said Sam Mroky, store manager at Cigarette Depot in San Diego. ""Before the price went up, a lot of people stocked up on cigarettes. I'm the cheapest one in the town now and … still business is no good."" The falloff in sales is evident in a study released this month by the state Legislative Analyst's Office. It shows revenues from the state's cigarette excise taxes plunged 64 percent in May 2017 compared with the year earlier. An informal check of more than a dozen independent retailers statewide found more than half of them were experiencing a drop of 10 percent or more in cigarette purchases. Several others, though, indicated they had seen a recovery in June or July and estimated purchases were down in single digits. California voters passed a measure in November to boost the cigarette tax by $2 a pack, up from the earlier 87-cent tax. Big tobacco companies spent more than $70 million fighting the voter measure, according to MapLight. The higher taxes are designed to discourage people from smoking by raising the price of cigarettes. California already has one of the nation's lowest adult smoking rates. ""We went down around 12 percent after the tax,"" said Andy Musayelyan, manager of Hollywood Smokes in Los Angeles. On Thursday, Altria reported second-quarter adjusted earnings per share that were short of Thomson Reuters consensus. The company said its smokeable segment's results were hurt by the cigarette excise tax increase in California. According to Altria CEO Martin Barrington, the company's flagship brand, Marlboro, has more than 50 percent share in the California market. The CEO called California ""a high-volume state,"" noting it previously accounted for about 7 percent of total U.S. cigarette industry volume but since the tax increase its volume contribution fell to 5 percent. As a result, he said total U.S. industry cigarette volumes were down around 4.5 percent in the June quarter. Altria and other big tobacco companies have been using coupons to make the California tax hike more palatable to consumers. ""The tobacco companies have been sending out a lot of coupons to our customers,"" said Dave Mesesan, store manager for Rod's Liquor in Orange, California. ""They're trying to deal with the tax increase the best they can."" A bill that would have prohibited the redemption of all coupons and promotional discounts for tobacco products failed to pass recently in the state legislature. The bill was proposed by Assemblyman Kevin McCarty (D-Sacramento). ""Tobacco coupons are nothing more than a deadly promotional trick by the tobacco industry to keep Californians smoking, leading to illness and early death for our residents, with taxpayers footing the bill,"" McCarty said in a statement. The higher cigarette prices also have attracted theft rings. Three suspects are being sought for several recent thefts of cigarettes from Walgreens stores in the L.A. area, according to the Burbank Police Department. It said there have been eight reported incidents involving the same suspects, including in Burbank, and estimated losses were running into the thousands of dollars. Similarly, there have been big thefts of cigarettes reported in recent months in other areas of the state, including Redding, Riverside and Bakersfield.

"Constance Gustke, special to CNBC.com",08032017,CNBC,07272017,"After working with people with dementia for many years as a licensed nursing home administrator, Scott Tarde was fed up with the lack of affordable care options. So as the CEO of George G. Glenner Alzheimer's Family Centers, he decided to reimagine a new kind of day care: a faux mini-town with a 1950s and 1960s look designed for people with dementia. His concept is based on reminiscence therapy. His creation is Glenner Town Square, set to open in San Diego next spring. Reminiscence therapy, developed by psychologist Ellen Langer in 1979, involves the use of past activities, events and experiences with other people, usually with the aid of music and tangible, visual prompts from earlier years, such as photographs and familiar household items. Glenner Town Square bathes the senses in sights and smells to reflect a person's younger days. Its 9,000 square feet of space, designed by renowned architect Douglas Pancake, sits in an industrial building and will include a pet store with shelter puppies, department store with clothes and a movie theater with real popcorn. Everyplace is staffed with trained caregivers. Besides being fun, the retro town, outfitted with gas-lit streetlamps, also has real uses, like triggering positive past memories, say experts, and can help people with dementia feel calmer and need fewer drugs. The goal is to offer a safe location where residents have a structured day, as well as autonomy and independence — giving them a higher quality of life. ""We're taking people back to their strongest memories,"" says Tarde, noting it is a form of time-travel therapy. ""Long-term memories are more preserved than short-term ones."" Tarde, who has 20 years of experience working in the long-term care industry, has targeted a growing demographic in America. An estimated 5.4 million people in the United States suffer from Alzheimer's disease, a number that is expected to grow as baby boomers age. Even more suffer from a form of dementia. He got the idea for the village after visiting a junior-achievement mini-city in San Diego, where young people discover how the ""real world"" works by learning how to generate wealth and effectively manage it. More from Modern Medicine:A major step forward in fighting Alzheimer'sNew technology that can help with hearing loss Tarde has ambitious national plans, too. He wants to build 100 of these day care centers throughout the United States within 20 years. ""Families need reliable options and meaningful experiences,"" he says. As the projected number of dementia patients grows, he adds, society will need new, viable solutions. Glenner Town Square fits into a new type of community called dementia villages. They're attempting to bring fresh models of care, rather than just relying on drugs to take the sharp edges off the disease. The villages also provide safety and connection, which can increase well-being. Tarde's creation may be the United States' first dementia village, though. In 2009 the first kind of residential dementia village appeared in Hogewey, Holland, outside Amsterdam. Inhabitants walk freely among the walled town's parklike grounds and live in housing units arranged by theme. There are also grocery stores, hair salons and pubs, where the staff works and keeps an eye on the 152 residents The village is about the size of 10 football fields. Bringing more residential dementia villages to the United States may be a challenge. Hogewey is mainly funded by the Dutch government. Glenner Town Square, conversely, is privately funded by real estate developers Village Holdings, who have anted up $1 million in capital so far. The cost for day visitors, though, is affordable at $95 per day, says Tarde. Still, Tarde is optimistic about the power of day programs like Glenner Town Square to transform lives. He believes that medicine alone can't effectively treat people with Alzheimer's. ""Many people can also stay home if they have the right support,"" he says. There's such a tsunami of dementia care needed, agrees Donna Surges Tatum, board of directors of the National Certification Board for Alzheimer and Aging Care. In the United States an estimated 4 million to 5 million Americans currently have dementia. It remains the most expensive disease in America — a study funded by the National Institute on Aging  estimated that in 2010 it cost up to $215 billion a year to care for dementia patients, surpassing heart disease ($102 billion) and cancer ($77 billion). In addition, 5.5 million people are currently living with Alzheimer's. By 2050 that number is projected to reach 13.8 million, according to the Alzheimer's Association. ""It's expensive to create a whole village,"" she says. ""And we have such trouble getting care to anyone needs who it these days."" Reminiscence therapy, which taps into positive back memories, works well, though, she adds. These villages also emphasize personalized care and more engagement, too. ""People are currently sometimes drugged more than necessary,"" she adds. Jason Karlawish, a co-director at Penn Memory Center at the University of Pennsylvania, agrees. He advocates for spaces that tap into well-learned memories and comfort. ""They should be safe, social and engaged,"" he says. Social isolation can even lead to dementia, according to studies, he says. ""People with dementia need to feel like they're part of the human race,"" he adds. ""And so we need new approaches that aren't just biomedical."" For people used to growing up on farms, Prairie Elder Care in Kansas has a different solution. It's developing a dementia-care residence farm in Overland Park, Kansas, set to open next year. Called Prairie Farmstead, it has chicken coops and gardens. About 16 residents will always be supervised. But they can also plant tomatoes or roam in a sensory garden with butterflies. The cost is about $7,400 per month. ""Men with dementia can be difficult to engage,"" says Mandy Shoemaker, co-owner of Prairie Elder Care. ""They end up being on lots of medications for aggressive behaviors."" The goal, she says, is giving them back control over their lives. ""Control is slowly lost over the most basic decisions,"" she adds, explaining that with more engagement, they can be more calm and connected. There are no one-size-fits-all dementia villages, though, says Mario Garrett, professor of gerontology at San Diego State University. ""Your 1950s is completely different then my 1950s,"" he says. Yet every attempt is a good one, he adds, since people with dementia tend to be ignored. Even dementia village models will evolve into something better, he says. ""People need emotional support.""

The baby-boomer generation is a massive part of the American population, made up of nearly 80 million people. This group of people is a big part of our economy, and their retirement over the next decade or so could have major implications on programs like Social Security and Medicare. With that in mind, here are some interesting statistics about baby boomers and their impact on the U.S. economy -- past, present, and future. Baby boomers are defined as people born between 1946 and 1964 in the post-World War II era. About 77 million Americans were born in this time period, making it significantly larger than the generations immediately before and after. While the millennial generation is even larger, this is still a massive group of people. Image Source: Getty Images. In Maine, 36.8% of the population is made up of baby boomers, with New Hampshire coming in a close second. Montana and Vermont also have baby-boomer concentrations of greater than 35%. On the other hand, California, Texas, Georgia, Arizona, and Utah have the lowest concentrations of baby boomers. Two-thirds of Baby Boomers think preserving Social Security and Medicare for themselves and future generations is even more important than reducing the deficit, according to a Pew Research survey. Separately, in a survey by the National Academy of Social Insurance, the majority of baby boomers of all income levels and political affiliations say they would gladly pay higher Social Security taxes to fix the program's funding issues. According to a survey from the National Endowment for Financial Education, 59% of baby boomers who are parents are financially supporting their children ages 18-39. There are several potential reasons for this, such as record-high student-debt levels and a difficult job market for recent college graduates. Perhaps related to worries about Social Security and Medicare, as well as the abundance of financial support they give to adult children, 65% of baby boomers plan to work past age 65. However, a study by Voya Financial found that 60% of retired workers had to stop working before they planned, for reasons such as layoffs and health concerns, one of the top reasons people claim Social Security at age 62. Despite the common perception of the millennial ""start-up"" culture, baby boomers are twice as likely as millennials to start a new business. Furthermore, 45% of baby boomers consider themselves to be entrepreneurs. According to a recent survey, baby boomers are projected to have 70% of all U.S. disposable income over the next five years. Not only that, but baby boomers will inherit about $15 trillion in the next 20 years. Surprisingly, AARP finds that this group is targeted by just 5%-10% of all marketing efforts. The median 401(k) balance of someone in the 55-64 age group is $177,805, according to a report from Vanguard. Using the commonly used ""4% rule"" of retirement, this translates to sustainable income of just $7,112 per year in retirement. Even when combined with Social Security income, this isn't nearly enough for most retirees to sustain their quality of life. Worse yet, 45% of baby boomers report having no retirement savings whatsoever. ","
      
    9 Baby-Boomer Statistics That Will Blow You Away -- The Motley Fool

Most Americans are eligible for Medicare benefits beginning in the month of their 65th birthday. Although it is the most widely used health insurance plan in the United States, many pre-retirees don't understand it well. With that in mind, if you're getting close to turning 65, here's some basic information about Medicare that you need to know. There are four different types of Medicare insurance, known as ""parts,"" designated with letters A through D. Here's the difference between each one: Collectively, Medicare Parts A and B are known as ""original Medicare."" These are the parts that nearly all senior citizens have. Image Source: Getty Images. If you're already collecting Social Security benefits, you will automatically be enrolled in Medicare, starting on the first day of the month in which you turn 65. If you're not collecting Social Security benefits, you'll need to apply for Medicare. You can apply for Medicare only at the Social Security Administration's website, and your initial enrollment period runs for seven months, beginning three months before the month of your 65th birthday. Having said that, it's still a good idea to sign up for Medicare Part A at 65. It's free, so there's really no reason not to. On the other hand, Medicare Part B has a monthly premium you'll have to pay, so it can be smart to wait if you aren't required to sign up during your initial enrollment period. For most retirees, Medicare Part A is free, meaning you probably won't have to pay a premium for your hospital insurance. Medicare Part B, medical insurance, is another story. The standard Medicare Part B premium is $134 per month in 2017, although beneficiaries who pay their premiums directly through their Social Security benefits pay slightly less, because of cost-of-living adjustment rules. In addition, high-income retirees pay higher premiums. This is based on the beneficiary's income from two years ago, so 2015 income was considered for 2017 Medicare Part B premiums. Single taxpayers with adjusted gross income greater than $85,000 and married couples with combined incomes over $170,000 pay Part B premiums of $187.50 to $428.60 per month, depending on their specific income level. Finally, Medicare advantage and prescription-drug plans have costs that vary widely, depending on variables such as location and scope of coverage. As I mentioned, ""original Medicare"" refers to parts A and B. Since virtually all Americans over 65 will have original Medicare, it's important to know what it covers, and what you'll still be responsible for paying. First, of all, Medicare Part A covers hospital service, including meals, drugs, and other services while hospitalized. It also covers skilled nursing facilities for a limited amount of time, nursing home care that is deemed medically necessary, hospice care, and some home health services. In addition to doctors' office visits, Medicare Part B covers outpatient surgeries, as well as necessary medical supplies, such as wheelchairs and walkers. It also pays for preventative services such as lab tests, disease screenings, and disease-preventing services, such as an annual flu shot. However, there are some medical costs that Medicare doesn't cover, such as: In addition to this list, it's important to point out that you'll have some out-of-pocket costs for covered services as well. For starters, Medicare Part A has a $1,316 deductible per benefit period for inpatient hospital stays, and a coinsurance requirement of at least $329 per day for stays longer than 60 days. Skilled nursing facility stays are only fully covered for 20 days, and you'll pay a $164.50 daily coinsurance payment for longer stays, up to 100 days, at which point Medicare stops paying. Part B has a lower $183 annual deductible, but after this is met, Medicare generally covers 80% of covered services, leaving you responsible for the other 20%. These copays, deductibles, and coinsurance requirements are collectively referred to as ""Medigaps."" To limit your unexpected healthcare costs, a Medicare Supplemental Insurance Plan, or Medigap plan, can be purchased. There are 10 different types of Medigap plans, and price and availability depend on your location. You can read the features of all 10 plans at Medicare's website, but an important point is that Plan F is the most comprehensive, as well as the most popular. While it's a bit more expensive than other Medigap plans (average monthly cost of $159-$239 for a 65-year-old male), it covers virtually every copay, deductible, or coinsurance payment Medicare Parts A and B could ask you to pay. The bottom line is that by knowing the basics of Medicare, you'll know when and how to sign up, how much you'll pay for it, how much of your costs Medicare will cover, and how to protect yourself from uncertainty.

Frank DiPietro,08032017,Fool,07272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. McCormick & Company Inc. (NYSE:MKC) recently announced it will acquire the food division of British consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser Group plc in a $4.2 billion deal that is expected to close later this year. Many products familiar to U.S. shoppers will join McCormick, including Frank's RedHot hot sauce, French's ketchup, French's mustard, and Cattleman's barbecue sauce. The deal will make McCormick the largest supplier of condiments in the United States. Image source: McCormick. Health, hygiene, and home products produced the lion's share of Reckitt Benckiser's more than $12 billion in 2016 revenue. Its food division was expected to provide $581 million in 2017 sales and the business has been growing in the mid-single digits, according to McCormick's management. The way McCormick CEO Lawrence Kurzius described it, Reckitt Benckiser's food division was a ""food asset trapped inside a nonfood company. ... For us, this is going to be a core business, and we're going to treat it accordingly."" McCormick believes it can give the acquired brands a friendlier base of operations as its $4.4 billion in 2016 revenue came entirely from food products. Management feels the company's expertise in the food business can result in increased sales due to more exposure to both the industrial segment of the market (which includes customers like restaurants), where McCormick sold 40% of its products,  and internationally, where McCormick sold 42% of its products in 2016. McCormick is a leader in spices and seasoning, with about 20% market share in the packaged retail spices and seasoning category of foods on a global basis. The key brand that drove McCormick to make the acquisition is Frank's RedHot Sauce, the product with the largest growth potential in the portfolio of brands that came with the acquisition. McCormick sees Frank's RedHot Sauce as a ""liquid spice"" that's very popular with millennials and has a runway for growth. ""... the hot sauce category and the Frank's RedHot brand, in particular, really drive the growth of the whole portfolio,"" said Kurzius. Management believes it can expand Frank's brand beyond the United States and Canada by increasing its presence in the Asian marketplace, where Western condiments have become quite popular, particularly for table-top usage in restaurants, not a distribution channel that current ownership has access to. McCormick management stated that their goal is to Make Frank's RedHot sauce the No. 1 global hot sauce brand. The company is also quite keen on French's mustard, the No. 1 brand in the U.S. and Canada. The price tag was $4.2 billion, which is over seven times the food division's estimated 2017 revenue of $581 million. The chart below shows McCormick's price to sales multiple over the past three years, which barely ever reached three. MKC PS Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts The price tag of $4.2 billion will be paid all in cash. McCormick will finance the deal in two ways. The company will work with lenders to borrow $3.7 billion. The other $500 million will come in the form of an equity offering of the company's stock. The company also announced, in light of the deal, it will suspend its share buyback program to conserve cash. Management reiterated that the company plans to continue issuing its quarterly dividend. The additional debt the company will take on will increase its borrowings from $804 million at the end of last quarter to a projected $4.5 billion when the deal closes. The company said it will update shareholders once the deal closes toward the end of this year. Until then, management will continue to focus on the current brands under the McCormick umbrella. The company sees French's products being its No. 2 brand and Frank's RedHot Sauce as its No. 3 brand, both of which will help McCormick move up from its current position as the No. 10 condiments supplier in the United States to No. 1 stateside and No. 3 on a global basis. This is a big investment for the company; the largest acquisition it has ever made. It is taking on a lot of debt to make the purchase. Time will tell if management is able to integrate the business, execute its plan, and reward shareholders with a higher stock price. ","

Emma Court,08032017,MarketWatch,07272017,"Published: July 31, 2017 9:39 a.m. ET The president could withhold key payments — something he appeared to allude to in a Monday tweet By After the so-called “skinny” repeal of the Affordable Care Act failed to pass in a Senate vote early Friday morning, President Donald Trump tweeted out his thoughts on the subject. “As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!” he said. It won’t necessarily happen by itself. The Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, has been plagued by high-profile health insurer exits and rising premiums. But that doesn’t tell the whole story. Some health insurers are turning a profit on the exchanges, like Centene Corp

And the Congressional Budget Office said in March that the individual market would likely be stable in most areas under current law. There are a few ways Trump can help implosion occur. He’s most likely to do so through cost-sharing reduction payments, which pay back health insurers for the increased cost of certain plans on the ACA’s marketplaces. “If ObamaCare is hurting people, & it is, why shouldn’t it hurt the insurance companies,” Trump said in a Monday tweet in which he appeared to allude to the cost-sharing payments. See our previous coverage of this issue: What Trump can do to undermine Obamacare, now that the GOP health bill has failed Trump threatened to withhold cost-sharing payments this past spring as a negotiating tactic with Congressional Democrats. Without them, health insurers might stop offering plans, causing consumers to lose health insurance, according to The Commonwealth Fund, a health-care foundation. That “could immediately destabilize the exchanges, perhaps fatally,” said Spencer Perlman, director of health-care research at Veda Partners, an investment advisor and consultancy. Trump could withhold the payments in August, said Height Securities analyst Stefanie Miller, “before Congress will be in a position to take that authority away from Trump legislatively.” (Congress has an extended recess coming up.) The Trump administration could either end an appeal of a lawsuit over the cost-sharing payments on Aug. 20 or just decide not to make the payments, which are scheduled for Aug. 21, Perlman said. Related:  Trump aims to squeeze Democrats into health-care negotiations There are also other ways to sabotage the health care law, which is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Tom Price. Enrollment in the ACA’s exchanges is one key measure of the health law’s success. But enrollment appears highly dependent on marketing and promotion of the exchanges, making it an easy target for the administration. Read more:  ‘Skinny’ repeal of Obamacare fails to pass in late-night Senate vote For example, enrollment for 2017 exchange plans looked like it was on track to surpass previous years until, under Trump’s administration, it dropped off. “The secretary certainly can undermine the functioning of the ACA by refusing to encourage enrollment,” Veda’s Perlman said. But it’ll be difficult for Price to change exchange plan requirements, since “Price’s ability to alter the ACA’s insurance rules via the regulatory process is actually quite limited.” But it’s likely that Congress will have to tackle market stabilization next, both Perlman and Miller said, probably when members return to work in September. Bipartisan cooperation will be necessary, though, and “we do not expect Republicans and Democrats to reach a compromise quickly, meaning that uncertainty is likely to continue to plague the exchanges over the coming weeks and months,” Perlman said. That also means Medicaid and Medicaid expansion are “safe for now,” he said, though hospitals — expected to be hit hard by ACA repeal — should keep facing challenges.

                                    UCO, +1.89% The research I provided to clients in June suggested that oil prices were not appropriately reflecting the fundamentals. But oil moves with so much momentum, we need to focus on price. When WTI rose above $47 per barrel, it broke above a resistance line that opened the door for an increase to just above $50 a barrel, which was tested Monday. Oil may keep rising Notwithstanding the fundamental observations, WTI will need to increase beyond Monday’s highs in order to break resistance, and so far it is failing to do that. With the fundamental observations in tow, my research suggests that the possibility of a continued increase is very high, as the market finally starts to appreciate the influence of OPEC. Although mathematically we could calculate the difference in domestic supply given the reduced shipments from Saudi Arabia about two months ago, traders in the oil space were so bearish that they did not care. Finally, those reduced shipments are starting to impact U.S. stockpiles. Shipments take about 1.5 months to reach the U.S. from Saudi Arabia, so the impact on U.S. stockpiles is not felt until an equivalent amount of time after shipments have stopped. There now has been ample time, and the impact is being felt, and that changes the sentiment of oil traders. OPEC’s influence Although the influence of OPEC has already significantly reduced global supplies, measuring stockpiles globally is much more difficult than measuring stockpiles in the United States. As those global stockpiles declined, the United States saw increases, which led traders to believe that OPEC was not influencing the global oil market. Quite to the contrary, OPEC is doing a big job of reducing global supply, and it will continue to do so. And, finally, given what Saudi Arabia has chosen to do, the impact of OPEC will also be measurable in U.S. stockpiles. This is a material difference between what we could mathematically anticipate when Saudi Arabian shipments changed months ago, because now it is tangible. This is not expected to change anytime soon, and Saudi Arabia is not shipping oil to the United States like it did last year, or in the past. That will continue to reduce U.S. stockpiles. As far as the fundamentals are concerned, traders can now measure the reduction in stockpiles much more tangibly than they were able to before. The data now point to materially lower stockpiles because Saudi Arabia has taken aim at U.S. supply after realizing that traders were laser-focused on that specific data. Thomas H.

Buddy Carter, a Georgia Republican, offered a colorful and presumably aggressive strategy during an MSNBC interview Wednesday: Carter said it was “perfectly fair” for President Donald Trump to have called out Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, by name as standing in the way of the repeal and/or replace effort, having voted no on the motion to proceed Tuesday, causing Vice President Mike Pence to step in with a tie-breaking vote. “This is extremely frustrating.” Carter said the American Health Care Act — on which, he said, the House’s health-care subcommittee had spent 27½ hours working — is a good bill that “needs to pass.” Though admittedly an exurban dictionary might be more handy in the matter, the Urban Dictionary defined the phrase “snatch a knot” thusly: ",How Congressman Buddy Carter got the whole country looking up the phrase ‘snatch a knot’ - MarketWatch

                                   following of millions, but many shame their employees in other ways, including trash-talking the employee to their peers, telling an employee not to attend certain meetings any more, or moving them to a remote office, said Kenneth Siegel, the president of The Impact Group, a management consultancy based in Los Angeles. “All of those are versions of public shaming, under the guise of transparent feedback,” Siegel said. Some 27% of bosses have a current direct report they would like to see leave their company, according to a survey of about 2,000 employees from the jobs site CareerBuilder in 2013. Less than half, 42%, said they have given those employees a formal warning that their job is in danger. And the rest? Some 27% say they pointed out the employee’s’ shortcomings, 21% said they reduced the employee’s responsibilities and 12% said they hired someone else to replace the employee. If you fear you’re being edged out like Sessions, here are 5 things to do next: Figure out if your fears are legitimate A boss may show their dissatisfaction in passive-aggressive ways, including through negative facial expressions or not providing the resources employees need to do their jobs. If you experience those, it’s usually a good idea to set up a one-on-one meeting to find out the truth, said Marc Cenedella, the founder and CEO of Ladders, a career site. It’s the employee’s job to set up that meeting, he said. In fact, they should be asking for meetings like those regularly even before they’re worried about losing their job so they know where they stand. Before the meeting, take a moment to reflect on what information you need from your boss, Cenedella said. Try not to let your feelings about the situation overwhelm you. Don’t make accusations — ask questions “It’s totally OK to have emotions, but you need to think through what you want to do,” he said. Instead, clarify the situation with your boss. Don’t accuse your boss of bad behavior, he said, but ask, “What should I understand from your feedback?” Using “I” statements such as “I have noticed you have not responded to me as frequently” or “I feel I am being left out of meetings” can help, Siegel said. Ask the boss for three specific things to improve and whether or not, in their estimation, you have the ability to improve, Cenedella said. And, then, ask what “success” would look like if you’re able to complete them. Ask your boss if your job can be saved It’s difficult to do, but an employee should actually ask whether the boss sees a path to recovering the job, Siegel said. He suggested saying something along the lines of, “If I were to spend the time and energy to enhance my skill set, or learn this software program, or become a better designer, would that matter?” If the boss says it is possible, keep a written record of your goals and check in periodically to review them, Cenedella said. Start cutting back on your spending If you want to stay in your job, but you’re afraid of being fired, start preparing financially, Siegel said. Personal finance experts typically recommend having three to six months’ worth of expenses saved for such a situation, but many Americans don’t have enough money in the bank to weather a job loss. “Maybe you put off buying that high-end car, or piece of art, or don’t go on that family vacation if you’ve gotten some forewarning you’re likely to be unemployed,” Siegel said. Plan an exit strategy (just in case) This is also the right time to reconnect with people in your professional network who work outside your company, Cenedella said. Even for people who are not desperately seeking a new job, make a list of 10 ideal companies to work for. Then, they should make it a goal to reach out to at least one person who works at each company over the course of a year, for a lunch, breakfast, coffee or drinks. “Having that ‘in’ is so helpful,” he said. Of course, if you think your boss is edging you out for a discriminatory reason — such as age, race, gender or sexuality — you may want to seek legal advice, Cenedella said. Either way, Siegel said workers should approach the delicate situation of wondering if they’re being edged out with as little emotion and panic as possible, as difficult as that might seem. “All of this implies your boss has some level of decency,” he said.

And they think we should cover his tax plans and infrastructure plans. To which I reply: “What plans?” Also read: Dropping border adjustment plan limits tax-reform push Here we are, more than six months in and Trump—who conned his believers into thinking everything would be a cakewalk—has no major legislative achievement he can point to. Nothing. Trumpsters think he’s busy, busy, busy they confuse activity and bluster with actual accomplishment. Here’s the reality: This president is a lazy old man who golfs, watches TV and tweets. That’s about all. He barely lifted a finger on healthcare. No town halls, no speeches, nothing. On taxes, Trump unveiled what he called his “tax plan” back in April. It took up less than a page and had a couple of bullet points. It was really just the equivalent of a few tweets. No substance, no detail. For example, on taxes, he hasn’t said what income thresholds will be for the brackets he wants (10%, 25% and 35%); he hasn’t specified what tax breaks should be kept and what shouldn’t; he hasn’t detailed what he would do tax-wise for businesses. Various people in the administration have spoken of various things, but again—no specific, formal proposals yet. As Trump likes to say: Sad! Also read: ‘Skinny’ repeal of Obamacare fails to pass in late-night Senate vote Same thing with infrastructure. Lots of talk, few specific details. These are giant issues and with Republicans dominating Congress, Trump should have racked up a win or two by now. Instead he appears focused on nonsense: immature rants on Twitter, wondering why the media hasn’t recognized his towering genius, hinting that his hand-picked Attorney General Jeff Sessions isn’t up the job, and making such a fool of himself at a Boy Scout jamboree that Scout officials actually issued an apology to parents. And that’s just this week. Speaking of Sessions, for those of you who are all in on Trump, who automatically believe everything he says, square this circle for me: He claims he fired FBI Director James Comey because Comey was mean to Hillary Clinton. But now he’s mad at Sessions for being too nice to Clinton, for not launching yet another investigation of her. Huh? Trump, of course, is also furious that Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe. Translation: Sessions, the top law enforcement officer in the United States, is loyal to the Constitution, not the president—and this bugs Trump. Sessions is “weak,” Trump has said—about the worst thing you can be in Trumpworld—short of having bad hair, being badly dressed or fat (the junk food-scarfing, non-exercising president excluded, of course). That the president is picking fights with his own Attorney General—for doing his job—is mind blowing. Trump thinks that ethics, the rule of law, the Constitution itself—that stuff’s for suckers. Funny thing is I seem to recall that back on Jan. 20, Trump put his hand on a bible and swore to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution himself. Perhaps I was mistaken. So much has happened since then, it’s hard to remember. The president also said this week that he might wind up on Mount Rushmore with Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. That’s how great he thinks he is. Does he know why those four truly great presidents were selected for Rushmore? Sculptor Gutzon Borglum picked Washington because he was the father of our country and laid the foundation for American democracy; Trump has chiseled away at it with his attacks on our independent judiciary and free press. Jefferson was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence; he wrote that “all men are created equal.” But Trump, to borrow from George Orwell, believes that some are more equal than others. Lincoln preserved the Union and abolished slavery; Trump has quietly rolled back enforcement of civil rights laws. Theodore Roosevelt was chosen for several things, including his focus on conservation and preserving America’s natural beauty; Trump installed a guy at the Environmental Protection Agency who has proceeded to weaken regulations that keep the air you breathe and water you drink safe. Trump says he’s doing great. Why, just a month ago he bragged that his favorite poll Rasmussen, had his approval rating at 50%. He has always said that Rasmussen is the best poll, the fairest poll, the most accurate poll. OK: that same poll now has his approval at 41%. In fact, since Inauguration day, it has been sliding steadily. January 20: 56%. April 20: 49%. Today: 41%. Again that’s the one poll Trump says is the best, fairest, most accurate. Even his buddies at Fox News have his approval at 41%. Fox and Rasmussen. What do you say, Trumpeters? So much winning! The problem for Trump is that presidents, usually, are never more popular than in the first year. You’ve got to get the big stuff done quickly before that power ebbs. Trump’s time—and political capital—is quickly running out. Mount Rushmore may have to wait. ",Trump’s time—and political capital—is quickly running out - MarketWatch
Elliot Blair Smith,08032017,MarketWatch,07272017,"Published: Aug 2, 2017 11:39 a.m. ET By Once the Grenfell Tower landlord in London agreed to substitute cheaper construction materials to renovate the 120-apartment building, a death trap was set waiting to be sprung. In June, an uncontrollable inferno at the 24-story public housing complex took at least 80 lives. Two parallel investigations are now under way: a criminal probe by the Metropolitan Police, and a broader public inquiry by a retired judge. The true purpose of building-safety standards is not to inflate costs—not to impose barriers to getting work done, nor to keep people from being compensated fairly—but rather to protect people. The Grenfell Tower tragedy exposed woefully inadequate building and fire-safety codes in Britain, and much wider haste to cut corners. And that lesson is lost in most arguments about rolling back regulations broadly, in the United States and elsewhere. “The disaster at Grenfell Tower should never have happened,” said Sajid Javid, Britain’s secretary of state for communities and local government, before Parliament. “It is already clear to us all that there will need to be changes.” For years, residents of Grenfell Tower contended with cold, drafty winters, and stiflingly hot summers. Renovation to dress up the aging concrete building—including a new aluminum skin, and windows—would better insulate it from rain, cold, and the beating sun. So about $13.5 million was targeted to improve the “poor condition” of the apartment complex between 2014 and 2016, according to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the neighborhood authority in one of London’s wealthiest districts. The work was loud, and tensions emerged among tenants who’d complained first about substandard conditions, and then about allegedly being kept uninformed. But authorities conducted a “door knocking” poll in December 2015—close to project completion—and found most occupants happy with the improvements to the heating, hot water, and new windows. While there’s a shambling charm to a tenant-landlord relationship that resolves complaints with a “door knocking,” it reflects a civic casualness that contributed to the uncontained blaze that turned the tower into a flaming skewer. Police now believe “there are reasonable grounds to suspect” that the borough and the tenant management organization “may have committed the offense of corporate manslaughter,” the BBC and others reported last week. Three years earlier, plans for fire-resistant exterior cladding were quietly replaced with a less expensive product; and the fire-retardant core proposed for each two-sheet aluminum panel was swapped out with a cheaper combustible alternative, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars, the Guardian newspaper reported. Final project costs came down by $2.1 million. In the balance, one might calculate the value of human life. Celia Caliskan, an assistant to the Kensington and Chelsea neighborhood authority’s housing director, referred my query to the borough’s press office, which didn’t respond. British authorities have now tested at least 181 aluminum-veneer high-rises. “So far, all the samples of cladding tested have failed—that is 181 out of 181,” Javid told Parliament, with about 400 more buildings to be tested. Yet British authorities, builders, and citizens can’t seem to agree—and probably don’t know—whether the Grenfell Tower renovation met national fire-safety standards. Even if each building product individually met code requirements, it’s not clear they did so in combination. What seems certain is the cladding was more combustible than anyone admitted, and became a chimney spreading flames, heat, and fumes faster than firefighters could chase them. Michele Gianeselli, senior fire engineer at Chemolli Fire, an Italian fire-safety consultant licensed to do business in the United Kingdom, told me that aluminum cladding with a plastic core—sometimes called sandwich board—combined with plastic-foam insulation between the building and veneer, is “very cheap” and “easy to use” but will “increase the fire risk.” Even a British cladding trade group that previously argued against imposing supposedly cost-prohibitive fire-safety standards now offers stricter guidance.

                                    supplied the Grenfell Tower veneer through a sub-contractor on the project, and announced after the fire that it no longer will sell the product for any other high-rise construction. The company was formerly known as Alcoa, which it spun off last year as a separate company. The Centre for Window and Cladding Technology updated its recommendations earlier this year—prior to the blaze, it told me—stating that the approved fire-safety classification for aluminum cladding as used at Grenfell Tower “is no longer appropriate for such materials.” This policy shift by an industry group that Alcoa long was a member of seems to challenge the appropriateness of the product all along. The trade group’s new position also puts it at odds with the ongoing certification of Arconic’s Reynobond PE product by the British Board of Agrément—a nonprofit testing, inspection, and ecertification service—which describes itself as the “Gold Standard of product or system approvals.” The BBA maintains its certification of Reynobond PE unconditionally, even after the company itself limited the product’s future sale. “We have been attempting to contact the certificate holder to clarify certain facts and we will review our position in light of that information,” the BBA said in a statement. I found other high-rise structures outfitted with Reynobond PE, including a popular oceanfront hotel in the Middle East. I asked hotel management, the builder, and architect if they planned any structural modifications for the benefit of hotel guests and employees. None responded. Arconic’s Reynobond PE veneer formed only the most visible layer of Grenfell Tower’s beautifying mask. Under it, were foam plastic panels produced by French manufacturer Saint-Gobain

                                   , also produced insulation that found its way into the project, though the company issued a statement expressing doubt that cladding with a polyethylene core and plastic insulation “would ever pass” appropriate fire-performance tests. By the time Arconic restricted sales of Reynobond PE 12 days after the fire, company shares had fallen 13%, and bottomed the next day—down 21%—before rebounding. Arconic offered “deepest condolences” and “full support to the authorities as they conduct their investigations,” along with blame-mitigating expressions common among other contractors and suppliers: it was “not involved in the installation” at Grenfell Tower, “other parts of the cladding system, including the insulation, were supplied by other parties” and “we sold our products with the expectation that they would be used in compliance with … local building codes and regulations” and “we don’t control the overall system or its compliance.” And yet Arconic marketing materials state: “When we designed Reynobond panels, we made sure they could take the heat.” Any consumer might understand that as attesting to product safety. It appears under the header, “Safety. One of our core values.” Apparently, that isn’t what the company meant. Not all Reynobond panels can take the heat—at least not in the sense of being fire-proof. “That’s why they are also available with a fire-resistant core that meets or exceeds international building code requirements,” the marketing materials explain. Arconic cladding is associated with other questionable “fire safety” language in marketing materials published by the European Aluminium Association. The association, of which Arconic is a member, states: “Industrial roofs and external walls are increasingly being made of thin aluminium cladding panels, intended to melt during a major fire, allowing heat and smoke to escape and thereby minimizing the damage.” This publication identifies Alcoa Architectural Products, now part of Arconic, as a sponsor, and credits it with contributing some of the images in the pamphlet. The language promoting product performance in a blaze is identified as “section 2.9. FIRE SAFETY.” Given anecdotal accounts that Grenfell Tower cladding served as a flue that contributed to the rapid spread of fire, heat, and fumes, I asked Aurelie Pattyn, a spokeswoman for the European Aluminium Association in Brussels, to explain the association’s statement that cladding allows “heat and smoke to escape … thereby minimizing the damage.” Pattyn responded: “The publication you refer to is indeed not specific on fire safety and focused on many different aspects of sustainability of buildings.” Even today, Arconic recommends a non-fire-resistant form of another walling product called curtain wall, which combines glass and aluminum, to customers who don’t want added fire safety in their high-rise hospitals, hotels, and residential towers around the world. I was told curtain wall is fundamentally different than cladding, with its own guidelines for installation and use. And I was told it would be inaccurate to conclude that guidance applicable to one high-rise product (cladding) extended to any other (curtain wall). Virendra Kumar Paul, head of the department of building engineering and management in the School of Planning and Architecture in New Delhi, told me it’s “very unlikely” that fire-resistant cladding is widely installed in India, where such veneers are “used quite extensively in high rises of all sorts.” “It is safe to infer,” he added, “the use and the installation is unprofessional, and safety not the consideration.” John Cowley, the managing director of a British building-products firm called CEP Architectural Facades, which custom-cut the aluminum panels for Grenfell Tower, says fires in 2010 and 2012 at two other aluminum-clad buildings with mineral-fiber rather than plastic insulation didn’t spread. Yet someone decided non-fire-resistant aluminum cladding—with a combustible plastic core and plastic-foam insulation—was good enough at Grenfell Tower. “Where are the arrests?” asks the British writer Andrew Chapman, who has written about the tragedy from an engineering standpoint. “The regulations were breached, there are several clear culprits, many died. …. It’s not that complicated, surely?” Meaningful standards and oversight should have been as important for the construction workers, building-products manufacturers, landlords, safety inspectors, police, and fire at Grenfell Tower as for the deceased victims.

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"But the results come amid uncertainty in the U.S. healthcare industry with Republican lawmakers seeking to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. Republican President Donald Trump has threatened to cut off about $8 billion in subsidies that help control costs for low-income Americans under the ACA, popularly known as Obamacare. Tampa, Florida-based WellCare, which focuses on government-backed Medicare and Medicaid plans, said Medicaid memberships increased 16.6 percent to 2.83 million as of June 30, helped mainly by higher enrolments in Missouri. Memberships surged 46 percent in WellCare’s Medicare business and by 10.3 percent in its Medicare prescription drug plans business. The amount WellCare spent on medical claims out of the premiums it earned, a key measure of costs known as medical benefits ratio (MBR), rose in the Medicaid and Medicare businesses. The lower the ratio, the better for the insurer. WellCare said its MBR deteriorated to 86.8 percent in Medicaid and to 86.4 percent in Medicare. The company has been trying to bolster its Medicare Advantage business to offset any likely hit from a possible repeal and replace of Obamacare. It bought smaller rival Universal American Corp for $600 million in April. Piper Jaffray analysts said on Friday such investments position WellCare for a lower MBR and better profit margins over the long term. WellCare’s net income fell to $74.1 million, or $1.65 per share in the second quarter, from $90.8 million, or $2.04 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, WellCare earned $2.52 per share, beating analysts’ average expectation of $2.24, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 19.8 percent to $4.31 billion. Analysts had expected $4.2 billion. The company raised its 2017 earnings forecast to $6.75 to $6.95 per share from $6.55 to $6.80 per share. WellCare’s shares have climbed about 33 percent this year. (In paragraph 13, this story corrects revenue number to $4.31 billion from $4.1 billion; the error also appeared in an earlier version of the story) ","

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Fifteen aid groups on Wednesday called on warring parties in Yemen to reopen the country’s main airport, saying a year-long closure was hindering aid and preventing thousands of patients from flying abroad for life-saving treatment. Yemen has been torn apart by a civil war in which the exiled government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, backed by a Saudi-led military coalition, is trying to push back gains made by the Iran-aligned Houthi group. The Houthis control most of the north, including the capital Sanaa and its international airport while the Saudi-led coalition controls the airspace. Any reopening would need an agreement between the two sides, which blame each other for Yemen’s humanitarian disaster. “The official closure of Sanaa airport, one year ago today, effectively traps millions of Yemeni people and serves to prevent the free movement of commercial and humanitarian goods,” the statement signed by groups including the International Rescue Committee and the Norwegian Refugee Council said. Yemen has had more than 400,000 suspected cases of cholera in the past three months in an epidemic that has killed 1,900 people, the World Health Organization said in late July. The aid groups said: “The current cholera outbreak and near-famine conditions in many parts of Yemen make the situation far worse. The importance of unhampered delivery of humanitarian aid cannot be overstated.” Yemen’s health ministry estimates that 10,000 Yemenis have died from critical health conditions for which they were seeking international medical treatment, the statement said, adding it was unable to verify the figure. It said this was roughly equivalent to the number of people that have died as a direct result of the fighting and represented the hidden victims of the conflict. Citing United Nations figures, the statement said an estimated 7,000 Yemenis had gone abroad from Sanaa each year for medical treatment before the conflict. Now the number needing life-saving healthcare was around 20,000 Yemenis over the past two years because of the violence, it said. “Yemenis awaiting critical medical treatment abroad now have to find alternative routes to leave the country, which include a 10-20 hour drive to other airports, often through areas where active fighting takes place,” the statement added.

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"With John McCain’s dramatic “no” vote, the Health Care Freedom Act (HFCA) died early last Friday morning and with it any hope of repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for the foreseeable future. While conservatives might prefer to blame incompetent vote-whipping in the Senate, the ACA could prove resilient for the same reason Medicare and Social Security have: most voters prefer not to wonder if they will be able to eat when hungry or see a doctor when sick. Any program that gives more economic security to a broad, politically powerful group will be dangerous to meddle with, even in these polarized times. Conservative activists and pundits who don’t want to contend with that reality may point to the president they were dealt: Donald Trump knew essentially nothing about health care and he alternated between disengagement and crude bullying of wavering senators ahead of the vote. Blaming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is less convincing. McConnell is a masterful legislative strategist and it took his maneuvering to bring a bill supported by less than 30 percent of the public to within one vote of passing. Indeed, McConnell may only have come even that close because he skipped the normal committee hearing process, protecting the proposal from more public and media scrutiny. The real lesson here is that once major social programs are in place, it’s simply very hard to eliminate them. In his 1994 book “Dismantling the Welfare State?”, the political scientist Paul Pierson showed that major social welfare programs were very resilient, and conservative attempts to repeal them generally failed. This was true even in parliamentary systems with fewer choke points to stop repeal than the American system. In the United States, the clearest example is Social Security. Before becoming president, Ronald Reagan had repeatedly expressed a desire to make it a voluntary program, but he quickly abandoned any thoughts of radically restructuring the program after taking office. Instead he oversaw a bipartisan plan to protect the program’s solvency through a combination of regressive tax increases and benefit cuts. When the Republican controlled-Senate narrowly passed a one-year freeze to seniors’ annual cost-of-living adjustment freeze during Reagan’s second term, the president abandoned the unpopular proposal, letting it die in the House of Representatives. George W. Bush, after winning re-election in 2004, made Social Security privatization his signature domestic issue. Bush travelled the country, making the case for a system of voluntary private accounts to partially replace Social Security for young workers. But the idea was politically toxic, actually becoming less popular the more Bush discussed it. Congressional Democrats, who had collaborated with Republicans on major domestic legislation during Bush’s first term, came out against the proposal en masse. Republicans controlled both houses of Congress but they refused to take responsibility for highly unpopular changes to a cherished program. No Social Security privatization bill came close to a vote. Republicans have not actively pursued the goal since. Nor have Republicans had any success at attacking the Great Society’s cornerstone health policy, Medicare. Sometimes they actively go in the opposite direction. In George W. Bush’s first term, Bush worked with Republicans to pass a corporate-friendly expansion of Medicare to partially cover payments for prescription drugs. Tea Party activists consider this one of the Bush era’s major betrayals of small government conservatism. But even arch-conservatives like Rick Santorum voted for the law. The politics were irrefutable: senior citizens vote, mostly Republican, and they fill a lot of prescriptions. In 2011, now-Speaker of the House Paul Ryan proposed a plan to convert Medicare into a system in which seniors received vouchers (whose value would decrease over time) to purchase health insurance on private markets. The proposal was extremely unpopular and created a major backlash. Ryan has never officially abandoned some form of vouchers as a goal, but he has not put any Medicare restructuring on his legislative agenda since taking the Speaker’s gavel. The Ryan budget’s threat to Medicare, however, proves a reliably spooky specter for Democrats to invoke when sending fundraising emails or appealing to older swing voters. Social programs are often not fully appreciated by their beneficiaries until someone proposes getting rid of them. Facing an existential threat made the Affordable Care Act much more popular – as then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi predicted, support for it increased once people found out what was in it. The Republican proposals to replace the ACA, conversely, are staggeringly unpopular. As recently as last year, more Americans disapproved of the ACA than supported it, but its approval ratings are now over 50 percent, while the repeal bills started out unpopular and became more so. The majority support for the ACA wasn’t soft, either. Supporters of the ACA were far more motivated than its opponents during the repeal struggle, putting their time and sometimes their bodies on the line, such as when disabled people were ejected from the offices of members of Congress. This helps to explain why moderate Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska (not to mention Democratic senators representing states that Trump won in landslides such as West Virginia and Montana) were unwavering in their opposition. The weekend after the HCFA was voted down, Murkowsi was repeatedly greeted by supporters, some in tears, thanking her for her no vote, while Nevada Senator Dean Heller was rewarded for his “yes” vote by seeing his approval rating plummet to 22 percent. This doesn’t mean that supporters of the ACA should be complacent. Even when Republicans have failed to eliminate major social programs, they have been able to make them less generous in ways that caused real harm, Reagan’s Social Security adjustment included. Trump is signaling that he will damage the ACA administratively, and 19 states are still refusing the ACA’s generous Medicaid expansion. Moreover, the failure to eliminate major welfare programs is a tendency, not an iron law. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed a welfare “reform” bill that led to more than 6 million mothers with children losing welfare benefits. That was possible partly because welfare, unlike Obamacare, only benefits the poor, who are politically disempowered. Still, Republicans just came closer to passing a partial repeal of the ACA than many would have thought possible. The battle over healthcare is far from over, but the repeated failures of the GOP efforts to repeal it prove the political durability of the social safety net.

The civilians were killed and 10 others wounded in Sa’ada province after attacks on a house and a private vehicle, the U.N.’s Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen Jamie McGoldrick said, citing reports from fellow aid groups. Reuters reported on Friday that three women and six children from the same family were killed in an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition on their home in the area, according to a local health official. A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition did not respond to a request for a comment. Yemen has been torn apart by a civil war in which the exiled government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, is trying to push back gains made by the Iran-aligned Houthi group which controls most of the north, including the capital Sanaa. The new incidents were an example of the “brutality” of the conflict, McGoldrick said in the statement in which he expressed deep concern. “All parties to the conflict continue to show a disregard  for the protection of civilians and the principle of distinction between civilians and combatants in the conduct of hostilities.” Saada, a stronghold of the Houthi group, has been repeatedly hit by air strikes since the coalition of Arab states joined the civil war in March 2015.

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday called on warring parties in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan and northeastern Nigeria to allow humanitarian aid access and urged countries to donate more money to avert famines threatening 20 million people. In a statement drafted by Sweden, the 15-member council expressed “deep concern that ongoing conflicts and violence have devastating humanitarian consequences and hinder an effective humanitarian response in the short, medium and long term, and are therefore a major cause of famine” in these four countries. “The Security Council calls upon all parties in Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and northeast Nigeria to urgently take steps that would enable a more effective humanitarian response,” the statement said. The United Nations appealed in February for $4.9 billion to combat what it calls the largest humanitarian crisis since the world body was formed more than 70 years ago, but U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said only 51 percent of that amount has been received. “These four contexts are very different but one thing is in common - they are all affected by conflict, they are manmade and also the humanitarian access is hampered by the ongoing conflict,” Sweden’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Carl Skau told reporters. The statement also asked U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to brief the Security Council in October on impediments to responding to the risk of famine in Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and northeastern Nigeria and make recommendations on how to overcome any obstacles. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said famine was an issue of peace and security. “The Security Council has finally acknowledged the clear link between conflict and famine,” she said in a statement. Yemen has been embroiled in conflict for several years with Iran-allied Houthi rebels fighting Yemeni government forces backed by a Saudi Arabia-led military coalition. South Sudan plunged into civil war in 2013 after President Salva Kiir sacked his deputy Riek Machar, while in northeastern Nigeria, the Islamist militant group Boko Haram is targeting military and civilians. Somalia has been at war since 1991, when clan-based warlords overthrew dictator Siad Barre and then turned on each other. Al Qaeda-affiliated militant group al Shabaab has since gained a foothold in the country during the chaos. ","

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters) By Mark Miller CHICAGO (Reuters) - If you are hovering around retirement age today, you will be closing in on your eighties in the year 2030. With any luck, you will be healthy and mobile - but imagine for a moment that you are not. Let’s say a debilitating illness requires that you receive care in a nursing home. It is an unsettling future to imagine. But now ask yourself this - who will take care of you? The United States is headed toward a severe shortage of caregivers - paid and unpaid - in the decades ahead, according to human resources expert Paul Osterman. A professor of human resources and management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management, Osterman is the author of a new book, “Who Will Care for Us: Long-term Care and the Long-Term Workforce” (Russell Sage Foundation, 2017), which examines trends in the labor force market for caregivers. His conclusion? “It’s an absolute train wreck waiting to happen.” Our aging population will push up demand, although Osterman notes that roughly half of demand for care will come from younger, disabled people. He examines the projected rising demand for care in the coming decades, and then matches up the demand side with trends in the labor force for paid certified nursing assistants (CNAs) and home care workers, including the availability of unpaid family and friends - the most common source of care for many people. He finds that in 2030 there will be a national shortage of 151,000 paid direct care workers and 3.8 million unpaid family caregivers. By 2040, the shortfall will be much larger: 355,000 paid workers, and the family and friends shortfall will be a shocking 11 million. “These are conservative estimates,” Osterman said in an interview. “They assume no changes in immigration policies, and that family members will be willing to provide care at the same rate they do today - that’s not likely, due to smaller families and more geographic dispersion.” If family caregivers become more scarce, that can only put further pressure on demand for paid care. The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration in the United States will only worsen the situation. In 2015, 18 percent of CNAs and 27 percent of home care aides were immigrants, Osterman estimated, citing Census data. Among immigrant home aides, 24 percent each come from Central America and Asia, 23 percent come from the Caribbean and 10 percent are from Africa. But he cautions that the impact of a shrinking immigrant labor pool will be uneven, due to the huge variation in immigration patterns among the states. “New York and California have very large immigrant populations, but it would probably have very little impact in a state like Ohio,” he said. The highest percentages of home care aides who are immigrants are found in New York (64 percent), New Jersey (47 percent) California (46 percent), Florida (38 percent) and Texas (22 percent). By contrast, just 8 percent of the home care aide workforce in Ohio are immigrants; in Georgia, the figure is 12 percent. Osterman also does not believe a crackdown on undocumented workers would affect the caregiving labor market much. Young men make up a very large part of the undocumented population and nationally, nearly 90 percent of direct care workers are female. “Undocumented workers as a group are unlikely to be a dominant source of labor for these jobs,” he said. Caregivers earn very low wages - median income for CNAs in 2015 was $20,000, and home care aides earned a median of $15,000, according to Census data. Normally, a labor shortage would resolve itself by putting upward pressure on wages - which would bring more workers into the field. But in this case, the impact on wages - and the caregiving shortage - will be uneven, Osterman said. Two-thirds of long-term care in the United States is funded by the federal Medicaid program, with the remainder paid through private commercial insurance or out of pocket. Medicaid payment policies vary widely among the states, but Osterman worries that in many states, care facilities funded by cash-strapped Medicaid programs will not be able to boost wages. “It’s difficult for wages to rise because they are set bureaucratically according to Medicaid reimbursement rates,” he said. Meanwhile, wages in the high-end private payer market will rise, with a corresponding impact on the cost of care and insurance. Osterman’s book is not completely doom and gloom. He holds out hope that we can attract more workers to caregiving by making the occupation more attractive. One needed change, he said, is attitudinal. Many key actors in the profession - doctors, hospitals, regulators, legislators and insurance companies - simply do not demonstrate respect for direct care workers, which is an obstacle to improving the job. The second challenge, he writes, is the complexity of our care delivery system and its financing mechanisms, both of which make reforms difficult to implement. Osterman also argues for restructuring the roles of caregivers. Currently, new caregiving workers receive only about two weeks of job training; expanding that could open the door to broader responsibilities. “In some states, a caregiver can’t administer eye drops, or help with wound care,” he said. He thinks caregiving workers could be trained to help with responsibilities like physical therapy, or coaching people with diabetes on eating and exercise. That could attract more workers, he thinks, and save money in the healthcare system by shifting tasks away from higher-paid workers such as nurses. “The point of my book is not to be nice,” he said. “It’s really a financial case for doing this, and an argument for an important social policy.” ","

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Discount supermarket chain Aldi is withdrawing all eggs from sale at its more than 4,000 stores in Germany as a precaution, it said on Friday, as a scare over the possible contamination of eggs with insecticide spreads. Traces of insecticide fipronil were found in eggs in Belgium and the Netherlands last month, which has led to the temporary shut-down of some poultry farms and to supermarkets halting the sale of eggs from the Netherlands. Fipronil is considered by the World Health Organization to be moderately toxic, with high doses leading to feelings of nausea and dizziness. Very large quantities can cause damage to the kidneys, liver and lymph glands. German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt said the likelihood of a health hazard was very unlikely, but German state authorities were working to examine all egg supplies and determine where they originated or were processed. “The situation is under control, but we cannot give the all-clear signal yet ... We are taking this very seriously,” Schmidt told the Straubinger Tagblatt/Landshuter Zeitung newspaper group. He urged consumers to check any already purchased eggs against lists of affected supplies that were available online. Investigators suspect the chemical may have gotten into eggs through a contaminated detergent against mites called Dega 16 that is used to clean barns, and criminal investigations have been launched in both Belgium and the Netherlands. The Netherlands is the world’s second-largest agricultural exporter after the United States and sells around 5 billion eggs a year to Germany. The detergent was also supplied to farms in the northern German state of Lower Saxony, from where eggs were distributed across the country, Lower Saxony’s agriculture ministry said. Dutch food safety watchdog NVWA said this week only a limited type of egg, recognizable by specific serial numbers, posed a risk. Nonetheless, around 180 poultry companies in the Netherlands have been temporarily closed, and some firms have culled their flock. A number of supermarket chains including Germany’s REWE and Penny have taken Dutch eggs off their shelves. Aldi is the first major retailer to halt all egg sales, regardless of origin. “This is merely a precaution, there is no reason to assume there are any health risks,” Aldi North and Aldi South, the two operators of Aldi stores, said in a joint statement on Friday. Aldi South’s 190 stores in Switzerland have stopped the sale of imported eggs, Aldi Suisse said in a separate statement. The Dutch organisation of food retailers CBL said on Friday all possibly contaminated eggs would be removed from the shelves of supermarkets in the Netherlands. Public prosecutors in Belgium and the Netherlands are investigating poultry service providers that are suspected of having added Dega 16 to their products, the European Commission said, without providing further details.

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"ADEN/DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemeni troops and armor have pushed al Qaeda militants out of main cities in Shabwa, residents said on Friday, regaining government control over the southern province for the first time in years. They said al Qaeda militants withdrew to the mountains without a fight as armored vehicles from the government army and a new force known as the Elite Shabwa Forces rolled into the provincial capital Ataq, and other towns and cities from Thursday morning. United Arab Emirates news agency WAM said on Thursday the advance had been backed by the United States and the UAE (United Arab Emirates) but it did not specify what support they had provided. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has taken advantage of the civil war pitting the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi against the Houthi movement to try to widen its control and influence in Yemen. In a separate incident in the parallel war, three women and six children from the same family were killed in an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition on their home in northern Yemen on Friday, a health official said. The conflicts have killed more than 10,000 people,  displaced millions and created a humanitarian crisis, including a cholera epidemic and widespread famine. The Shabwa operation marked the first time in years that government-backed forces had controlled all districts in the province, where Yemen’s biggest gas project, a $4.5 billion Total-led plant, is based. The terminal stopped operating after foreign experts were evacuated in 2015 but the government says it plans to get the facility working again. Large-scale ground operations by regional troops have been rare since 2015, when al Qaeda was driven out of the mini-state it had established in the port city of Mukalla, capital of neighboring Hadramout province. But air strikes by U.S. drones and aircraft against the militant group are frequent. The U.S. military carried out an air strike in Shabwa in June that killed Abu Khattab al-Awlaqi, one of the emirs of AQAP, along with two other militants. Operations against the militants are complicated by the civil war, in which the Saudi-led coalition is fighting Iran-backed Houthi fighters and troops loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh in a campaign to restore Hadi’s internationally recognized government, now based in the southern port city of Aden. The forces are largely stalemated. In Friday’s air strike in north Yemen, the head of the local health department, Dr Abdel-Ilah al-Azzi, said the attack on a home in Mahda district in the southwestern outskirts of Saada, killed three women and six children and wounded three people. A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition did not respond to a request for a comment. It was not clear if the house was hit by mistake, but the coalition says it does not target civilians. A relative, who declined to be identified, said the attack happened before dawn while the family slept. Pictures from the scene showed the house completely destroyed by the strike. Residents who rushed to the scene were afraid to start rescue work while aircraft hovered overhead. Saada, a Houthi stronghold , has been repeatedly hit by air strikes since the coalition of Arab states joined the civil war in March 2015. They see the war as an attempt by Iran to expand its influence in Yemen. At least 25 Yemenis were killed in June when coalition aircraft struck a market in Saada province. In March, a coalition air strike killed 22 people and wounded dozens in a market in western Yemen near the Red Sea fishing town of Khoukha. In December, the coalition acknowledged it had made “limited use” of British-made cluster bombs, but said it had stopped using them. ","

 ,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"Supported by TOKYO — Toyota said on Friday that it was taking a 5 percent stake in Mazda, another Japanese automaker, and that the companies would jointly build an assembly plant in the United States and would pool resources on new technologies. The factory’s location has not been decided, but Toyota and Mazda said they hoped the first vehicles would roll off its production lines in 2021. The plant is expected to cost $1.6 billion and to employ about 4,000 workers, they said. Akio Toyoda, chief executive of Toyota, said in January that the carmaker would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years. Although plans for that spending predated the election of President Trump, the timing of the announcement was widely seen as a response to Mr. Trump’s vows to promote American manufacturing, pushing back against countries like Japan that have large trade surpluses with the United States. Mixing appeals, rebukes and state-sponsored enticements, Mr. Trump has pushed both American and foreign-owned companies to locate factories in the United States rather than in lower-wage countries. Even before Mr. Trump was sworn in, the heating and cooling giant Carrier agreed to cut the number of jobs it planned to move to Mexico from an Indiana plant after the state added $7 million in incentives. Last week, the Taiwanese electronics supplier Foxconn joined Mr. Trump at the White House to announce its plans to locate a new plant with 3,000 positions in Wisconsin, which lured the company with a staggering $3 billion in state tax credits. The announcement by Toyota and Mazda earned a congratulatory tweet from the president early Friday. “Toyota & Mazda to build a new $1.6B plant here in the U.S.A. and create 4K new American jobs. A great investment in American manufacturing!” he wrote. Seven months earlier he had warned Toyota in a tweet that moving operations to Mexico could result in a “big border tax.” The alliance between Toyota and Mazda represents a small but significant step in the consolidation of the Japanese car industry, where a half-dozen producers compete for customers and capital. Toyota and Mazda said they planned to pursue joint development of electric vehicles and safety technology. In an era of soaring development costs and unsettling technological shifts — especially the emergence of battery-powered and self-driving cars — many smaller producers fear they lack the resources required to keep up. Even Toyota, one of the world’s largest producers of vehicles, with an output of 10 million units a year, has been accused by some critics of falling behind in research and development. “In the future, mobility won’t belong only to carmakers,” Mr. Toyoda said at a news conference announcing the Mazda stake, noting that Silicon Valley was increasingly turning its gaze to the auto industry, looking to disrupt areas including design, manufacturing and retail distribution. “Totally new players like Google and Amazon are right before our eyes,” Mr. Toyoda said. “We need to cooperate and compete with them.” Japan’s smaller carmakers have sought partnerships with larger producers before. Ford Motor long had a minority stake in Mazda, as did General Motors in Suzuki, before the American partners withdrew. Mitsubishi joined the Renault-Nissan alliance last year, after the French-Japanese group extended Mitsubishi a $2.2 billion lifeline to help it recover from a scandal over falsified fuel-economy ratings. Toyota has been extending its reach, as well. Last year, it took over its longtime minicar affiliate, Daihatsu. It has also been strengthening its links with Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru cars, in which Toyota owns a 16.5 percent stake. And it has been discussing a new partnership with Suzuki. Toyota and Mazda have been cooperating since 2010, when Toyota agreed to license its gasoline-electric hybrid-drive system to Mazda. The companies said in 2015 that they were exploring ways to expand their partnership. With the Prius and other hybrids, Toyota has dominated the market for lower-emissions vehicles for years. But as fully battery-powered cars gain favor with regulators and consumers, the company faces new challenges — both from traditional competitors and new players like Tesla. Mazda is known for making powerful and fuel-efficient internal combustion engines, but it lacks its own electric alternatives. Its sporty image and widely praised designs could appeal to Toyota: Mr. Toyoda has repeatedly spoken of his desire to give his company’s products more flair. Mazda said it planned to issue new shares to Toyota worth 50 billion yen, or about $450 million, which would give Toyota a 5.05 percent ownership stake in Mazda. In return, Toyota plans to transfer some of its shares to Mazda. The stock would be worth an equivalent amount in cash, but because Toyota is much larger than Mazda, Mazda’s stake in Toyota would work out to 0.25 percent. According to a Toyota fact sheet, the company has directly invested $23.4 billion in the United States, has 10 plants, and employs 136,000 people. Some of the states where Toyota is currently located would love to be the home of this newest expansion. “As Toyota embarks on its joint venture with Mazda, we stand ready to grow our existing partnership and strengthen Mississippi’s standing as a global leader in automotive manufacturing,” said Phil Bryant, the governor of Mississippi, where the company employs more than 2,000 workers. Michigan, where Mazda produced cars before exiting in 2012, also boasted of what it could offer. “Any manufacturer looking to locate a plant in the United States will likely be taking a good look at Michigan,” Gov. Rick Snyder said. “We are a national leader for mobility and automotive R&D, as well as providing an exceptionally skilled manufacturing workforce and an outstanding business environment.” And a spokesman for Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said: “Toyota Motor Corporation has made significant investments in Texas — just recently opening their new North American headquarters — and we are very proud of the work they are doing in the Lone Star State. We will continue to work with Toyota to ensure Texas provides the business environment they need to succeed in the marketplace.” An earlier version of this article misstated the worth of shares Mazda plans to issue to Toyota. It is about $450 million, not $450 billion. Because of an editing error, an earlier verison of this article misstated the terms of two past partnerships between Japanese and American automakers. Ford owned a minority stake in Mazda, as did General Motors in Suzuki; neither American automaker fully owned its Japanese partner.

 ,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"* Plant to produce Toyota Corollas, new Mazda SUV crossover * To develop electric vehicle technologies * Trump says plan a “great investment in American manufacturing” * Toyota to take 5 pct stake in Mazda; Mazda 0.25 pct in Toyota (Adds details from press conference, Trump comment) By Naomi Tajitsu and Sam Nussey TOKYO, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it planned to take a 5 percent share of smaller Japanese rival Mazda Motor Corp, as part of an alliance that will see the two build a $1.6 billion U.S. assembly plant and work together on electric vehicles. The plant was a surprise for investors at a time of cooling U.S. sales, but marked good news for U.S. President Donald Trump who came to office on the back of promises to bring back manufacturing and jobs for U.S. workers. He commented on Twitter that it was a “great investment in American manufacturing”. The plant, whose location is not yet public, will be able to produce 300,000 vehicles a year, with production divided between the two automakers, and employ about 4,000 people. It will start operating in 2021. Analysts said the plan was more than a political ploy. The alliance is also an attempt to catch up with rivals in the race for electric car technology, as tighter global emissions rules loom, along with the entry of new players into the market. “There will be new rivals appearing - Apple, Google - these are IT companies, we also need to compete with them, too,” Toyota President Akio Toyoda, grandson of the company’s founder, told a news conference in Tokyo. He was appointed last year to lead Toyota’s newly formed electric car division, flagging the group’s commitment to a technology it has been slow to embrace. “What’s different from the past is that there are no nautical charts for us to follow. It’s without precedent,” he said of the push into alternatives to the internal combustion engine. Other traditional automakers such as Daimler and BMW are also weighing how best to work on new, disruptive technology, from electric vehicles to autonomous driving, that require hefty investment and have turned firms like Google and Tesla into rivals. Toyota has set a goal for all of its vehicles to be zero emission by 2050. But until recently, it has said it favoured EVs for short-distance commuting, given their limited driving range and lengthy charging time. It has been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), while rivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and Tesla have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles. As part of the agreement, as well as electric car technology, Toyota and Mazda will work together to develop in-car information technologies and automated driving functions. Toyota, Japan’s biggest auto company, has been forging alliances with smaller rivals for several years, effectively engineering a loose network at the heart of the Japanese auto sector. It already owns a 16.5 percent stake in sixth-ranked Subaru Corp with which it also has a development partnership. Toyota is also courting compact car maker Suzuki Motor Corp to cooperate on R&D and parts supply, as Toyota seeks to tap its smaller rival’s expertise in emerging Asian markets. As part of Friday’s plan, Toyota, the world’s second-largest automaker by vehicle sales last year, will take a 5 percent share of Mazda, and Mazda will take a 0.25 percent share of Toyota. Mazda said it could even expand the alliance, as long as it could stay in control of its own management. “We will study the possibility of expanding the capital alliance, but the basic premise is that autonomy is assured,” said Mazda Executive Vice President Akira Marumoto. A stake in Mazda may also prevent future incursions by tech companies, one analyst said. “For a technology company which lacks the expertise in making cars, Mazda could look like a very interesting acquisition. They’re very good, they’re not too expensive. Maybe Toyota realises this,” CLSA managing director Chris Richter said. “By buying a 5 percent stake, Toyota takes Mazda off the table rather than having it sit out there like a free agent which could someday be used against them.” Mazda, for its part, stands to gain from a deal that gives the small automaker a production foothold in the United States. At the moment, it ships all vehicles sold in the country, its biggest market, from its plants in Japan and Mexico. With an R&D budget of around 140 billion yen ($1.27 billion) this year, a fraction of Toyota’s 1 trillion yen, Mazda lacks the funds to develop electric cars on its own, a predicament shared by Subaru and Suzuki. “Mazda needs electrification technology. In the past, they’ve pooh-poohed EVs, they’ve felt they can make internal combustion engines more efficient, but the bottom line is that globally you need to have this technology,” said Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities. The automakers plan to produce Toyota Corollas and a new Mazda SUV crossover at the new plant, and the companies said they could eventually build other cars including electric vehicles. Toyota initially had been planning to produce Corollas at its new $1 billion plant being built in Mexico, prompting Trump to threaten punitive tariffs. The company has since said it will instead produce its Tacoma truck model in Mexico. ","

A bonus can be given to a company’s employees and executives, prospective employees, or shareholders. In workplace settings, a bonus is compensation given to an employee in addition to his/her normal wage. A bonus can be used as a reward for achieving specific goals set by the company, or for dedication to the company – or even to join the company. Examples of bonuses that are offered as an incentive include sign-on bonuses, referral bonuses, and retention bonuses. A sign-on bonus is a monetary offer to prospective employees who are perceived to be top talents. The bonus is meant to incentivize the potential hire to accept a company’s offer of employment over another firm’s offer. The initial payment is designed to entice the signing of an agreement that will cost the company more now for higher future benefits. Professional sport teams, for example, often offer bonuses to highly skilled players they're seeking to sign. A referral bonus is given to an employee whose recommendation of a person for an open position with the company leads to the hiring of that person. Companies offer referral bonuses to their top performers to refer people whom the employees can vouch for in terms of great work ethics, high skills, and positive attitudes. If the recommended individual ends up getting the job, the recommender will be given a bonus. Companies offer retention bonuses to key employees to encourage them to stay with the company, especially during stressful periods or during organizational changes. The financial incentive seeks to provide assurance management values their contributions with the company and would like to retain them. A bonus may also be offered to employees as a reward for some exceptional work that has been done and completed. A performance bonus is offered when a project, quarter, or year has successfully been completed; when a team or employee goes above and beyond the required job responsibilities; or when special recognition is to be given to an employee. The bonus can be given to an individual, a team, a department, or everyone in the company according to each entity’s contribution. A reward bonus may be a one-time offer or may be a periodic payment. Reward bonuses are not always cash. Sometimes they are paid out in kind in the form of stocks, gift cards, a day off, a holiday turkey, or simply just a verbal appreciation. Examples of bonuses given to an employee for a job well-done include the annual bonus scheme, spot bonus award, employee appreciation award, gain sharing bonus and milestone bonus. Some businesses have an annual bonus structure built into employees’ contracts. In the event that the firm makes a profit during its fiscal year of operation, the profit will be shared amongst the employees, with executives in the C-Suite getting a larger piece of the pie. The spot bonus award is a micro-bonus payment, typically valued at around $50, given to an employee or team that deserves special recognition. The employee appreciation bonus could also fall under the spot bonus scheme or it could be its own separate award plan given to an exceptional employee. Workers who reach a milestone with the firm, say 10 years of employment, may also be recognized with additional compensation in cash or kind. Not all bonuses are offered as an incentive or a reward. Some bonus payments made out to employees are not earned,and are given only because the individual is part of the company. Example of a just-because bonus is the holiday bonus, which ranges from payments in cash or kind to all employees to an extra month's salary in addition to the salary for 12 months already received. In general, people assume that workplace bonuses are issued to reward workers who have adequate and above-average performance levels, and whose work benefits the company and generates more profit. You'd think a manager who pays bonuses to certain individuals on a lackluster team would likely need to explain his actions both to his boss and to the team members who didn’t receive bonuses. However, recent studies indicate that close to 25% of all North American managers issue bonuses or some type of financial rewards to even the lower-performing employees. This includes those who fail to meet performance expectations. One study, conducted by Towers Watson Talent Management and Rewards Pulse Survey, also indicated that just short of 20% of these managers do not set any differences in target payouts based on employee performances. Research reveals that businesses that reward all staff, disregarding performance, generally tend to grow more slowly and in many cases end up generating less money. Lack of successful and effective management of employee performance typically causes companies to lose profits. However, the majority of businesses in the United States are still rewarding mediocre employees, and there are a number of reasons why. Performance-based bonus systems, particularly those that are extremely restrictive, cause substantial headaches, mainly in the shape of staffer complaints, lower morale and anger – taken out on management, colleagues and sometimes even on customers and clients. As a result, bonuses are often issued to even the poorest-performing workers, to avoid dealing with backlash: It's simply easier to pay bonuses to all employees. This allows management to avoid discussing inadequate performances with employees and explaining why they weren't given bonuses, or were given smaller bonuses than their better-performing co-workers. Even chief executive officers (CEOs) who have tried to implement strictly numbers-based reward-and-punishment bonus systems have found great difficulty in doing so. Then too, it is often difficult to judge the rate of performance, even when using ""objective"" measures. For example, judging an employee on his failure to meet a certain quota or deadline is not always a good indicator of how hard the employee is working or how valuable he is to the company: The worker may be struggling against unavoidable production delays or downward trends in the economy. Finally, some companies may try to use bonuses not as a reward for good work in the past year, but as an incentive for better work in the future – in effect, a bribe to boost workers' overall performances going forward. There's another reason every worker might receive, or at least be promised, a bonus. Within the past decade or so, companies have increasingly been replacing raises in salary partially or entirely with bonuses, a change affecting everyone from the senior executives to the secretaries and assistants. It's a cost-saving measure that, according to Aon Hewitt’s 2014 Salary Increase Survey, companies across the United States are now using in record numbers, much to the detriment of the employees. Employers keep wages and wage increases low by promising to fill the gap with bonuses; when bonus time comes, though – traditionally, at the end of the year – there’s no obligation to actually pay out. Because employers pay bonuses on a discretionary basis, they’re able to keep their fixed costs low by shifting heavily to a bonus system. Such variable pay can be adjusted to suit the economic health of the company and, in slow years, can be written off entirely. Compare this to a company that increases salaries every year and then tries to cut wages during a recession. It rarely happens. The increased control over wages has additional benefits aside from its flexibility. For starters, wage increases, once implemented, grow exponentially as each year’s increase is based off of the previous year’s salary. What’s more, Social Security, payroll taxes and pension contributions are all based on salary: Save on salary costs, save on benefit costs. It’s a win-win for any organization. Another unnerving statistic is the amount in bonuses that are actually given out, specifically to top-performing employees. According to recent studies, American companies have just over 85% of the money they previously earmarked to be available for bonuses for their employees. Since 2005, U.S. companies have only had 100% of bonus funds available to reward employees twice – in 2006 and in 2010. In addition to employees, shareholders may also receive a bonus as a return on their investment with the company. One type of shareholder bonus is dividends, which are paid to shareholders from funds created out of profits realized by the company. The board of directors has to approve dividend payments, and can also decide to stop the payments at its discretion. A company can also issue bonus shares to shareholders, thereby increasing the total number of shares issued and owned. A bonus issue is usually based on the number of shares already owned by the shareholder, and is very similar to a stock split, except that no splits occur with bonus shares and the figures in the Shareholders' Equity section of the balance sheet changes. Bonus plans are not limited to office employees and shareholders. Other stakeholders in the company’s supply chain may receive additional compensation, such as sign-on bonuses, from a company in order to close a deal or obtain a contract. ",Bonus

Bertha Coombs,08102017,CNBC,08032017,"It's easy to think the nation's entire health insurance market is paralyzed by the nasty debate over Obamacare in Washington. But, while Congress battled over health reform this spring, the nation's largest health insurers racked up strong profits in the second quarter thanks partly to less exposure to the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.  Combined, the nation's top six health insurers reported $6 billion in adjusted profits for the second quarter. That's up more about 29 percent from the same quarter a year ago — far outpacing the overall S&P 500 health care sector's growth of 8.5 percent for the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data.  ""A lot of the companies have downsized their exposure to the public exchanges,"" said health care equity analyst A.J. Rice, a managing director at UBS. ""The core business, which is providing coverage to large and mid-sized employers... and the established government programs, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care, have all done well."" Aetna, Humana and Cigna all saw adjusted earnings rise more than 45 percent from the year ago quarter, despite the fact that they continue to experience losses on Obamacare individual plans. Centene and UnitedHealth Group's adjusted profits were up roughly 25 percent from a year ago; Anthem was the laggard, with its earnings up just 2 percent.  The strong earnings are driving share gains, with all six of the top insurers' stocks hitting all-time highs this summer. The S&P 500 Managed Care sector is up 25 percent year to date.  What's driving insurer profits? One major tailwind has been their ability to control medical costs. Most see costs rising in the mid-single digit range again this year. Cigna, the nation's fifth largest health insurer, said that much of that is being driven by the changes in plan design in the large employer market, which covers nearly 180 million Americans.  ""They're seeing the benefit of this lower medical cost trend for their respective portfolio based upon the actions we're driving and continuing to drive for them,"" said Cigna CEO David Cordani on the company's second-quarter conference call. Though, Cordani noted that even within the individual exchange business, medical costs growth is trending better than the company expected. Analysts say that increasing use of high deductible plans is helping rein in medical spending, in part by driving down the use of hospital emergency rooms. A number of the hospital providers reported lower volumes this quarter.  ""It's not so much that (insurers are) getting great concession from hospitals,"" explained Rice. ""Employees have much more upfront costs... and maybe they're taking a look at some utilization."" The Medicaid and Medicare markets are increasingly driving insurer topline growth, and that is where the plans are setting their sights on expansion. Aetna now derives more than half of its revenue from government plans, and after abandoning its merger deal with Humana, the insurer is focused on growing its Medicare Advantage market share on its own in 2018 and 2019.  ""The general trend is growing the portion of health care claims that are directly or indirectly paid by the federal government,"" said health care ratings analyst Deep Banerjee, a director at S&P Global Ratings.  Beyond the appeal of the growing number of baby boomers aging into Medicare, Banerjee says the government health programs represent mature, more predictable markets for the large insurers, than the three-year old Obamacare program.  ""If you look at Medicare Advantage, it's a public-private partnership,"" said Banerjee. ""Even with a single payer in a public-private partnership, insurance companies are very involved in managing the costs, and actually running the program for the state or the federal government.""  And as state and federal officials governments look to cut costs in programs like Medicaid, they are increasingly turning to the insurers. That's not to say that the big insurers are not worried about the Obamacare market. Centene and Anthem are the largest national insurers on the exchanges, and both are still planning to offer plans next year, as is Cigna.  With 2018 open enrollment slated to begin in less than three months, large and small insurers are sweating whether the Trump administration will continue to pay cost-reduction subsidies for low-income enrollees and whether the health insurance tax will be reinstated next year. They are also watching to see whether a proposed bipartisan short-term stabilization plan floated by Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander will gain support when Congress returns from its August recess.  Yet, even before the ACA, large insurers have had a tougher time with the individual market than regional players.  ""This is a market they've never been able to break into very well,"" explained Rice, of UBS. ""They've found it really tough to find the right model."" Centene is among the few large insurers that is starting to manage its exchanges plans profitably. Some Blue Cross insurers are also starting to see cost trends on the exchanges stabilize, after raising rates to account for the older, sicker risk pool in the last year.  The industry argues that with more permanent reinsurance funding to offset losses on the most expensive consumers, similar to the Medicare program, the individual exchanges could find their footing, and consumers could begin to see better pricing.  But, it is a work in progress,"" said Banerjee.  And for now, most large insurers are finding it pays to wait it out, when it comes to Obamacare.

Sarah O'Brien,08102017,CNBC,08032017,"Employees at big companies should be prepared to pay 5 percent more for their health care next year. New results from an industry organization's annual study shows that large employers expect the total average per-employee cost for health insurance benefits — which includes premiums and out-of-pocket costs for employees and dependents — to rise in 2018 to $14,156 from $13,482 this year. With employers covering about 70 percent of that cost, the average worker will  pay 30 percent of the tab, or about $4,200. ""I think you'll see [the 5 percent rise] in premium increases,"" said Brian Marcotte, president and CEO of the Washington, D.C.-based National Business Group on Health, which released the study this week. ""Most people will probably see minimal changes to deductibles and co-pays unless they move to a [higher-deductible] plan."" This marks the fifth consecutive year that health care costs are expected to rise by 5 percent, according to the study. That outpaces the rate of inflation, which was 2.54 percent in 2016 and 2 percent for the first half of 2017. Workers' salaries also aren't rising as quickly as health care costs. The most recent data from the Federal Reserve shows that wages are growing by 3.2 percent annually. The National Business Group of Health's annual study surveyed 148 companies, 79 percent of which have 10,000 or more employees. It shows that employers rank the cost of ""specialty pharmaceuticals"" as the top driver of cost increases, which is unchanged from last year's survey results. Basically, new treatments for specific conditions ranging from diabetes and asthma to hemophilia and immune disorders can come with hefty price tags. ""There's a rich pipeline of specialty medicines,"" Marcotte said. ""They can be thousands or tens of thousands of dollars per treatment."" Marcotte said that the cost can vary depending on where the treatment is administered (i.e., a hospital or doctor's office or even in the home). The survey shows that 44 percent of companies plan to combat pharma costs in part by better managing where patients receive those high-price medicines. Employers also increasingly have been offer high-deductible plans as a way to control costs. The study shows that by next year, 90 percent of large companies will offer this option. Under these plans — sometimes called consumer-driven health plans in industry lingo — employees can put away tax-deductible savings in a health savings account, or HSA. For 2017, contribution limits are $3,400 for individual coverage and $6,750 for family plans. An extra $1,000 is allowed for people age 55 or older. HSA balances can carry over from year to year, and withdrawals are tax-free as long as they go toward qualified medical expenses. The survey also says that without such various cost-cutting measures being implemented by employers, overall costs would increase by 6.6 percent next year instead of the anticipated 5 percent.

 ,08102017,CNBC,08032017,"Discount supermarket chain Aldi is withdrawing all eggs from sale at its more than 4,000 stores in Germany as a precaution, it said on Friday, as a scare over the possible contamination of eggs with insecticide spreads. Traces of insecticide fipronil were found in eggs in Belgium and the Netherlands last month, which has led to the temporary shut-down of some poultry farms and to supermarkets halting the sale of eggs from the Netherlands. Fipronil is considered by the World Health Organization to be moderately toxic, with high doses leading to feelings of nausea and dizziness. Very large quantities can cause damage to the kidneys, liver and lymph glands. Investigators suspect the chemical may have gotten into eggs through a contaminated detergent against mites called Dega 16 that is used to clean barns, and criminal investigations have been launched in both Belgium and the Netherlands. The Netherlands is the world's second-largest agricultural exporter after the United States and sells around 5 billion eggs a year to Germany. The detergent was also supplied to farms in the northern German state of Lower Saxony, from where eggs were distributed across the country, Lower Saxony's agriculture ministry said. Dutch food safety watchdog NVWA said this week only a limited type of egg, recognizable by specific serial numbers, posed a risk. Nonetheless, around 180 poultry companies in the Netherlands have been temporarily closed, and some firms have culled their flock. A number of supermarket chains including Germany's REWE and Penny have taken Dutch eggs off their shelves. Aldi is the first major retailer to stop the sale of eggs altogether, regardless of origin. ""This is merely a precaution, there is no reason to assume there are any health risks,"" Aldi North and Aldi South, the two operators of Aldi stores, said in a joint statement on Friday. Aldi South's 190 stores in Switzerland have stopped the sale of imported eggs, Aldi Suisse said in a separate statement. The Dutch organisation of food retailers CBL said on Friday all possibly contaminated eggs would be removed from the shelves of supermarkets in the Netherlands. Albert Heijn, the country's largest supermarket chain, said it had removed two thirds of the 38 different kind of eggs it normally sells. The company, part of Ahold Delhaize <AD.AS>, said it could not yet estimate the cost of the move. Public prosecutors in Belgium and the Netherlands are investigating poultry service providers that are suspected of having added Dega 16 to their products, the European Commission said, without providing further details. ""It is for the national public prosecutors to take these cases forward,"" it said. ",Aldi stops selling eggs in Germany over food safety scare

Rebecca Ungarino,08102017,CNBC,08032017,"While tensions with North Korea have taken a bite out of the stock market, defense stocks are benefiting. Shares of defense companies like Lockheed Martin, L3 Communications and Raytheon have surged to record highs in the wake of remarks President Donald Trump made Tuesday about meeting North Korea with ""fire and fury"" if the nation were to threaten the United States. Investors likely flocked to buy up shares of the defense names with the thought that should the U.S. actually engage militarily with North Korea, defense contractors would benefit. Baird on Thursday raised its price target for Raytheon by 25 percent, implying about 18 percent upside from current levels. ""We are raising the price target of Raytheon … reflecting the significant programs wins both domestically and internationally for missile defense and missile systems that puts Raytheon in position for favorable organic growth in 2018 and beyond,"" analyst Peter Arment wrote in a note to clients. The bump seen on Wednesday was most certainly all about North Korea-related tension, but the defense stocks themselves look strong more broadly, said Erin Gibbs, portfolio manager at S&P Global. Earnings growth for the group has been above expectations this year. ""It is still not as great as we would like; we are still only expecting about 9 percent earnings growth for aerospace and defense for this year, and 10 percent for next year, so not amazing,"" Gibbs said, adding that she would recommend Raytheon and Rockwell Collins at this juncture. ""We see some of the best value and growth with those two, particularly with some of the anti-air missile defense systems and the merger rumors. Those could be, potentially, your best bets, even if things escalate or don't escalate with North Korea,"" she said. Shares of Rockwell Collins rose last week on a report that United Technologies, another aerospace company, was considering acquiring it. On a strictly technical basis, L3 Communications appears poised to rise about 10 percent from current levels, said Rich Ross, head of technical analysis at Evercore ISI. This is due in part to a long-term base of support he sees in the performance chart, which points to further bullish activity. The longer-term weekly chart of L3 Communications, too, paints a bullish picture on a technical basis. Ross pointed out a ""consolidative multiyear trading range,"" which he sees giving way to further upside. ""I'm a buyer of the stock,"" he said on CNBC's ""Power Lunch."" ""I think it looks great in textbook pattern and form."" ""I don't think that we'll see a recovery before the end of 2018,"" according to tech investor Paul Meeks. Social stocks have gotten slammed, but one has survived the social media meltdown: Twitter. The charts could be setting up for an even bigger pop for the social network. The bears devoured the Apple trade this week, but one technician isn't sweating the sell-off. Should you buy the dip? Some say that's no longer the viable strategy it once was. Wells Fargo's Pravit Chintawongvanich says investors can't assume buying every dip will pay off. Apple shares just dipped into bear market territory. “I don’t think that we’ll see a recovery before the end of 2018,” according to tech investor Paul Meeks. Social stocks are in a slump, but one is flying above the rest: Twitter.

Dan Mangan,08102017,CNBC,08032017,"A federal jury Friday found notorious ""Pharma bro"" Martin Shkreli guilty of three counts of securities fraud — but acquitted him of five other criminal counts related to hedge funds investors and a drug company he founded. The split verdict in Shkreli's trial came at about 2:37 p.m. on the fifth day of jury deliberations, after a more-than-month-long trial in Brooklyn, New York, federal court. At that trial, prosecutors claimed Shkreli had defrauded multiple investors in his two hedge funds out of millions of dollars, only to repay them with stock and cash that he looted from a the biotech company he created, Retrophin. While the seven-woman, five-man jury clearly accepted some of the prosecution's evidence, it rejected other parts of their argument. The mixed decision perplexed many in the courtroom, including the 34-year-old Shkreli, who first drew widespread public scorn in 2015 for raising the price of a lifesaving drug by more than 5,000 percent. He looked over quizzically at one of this lawyers, Marc Agnifilo, each of the three times that Judge Kiyo Matsumoto interrupted a set of ""not guilty"" announcements she was reading off of the jury's verdict sheet with a ""guilty"" one. A juror who was quoted anonymously by the New York Times, said  ""In some of the counts at least we couldn't find that he intentionally stole from them and the reasoning was to hurt them."" Matsumoto did not set a sentencing date. That will happen after prosecutors and defense lawyers argue how much, if any, money Shkreli should be ordered to forfeit, and after defense lawyers ask her to overturn the guilty verdicts. Shkreli, who remains free on $5 million bail, faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. But he is sure to receive a far-less-severe punishment than that, given his lack of a criminal record, and other factors. ""I think we are delighted in many ways,"" said Shkreli said outside of the courthouse. ""This was a witch hunt of epic proportions and maybe they found one or two broomsticks but at the end of the day we've been acquitted of the most important charges in this case."" He almost immediately afterward used his new Twitter account, @samthemanTP, to comment on the outcome of the case, and also started a livestream on YouTube from his apartment. Tweet Shkreli's lead lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, told a group of journalists, ""I hope tomorrow's reports inform the public that Martin Shkreli went to trial and despite being Martin Shkreli he won more than he lost."" But acting United States Attorney Bridget Rohde, whose office prosecuted Shkreli, said, ""We're gratified as we stand here today at the jury's verdict."" ""Justice has been served,"" said Rohde, whose prosecution team next plans to try Shkreli's co-defendant and former business lawyer Evan Greebel this fall. Brafman said the amount of money Shkreli could be made to surrender would have been much higher if he had been found guilty of ripping off Retrophin, to repay swindled hedge-fund investors. But Shkreli was acquitted of that charge, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which Brafman referred to as ""the money count."" Brafman said that because the jury found that any loss suffered by Retrophin was either low, or non-existent, as the defense claims, the sentence recommended for Shkreli will be light. ""I think we would love to have a complete sweep but five out of eight counts, not guilty, is in our view a very good verdict especially since count seven, the main count that impacts on the loss in this case, that was the most important count in the case from our perspective,"" Brafman said. ""And for Martin to be found not guilty of that count is a very, very good result as far as we are concerned,"" Brafman said. He noted that Matsumoto will have ""enormous discretion"" in sentencing Shkreli, who has no criminal history. Brafman also said, ""I think this verdict is a reasonably good verdict under the circumstances ... we are 90 percent pleased."" The charges against Shkreli were unrelated to his decision, while CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, to raise the price of the drug Daraprim from $13.50 per pill to $750 per pill in 2015. The price increase came as he was being investigated for the case that led to his trial. Prosecutors said a mountain of testimony and evidence at that trial showed that Shkreli duped multiple investors into putting millions of dollars into two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, by falsely claiming to have an excellent record of running such funds, and by falsely stating his investment strategy had a low level of risk. After getting their money, prosecutor said, Shkreli quickly lost much of it, and also used some of it to capitalize his infant company Retrophin even as he continued sending out financial statements to investors claiming positive returns. And when investors asked for their money to be redeemed to them in cash, Shkreli brushed them off for months or more, inventing excuses and suggesting alternative ways to pay them back, according to the prosecution's case. Two of the securities fraud counts for which Shkreli was convicted related to those hedge funds. Prosecutors said that he then improperly used Retrophin stock and cash from the young firm to pay off the the funds' investors. While Shkreli was acquitted of on Retrophin-related count, he was convicted of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in connection with Retrophin.

"Tim Mullaney, special to CNBC.com",08102017,CNBC,08032017,"No matter how advanced medical technology gets, for many patients modern health care begins in a hospital emergency room and ends with an unexpectedly huge bill. On average, emergency-room bills for out-of-network care is 4.4 times higher than what Medicare allows for the same services, costing consumers more than $3 billion a year, according to a nationwide study by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Internal Medicine. Put another way, emergency medicine physician charges came to about $4 billion versus $898 million in Medicare allowable amounts. Overall, the study found that emergency departments are charging anywhere from 1.0–12.6 times ($100–$12,600) more than what Medicare pays for services. The greatest disparities were for those who lack insurance or have to go to a facility that's not in their health plan's network.  The biggest overcharges were made to poor and minority patients, and the biggest gaps between charges for Medicare and uninsured patients were at for-profit hospitals, mostly in the Southeast and Midwest, the study said. The service with the highest median markup ratio? Wound closures, at 7.0, while interpreting head CT scans had the greatest within-hospital pricing variation, with markup ratios ranging between 1.6 and 27. General internal medicine physicians had a markup rate, compared to Medicare pricing, less than half what is billed by ER physicians. For a physician review of an electrocardiogram, the median Medicare allowable rate is $16, but emergency departments charged anywhere from $18 to $317, with a median charge of $95 (or a markup ratio of 6.0), the Johns Hopkins study found. General internal medicine doctors in hospitals charged an average of $62 for the same service. For the study, researchers analyzed the Medicare billing records for 12,337 emergency medicine physicians practicing in almost 300 hospitals in all 50 states in 2013 to determine how much emergency departments billed for services compared to the Medicare allowable amount (the sum of what Medicare pays, the deductible and coinsurance that patients pay, and the amount any third party such as the patient pays). More from Modern Medicine:The data that's fueling Joe Biden's cancer moonshot Google's role in an emerging war against killer mosquitoes Crisis in America: The organ transplant shortage ER care may be the one place in the health system where consumers ask the fewest questions and get exploited on price the most, says Martin Makary, a Hopkins surgeon and professor of public health policy who was the lead investigator for the study. ""This is consistent with outlier stories we've always heard about seeking care out of network,'' Makary said. ""Generally, these patients feeling like they're being treated as if they did something wrong. We can't expect people to live within a local network bubble and never leave."" The Johns Hopkins' data tracks a troubling pattern when it comes to ER billing. Health policy journal Health Affairs found in a 2016 study that 1 in 5 inpatient emergency-room cases result in surprise bills. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey last year found that among insured, non-elderly adults struggling to pay medical bills, charges from out-of-network providers were a contributing factor one-third of the time. And 7 in 10 individuals with unaffordable out-of-network medical bills did found that the provider wasn't in their plan's network when they received care. The surprise bills are not going away. One reason: An investigation last month by the New York Times, including work done by Yale University researchers, found that some hospitals are outsourcing emergency-room services to out-of-network doctors groups and for-profit companies that aggressively hike prices. ""This is a huge problem,"" said Jenifer Bosco, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center in Boston. ""Consumers are being overcharged, sometimes exorbitantly."" The real questions for consumers are: What can they do to prevent overcharges? How can they fight back? What rights do they have that they may not know about? The advice is slightly different for insured and uninsured patients, Bosco said. Families with incomes low enough to qualify for the Medicaid expansion or for Obamacare subsidies have rights that don't always apply to wealthier patients. Here are some key steps to protect yourself. 1. Get to a nonprofit hospital, if at all possible. Depending on the emergency, this may not be practical, experts concede. But a provision of the Affordable Care Act, which wasn't yet in force in 2013, requires nonprofit hospitals to have written financial assistance policies and to limit charges for those who qualify for financial assistance to no more than the rates generally paid by other insurers, usually the Medicare rate, said Marie Watteau, a spokeswoman for the American Hospital Association. ""Hospital payments will vary because they reflect each individual hospital and the unique care needs of the patient population it serves,"" Watteau said in a statement. ""One community may have sicker patients with more chronic illness, while another may care for more uninsured patients. Drawing information that is meaningful from a uniform set of charges is challenging because hospital care is individually tailored to each patient's needs."" For single Americans making $48,284 or less, or families with incomes below $92,000, this provision can limit the amount emergency rooms can charge, making a painful accident or illness hurt your wallet less. But for-profit hospitals aren't covered by the provision, Bosco said. 2. Ask for financial counseling at the ER. Hospitals routinely have this service available, and it can be the key to learning your rights. On top of the Obamacare provision covering nonprofit hospitals, Medicaid-eligible patients are able to apply for coverage up to 10 days retroactively, Bosco said. That can cover nearly all of the unexpected bills for patients who make less than Medicaid cutoffs, about $33,900 for a family of four. (The cap varies by state.) In addition, a counselor can explain that the ACA requires that Obamacare plans cover out-of-network ER care without co-pays over and above what in-network ERs charge — it's one of the essential health benefits the law requires subsidy-eligible plans to have. Most employer-provided plans have a similar provision. 3. After you get the bill, go back to the hospital or doctor and negotiate. It's well known that providers give insurers, both private and public, big breaks on quoted rates. Uninsured or out-of-network patients initially get billed at so-called chargemaster rates. But Makary and Bosco agree that hospitals will rarely dig in to get the full price when challenged. If they do, they risk getting nothing for their services, so they are likely to cut the price and negotiate a payment plan. In addition, hospitals are getting better about prominently posting their financial-assistance policies in ERs, Bosco said. ""It's not a great solution,"" Bosco said. ""But patients with a low income can ask for the Medicare or Medicaid rate.''

Meg Tirrell,08102017,CNBC,08032017,"It's been less than a year since Jonathan Silverstein, a venture capitalist at health-care fund OrbiMed, received the diagnosis that changed everything. Parkinson's disease at age 49. A potentially more aggressive, inherited form, driven by a mutation in a gene called GBA. It affects up to 10 percent of Americans with Parkinson's, and — as for other forms of the neurodegenerative disease — there is no cure, or even treatments that slow its course. In recent months, Silverstein and his wife, Natalie, set up the Silverstein Foundation, raised $6 million from donors and gave $10 million of their own money to fund half a dozen promising projects and start a new company. ""I'm a venture capitalist, and what a venture capitalist is, is a problem-solver,"" Silverstein said from OrbiMed's New York offices. ""This was a problem that was not just impacting me, but another 100,000 people around the globe."" His nonprofit foundation has three main goals: first, find a way to halt progression of Parkinson's with GBA. Next, identify a regenerative approach to repair the damage it wreaks. And finally, find a way to prevent it altogether. Accomplishing even just the first would be to do something that's never been done. Despite years of effort and capital — from the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research to funding from Google founder Sergey Brin — treatments for Parkinson's disease have remained as elusive as those for other devastating neurodegenerative conditions, like Alzheimer's. ""It has been extremely challenging, and many clinical trials have failed,"" said Dr. Dimitri Krainc, chairman of the department of neurology and director of the Center for Rare Neurological Diseases at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""However, we have learned important lessons from these failures."" The disease was first described two centuries ago, in 1817, by British surgeon James Parkinson. In a document he called ""An Essay on the Shaking Palsy,"" Parkinson described a condition characterized by ""involuntary tremulous motion, with lessened muscular power."" We know now that Parkinson's results from loss of brain cells, including those that produce the chemical messenger dopamine, important for coordinating movement. Treatments have been developed to provide symptomatic relief, such as levodopa, which helps replenish the brain's supply of dopamine, but those have a set of problems of their own. Over time, people gradually need to increase the dose, and the medicines can lead to involuntary movement called dyskinesia. The bigger problem, though, is that levodopa and other approved agents aren't neuroprotective, said Krainc, ""meaning that they do not prevent neurons from degenerating."" Recent advancements in genetics provide some hope for better drug targets — including, according to Krainc, for the kind of Parkinson's that Silverstein has, driven by a mutation in GBA. The GBA gene is responsible for creating a protein known as GCase, or glucocerebrosidase, important for helping clear junk out of cells. And work is underway already: A clinical trial from Sanofi's Genzyme unit is ongoing, and, in January, drugmaker Allergan bought an exclusive option to acquire a company called Lysosomal Therapeutics, whose lead program also focuses on GBA-associated Parkinson's. Krainc is a co-founder of Lysosomal Therapeutics and chairs its scientific advisory board. ""There is a real need for disease-modifying treatment,"" Allergan CEO Brent Saunders told CNBC. Silverstein said he hopes the most advanced drugs will be able to help him, but he doesn't plan on depending on them. After his diagnosis, he sent out a massive call for any work in Parkinson's with GBA. ""We were just floored with the response,"" he said. Hundreds of ideas flowed in — ""some of them a little bit crazier than others"" — but about 80 he deemed worth looking at more closely. Since then, the Silverstein Foundation has made six funding grants to academic labs and private biotech companies, and received a $5 million donation from drugmaker Celgene. Being a patient as well as a venture capitalist has changed Silverstein's approach. ""As a venture capitalist, your first boss is your investors, so returns are the first thing that you have to be focused on,"" he said. That can lead to less risk-taking than might lead to bigger advances. ""But when you're a patient, you come at it from a completely different viewpoint,"" Silverstein said. ""You're not interested in incremental change. You're interested in cures."" Wednesday, along with OrbiMed and gene therapy biotech RegenXBio, the foundation announced the launch of a new company called Prevail Therapeutics. The founders of rare-disease drug giant Alexion, Leonard Bell and Stephen Squinto, are joining the board. Silverstein knows firsthand the odds, and the timelines of traditional drug development are stacked against him. It's estimated only 1 in 10 experimental compounds that enter human trials make it to market, and it takes years to get through the FDA approval process. But a piece of advice, he said, has remained with him: ""Be hopeful."" He's also determined. Julian Adams, a drug developer who met Silverstein two decades ago, recalled learning of his diagnosis and offering sympathies. ""I got this very rapid turnaround,"" Adams said of Silverstein's response: ""'I don't need your sympathies; I need your brains and I need a cure.'"" Adams joined the Silverstein Foundation's scientific advisory board, he said, ""10 seconds later."" ""He's so deeply respected in his field,"" Natalie Silverstein, Jonathan's wife of 17 years, said from their home in Manhattan. ""The rallying around him has been incredible."" One of his biggest successes, Silverstein recently recounted, is a drug called Strensiq, sold by Alexion for a rare, genetic bone disease called hypophosphatasia. He described seeing a baby, whose mother had been told she wouldn't live past a few more months, receive a dose of the medicine when she was just a few weeks old. She's now 9, said Silverstein, who's friends with her mom on Facebook. She's ""riding bikes and climbing trees and all those sorts of things."" ""I've seen miracles happen,"" Silverstein said. ""And … now I've got to create another miracle.""

"Constance Gustke, special to CNBC.com",08102017,CNBC,08032017,"After working with people with dementia for many years as a licensed nursing home administrator, Scott Tarde was fed up with the lack of affordable care options. So as the CEO of George G. Glenner Alzheimer's Family Centers, he decided to reimagine a new kind of day care: a faux mini-town with a 1950s and 1960s look designed for people with dementia. His concept is based on reminiscence therapy. His creation is Glenner Town Square, set to open in San Diego next spring. Reminiscence therapy, developed by psychologist Ellen Langer in 1979, involves the use of past activities, events and experiences with other people, usually with the aid of music and tangible, visual prompts from earlier years, such as photographs and familiar household items. Glenner Town Square bathes the senses in sights and smells to reflect a person's younger days. Its 9,000 square feet of space, designed by renowned architect Douglas Pancake, sits in an industrial building and will include a pet store with shelter puppies, department store with clothes and a movie theater with real popcorn. Everyplace is staffed with trained caregivers. Besides being fun, the retro town, outfitted with gas-lit streetlamps, also has real uses, like triggering positive past memories, say experts, and can help people with dementia feel calmer and need fewer drugs. The goal is to offer a safe location where residents have a structured day, as well as autonomy and independence — giving them a higher quality of life. ""We're taking people back to their strongest memories,"" says Tarde, noting it is a form of time-travel therapy. ""Long-term memories are more preserved than short-term ones."" Tarde, who has 20 years of experience working in the long-term care industry, has targeted a growing demographic in America. An estimated 5.4 million people in the United States suffer from Alzheimer's disease, a number that is expected to grow as baby boomers age. Even more suffer from a form of dementia. He got the idea for the village after visiting a junior-achievement mini-city in San Diego, where young people discover how the ""real world"" works by learning how to generate wealth and effectively manage it. More from Modern Medicine:A major step forward in fighting Alzheimer'sNew technology that can help with hearing loss Tarde has ambitious national plans, too. He wants to build 100 of these day care centers throughout the United States within 20 years. ""Families need reliable options and meaningful experiences,"" he says. As the projected number of dementia patients grows, he adds, society will need new, viable solutions. Glenner Town Square fits into a new type of community called dementia villages. They're attempting to bring fresh models of care, rather than just relying on drugs to take the sharp edges off the disease. The villages also provide safety and connection, which can increase well-being. Tarde's creation may be the United States' first dementia village, though. In 2009 the first kind of residential dementia village appeared in Hogewey, Holland, outside Amsterdam. Inhabitants walk freely among the walled town's parklike grounds and live in housing units arranged by theme. There are also grocery stores, hair salons and pubs, where the staff works and keeps an eye on the 152 residents The village is about the size of 10 football fields. Bringing more residential dementia villages to the United States may be a challenge. Hogewey is mainly funded by the Dutch government. Glenner Town Square, conversely, is privately funded by real estate developers Village Holdings, who have anted up $1 million in capital so far. The cost for day visitors, though, is affordable at $95 per day, says Tarde. Still, Tarde is optimistic about the power of day programs like Glenner Town Square to transform lives. He believes that medicine alone can't effectively treat people with Alzheimer's. ""Many people can also stay home if they have the right support,"" he says. There's such a tsunami of dementia care needed, agrees Donna Surges Tatum, board of directors of the National Certification Board for Alzheimer and Aging Care. In the United States an estimated 4 million to 5 million Americans currently have dementia. It remains the most expensive disease in America — a study funded by the National Institute on Aging  estimated that in 2010 it cost up to $215 billion a year to care for dementia patients, surpassing heart disease ($102 billion) and cancer ($77 billion). In addition, 5.5 million people are currently living with Alzheimer's. By 2050 that number is projected to reach 13.8 million, according to the Alzheimer's Association. ""It's expensive to create a whole village,"" she says. ""And we have such trouble getting care to anyone needs who it these days."" Reminiscence therapy, which taps into positive back memories, works well, though, she adds. These villages also emphasize personalized care and more engagement, too. ""People are currently sometimes drugged more than necessary,"" she adds. Jason Karlawish, a co-director at Penn Memory Center at the University of Pennsylvania, agrees. He advocates for spaces that tap into well-learned memories and comfort. ""They should be safe, social and engaged,"" he says. Social isolation can even lead to dementia, according to studies, he says. ""People with dementia need to feel like they're part of the human race,"" he adds. ""And so we need new approaches that aren't just biomedical."" For people used to growing up on farms, Prairie Elder Care in Kansas has a different solution. It's developing a dementia-care residence farm in Overland Park, Kansas, set to open next year. Called Prairie Farmstead, it has chicken coops and gardens. About 16 residents will always be supervised. But they can also plant tomatoes or roam in a sensory garden with butterflies. The cost is about $7,400 per month. ""Men with dementia can be difficult to engage,"" says Mandy Shoemaker, co-owner of Prairie Elder Care. ""They end up being on lots of medications for aggressive behaviors."" The goal, she says, is giving them back control over their lives. ""Control is slowly lost over the most basic decisions,"" she adds, explaining that with more engagement, they can be more calm and connected. There are no one-size-fits-all dementia villages, though, says Mario Garrett, professor of gerontology at San Diego State University. ""Your 1950s is completely different then my 1950s,"" he says. Yet every attempt is a good one, he adds, since people with dementia tend to be ignored. Even dementia village models will evolve into something better, he says. ""People need emotional support.""

Sean Williams,08102017,Fool,08032017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you've picked up a prescription from your local pharmacy recently, you probably don't need me to tell you that prescription drug prices have handily outpaced wage growth and the rate of inflation in the U.S. for some time now. According to Segal Consulting, prescription drugs are estimated to rise by 11.6% in 2017 for those under the age of 65, which follows an average price increase of 11.3% in 2016 for this same age group. Seniors don't have it much better, with projected increases in drug prices this year of 9.9%, following the 10.9% they rose in 2016. Image source: Getty Images. A separate report from AARP confirmed the pain seniors are dealing with when it comes to drug costs. Between the end of 2005 and the end of 2015, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Workers rose by an aggregate of 21.6%. This measurement suggests that a diverse basket of goods and services would be 21.6% more expensive after 10 years. However, prescription drug prices rose by 172.1% over the same period. The magnitude of prescription drug hikes is what's really eroded the purchasing power of Social Security benefits over the last decade. But when we're talking about drug inflation, nothing stands out more than cancer drugs, which often have six-digit annual costs. Last year, when I examined the approximate annual cost of 20 recently approved cancer drugs, 17 had annual costs in excess of $104,000. It's possible two of the remaining three did as well, but insufficient cost data existed at the time, because drugmakers, pharmacy-benefit management companies, and insurers, tend to be pretty secretive when it comes to wholesale list prices for prescription drugs. How on Earth can a $100,000-plus price tag be justified? Here are 10 reasons that describe why cancer drugs cost as much as they do. Image source: Getty Images. To begin with, cancer drugs are often specialized therapies. More and more these are drugs that aren't being administered as global chemotherapies designed to wipe out both cancerous and healthy cells. Instead, cancer drugs are being developed that target a specific mutation or biomarker within the body. Yes, this means certain cancer drugs are exclusionary and will only work for select patients of a particular cancer type. However, it often means a higher response rate, which can, in turn, lead to a partial or complete response and an improvement in the quality of life (and perhaps life expectancy). What patients are paying for is often this specialization and the fact that because it's targeted at a specific biomarker, a cancer drug's patient pool is narrower that previous-generation cancer drugs. Add to the previous point that cancer drugs, along with practically any drug that works its way through the drug development process in the U.S., has a lengthy patent protection period. From the time a biotech or pharmaceutical gets the green light from the Food and Drug Administration to begin human clinical trials, a 20-year clock begins to tick. This clock generally prevents generic drugs from entering the marketplace at substantial discounts in price to branded therapies. This usually leaves drugmakers with a decade or longer to market their pricey medicines without the fear of cheaper generic competition. Also, added protections are given to drugs that treat orphan diseases, which are defined as affecting 200,000 or fewer patients in the United States. If a cancer-drug maker focuses on an orphan type of cancer, then it would receive these extra protections from competition. Image source: Getty Images. The cost to develop a new drug is exceptionally expensive, with an analysis by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development pegging the total direct and indirect costs (i.e., time costs) combined as $2.56 billion.  Drug companies are looking to recoup these costs when they price their cancer drugs. Among the more than 30 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), just two don't have a universal health plan in place: the U.S. and Mexico. Because the U.S. lacks a universal health plan -- and make no mistake, the Affordable Care Act is not a universal health plan -- its lawmakers are unable to cap drug pricing. This isn't to say the government couldn't attempt to reform drug-pricing practices in the U.S., but it would be highly unlikely with Republican lawmakers generally favoring free-market economics, and therefore the ability of drugmakers to price their own products as they see fit. Image source: Getty Images. On top of not having a universal health plan, the U.S. is also filled with insurance companies that essentially have no backbone. There are thousands of approved medicines, but insurers often exclude just a few dozen from their approved formularies because of price. The reason? Insurers don't want to face the wrath of their members for excluding a popular or effective drug, which could lead to a drop in membership. Even though it's not a cancer product, Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) Sovaldi and Harvoni, which are both used to treat hepatitis C, are great examples. These drugs revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C by providing an effective cure, but their wholesale cost for a standard 12-week treatment are $84,000 and $94,500, respectively. Despite protests from the public and grumbling from Congress over these high costs, insurers were far too worried about excluding these drugs from their formularies and risking the loss of a lot of patients, so they kept them both on their approved-drug lists. A somewhat behind-the-scenes reason cancer drug prices are soaring is that the foundation of how certain late-stage cancer types are treated has changed. Cancer immunotherapies, which are drugs designed to stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells, are becoming a mainstay in some advanced cancers. More specifically, cancer immunotherapies have been shown in some instances to work better with existing cancer drugs as a combination therapy, as opposed to a monotherapy. While this can increase the objective response rate and improve quality of life for patients whose tumors have specific biomarkers, it also means having to pay for two cancer drugs instead of one. That's an easy way to double your cancer drug costs overnight. Image source: Getty Images. Now for the obvious: Supply and demand always matter. When it comes to demand, no country has more of an appetite for pharmaceutical products than the U.S. -- and that includes all pharmaceuticals, not just cancer drugs. A 2014 analysis from PBS found that the U.S. spends more per capita on drugs than any other OECD country by a mile, and that it ranked first in the use of a number of medicine types.  For example, American demand is tops on the list for antipsychotics, drugs for dementia, respiratory problems, and rheumatoid arthritis. If demand for prescription medicines is high, including cancer drugs, list prices will follow that demand higher. Let's also not forget that drugmakers often have to spend quite a bit on legal matters. This can include lawsuits against the company from patients, as well as the protection of their intellectual property from competitors. Corporate legal proceedings can sometimes takes years to hash out, which can mean millions or billions in annual legal costs, depending on the size of the company, or the legal problem in question. For instance, a little more than a week ago, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), which has one of the leading cancer immunotherapies on the market with Opdivo, filed a lawsuit against Roche (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY) subsidiary Genentech that suggests its more recently approved cancer immunotherapy, Tecentriq, exploits treatment patterns used by Opdivo. Bristol-Myers is seeking as of now unspecified damages, but since Tecentriq is expected to be a blockbuster drug, we could be talking about billions in annual revenue. High cancer-drug prices fuel this IP defense. Image source: Getty Images. Compared with other countries, Americans are also paying a high price for substantially quicker access to new medicines. Once the FDA approves a new drug, be it a cancer drug or one to treat diabetes, it becomes immediately available for sale. The one exception would be drugs considered addictive or with the potential for abuse, which may have to wait for scheduling from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. On the other hand, countries with universal health plans don't work this way. In Europe, once the European Medicines Agency has given the thumbs-up to a cancer drug, the drugmaker must then negotiate on pricing and rebates with each and every EU country. It's a tedious process that can delay the launch of a drug by months, or years, relative to the United States. Finally, drugmakers believe they can get away with slapping six-digit price tags on cancer drugs in the U.S. because the standard of living is relatively high, especially when it comes to income. In 2011, the Pew Research Center took a look at how Americans stacked up next to the rest of the world on the basis of income. Whereas 15% of the global population was considered poor (living on $2 a day, or less), and 56% was low income (living on $2-$10 a day), just a combined 5% of the U.S. population fit this mold. Comparatively, a ""high-income individual"" is described as one living on $50 or more a day. Just 7% of the global population met this definition compared to 56% of Americans in 2011. Drugmakers view this wealth as all the reason they need to pass along high cancer drug prices. Cancer drug inflation shows little signs of slowing, which means you should be prepared for these costs by saving more, getting insured, and investing for your future. ","

Daniel B. Kline,08102017,Fool,08032017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. After a complaint was filed in federal court alleging that Dunkin' Brands' (NASDAQ:DNKN) Dunkin' Donuts' steak sandwiches do not actually contain ""steak,"" a new suit makes similar charges about its blueberry bakery items. The lawsuit, which was filed in United States District Court in the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division, was filed by attorneys for Bartosz Grabowski ""and on behalf of all others similarly situated."" It seeks class action status. The plaintiff claims that the coffee chain's various blueberry-named bakery products, including Glazed Blueberry doughnuts, Blueberry Butternut doughnuts, and Blueberry Crumb Cake doughnuts, contain imitation blueberries ""that highly resemble actual blueberries due to their round shape and blue color."" Lawyers claim that if their client had known the products did not contain blueberries, he either would not have purchased them or would have paid significantly less for the products. They seek in excess of $5 million to remedy the situation. Dunkin' Donuts does not list blueberries as an ingredient in its blueberry doughnuts. Image source: Getty Images. While Dunkin' Donuts lists blueberries as an ingredient in its blueberry muffins, none of its blueberry doughnuts list the fruit as an ingredient. The company's various ""blueberry"" doughnut flavors appear to use a mix of non-fruit ingredients to simulate blueberries in the baked treats. The lawsuit charges that this is an attempt to deceive consumers. Through its manufacturing, marketing, and sale of the Blueberry Products, Defendant has represented that the Blueberry Products contain actual blueberries. Defendant has named the Blueberry Products as ""Blueberry Butternut"", ""Blueberry Crumb Cake"", and ""Glazed Blueberry"", indicating that the Blueberry Products contain actual blueberries. The lawsuit contends that blueberries have health benefits that consumers would be willing to pay more for. It also notes that when buying a doughnut in-store, consumers see the blueberry doughnuts displayed alongside other products, including various doughnuts and muffins, that contain the fruit they are named for. Food lawsuits have become common in recent years with Subway being sued over its sandwiches not being the size advertised while Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) has been sued multiple times over whether it fills its drinks properly. While Starbucks has either won its cases or seen them dismissed, Subway did have to pay up to $525,000 in attorneys fees, and take steps to ensure its 12-inch sandwiches actually measure 12 inches. In the case of the Dunkin' suit, the case is a little different because it involves whether it's OK to call a product ""blueberry"" when it contains no blueberries. There is some precedent for this as certain beverage products marketed using fruit names do list how much (or how little) actual juice they contain. If this case proceeds, it's possible that Dunkin' may have to change its marketing for these products. Given the past history of lawsuits like this, it's somewhat unlikely the plaintiffs will receive a large cash payout. That's because while the lawsuit makes a case for the benefits of the fruit, noting that ""blueberries have the potential to limit the development and severity of certain cancers and vascular diseases,"" it's highly unlikely anyone specifically seeking those health benefits does so through doughnuts.

    Lawsuit Claims Dunkin' Donuts Misleads About Blueberries -- The Motley Fool

Sean Williams,08102017,Fool,08032017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The more than 50-year war that's been waged by the U.S. against tobacco companies has been working. According to the latest statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 15.1% of U.S. adults (36.5 million) aged 18 and older were smoking cigarettes as of 2015. That's down from 20.9% of all U.S. adults back in 2005, and more than 40% of all adults back in the mid-1960s. Since smoking tobacco has unquestionably been linked to an increased risk for heart disease and cancer, this sizable decrease in adult smokers has undoubtedly saved lives and helped increase average life expectancies. Image source: Getty Images. However, there's a long way to go. Cigarette smoking still accounts for more than 480,000 deaths per year, or roughly 1 in every 5 annual deaths. Despite its ongoing educational campaign to curb smoking, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) want to do more to get smokers to put down their cigarettes for good. Late last week, the FDA unveiled its latest proposal, which could represent the first true nail in the coffin for the traditional tobacco industry. The FDA proposes cutting nicotine levels in cigarettes to levels it would deem as minimally addictive, or possibly even non-addictive. The FDA can't outright ban tobacco, but its regulatory proposals could certainly push down acceptable nicotine levels in cigarettes. Nicotine itself isn't a cancer-causing agent, but it's what's responsible for creating the addiction that keeps consumers coming back for more, and thereby smoking cigarettes that do have cancer- and disease-causing chemicals. By lowering nicotine content in cigarettes, the FDA presumes that it'll reduce the addictive quality of tobacco -- meaning consumers will smoke less, quit altogether, or move their habit to an alternative source, such as electronic cigarettes or a nicotine patch. All of these scenarios are potentially bad news for Big Tobacco. Image source: Getty Images. It should be noted that the FDA's proposal won't simply become a new regulation. Proposals of this sort allow for public commentary and input from multiple stakeholders before any measures are officially taken. In other words, it could be months, or longer, before we have a firm idea on what could happen with nicotine regulation. In recent years, Big Tobacco has been utilizing its exceptional pricing power to counteract a fairly steady drop in cigarette volume. Altria (NYSE:MO), which operates solely in the U.S., has been almost entirely reliant on higher cigarette prices and its share-buyback program -- which has reduced its share count by approximately 175 million shares over the past decade -- to push its earnings per share (EPS) higher. Overseas manufacturers, such as Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), have been a little luckier in that they have a broader geographic audience with, in some countries, far less regulatory oversight. Thus, countries like India and China continue to offer plenty of growth opportunity in the wake of the U.S.'s crackdown on Big Tobacco. Philip Morris doesn't operate in the United States, but has, instead, benefited from its global diversification. U.S. manufacturers like Altria and Reynolds American, which is now owned by British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI), have seen the writing on the wall for years that tougher regulations could be headed their way. As such, they've been focused on alternative-delivery platforms. Unfortunately, these alternative platforms, like electronic cigarettes, represent a nascent operating segment that is growing fast, but is still a low-to-mid single-digit contributor. British American Tobacco is the largest vape company in the world, so among all its peers, it should be best fit to test the idea that alternative-product platforms can stem weakness in combustible products. Then again, it could be quite some time before Big Tobacco sees any sort of genuine offset from the growth in smokeless products compared to the loss in volume from combustible tobacco products. Image source: Getty Images. Though the transition toward smokeless products and alternative-delivery platforms is ongoing, perhaps the biggest surprise of the FDA's proposal was commentary from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb that electronic cigarettes may offer a solution to curb tobacco use. Said Gottlieb, ""While there's still much research to be done on these products and the risks that they may pose, they may also present benefits that we must consider."" As Reuters points out, this commentary is consist with his position this past April that electronic cigarettes may be useful in helping to wean smokers off combustible cigarettes. But what's truly notable here is that Gottlieb's statement goes against published studies that have shown e-cigs, as they're also known, can be quite harmful. A study by National Jewish Health in 2014 found that liquid vapor from electronic cigarettes damaged epithelial cells in users' airways within minutes, leaving them more susceptible to viral infections. The effect lasted for up to 48 hours after use. Another study from researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in 2015 wound up analyzing 51 flavored liquids for the presence of three chemicals known to have an adverse impact on a person's lungs. The findings showed that 92% of the liquids contained at least one of these three chemicals. Image source: Getty Images. There have also been concerns that liquid-vapor marketing has been targeted at children, given flavors like cotton candy and bubble gum. This was supposed to be taken care of this past August when new FDA regulations were to go into effect requiring the disclosure of ingredients being used in nicotine-containing vaping liquid and the placement of warning labels on packaging. Unfortunately, these regulations were pushed back, giving electronic cigarette and liquid-vaping producers additional years to comply, or fail to adhere to, the coming regulations. It certainly appears that we're coming to a crossroads for the tobacco industry. At some point, consumers simply won't be able to absorb any more substantial price hikes. Further, reassurances are needed from the FDA that electronic cigarettes are ""safe,"" in the relative sense of the word, before this Fool believes e-cigs have a shot to replace even 5%-10% of the lost revenue from combustible tobacco products. I'd suggest avoiding those delectable tobacco dividends and finding other high-yield companies to invest in until the FDA issues its final word on the matter. ","

                                    hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has notched a nominal record close (2,480.91), eclipsing the former record by three points. Still, the index remains range-bound, capped by its absolute all-time high (2,484.04). This area is under siege early Tuesday, and the session close will likely add color. More broadly, the S&P’s orderly three-week range at record territory is technically constructive. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has taken flight, notching nine straight record closes. To reiterate, near-term support is poorly-defined, though the 22,040 and 21,930 areas mark potential floors. The Dow’s first notable support matches its breakout point, the July peak of 21,682. Conversely, the Nasdaq Composite continues to digest the late-July plunge amid jagged price action. Still, the index has maintained its first significant support —the 6,342-to-6,344 area — matching the breakout point, better illustrated below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq’s bearish key reversal — the late-July downdraft — has been stemmed by support matching the 6,342 breakout point. (The closing low rests at 6,340.) The absence of downside follow-through, seven sessions after the initial plunge, is technically constructive. In a textbook world, the seven sessions or so following a major market move conventionally constitute the “caution-zone” period. Looking elsewhere, the Dow industrials’ six-month chart above includes the Bollinger bands, also known as volatility bands. Illustrated in red, the bands encompass two standard deviations of the Dow’s trailing 20-day volatility. Consider that consecutive closes higher signal a tension between two time horizons. For the near-term, the Dow is overbought, and due to consolidate. An eventual reversion to the mean — or at least a pullback to the range — would be expected. More broadly, the Dow’s bullish momentum registers as statistically extreme, and improves the chances of longer-term follow-through. See the February closes atop the bands, subsequent pullback, and unseasonal summer follow-through. (The Dow’s prevailing five-session string concluded on Aug. 3.) Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is not taking flight, though it is acting well technically. To reiterate, the S&P’s prevailing bull flag — the tight three-week range — is a continuation pattern, positioning the index to extend the uptrend. Consider that the 50-day moving average, currently 2,446, is rising toward the 2,453 breakout point. Broadly speaking, the big three U.S. benchmarks have asserted a slight technical divergence. Perhaps most obviously, the Dow Jones industrial Average has taken flight, and is refusing to pull in. The blue-chip benchmark is vying for its eleventh straight daily gain, and tenth straight record close. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 remains range-bound — though a breakout attempt is underway — while the Nasdaq Composite digests its late-July plunge. Despite the slight cross currents, the bigger-picture backdrop remains constructive. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF

Additional overhead matches the small-cap benchmark’s former record close, technically 142.10. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 is retesting the 50-day moving average, currently 319.30, an area closely matching the former range top.

Amid the cross currents, the S&P 500 has notched a nominal record close — by a narrow three-point margin — and a grinding-higher breakout attempt remains underway.

Rachel Koning Beals,08102017,MarketWatch,08032017,"Published: Aug 5, 2017 6:19 p.m. ET A Reuters/Ipsos survey found evidence of distrust of big airlines By Some profit-hunting airlines have sought to lure travelers into business and first class with comfy lounges, fancy cocktails and high-speed internet connections. Most travelers could care less; they’re watching their own bottom line. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll out this week showed that 83% of Americans put ticket prices chief among their considerations when booking personal tickets, topping travel perks and even an airline’s reputation. Don’t miss: Court orders FAA to address ‘the case of the incredible shrinking airline seat’ — this is how much they’ve actually shrunk Some 60% of those polled said they would not pay extra to avoid being assigned a middle seat. About 52% said they would not pay more to fly on their preferred airline. While more perks have been introduced to differentiate higher-priced ticket options, the airlines are not ignoring the other end of the spectrum.

Earlier this year, United’s chief executive said he was “ashamed” of his company’s treatment of a paying passenger dragged off a plane by law-enforcement officials called by United agents. And in another incident this summer, Delta stood up for its actions after author and media personality Ann Coulter went on a dayslong Twitter campaign against the airline after losing her pre-booked “extra room” seat. Some airlines are trying to shift focus back on paying customers. Alaska Airlines last month announced that most sporting equipment that may exceed its normal checked baggage weight and dimensions could now fly for only $25, a sharp discount from its former fee, and even extended to bikes.

Victor Reklaitis,08102017,MarketWatch,08032017,"Published: Aug 9, 2017 1:04 p.m. ET After North Korea’s saber-rattling, Gov. Eddie Baza Calvo stresses ‘Guam is American soil’ By Guam Gov. Eddie Baza Calvo on Wednesday reassured the U.S. territory’s residents and pushed back after North Korea’s latest saber-rattling. North Korea threatened a missile strike on a U.S. military base on Guam, with the bellicose message coming early Wednesday from that isolated Asian nation after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would respond with “fire and fury like the world has never seen” if North Korea doesn’t halt its threats. Trump’s comments came after a Washington Post report said North Korea has built a miniaturized nuclear warhead. Calvo aimed to soothe at the start of a video message. “I want to reassure the people of Guam that currently there is no threat to our island or the Marianas,” the governor said. “My Homeland Security adviser, who is in communications with Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, notes there is no change in the threat level resulting from North Korea events.” He then said he had spoken with White House officials, who promised to protect the largest of the Marianas Islands. Calvo also suggested reporters aren’t giving the full picture when it comes to the U.S. territory in the western Pacific Ocean. “I also want to remind the national media that Guam is American soil, and we have 200,000 Americans in Guam and the Marianas. We are not just a military installation,” he said. Here is his full video message: Want news about Asia delivered to your inbox? Subscribe to MarketWatch's free Asia Daily newsletter. Sign up here.

While equities have been in an essentially uninterrupted uptrend all year—the S&P has advanced nearly 11% so far in 2017—recent moves have been slight in both directions. The S&P hasn’t had a daily move of at least 0.5% in 13 sessions, an abnormally long time. That is a sign that while investors aren’t broadly seeing the kind of risk that could lead to a correction, they’re also finding few reasons to keep pushing shares meaningfully higher from current levels. “We have a low-inflation environment, low interest rates, and corporate earnings have come in incredibly well. Those can all hold the market at these levels, but at the same time, you don’t have all sectors firing at once, and the calls for a correction could become a self-fulfilling prophesy,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. “I’m cautious about what I’m doing. I don’t need to chase the market, and nothing is exciting me enough to rush out and spend the cash I have on hand,” he said. “Why pay full price for a suit if I strongly suspect that it will go on sale in the next month or two?” Check out: Beneath the glow of stock-market records, darkly bearish trends are lurking See:  The stock market’s historically worst 2 months are dead ahead. Time to worry? Fed speakers in the spotlight:  St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the level of short-term interest rates was fine, and that “the current level of the policy rate is likely to remain appropriate over the near term.” Separately, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said businesses that complain of troubles finding workers but don’t raise wages are just “whining.” Read: American workers are missing out on a big payday, and here’s the main reason why It will be a light week for economic data, with consumer prices on Friday, representing the most significant update. On Monday, a report on total consumer credit showed an annual pace of growth of 3.9% in June, according to the Federal Reserve. This was down from May’s growth rate, which was the strongest in six months. Economists are watching the consumer closely as they expect spending to drive growth in the remainder of 2017.

,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"Wichmann, 54, was widely viewed inside and outside of the company as Hemsley’s likely successor, although the timing of the change was sooner than some had expected. UnitedHealth’s shares fell 0.7 percent to $193.79 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Under 65-year-old Hemsley, UnitedHealth became one of the biggest sellers of insurance plans on the exchanges created as part of former President Barack Obama’s national healthcare law. However, mounting losses from the program prompted the company to largely exit from Obamacare plans in 2017. Current Chairman Richard Burke will become UnitedHealth’s lead independent chairman, UnitedHealth said. The changes are all effective Sept. 1. Wichmann has spent nearly 20 years with the company and was previously its chief financial officer. He has long been in charge of the insurer’s mergers and acquisitions. “Management is the single most important factor in our view of UnitedHealth - and with Hemsley staying in a very important operating/strategic role, we are very comfortable with this change,” Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick wrote in a research note. As founder, Burke also remains on the board. “The guardians of the UNH galaxy are firmly in place,” Skolnick said. The insurer reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit last month, helped by its decision to abandon the Obamacare individual insurance market, amid uncertainty over the fate of the law under President Donald Trump’s administration. Hemsley said in July he was optimistic about the business next year, but that national and state healthcare policies would be a possible drag on profit in 2018. Shares of the company have risen nearly four-fold since Hemsley took over the helm. ","

,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"The move comes nearly two weeks after President Donald Trump took aim at insurers by threatening to cut the healthcare subsidy payments that make Obamacare plans affordable, after repeatedly failing in his efforts to dismantle former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law. Insurers are facing an upheaval in their health insurance businesses due to uncertainty over the healthcare legislation as Republican lawmakers seek to follow through on their promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The insurers have asked the government to commit to making the $8 billion in subsidy payments for 2018, saying they may raise rates or leave the individual insurance marketplace if there is too much uncertainty. On Monday, Anthem said it would no longer offer Obamacare plans in Nevada’s state exchange and half of Georgia’s counties in 2018. The company said on Friday it will only offer off-exchange plans in Washington and Scott counties and the city of Bristol. Hundreds of U.S. counties are at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018 as health insurers consider pulling out of those markets in the coming months. ","

,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"(Reuters) - Centene Corp, one of the largest players in the Obamacare individual insurance market, said it would offer Obamacare plans in Nevada in 2018. Nevada was left without insurance coverage after U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc said last week it would pare back its Obamacare offerings in the state exchange next year. Centene said its SilverSummit Healthplan would cover all 17 counties of Nevada, including the “bare counties” that were expected not to have coverage by any other health insurers in 2018. Health insurers are facing an upheaval in their businesses amid growing uncertainty over the healthcare legislation under President Donald Trump, who seek to follow through on his promise to dismantle former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. Centene is among the few large-cap health insurers that have not exited the individual insurance market despite Republican lawmakers’ persistent efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. In June, the company said it would enter into three new states and would expand operations in six existing markets in 2018. Insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc have exited most of the states where they sold Obamacare plans, leaving hundreds of U.S. counties at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018. Centene's latest move was first reported by the Nevada Independent on Tuesday. (bit.ly/2w76jKR) ","

,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"GENEVA (Reuters) - More than half a million people in Yemen have been infected with cholera since the epidemic began four months ago and 1,975 people have died, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday. Each day there are more than 5,000 new cases of the waterborne disease, which causes acute diarrhoea and dehydration, in the country where the health system has collapsed after more than two years of war, it said. “The total number of suspected cholera cases in Yemen this year hit the half a million mark on Sunday, and nearly 2,000 people have died since the outbreak began to spread rapidly at the end of April,” the WHO said in a statement on Monday. “The spread of cholera has slowed significantly in some areas compared to peak levels but the disease is still spreading fast in more recently affected districts, which are recording large numbers of cases,” it said, reporting a total of 503,484 cases. The disease, spread by ingestion of food or water tainted with human faeces, can kill within hours if untreated. It has been largely eradicated in developed countries equipped with sanitation systems and water treatment. But Yemen’s devastating civil war, pitting a Saudi-led military coalition against the Iran-backed armed Houthi group, and economic collapse has made it extremely difficult to deal with catastrophes such as cholera and mass hunger. Millions of Yemenis remain cut off from clean water and waste collection has ceased in major cities, the WHO added. Yemen’s 30,000 critical health workers have not been paid salaries in nearly a year and critical medicines are lacking, the WHO said. “These doctors and nurses are the backbone of the health response – without them we can do nothing in Yemen. They must be paid their wages so that they can continue to save lives,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. WHO and partners are working around the clock to set up cholera treatment clinics, rehabilitate health facilities, deliver medical supplies and support the national effort, the United Nations agency said. More than 99 percent of patients who reach health facilities survive but children and the elderly are most vulnerable. “The response is working in some places. We can tell you that surveillance confirms a decline in suspected cases over the past four weeks in some of the most affected governorates,” WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a news briefing last Friday. “Most notably Sanaa city, Hajja and Amran are consistent with his decline. But in many other districts, cases and deaths persist and are on the rise.” ","

 ,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"DEADLY AGENT: A sarin attack in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta killed hundreds of men, women and children in August, 2013. Despite international condemnation, attacks with chemicals continue. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh Nearly four years after President Bashar al-Assadâs government promised to get rid of its stockpile of chemical weapons, gas attacks are still commonplace. What went wrong? By  Anthony Deutsch Filed Aug. 17, 2017, 10 a.m. GMT THE HAGUE â In the spring of 2015 a Syrian major general escorted a small team of chemical weapons inspectors to a warehouse outside the Syrian capital Damascus. The international experts wanted to examine the site, but were kept waiting outside in their car for around an hour, according to several people briefed on the visit. When they were finally let into the building, it was empty. They found no trace of banned chemicals. âLook, there is nothing to see,â said the general, known to the inspectors as Sharif, opening the door. So why were the inspectors kept waiting? The Syrians said they were getting the necessary approval to let them in, but the inspectors had a different theory. They believed the Syrians were stalling while the place was cleaned out. It made no sense to the team that special approval was needed for them to enter an empty building. The incident, which was not made public, is just one example of how Syrian authorities have hindered the work of inspectors and how the international community has failed to hold Syria to account, according to half a dozen interviews with officials, diplomats, and investigators involved in eliminating Syriaâs weapons of mass destruction. Related content Slideshow: An invisible enemy Video: Anthony Deutsch on how he uncovered the problems facing weapons inspectors in Syria Video: Interview with Angela Kane, former UN high representative for disarmament Timeline: U.N.-OPCW investigations Â into Syrian chemical weapons Syria investigator del Ponte quits, blaming U.N. Security Council A promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse. They suspect that President Bashar al-Assadâs regime, while appearing to cooperate with international inspectors, secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability. They say Syria hampered inspectors, gave them incomplete or misleading information, and turned to using chlorine bombs when its supplies of other chemicals dwindled. There have been dozens of chlorine attacks and at least one major sarin attack since 2013, causing more than 200 deaths and hundreds of injuries. International inspectors say there have been more than 100 reported incidents of chemical weapons being used in the past two years alone. âThe cooperation was reluctant in many aspects and thatâs a polite way of describing it,â Angela Kane, who was the United Nationâs high representative for disarmament until June 2015, told Reuters. âWere they happily collaborating? No.â âWhat has really been shown is that there is no counter-measure, that basically the international community is just powerless,â she added. That frustration was echoed by U.N. war crimes investigator Carla del Ponte, who announced on Aug. 6 she was quitting a U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria. âI have no power as long as the Security Council does nothing,â she said. âWe are powerless, there is no justice for Syria.â The extent of Syriaâs reluctance to abandon chemical weapons has not previously been made public for fear of damaging international inspectorsâ relationship with Assadâs administration and its backer, Russia, which is giving military support to Assad. Now investigators and diplomatic sources have provided telling details to Reuters: - Syriaâs declarations about the types and quantities of chemicals it possessed do not match evidence on the ground uncovered by inspectors.Â Its disclosures, for example, make no mention of sarin, yet there is strong evidence that sarin has been used in Syria, including this year. Other chemicals found by inspectors but not reported by Syria include traces of nerve agent VX, the poison ricin and a chemical called hexamine, which is used to stabilise sarin. - Syria told inspectors in 2014-2015 that it had used 15 tonnes of nerve gas and 70 tonnes of sulphur mustard for research. Reuters has learned that inspectors believe those amounts are not âscientifically credible.â Only a fraction would be needed for research, two sources involved in inspections in Syria said. âWhy, my God, three-and-a-half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that, I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people.â - At least 2,000 chemical bomb shells, which Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons and either used or destroyed, are unaccounted for, suggesting that they may still be in the hands of Syriaâs military. - In Damascus, witnesses with knowledge of the chemical weapons programme were instructed by Syrian military officials to alter their statements midway through interviews with inspectors, threeÂ sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international agency overseeing the removal and destruction of Syriaâs chemical weapons, conceded serious questions remain about the completeness and accuracy of Syriaâs disclosures. ""There are certainly some gaps, uncertainties, discrepancies,"" OPCW Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, told Reuters. But he rejected criticism of his leadership by Kane and some other diplomats. Kane told Reuters that Uzumcu should have turned up the pressure on Syria over the gaps in its reporting and done more to support his inspectors. Uzumcu countered that it was not his job âto ensure the full complianceâ of treaties on chemical weapons, saying that the OPCW was mandated to confirm use of chemical weapons but not to assign blame. Syriaâs deputy foreign minister, Faisal Meqdad, insisted that Syria was completely free of chemical weapons and defended the countryâs cooperation with international inspectors. âI assure you that what was called the Syrian chemical weapons programme has ended, and has ended with no return. There are no more chemical weapons in Syria,â he told Reuters in an interview. Sharif did not respond to requests for comment about the incident at the warehouse. SARIN ATTACK On Aug. 21, 2013, hundreds of people died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta, a district on the outskirts of Damascus. The colourless, odourless nerve agent causes people to suffocate within minutes if inhaled even in small amounts. Assadâs forces were blamed by Western governments. He has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and blames insurgents for the attack. âThe secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil.â In the wake of the atrocity, the United States and Russia brokered a deal under which Assadâs government agreed to eradicate its chemical weapons programme. As part of the deal, Syria joined the OPCW, based in the Hague, Netherlands, promising to openÂ its borders to inspectors and disclose its entire programme â after previously denying it had any chemical weapons. Syria declared it had 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons or industrial chemical stocks, precisely the amount that outside experts had estimated. In an OPCW-led operation, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, that stockpile was shipped overseas for destruction with the help of 30 countries, notably the United States. But there were two significant problems. First, inspections did not go smoothly. Days after the Ghouta sarin attack, OPCW inspectors heading for the area came under sniper fire. They made it through to Ghouta eventually and were given just two hours by Syrian authorities to interview witnesses and take samples. The team confirmed that sarin had been used. And in May 2014 a joint United Nations-OPCW convoy was hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while attempting to get to the site of another chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita. That mission was aborted. On the return journey some of the team were detained for 90 minutes by unidentified gunmen. Syriaâs foreign ministry issued a statement blaming terrorists for attacking the convoy. Reuters was unable to determine exactly how many times the work of inspectors has been hampered, but Syrian tactics have included withholding visas, submitting large volumes of documents multiple times to bog down the process, last-minute restrictions on site inspections and coercing certain witnesses to change their stories during interviews, four diplomats and inspectors involved in the process told Reuters. The OPCW team has carried out 18 site visits since 2013, but has now effectively given up because Syria has failed to provide sufficient or accurate information, these sources said. The second problem was a switch of tactics by Assadâs forces. While the United Nations and OPCW focused on ridding Syria of the stockpile it admitted having, Assadâs forces began using new, crude chlorine bombs instead, according to two inspectors. As many as 100 chlorine barrel bombs have been dropped from helicopters since 2014, they said. Syria has denied using chlorine. Â Although less poisonous than nerve gas and widely available, chlorineâs use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria signed when it joined the OPCW, an intergovernmental agency that works with the United NationsÂ to implement the convention. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by drowning victims in body fluids. A source involved in monitoring Syriaâs chemical weapons for the OPCW said Damascus began using chlorine as âa weapon of terrorâ to gain a battlefield advantage when one of its bases in Kafr Zita was threatened with being overrun in 2014. âThe base was surrounded by opposition. The government forces wanted to depopulate the area. Thatâs why they started using chlorine,â said the source. A senior official who has worked with United Nations and OPCW investigators said two helicopter squadrons dropped chlorine barrel bombs, drums filled with chlorine canisters, from two air bases. To produce such a quantity must have required technical staff and logistical support, suggesting the operation was overseen by senior commanders, the official said.

The Syrian armed forces denied using chemical weapons. REUTERS/Mohamed Abdullah The introduction of a new type of chemical weapon came at an awkward time for the OPCW, said the source involved in studying Syriaâs chemical weapons for the weapons monitoring group. It was keen to remove Syriaâs declaredÂ stockpile and reluctant to start a probe into alleged government violations that could jeopardise Syrian cooperation. The goal of removing the stockpile, which Western governments feared could fall into the hands of Islamic State, took precedence over the chlorine attacks, the source said. OPCW head Uzumcu denied there had been a reluctance to investigate reports of chlorine attacks, pointing out that in 2014 he set up a fact finding mission to look into them. This mission was not tasked with assigning blame, however. ItÂ concluded that the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread. Uzumcu said the teamâs conclusions were handed to the OPCW executive council. It condemned the use of chlorine and passed the findings to the United Nations. A spokesman for the United Nations said it was the role of the OPCW to determine whether or not a member state was in breach of the chemical weapons ban. Kane, the former U.N. high representative for disarmament, told Reuters that Uzumcu should have tackled Syria over its lapses in reporting to the OPCW, including undeclared chemicals and a failure to report the governmentâs Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which was, in effect, the programmeâs headquarters. âWhy, my God, three-and-a half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that ... I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people,â Kane said. Uzumcu said the OPCW was constrained by its founding treaty, the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW has no obligation to act when one of its members violates the convention, he said. Determining blame for the use of chemical weapons is the task of aÂ separate United Nations-OPCW mission in Syria, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, established in 2015. A spokesman for the Joint Investigative Mechanism referred questions to the OPCW. âThe secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil and will remain within our limitations as far as our mandate is concerned,â Uzumcu said. He said some states have suspicions that the Syrian government hid stocks of chemical precursors that might be used for the production of certain nerve agents, including sarin. But he said there was no conclusive evidence. Uzumcu said he regretted that relations had broken down between Russia and the United States on the OPCW executive council, which has the power to impose restrictions on Syriaâs membership and report it to the U.N. Security Council for non-cooperation. Uzumcu said his office was still seeking answers from the Assad administration about undeclared chemicals, aerial bombs and the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which has overseen Syriaâs chemical weapons since the 1970s. Syrian officials have maintained that no supporting documentation exists for the programme, which included dozens of storage, production and research facilities. POLITICAL DEADLOCK The Syrian crisis has had a profound effect on the way the OPCW operates. For two decades the organisation had reached consensus on most decisions, only calling on the 41-member executive council to vote on a handful of occasions. Syria marked a clear divide on the council. In 2016, when an inquiry by the United Nations and OPCW found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks, the United States sought to impose sanctions on those responsible through the executive council, but then dropped the proposal, the details of which were not made public. A text drafted by Spain condemned the attacksÂ but removed any reference to sanctions. It was supported by a majority, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain, but opposed by Russia, China, Iran and Sudan. The United States has since placed sanctions on hundreds of Syrian officials it said were linked to the chemical weapons programme. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian air base, but division on the OPCW governing body and at the United Nations has prevented collective action against the continuing attacks. Western governments accused Moscow of trying to undermine investigations by the United Nations and OPCW in order to protect Assad; Syria says the inspection missions are being used by Western countries to force regime change. Russian officials did not respond to a request for comment. SARIN FOUND Former U.N. chief weapons inspector Ake Sellstrom, who is now chief scientist for the U.N.-OPCW mission, said it is critical that perpetrators of chemical attacks are put on trial to deter future use of weapons of mass destruction. His team should be reporting back to the U.N. by mid-October, he said. A key unsolved question is what happened to the 2,000 aerial bombs that Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons, a process that would be costly and time-consuming. reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives âTo my knowledge, the Syrian government never furnished any details of where, when and how they changed the bombsâ payload,â said an OPCW-U.N. source, who took part in investigations in 2015-2016. He said there clearly was âa real, high-level, command structure behind this.â Syrian officials did not respond to requests for comment about the bombs. The team is also examining the deaths Â of almost 100 people on April 4 when a gas attack hit Khan Sheikhoun, a town in the rebel-held province of Idlib near the Turkish border. Samples taken from people exposed to the chemicals and tested by the OPCW confirmed sarin use. Meqdad, Syriaâs deputy foreign minister, said in the interview Syrian forces were not to blame, repeating earlier denials by Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem. Sellstrom said the presence of sarin so long after Syria was supposed to have dismantled its chemical weapons programme posed difficult questions. âIs there a hideout somewhere, or is there production somewhere and how much is available?â he said, adding that the reported use of aerial bombs in Khan Sheikhoun could point to the Syrian forces keeping some strategic weapons as well. The attack means either âthat someone can produce sarin today, or sarin has been hidden,â Sellstrom said. 2013U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reach an agreement on the elimination of Syriaâs chemical weapons. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon establishes United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic. Headed by Swedish scientist Ake Sellstrom and comprised of experts from the World Health Organization and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), it is tasked with looking into possible use of chemical weapons following reports of an attack in the northern town of Khan al-Assal. It confirms use of sarin in the Aug. 21 attack in the Damascus suburb Ghouta that killed hundreds. 2014OPCW Declaration Assessment Team begins work to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in Syriaâs declaration to the OPCW, which was supposed to include all aspects of its chemical weapons programme. By July 2016, after visiting Syria 18 times to inspect sites and meet with Syrian officials, it can ânot fully verify that Syria had submitted a declaration that could be considered accurate and complete.â OPCW establishes a Fact Finding Mission in response to persistent allegations of chemical weapon attacks in Syria, âto establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic.â The Fact Finding Mission concludes the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread. It is not tasked with assigning blame. 2015United Nations-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism in Syria is established to identify individuals or entities behind chemical weapons attacks. 2016Joint Investigative Mechanism concludes that Syrian government forces used chlorine as a chemical weapon in three cases and that Islamic State militants used sulphur mustard. OPCW executive council adopts decision condemning Syrian government and Islamic State for chemical weapons use after a vote that split the body and signaled an end to U.S.-Russia cooperation. 2017OPCW Fact Finding Mission concludes that sarin was used in an April 4 attack in the Khan Sheikhoun area of northern Syria, the most deadly use of the nerve agent in three years. It does not assign blame.

 ,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"“We are looking for partners ... a series of partners. It’s not to fund the whole pipeline, just some projects in it. A small part of it,” Teva spokeswoman Denise Bradley told Reuters in an email on Wednesday. Israel’s Teva needs extra financial firepower to develop new drugs and has few options left other than striking alliances with big pharma players, sources familiar with the company said. “Teva will avoid injecting any extra funding in new drugs,” one of the sources said. “They will partner with other big pharmas and share the proceeds.” Earlier this month the world’s largest generics drugmaker, which is facing price erosion in the United States, reported a steeper than expected drop in second-quarter earnings, slashed its dividend by 75 percent and cut its 2017 forecast. A loss of confidence in the company’s management have led to a nearly 50 percent drop in Teva’s shares since Aug. 3, while losses are about 75 percent since the start of 2016. Investors say Teva paid too much for Actavis, prompting Chief Executive Erz Vigodman’s resignation in February and his temporary replacement by Chairman Yitzhak Peterburg, while Chief Financial Officer Eyal Desheh resigned at the end of June, again with only an interim stand-in. “People have lost faith in Teva not for what happened, but we don’t see where its going,” Eldad Tamir, head of the Tamir Fishman Investment House, said. In addition to seeking partners, Teva is responding by speeding up plans to divest non-core assets, the sources said, with long-term decisions including a possible break-up into two companies, generics and specialty drugs, only likely to be discussed after it fills its leadership vacuum. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have been asked to find buyers for Teva’s women’s health business and European oncology and pain unit, respectively. A source familiar with the divestments said that India’s Intas, which last year bought the generics business of Actavis in the UK and Ireland from Teva, is now bidding for specific assets within the women’s health unit, adding Teva is open to a break-up to speed up the sale. This means the business could be sold in two or three chunks with its U.S. and international operations being chopped and some products like contraceptive drugs Plan B and Paragard being carved out and sold separately, the sources said. The oncology business could also be broken up as industry players are mainly interested in pure cancer drugs while pain treatment medicine, which is being offered as part of the same deal, is seen as less attractive, the sources said. The prospect of a piecemeal deal has drawn interest from private equity funds including Advent and TPG, the sources said. Fresenius, Mylan and Advent declined to comment while Intas Advent and TPG were not immediately available for comment. Teva is also considering options for its respiratory treatments business as part of a review of its entire portfolio, the sources said. It recently decided to part ways with Iceland-based Medis, a supplier of development work to third-party drugmakers, which one source said could fetch about $500 million. Some shareholders have called on Teva to either split into two or sell off its generics business completely. “Teva should get out of generics. It means splitting the company of course, selling the generics in pieces and focusing on specialty drugs,” Benny Landa, an entrepreneur who in 2014 led an investor bid to shake up Teva’s board, said. Teva should become more like research-focused Novartis NOVM.S and its generics unit Sandoz, which are run as two separate firms, he added. But such changes could be slowed by Teva’s articles of association. These were designed to prevent a hostile takeover and include provisions that limit the number of board members to be replaced per year to a third of all seats. Teva’s problems also stem in large part from its specialty business. Its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone had contributed much of Teva’s revenue and profit, but its patent has run out and now is facing generic competition. Teva had no other drugs to take its place, although it has a pipeline of 21 specialty medicines for migraine, Huntington’s Disease, pain, respiratory and neurology in various stages of development, from early stage clinical trials to drugs already registered and awaiting regulatory approval.

 ,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"BUSIA, Uganda (Reuters) - The number of South Sudanese refugees in Uganda hit one million on Thursday, the United Nations said, as hundreds of desperate families pour across the border every day seeking a haven from the civil war. The conflict in South Sudan has created Africa’s biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and U.N. agencies are receiving a fraction of the cash they need to provide food and shelter. But the crowds keep flowing across rickety wooden bridges near the northwestern Ugandan border town of Busia, staggering under the weight of babies and a few pots or bundles of clothing balanced on their heads. Women and children make up more than 85 percent of the arrivals. “Two weeks ago my husband’s uncle was killed,” said Stella Taji, as she trudged barefoot over the bridge, a toddler clinging to her hand. “Since then we’ve been hiding in the bush. We have nothing.” Oil-rich South Sudan became the world’s youngest nation in 2011, upon its independence from neighboring Sudan, but the elation soon evaporated amid corruption and ethnic divisions. Troops loyal to President Salva Kiir, a Dinka, and forces under former vice president Riek Machar, from the Nuer ethnic group, have battled each other since late 2013, killing tens of thousands and forcing nearly a third of the population of 12 million to flee their homes. The trickle of refugees into Uganda swelled into a river last year after a shaky Western-backed peace deal between Kiir and Machar collapsed within months. The conflict has further fragmented since, breeding a patchwork of militias and briefly plunging parts of the country into famine this year. No one knows how many have died, but an August report by South Africa-based South Sudan Human Rights Observatory said 987 civilians were killed in violence across South Sudan between May and July, mostly by government forces. “They are slaughtering people with knives,” said Samuel Amule, who trekked for two days to the border to escape government attacks. “They say, ‘If you are staying here, you are a rebel.’” The U.N. says homes have been burned with families locked inside, gang rapes are common and boys are often kidnapped to be child soldiers. Gunmen, including South Sudanese rebels, rob those trying to escape. In Uganda, South Sudanese refugees receive hot meals, vaccinations, and plots of land. All can enter and they are free to travel and work in Uganda, policies that have drawn praise from aid groups. “The government response to accepting the South Sudanese refugees has been overwhelmingly positive, progressive, and welcoming,” said Sacha Manov, deputy director in Uganda for the International Rescue Committee, which provides health and protection services for refugees. But refugee agency UNHCR said Uganda was struggling to provide food and shelter. Donor nations have not given enough, with the U.N. agency having received just about 21 percent of the $674 million needed for South Sudanese refugees in Uganda in 2017, its spokesman, Charlie Yaxley, said. “That’s leaving significant gaps in the abilities of the humanitarian response to deliver lifesaving assistance and also key basic services,” he added. In Amugo camp, new arrivals sleep under loose white tarpaulins as they lack the tools to build proper shelters. Latrines are unfinished, forcing refugees to use nearby forests as toilets. In May, a cash crunch forced the U.N. to slash food rations in half, to 6 kg (13 lb) of maize. They have since been restored but funding remains tenuous. There is no end in sight to the conflict; international peacemaking efforts have stalled, said South Sudan analyst Alan Boswell. The United States, which played a key role previous negotiations, has not yet appointed a top official for Africa. “It’s been two years since the last serious political process,” said Boswell. “There is none on the horizon.” ","

 ,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - South Korea lifted a ban on imports of U.S. poultry and eggs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Thursday, allowing American farmers to resume sales to the Asian country that suffered an egg shortage caused by its worst-ever bird flu outbreak. South Korea was importing more U.S. eggs earlier this year as it fought its own outbreak of bird flu. But in March, the country limited U.S. poultry imports after the first U.S. case of bird flu of the year was detected on a commercial chicken farm in Tennessee. Prior to that, Americans “were putting table eggs in there like they were going out of style,” said Jim Sumner, president of the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council, a trade group. “They are in desperate need still,” he said. South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, was hit hard by the deadly H5N8 bird flu strain after the first case was confirmed in November, leading to a record culling of more than 37 million farm birds, more than a fifth of its total poultry population. Last month, South Korea’s government downgraded its bird flu alert by one notch from the highest level, after more than a month passed without new cases. South Korea bans U.S. poultry imports when the United States detects any cases of bird flu. The USDA is now working to convince South Korean officials to limit future restrictions on shipments to the geographic regions in which the virus is detected. “Korea’s lifting of its most recent ban is an important move for our poultry and egg industries, but it is still just the first step,” USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement. In 2014, the last full year without any bird flu-related U.S. trade restrictions in place, South Korea purchased $122 million in U.S. poultry products, including eggs, making it the United States’ tenth-largest market, according to the USDA. Last year, South Korea’s imports from all countries exceeded $350 million in 2016, but only $39 million came from the United States. ","

 ,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thousands of people uprooted by violence in Central African Republic are taking refuge in a hospital after armed groups looted and burned a camp for the displaced, medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said on Thursday. At least 10,000 people are staying on the grounds of the hospital in the town of Batangafo - 400 kilometres (250 miles) north of the capital Bangui - nearly two weeks after fighting broke out between rival groups, according to the charity. The camp for the displaced was attacked and several aid groups were looted during two waves of violence which left 24 people dead and 17 injured as of the start of August, MSF said. “The people taking refuge in the hospital ... are still unable to rebuild their shelters in the camp,” MSF project coordinator Carlos Francisco said in a statement. The medical charity said it was providing basic water and sanitation services for the displaced, and that health services were running as normal after being disrupted by the fighting. “Much of the general population is in a state of complete helplessness,” Francisco added. “Imagine what the situation must be like when people think that the only safe option left to them is a hospital ... knowing that not even hospitals are safe.” Hospitals in the southeastern towns of Bangassou and Zemio have been targeted by militant groups in recent months - with armed men abducting two patients who were later found dead, and shooting and killing a baby being held by its mother, MSF said. Six Red Cross volunteers were killed last week in an attack on a health centre in southeastern Gambo, the aid group said, adding that civilians and health workers may have also died. Thousands have died and a fifth of Central Africans - nearly 1 million - have fled their homes in an ethnic and religious conflict that broke out after mainly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in 2013, provoking a backlash from Christian militias. Militia violence has intensified across Central African Republic this year as splinter groups clash over control of land and resources, sparking fears of a return to the large-scale chaos that gripped the country at the peak of a 2013 civil war. United Nations aid chief Stephen O’Brien on Monday told a U.N. briefing that the “warning signs of genocide are there”. O’Brien last month told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the country has “the worst level of humanitarian needs per capita’, as about one in two people - 2.2 million - need aid. ","

 ,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"DANDONG, China (Reuters) - Undeterred by escalating tensions between Pyongyang and Washington rattling nerves globally, a steady stream of tourists from China each morning passes through the immigration checkpoint at the border trading hub of Dandong. Greeting them on the North Korean side are dozens of tour buses, collecting them for itineraries ranging from a day in neighbouring Sinijiu to a week visiting North Korea’s main cities, including the capital Pyongyang. “We’re curious. We want to see how they live,” Xu Juan said on Thursday before crossing the Yalu River, which marks the border between the two countries. Xu was travelling with friends and family from Hangzhou, in eastern China. “I just want the sense of nostalgia, to see a country that is poor, like (China was) when I was young,” said a man in his early 50s, from Jilin province, declining to give his name. Few expressed concern over the North’s persistent missile tests in recent months, which led the United Nations Security Council on Saturday to impose tough new sanctions against Pyongyang. North Korea dismissed on Thursday warnings by U.S. President Donald Trump that it would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States as a “load of nonsense”, and outlined plans for a missile strike near the Pacific territory of Guam. But tour operators said their industry remains robust. Traffic, especially on lower-end group tours, has grown steadily to one of the world’s most isolated states over the past few years, despite North Korea’s persistent nuclear and missile tests, which have drawn ever-tightening U.N. sanctions. A flyer for the one-day tour to Sinijiu tout a trip to the city’s central plaza, where you can pay respects to a bronze statue of North Korea’s founding president Kim il-Sung, as well as visits to a cosmetics factory, a revolutionary history museum, art history museum and a cultural park. “You can feast on the North Korean speciality food by warm and hospitable North Koreans,” it says. China’s tourism authority has not published a breakdown of the total number of Chinese visitors to North Korea since 2012, when it said 237,000 made the trip. But the number travelling just from Dandong spiked to 580,000 in the second half of 2016 alone, according to the state-run China News Service. The report said 85 percent of Chinese tourist visits to North Korea originated from Dandong. That’s still only a fraction of the 8 million Chinese who visited South Korea in 2016. Tourists can take ferries or charter speedboats down the Yalu for an up-close peek at North Korean villages and patrolling border guards. One tour operator targeting wealthier, more adventurous travellers said it was receiving more inquiries in recent weeks over whether it was safe to travel. “But those that inquire often already have their heart set on going,” the operator, who declined to be named, told Reuters. “The idea of a bit of danger adds to the thrill and mystery of North Korea.” Another tour guide, Teng Yi, said that while some may be deterred by tensions on the Korean peninsula, it was prompting others to get to North Korea while they still can. “There have been quite a few tourists in my groups who say they want to see North Korea in its reclusive state while they can,” he said. “It won’t be the same if the regime collapses.” ","

,08172017,Investopedia,08102017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Gardening leave refers to the period during which an employee, who is in the process of terminating their employment, stays away from the workplace or works from home or another location during their notice period. The employee remains on the payroll but is neither permitted to go to work nor to commence any other employment whilst on gardening leave. Gardening leave is a term most commonly used in the UK. Because gardening leave often prevents the employee from involvement in any work for their current employer, and typically restricts them from either taking on another job or working for themselves, an employee is likely to spend their time pursuing hobbies such as gardening. Gardening leave is sometimes considered to be a euphemism for being suspended, and can be perceived to have negative connotations, such as the employee being unfit for anything other than tending their garden. Following the resignation or dismissal of an employee, an employer may decide to place the employee on gardening leave. The primary reason for doing so is to safe-guard against possible detrimental actions or behavior that the employee might indulge in during his or her notice period. The employer may fear that the employee could be uncooperative, or that they may negatively influence the working environment and other employees. The employer may also prefer that the employee limit contact with clients for fear that the employee may persuade the clients to follow the employee to his or her new employer. Another reason for implementing a gardening leave is that the employee may have access to up-to-date information which could be beneficial to the employer’s competitors. Placing an employee on gardening leave could help to ensure that by the time the employee is contractually free, he or she would have been out of the loop long enough to reduce this threat. Gardening leave can be an employer’s way of taking the employee off the market for a period of time, which is why some employers may opt for this method, rather than ending the employment abruptly with a cash settlement in lieu of notice. An employee is entitled to their salary and benefits during gardening leave, but depending on their employment contract, may not be eligible for bonuses or accrual payments. It is typical, during gardening leave, for an employee to be prevented from accessing the employer’s data and computer system, and to be prohibited from contacting clients, suppliers, or fellow employees. The employee will usually be required to return company property such as laptops, smart phones, or vehicles while on gardening leave. During the period of gardening leave, the employee is required to be available if the employer wants them to provide information, support, or even to resume working. For this reason, an employee should not plan to travel during gardening leave, unless approved by his or her current employer. Furthermore, an employer may compel the employee to take any accrued holiday time during the period of gardening leave. While the name gardening leave may sound pleasant, and in fact an employee may sometimes prefer to serve their notice time relaxing at home rather than being in the workplace, the restrictive nature and negative implications of this leave can make it less than ideal.

Placing an employee on gardening leave could help to ensure that by the time the employee is contractually free, he or she would have been out of the loop long enough to reduce this threat. Gardening leave can be an employer’s way of taking the employee off the market for a period of time, which is why some employers may opt for this method, rather than ending the employment abruptly with a cash settlement in lieu of notice. An employee is entitled to their salary and benefits during gardening leave, but depending on their employment contract, may not be eligible for bonuses or accrual payments. It is typical, during gardening leave, for an employee to be prevented from accessing the employer’s data and computer system, and to be prohibited from contacting clients, suppliers, or fellow employees. The employee will usually be required to return company property such as laptops, smart phones, or vehicles while on gardening leave. During the period of gardening leave, the employee is required to be available if the employer wants them to provide information, support, or even to resume working. For this reason, an employee should not plan to travel during gardening leave, unless approved by his or her current employer. Furthermore, an employer may compel the employee to take any accrued holiday time during the period of gardening leave. While the name gardening leave may sound pleasant, and in fact an employee may sometimes prefer to serve their notice time relaxing at home rather than being in the workplace, the restrictive nature and negative implications of this leave can make it less than ideal.

Dan Mangan,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"The Trump administration refused Monday to commit to partnering with outside groups to promote enrollment in Obamacare health plans, potentially reversing four years of those cooperative efforts. The administration's stance, coupled with its similar refusal to commit to key Obamacare subsidies to insurers through next year, could result in fewer people signing up for health coverage in the individual insurance plans for 2018 after open enrollment starts in November. And if those subsidies, known as cost-sharing reduction payments, are ended, insurers could end up charging individual plan customers much higher premiums next year. For the past four years each fall, the Obama administration had coordinated its open-enrollment promotion efforts with a wide array of churches, advocacy groups and private companies. Those efforts seemed to be at risk with the election of avowed Obamacare opponent Donald Trump as president last November. Trump was inaugurated shortly before the end of open enrollment in individual health plans for 2017. The federal Health and Human Services Department, which had been Obamacare's biggest booster, immediately began reversing enrollment promotion efforts for the little time that remained in the sign-up season. That pullback may have contributed to the first-ever drop in enrollment in Obamacare plans. On Monday, a story on the news site Talking Points Memo reported there was no sign that the Trump administration would work with outside groups this fall to encourage people to sign up for health insurance for 2018. That's despite the fact the Affordable Care Act requires nearly all Americans to have some form of health insurance or pay a tax penalty. Amanda Hooper, the National Women's Law Center's director of engagement and mobilization, told CNBC that ""we have no indication from them that there will be reach out,"" as the Obama administration did with that organization every year since 2013. ""It is the silence that is speaking volumes,"" said Hooper, noting that the Obama administration would start reaching out to the law center and other groups in the summer to prepare for the fall enrollment season. ""We are very interested in hearing what their plans are,"" Hooper said of the Trump administration. CNBC reached out to HHS and asked whether the Trump administration would end the long-standing partnership, and, if so, why. In response, HHS spokeswoman Alleigh Marrè said, ""As Obamacare continues to collapse, the administration is considering its options on how to address the challenges Americans are facing by cancelled plans, higher costs, and failing markets."" Hooper said that even if the Trump administration doesn't want help from the National Women's Law Center in boosting Obamacare enrollment, the group will continue outreach efforts on its own to potential insurance customers. ""We will be sure to get the message to clarify for people that [Obamacare] is still here, and you should still sign up ... we will let people know when to sign up,"" Hooper said. ""Obamacare is the law of the land."" She said that in past years her group, which received no federal funding for its Obamacare promotion efforts, worked in tandem with other advocacy groups to encourage sign-ups. One example of that was a Facebook Live event in December hosted by the NWLC, with participation from the Center for American Progress, the National Partnership for Women and Families, and Raising Women's Voices, as well as two members of the Obama administration. ""The video reached 168,000 people and has been viewed 16,000 times,"" Hooper said. In addition to being coy about its open-enrollment promotion strategy, the Trump administration has refused to say whether the cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments will continue being made to insurers through 2018. Those CSR payments, worth billions of dollars, compensate insurers for discounts in out-of-pocket health-care charges offered to low- and middle-income Obamacare customers. Trump has threatened to end the CSR payments. But if the payments end, insurers would still be legally responsible for giving the discounts to qualified customers, cutting into the insurers' bottom lines. That, in turn, would lead insurers to seek higher premiums from customers to cover their operating costs. Late last week, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees Obamacare, gave insurers almost three extra weeks to submit their proposed prices for individual 2018 plans because of the lack of certainty about the CSRs. The new deadline for proposed Obamacare premiums is now Sept. 5. Meanwhile, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to release a report Tuesday that will outline the risks of terminating the CSR payments. The analysis, which is being done in conjunction with the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, will look at the impact on the federal budget, health insurance coverage, market stability and premiums. The Cleveland Plain Dealer on Saturday reported that insurers in Ohio have begun filing new, much-higher premium rate increase requests with state regulators in case Trump ends the CSR payments. The newspaper noted that insurers already were asking for price hikes averaging 20 percent or more for next year. But the state insurance department asked for new requests that assume an end to CSR payments, as well as other factors. One insurer, Molina Healthcare of Ohio, said last week that it wants to add an extra 21.4 percent average price increase on top of its existing request of a 24 percent increase, according to the Plain Dealer. Paramount Insurance filed an average rate hike of 35.9 percent assuming an end to the CSRs, and Summa said it would need to raise prices of its most popular individual plans by an average of 41.1 percent, the newspaper said.

Patti Domm,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"Talks that could set the tone for every other trade deal during the Trump administration start Wednesday, when Mexican and Canadian officials sit down in Washington to discuss the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement that President Donald Trump had one time vowed to tear up. Analysts say the odds are good the three sides will successfully update NAFTA by next year. Just resolving the technology issues alone will be a huge undertaking, since the agreement was written when cellphones were close to the size of a brick and there was no digital economy. At the crux of the talks, initiated by the U.S., is Trump's concern that the U.S. has not been fairly treated under NAFTA, and China has been able to use the agreement as a backdoor to slip its goods into North America. One sore point for Trump has been that Mexico is running a more than $60 billion trade surplus with the U.S. ""For Mexico and Canada, a lot of their trade really is dependent on the U.S. Canada is the U.S. top trading partner, and after that it would be China. There's a lot at stake here. We've seen how the Trump administration negotiates. They kind of present the stick first and the carrot later,"" said Dana Peterson, U.S. and Canada economist at Citigroup. The U.S. had a $12.5 billion surplus with Canada in 2016, and it traded $628 billion in goods and services with the U.S. last year, compared with Mexico's $580 billion. The negotiations are also a major test for the Trump administration, which has failed so far to win a legislative victory at home. ""I think as the administration struggle to put points on the political scoreboard, there's going to be a lot of focus on the renegotiation of NAFTA as a key indicator to move their agenda forward,"" said Jonathan Lieber, head of Eurasia Group's U.S. practice. Lieber said the problem for the Trump administration is it will be hard to look like a winner on a new NAFTA deal. ""If they put barriers on Mexican exports, they're going to have members of Congress condemning what they've done. It's going to be hard for them to spin it into a political victory,"" he said. Analysts say the U.S. wish list for NAFTA looks a lot like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was a trade agreement that Trump opposed as a candidate and then threw out once he became president. The 12-nation deal included countries in the Western Hemisphere but also partners in Asia like Japan and Singapore. ""I think the likely outcome based on the body language so far is they get a minor rewrite of NAFTA to include some of the TPP-like rules,"" said Lieber. The sectors that benefited the most from NAFTA are the automotive, agricultural and energy industries and they stand to lose the most of it falls apart. The automotive industry supply chain spans the three countries, with Mexico now a huge producer of both cars and parts. Peterson said the best case is that the negotiations wind up in six to eight sessions by December, and then be fast tracked so that it would be adopted before both the U.S. and Mexican elections next year. ""The worst-case scenario, which we assign a 10 percent probability, is someone exits, or the U.S. backs out,"" Peterson said. Timing is also critical since the Mexican election next year could result in a different party in control that might decide to scuttle the talks, and there's also congressional elections in the U.S. ""For Mexico, the main objective is to continue guaranteeing that Mexico has market access to the United States,"" said Juan Carlos Hartasanchez, senior director at Albright Stonebridge. He said Mexico wants to protect what is now in place in terms of no tarrifs, quotas or managed trade. There are a few potential hurdles to a deal. One is a U.S. demand to change the way disputes are resolved. Instead of going to a panel made up of representatives of the three countries, U.S. negotiators are seeking to change the rule and open the door for resolution elsewhere, including U.S. courts. Canada and Mexico disagree. ""The Trump administration wants to have all options to protect U.S. trade,"" said Peterson. If the rule is changed, countries might then slap tariffs on offenders even before the cases are resolved. The U.S. would also like to raise the level of duty-free import limits for e-commerce to the U.S. level of $800. Current threshold for Mexico is $50 and for Canada, just $20. Canadian retailers worry that e-commerce vendors will offer cheaper prices, and Mexicans are concerned such a move would open the door for cheap imports from Asia. This would be favorable for eBay and Amazon if adopted. Another concern for Mexico and Canada is the U.S. push to put America first, and buy American. ""[Canada] wants greater access to government procurement contracts while the U.S. wants to restrict it and focus more on producing goods and services within the U.S. with people in the U.S.,"" Peterson said. Canada also opposes U.S. efforts to limit the free flow of workers across borders, and the U.S. is complicating its relationship with Mexico by moving ahead with efforts to build a wall on the border, to help bar immigrants from entering. The U.S. would also like to refocus the country of origin rules, which now require 40 percent content to be made in the country. ""If you look at the U.S. objections in detail, they discuss rules of origin by stating that the new rules of origin should be reviewed to guarantee U.S. and North American products. They focus first on the U.S. which would be first thing for bilateral but you're trying to strengthen the region. If they push toward U.S. rules of origin that might complicate the negotiations,"" said Hartasanchez. ""If the conversation from the U.S. focuses on trying to reduce that trade deficit, through limiting, or high and unrealistic rules of origination, then we could be in a pretty bad situation. Mexico will have no other alternative than to walk away from the negotiations altogether,"" Hartasanchez said. As part of the TPP, Mexico had agreed to environmental and labor changes that could put it more on par with the U.S., and Lieber said this could be a positive opening. In Mexico, ""The infrastructure has improved but the wages haven't so you still have employees in Michigan making $30 an hour with health-care benefits competing against someone making $5 in Mexico without health care,"" Lieber said. ""If you can upscale some of the environmental rules you have in Canada and the United States, in Mexico, then suddenly you have a more level playing field for workers in the three countries."" There is also friction between the U.S. and Canada over dairy products and soft lumber, which the U.S. is now taxing at the border. ""The U.S. objects to Canada having subsidies for dairy. Canada's argument has been the amount of U.S. exports to Canada are five times what Canada is shipping to the U.S.,"" Peterson said. ",NAFTA talks are a major trade test for Trump

Christine Wang,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"President Donald Trump took questions from the press in a combative news conference on Tuesday. The president defended his response to the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. He reverted to his original argument blaming all sides, a position that drew bipartisan criticism. Read the question-and-answer portion of the press conference below. Reporter: Why do you think these CEOs are leaving your manufacturing council? Trump: Because they are not taking their job seriously as it pertains to this country. We want jobs, manufacturing in this country. If you look at some of those people that you're talking about, they're outside of the country. They're having a lot of their product made outside. If you look at Merck as an example. Take a look where — excuse me, excuse me. Take a look at where their product is made. It's made outside of our country. We want products made in the country. Now, I have to tell you, some of the folks that will leave, they are leaving out of embarrassment because they make their products outside and I've been lecturing them, including the gentleman that you're referring to, about you have to bring it back to this country. You can't do it necessarily in Ireland and all of these other places. You have to bring this work back to this country. That's what I want. I want manufacturing to be back into the United States so that American workers can benefit. Reporter: Why did you wait so long to put that last statement out? Trump: I didn't wait long. I didn't wait long. I didn't wait long. Reporter: It was at least 48 hours. Trump: I wanted to make sure — unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct. Not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement. But you don't make statements that direct unless you know the fact. It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don't know the facts, and it's a very, very important process to me, and it's a very important statement, so I don't want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts. If you go back to — I brought it. I brought it. I brought it. As I said — remember this, Saturday — we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence. It has no place in America, and then I went on from there. Now, here's the thing. Excuse me, excuse me. Take it nice and easy. Here's the thing. When I make a statement, I like to be correct. I want the facts. This event just happened. In fact, a lot of the event didn't even happen yet, as we were speaking. This event just happened. Before I make a statement, I need the facts, so I don't want to rush into a statement. So, making the statement when I made it was excellent. In fact, the young woman, who I hear is a fantastic young woman — and it was on NBC — her mother wrote me and said — through I guess Twitter, social media — the nicest things, and I very much appreciated that. I hear she was a fine, really actually an incredible young woman. But her mother on Twitter thanked me for what I said. And honestly, if the press were not fake and if it was honest, the press would have said what I said was very nice. But unlike you and unlike — excuse me — unlike you and unlike the media, before I make a statement I like to know the facts. Trump: They don't. They don't. Trump: Listen, how about- how about a couple of infrastructure questions? Reporter: Was that terrorism, that event? Was that terrorism? Trump: Say it. What? Reporter: The CEO of Wal-Mart said you missed a critical opportunity to help bring the country together. Did you? Trump: Not at all. I think the country — look, you take a look. I've created over a million jobs since I'm president. The country is booming, the stock market is setting records. We have the highest employment numbers we've ever had in the history of our country. We're doing record business. We have the highest levels of enthusiasm. So, the head of Wal-Mart, whom I know, who is a very nice guy, was making a political statement. I mean, I do it the same way. You know why? Because I want to make sure, when I make a statement that the statement is correct, and there was no way — there was no way of making a correct statement that early. I had to see the facts, unlike a lot of reporters — unlike a lot of reporters. I know, David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts, and the facts as they started coming out were very well-stated. In fact, everybody said his statement was beautiful. If he would have made it sooner, that would have been good. I couldn't have made it sooner because I didn't know all of the facts. Frankly, people still don't know all of the facts. It was very important — excuse me, excuse me. It was very important to me to get the facts out and correctly, because if I would have made a fast statement — and the first statement was made without knowing much other than what we were seeing. The second statement was made with knowledge, with great knowledge. There's still things — excuse me, there's still things that people don't know. I want to make a statement with knowledge. I wanted to know the facts. Okay. Reporter: Two questions. Was this terrorism and can you tell us how you're feeling about your chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Trump: Well, I think the driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family and this country, and that is ... you can call it terrorism. You can call it murder. You can call it whatever you want. I would just call it as the fastest one to come up with a good verdict. That's what I'd call it. Because there is a question. Is it murder? Is it terrorism? And then you get into legal semantics. The driver of the car is a murderer and what he did was a horrible, horrible inexcusable thing. Reporter: Can you tell us how you're feeling about your chief strategist, Mr. Bannon? Can you talk about that? Trump: Go ahead. Reporter: I would echo Maggie's question. Steve Bannon has- Trump: I never spoke to Mr. Bannon about it. Reporter: Can you tell us broadly — do you still have confidence in Steve? Trump: Well, we'll see. Look, I like Mr. Bannon, he's a friend of mine, but Mr. Bannon came on very late — you know that. I went through 17 senators, governors and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that, and I like him, he's a good man. He is not a racist, I can tell you that. He's a good person, he actually gets a very unfair press in that regard. But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon, but he's a good person and I think the press treats him frankly very unfairly. Reporter: Do you have confidence in him? Another reporter: John McCain has called on you to defend your national security adviser H.R. McMaster. Trump: I have already done it. I did it the last time. Reporter: And he called on you again to — Trump: Senator McCain? You mean the one who voted against Obamacare? Reporter: And he said- Trump: Who is senator- You mean Senator McCain who voted against us getting good health care? Reporter: Senator McCain said that the alt-right is behind these attacks, and he linked that same group to those who perpetrated the attack in Charlottesville. Trump: Well, I don't know. I can't tell you. I'm sure Senator McCain must know what he's talking about. But when you say the alt-right...uh, define alt-right to me. You define it. Go ahead. Trump: No, define it for me. Come on, let's go. Reporter: Senator McCain defined them as the same groups. Trump: OK. What about the alt-left that came charging at- Trump: Excuse me, what about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right. Do they have any semblance of guilt? Trump: Let me ask you this. What about the fact they came charging — that they came charging, with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do. So, you know, as far as I'm concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day- Trump: Wait a minute. I'm not finished. I'm not finished, fake news. That was a horrible day. Reporter: Is it the same level as neo-Nazis? Trump: I will tell you something. I watched those very closely, much more closely than you people watched it, and you have- You had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now. You had a group, you had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit and they were very, very violent. Trump: Go ahead. Reporter: Do you think what you call the alt-left is the same as neo-Nazis? Trump: Those people, all of those people- excuse me. I've condemned neo-Nazis. I've condemned many different groups, but not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists, by any stretch. Reporter: Well, white nationalists- Trump: Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue of Robert E. Lee. So … Excuse me. And you take a look at some of the groups and you see and you'd know it if you were honest reporters — which in many cases you're not. But many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. So, this week it's Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder is it George Washington next week and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself where does it stop? But they were there to protest- excuse me. you take a look the night before, they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of the Robert E. Lee. Infrastructure question. Go ahead. Reporter: Should statues of Robert E. Lee stay up? Trump: I would say that's up to a local town, community, or the federal government depending on where it is located. Reporter: Are you against the Confederacy? Another reporter: How concerned are you about race relations in America and do you think things have gotten worse or better since you took office? Trump: I think they have gotten better- or the same- I- look. They've been frayed for a long time, and you can ask President Obama about that because he'd make speeches about it. But, I believe that the fact that I brought in, it will be soon, millions of jobs — you see where companies are moving back into our country — I think that's going to have a tremendous positive impact on race relations. We have companies coming back into our country, we have two car companies that just announced, we have FoxConn in Wisconsin just announced. We have many companies, I say pouring back into the country. I think that's going to have a huge, positive impact on race relations. You know why? It's jobs. What people want now, they want jobs. They want great jobs with good pay and, when they have that, you watch how race relations will be. And I'll tell you, we're spending a lot of money on the inner cities. We're fixing the inner cities. We're doing far more than anybody's done with respect to the inner cities. It's a priority for me, and it's very important. Reporter: Mr. President, are you putting what you're calling the alt-left and white supremacists on the same moral plane? Trump: I'm not putting anybody on a moral plane. What I'm saying is this: You had a group on one side and you had a group on the other and they came at each other with clubs and it was vicious and it was horrible and it was a horrible thing to watch, but there is another side. There was a group on this side — you can call them the left, you've just called them the left — that came violently attacking the other group, so you can say what you want but that's the way it is. Reporter: Mr. President, your words- Another reporter: You said there was hatred, there was violence on both sides. Are there- Trump: Well, I do think there's blame- Yes. I do think there's blame on both sides. You look at both sides. I think there's blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it and you don't have any doubt about it either and- and- and- and if you reported it accurately, you would say it. Reporter: Neo-Nazis started this in Charlottesville. They showed up at Charlottesville, they- Trump: Excuse me. Reporter: To protest the removal of that- Trump: [Inaudible.] You have some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group — excuse me, excuse me — I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name. Reporter: Do you support white nationalists, then? Trump: Well, George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So, will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down- Excuse me. Are we going to take down, are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him? Reporter: I do love Thomas Jefferson- Trump: OK, good. Well, are we going to take down the statue? Because he was a major slave owner. Now, are we going to take down his statue? So, you know what? It's fine. You're changing history. You're changing culture and you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned, totally. But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, OK? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly. Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people, but you also had troublemakers and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats. You got a lot of bad people in the other group, too. Reporter: Who was treated unfairly? Sir, I'm sorry I don't understand what you were saying. You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly? I just don't understand what you were saying. Trump: No. No. There were people in that rally — and I looked the night before. If you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. I'm sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day it looked like they had some rough, bad people: neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them. But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest — and very legally protest, because you know- I don't know if you know, they had a permit. The other group didn't have a permit. So, I only tell you this. There are two sides to a story. I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country, a horrible moment. But there are two sides to the country. Does anybody have a final- does anybody- you have an infrastructure question. Reporter: What makes you think you can get an infrastructure bill? You didn't get health care. You're- Trump: Well, you know, I'll tell you. We came very close with health care, unfortunately, John McCain decided to vote against it at the last minute. You'll have to ask John McCain why he did that. But we came very close to health care. We will end up getting health care. But we'll get the infrastructure and actually, infrastructure is something that I think we'll have bipartisan support on. I actually think- I actually think Democrats will go along with the infrastructure. Reporter: Mr. President, have you spoken to the family- have you spoken to the family of the victim of the car attack? Trump: No, I'll be reaching out. I'll be reaching out. Reporter: When will you be reaching out? Trump: I was very — I thought that the statement put out, the mother's statement, I thought was a beautiful statement. I must tell you, I was- it was something that I really appreciated. I thought it was terrific, and really under the- under the kind of stress that she's under and the heartache that she's under, I thought putting out that statement to me was really something I won't forget. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Reporter 1: What about the nazis who support you? Reporter 2: Do you plan on going to Charlottesville, Mr. President? Reporter 3: Do you think you're helping to heal the nation? Trump: I own a house in Charlottesville. Does anyone know I own a house in Charlottesville? Reporter: Where is it? Trump: Oh, boy, it's going to be- it's in Charlottesville, you'll see. Reporter: Is it in the winery or something? Trump: It's a- it is the winery. Trump: I mean, I know a lot about Charlottesville. Charlottesville is a great place that's been very badly hurt over the last couple of days. I own- I own actually one of the largest wineries in the United States that's in Charlottesville. Reporter: What do you think needs to be done to overcome the racial divides in this country? Trump: Well I really think jobs can have a big impact. I think if we continue to create jobs — over a million, substantially more than a million — and you can see just the other day, the car companies coming in with fox- you know, FoxConn. I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I'm- that I'm creating jobs, I think that's going to have a tremendous impact, positive impact on race relations. Reporter: And what you said today, how do you think that will impact the racial- Trump: Because people are going to be working, they're going to be making a lot of money, much more money than they ever thought possible. Reporter: -your remarks today. Trump: And the other thing, very important, I believe wages will start going up. They haven't gone up for a long time. I believe wages now, because the economy is doing so well with respect to employment and unemployment, I believe wages will start to go up.

"Tim Mullaney, special to CNBC.com",08172017,CNBC,08102017,"No matter how advanced medical technology gets, for many patients modern health care begins in a hospital emergency room and ends with an unexpectedly huge bill. On average, emergency-room bills for out-of-network care is 4.4 times higher than what Medicare allows for the same services, costing consumers more than $3 billion a year, according to a nationwide study by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Internal Medicine. Put another way, emergency medicine physician charges came to about $4 billion versus $898 million in Medicare allowable amounts. Overall, the study found that emergency departments are charging anywhere from 1.0–12.6 times ($100–$12,600) more than what Medicare pays for services. The greatest disparities were for those who lack insurance or have to go to a facility that's not in their health plan's network.  The biggest overcharges were made to poor and minority patients, and the biggest gaps between charges for Medicare and uninsured patients were at for-profit hospitals, mostly in the Southeast and Midwest, the study said. The service with the highest median markup ratio? Wound closures, at 7.0, while interpreting head CT scans had the greatest within-hospital pricing variation, with markup ratios ranging between 1.6 and 27. General internal medicine physicians had a markup rate, compared to Medicare pricing, less than half what is billed by ER physicians. For a physician review of an electrocardiogram, the median Medicare allowable rate is $16, but emergency departments charged anywhere from $18 to $317, with a median charge of $95 (or a markup ratio of 6.0), the Johns Hopkins study found. General internal medicine doctors in hospitals charged an average of $62 for the same service. For the study, researchers analyzed the Medicare billing records for 12,337 emergency medicine physicians practicing in almost 300 hospitals in all 50 states in 2013 to determine how much emergency departments billed for services compared to the Medicare allowable amount (the sum of what Medicare pays, the deductible and coinsurance that patients pay, and the amount any third party such as the patient pays). More from Modern Medicine:The data that's fueling Joe Biden's cancer moonshot Google's role in an emerging war against killer mosquitoes Crisis in America: The organ transplant shortage ER care may be the one place in the health system where consumers ask the fewest questions and get exploited on price the most, says Martin Makary, a Hopkins surgeon and professor of public health policy who was the lead investigator for the study. ""This is consistent with outlier stories we've always heard about seeking care out of network,'' Makary said. ""Generally, these patients feeling like they're being treated as if they did something wrong. We can't expect people to live within a local network bubble and never leave."" The Johns Hopkins' data tracks a troubling pattern when it comes to ER billing. Health policy journal Health Affairs found in a 2016 study that 1 in 5 inpatient emergency-room cases result in surprise bills. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey last year found that among insured, non-elderly adults struggling to pay medical bills, charges from out-of-network providers were a contributing factor one-third of the time. And 7 in 10 individuals with unaffordable out-of-network medical bills did found that the provider wasn't in their plan's network when they received care. The surprise bills are not going away. One reason: An investigation last month by the New York Times, including work done by Yale University researchers, found that some hospitals are outsourcing emergency-room services to out-of-network doctors groups and for-profit companies that aggressively hike prices. ""This is a huge problem,"" said Jenifer Bosco, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center in Boston. ""Consumers are being overcharged, sometimes exorbitantly."" The real questions for consumers are: What can they do to prevent overcharges? How can they fight back? What rights do they have that they may not know about? The advice is slightly different for insured and uninsured patients, Bosco said. Families with incomes low enough to qualify for the Medicaid expansion or for Obamacare subsidies have rights that don't always apply to wealthier patients. Here are some key steps to protect yourself. 1. Get to a nonprofit hospital, if at all possible. Depending on the emergency, this may not be practical, experts concede. But a provision of the Affordable Care Act, which wasn't yet in force in 2013, requires nonprofit hospitals to have written financial assistance policies and to limit charges for those who qualify for financial assistance to no more than the rates generally paid by other insurers, usually the Medicare rate, said Marie Watteau, a spokeswoman for the American Hospital Association. ""Hospital payments will vary because they reflect each individual hospital and the unique care needs of the patient population it serves,"" Watteau said in a statement. ""One community may have sicker patients with more chronic illness, while another may care for more uninsured patients. Drawing information that is meaningful from a uniform set of charges is challenging because hospital care is individually tailored to each patient's needs."" For single Americans making $48,284 or less, or families with incomes below $92,000, this provision can limit the amount emergency rooms can charge, making a painful accident or illness hurt your wallet less. But for-profit hospitals aren't covered by the provision, Bosco said. 2. Ask for financial counseling at the ER. Hospitals routinely have this service available, and it can be the key to learning your rights. On top of the Obamacare provision covering nonprofit hospitals, Medicaid-eligible patients are able to apply for coverage up to 10 days retroactively, Bosco said. That can cover nearly all of the unexpected bills for patients who make less than Medicaid cutoffs, about $33,900 for a family of four. (The cap varies by state.) In addition, a counselor can explain that the ACA requires that Obamacare plans cover out-of-network ER care without co-pays over and above what in-network ERs charge — it's one of the essential health benefits the law requires subsidy-eligible plans to have. Most employer-provided plans have a similar provision. 3. After you get the bill, go back to the hospital or doctor and negotiate. It's well known that providers give insurers, both private and public, big breaks on quoted rates. Uninsured or out-of-network patients initially get billed at so-called chargemaster rates. But Makary and Bosco agree that hospitals will rarely dig in to get the full price when challenged. If they do, they risk getting nothing for their services, so they are likely to cut the price and negotiate a payment plan. In addition, hospitals are getting better about prominently posting their financial-assistance policies in ERs, Bosco said. ""It's not a great solution,"" Bosco said. ""But patients with a low income can ask for the Medicare or Medicaid rate.''

"Bob Woods, special to CNBC.com",08172017,CNBC,08102017,"There is an emerging biotech movement that promises to transform medical science and radically overhaul the arduous process of bringing new drugs, foods and cosmetics to market. Teams of academic and government researchers and a handful of start-ups have created human organs-on-chips — miniaturized versions of livers, lungs, kidneys, intestines and other vital innards. The nascent science, now being evaluated by the FDA, offers a less time-consuming and costly way to test drugs, foods, cosmetics and dietary supplements for efficacy and toxicity, with the goal of vastly improving upon traditional cell culture and animal-based methods. It sounds futuristic, but it's not sci-fi. Each organ-on-a-chip, roughly the size of a AA battery, is made from a flexible, translucent polymer. Inside are tiny tubes, each less than a millimeter in diameter, lined with living human cells extracted from a particular organ. When nutrients, air, blood and test compounds, such as experimental drugs or cosmetic ingredients, are pumped through the tubes, the cells replicate some of the key functions of that organ, just as they do in the body. More from Modern Medicine:The cost of America's most expensive prescription drugs
Huge ER bills leave patients in shockScientists treat diabetes, obesity with genetically altered skin grafts Data published by FDAReview.org, a project of the nonpartisan Independent Institute, indicates that only about 1 in 10 drugs that enter clinical trials ultimately win Food and Drug Administration approval. According to the California Biomedical Research Association, it takes an average of 12 years for a drug to travel from preclinical research to the patient, at an average cost of $359 million. Do the math on the 90 percent of those drugs that don't make it and you can see the need for a revolutionary new approach. ""The current tools don't always give us the complete picture,"" said Geraldine Hamilton, president and chief scientific officer at Boston-based Emulate, a three-year-old private spin-off of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, a pioneer of organs-on-chips that has a multiyear R&D agreement with the FDA. ""When you put cells in a [petri] dish, they're in a static environment and don't interact with each other in the same way as they do in the body,"" she said, referring to a common preclinical first step. Tests on animal systems, Hamilton added, often do not accurately translate to those in humans, because of dissimilarities in our respective biologies. Emulate has combined design, engineering and biology to recreate a dynamic microenvironment housed within its organ chips. ""Think of the chip like a home away from home for an organ,"" Hamilton explained. ""We can control the way cells interact with each other by applying relevant mechanical forces."" For example, Emulate's lung chip can simulate breathing in and out. Blood and airflow are reproduced in the chip's tiny channels. Besides increasing the speed and accuracy of drug testing, organs-on-chips present a range of game-changing potentials. They can be embedded with a particular disease, such as cancer or asthma, and provide researchers with a cost-effective mini laboratory for introducing immune cells or drugs and observing reactions in real time. It's also possible to grow separate chips of a human gut, a cow gut and an insect gut and then compare how each species' intestines react to a pesticide, an implausible experiment using those actual animals. Further down the road are you-on-a-chip models containing stem cells, a key component in so-called personalized medicine, and an entire human-on-a-chip, linking every organ together to study holistic interactions between cells and tissues. Although Emulate is the first commercial organs-on-chips venture, this audacious biotech dates back to the late 1990s, when Michael Shuler, a professor at Cornell University's Department of Biomedical Engineering, coined the term ""animal-on-a-chip"" as part of his research to define the multidisciplinary field, which spans nano science, computational modeling, biomedical engineering, physiology, cell biology and surface chemistry. Shuler is now also president and CEO of Hesperos, an organ-chip start-up in Orlando, Florida. The company has developed separate cardiac and muscle chip systems and is partnering with clients to customize multi-organ chips. In 2010, Harvard's Wyss Institute, led by Donald Ingber, produced the first successful chip, a lung model. Two years later Ingber's lab was included in a public-private collaboration tasked with creating 10 different human organs-on-chips. The five-year program was backed by a $37 million grant from the federal Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Institutes of Health and the FDA. In July 2014 and still at Harvard, Ingber founded Emulate, which raised $12 million in Series A funding from private investors. Last year Hamilton and 17 others left their Ivy League confines and set up shop in downtown Boston. The company has since raised an additional $45 million in a Series B round. NIH kicked in a $2 million grant this year, bringing Emulate's total funding to $57 million. Along with a lung chip, the company has developed liver and intestine models, Hamilton reported, and is working on the next generation, including brain, kidney and skin chips. Emulate is also creating a Human Emulation System, incorporating organ chips, testing instrumentation and software to collect and analyze data. ""That will allow this technology to be democratized,"" she said, ""so it can be used by researchers across industries — pharma, food, chemical, cosmetics — government agencies and academia. This is a lab-ready system that enables automation of our product platform."" Emulate plans to make the Human Emulation System available this year but in the meantime is actively partnering with several entities to further develop the basic technology platform capabilities and applications. They're working with Johnson & Johnson on a thrombosis chip to use in developing and testing drugs to treat or prevent blood clots that cause many life-threatening diseases, the Michael J. Fox Foundation to study safety of drugs for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease and with Merck to model asthma and viral infection in the lung. ""We initially focused on the lung-on-a-chip platform,"" said Stephen Alves, director of Merck's immunology discovery group, ""to better evaluate the communication between the various cell types and disease processes of asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]. We then expanded that to include the gut-on-a-chip to evaluate gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease."" The research is still in the exploratory mode, Alves noted, ""but we have demonstrated that you can pharmacologically manipulate aspects of disease. We hope we can move from the organ to a disease model on a chip."" Among Emulate's competitors is TissUse, a German spinoff of an organs-on-chips research program at the Technical University of Berlin's Institute of Biotechnology. Unlike Emulate's single organ chips, though, TissUse is producing ones with two or four organs on each. ""We focus on how to combine different organ models so they are able to interact with each other in a systemic manner,"" said Reyk Horland, vice president of business development at the company, which is jointly funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research and private investors. TissUse currently has custom-designed products on the market for preclinical R&D, with customers free to choose which organs to put on chips. ""We want to have the first fully functional human-on-a-chip prototype combining more than 10 organ models available next year,"" Horland disclosed. While this technology is extremely promising, using organ chips in human clinical trials is still a decade or so away. Ironically, a breakthrough that should accelerate the drug-approval process is subject to the rigorous regulatory system. In fact, even before the FDA considers okaying organ chips for clinical trials on new drugs, the agency recently signed a multiyear R&D agreement with Emulate to validate its organs-on-chips technology for possible use in testing ingredients in food, cosmetics and dietary supplements. The project will begin with a liver chip. ""The liver is particularly susceptible to organ toxicity, as it is the site of toxin filtration and metabolic breakdown, so we thought that the liver chip would be an appropriate place to start,"" said Robert Sprando, director of the Division of Toxicology in the Office of Applied Research and Safety Assessment at FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, referring to liver damage. The first step, however, is to verify the technology behind organ chips, he said. ""Initially, we have to do an evaluation of the technology, because one of the questions is, how can this be used in a regulatory environment?"" Different from academic research, regulatory research has to address public health standards. The FDA's meticulous approach to organs-on-chips is emblematic of the way science moves forward from the laboratory to the marketplace — and how this new technology might quicken the pace. Indeed, Sprando's colleague, senior advisor for toxicology Suzanne Fitzpatrick, summed it up in her FDA blog post written the day the agreement with Emulate was announced: ""In some ways, science is like a recipe, in that both can go through a number of incarnations before they work. There's a lot of experimenting and tweaking, collaborating and comparing. And that's what we'll be doing at FDA with the organs-on-chips research. We're excited to be at the forefront of this groundbreaking research, which may one day be routinely used to safeguard public health.""

Andrew Ross Sorkin,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"At what point do the C.E.O.s of the largest companies in the United States tell President Trump that enough is enough? Not yet, apparently. On Monday morning, President Trump went on a tirade on against Kenneth C. Frazier, chief executive of Merck, the pharmaceuticals giant. Mr. Frazier, one of the nation's most prominent African-American chief executives, had announced through his company's Twitter account that he was resigning from the president's American Manufacturing Council in response to Mr. Trump's refusal over the weekend to immediately and directly condemn the white supremacists and neo-Nazis carrying swastika flags in Charlottesville, Va. Mr. Trump had blamed the bigotry and violence — which left one anti-bigotry protester dead — ""on all sides."" More from New York Times:Is China outsmarting America in A.I.?  Uncle Sam wants your deep neural networks'Machines of loving grace,' by John Markoff ""America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,"" Mr. Frazier said. @merck Within minutes on Monday, Mr. Trump, in far less time that it took him to react to the violence in Charlottesville, was on Twitter criticizing Mr. Frazier. @realDonaldTrump: Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! The silence from the larger C.E.O. community about Mr. Trump's reaction to the situation in Charlottesville has been remarkably conspicuous, even as one of their own has now been attacked online by the president. A few big-name corporate leaders released innocuous statements over the weekend condemning the violence by white supremacists in Charlottesville. But with the exception of Mr. Frazier, none appear to have directly condemned the president's choice of words, which have been a lightning rod for Americans from many quarters, even among many Republican lawmakers and Trump supporters. (The president said at a news conference on Monday, after a barrage of blistering criticism, that ""racism is evil."") The closest thing to a critique of Mr. Trump's language from a United States C.E.O. came from Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, who tweeted on Monday morning: @lloydblankfein: Lincoln: ""A house divided against itself cannot stand."" Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together. (Mr. Blankfein is not on any of the president's councils, which may make it easier for him to be critical.) But how can so many other American business leaders and senior executives remain quiet about the president's reaction? Where is the moral courage to stand up? After all, most companies these days spend countless hours talking about their culture and values. Just last week, Google publicly fired one of its engineers within days of his writing a memo that questioned whether ""personality differences"" between men and women led to there being fewer women engineers in the technology industry. How can people like  Adebayo O. Ogunlesi, a lead director of Goldman Sachs and an infrastructure investor, remain a member of Mr. Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum — a role highlighted on Mr. Ogunlesi's company biography? How could Mr. Ogunlesi, an immigrant from Nigeria who was a clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall of the Supreme Court, not say anything? As Justice Marshall himself famously said, ""Where you see wrong or inequality or injustice, speak out, because this is your country. This is your democracy."" Mr. Ogunlesi declined to comment, through a representative. What about Indra Nooyi, the Indian-born chief executive of PepsiCo? She is a member the president's business council and has long been a vocal advocate for minorities. The company said this year that it ""does not tolerate bigotry or hate in any form."" When I contacted her about Mr. Trump's remarks over the weekend, a spokesman directed me to a tweet that clearly didn't mention the president: @IndraNooyi: Heartbroken by the violence in #
Charlottesville. Hate and intolerance are a betrayal of what we stand for as Americans. Some people who have less at stake are going on record to support Mr. Frazier's stance against the president. Tom Glocer, the former chief executive of Thomson Reuters, wrote on Twitter on Monday: ""Ken has stood up for true American values. I call on all other members of Trump's image-burnishing committees to do the same."" Privately, many chief executives say they are fuming, outraged by the president. (This after many of them campaigned to get on Mr. Trump's committees.) But many are too scared to say anything publicly that could make them or their company a target of Mr. Trump's wrath. Indeed, Mr. Trump's vitriol against Mr. Frazier and Merck — a company that depends on the government as a buyer for many of its drugs — will perhaps have an even greater chilling effect on other C.E.O.s who may consider speaking out. (The potential for economic retribution against Merck also demonstrates just how brave Mr. Frazier was in taking a stand.) When I asked one chief executive Monday morning why he had remained publicly silent, he told me: ""Just look at what he did to Ken. I'm not sticking my head up."" Which, of course, is the reason he said I could not quote him by name. The same trepidation may explain why people like Mr. Ogunlesi don't say anything. He runs an infrastructure fund that will most likely have to do business with the federal government. And Ms. Nooyi's PepsiCo, for example, was briefly boycotted by Trump supporters when she made some comments that were construed as critical of him. Other C.E.O.s, like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, have contended that they consider it part of their patriotic duty to remain on the president's business council, even when they disagree with things Mr. Trump says or does. ""It is very hard if you say, I'm going to go off an advisory group or not do a,b,c, because you disagree on one issue,"" Mr. Dimon said in early June after Mr. Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, a move that Mr. Dimon was against. Elon Musk of Tesla and Robert Iger of Disney resigned from the council in protest. ""Honestly, no one is going to agree with every president or prime minister on every issue, so I don't want to overreact to it,"" Mr. Dimon said. Lawrence Summers, who has served as Treasury Secretary and president of Harvard University, said in response to Mr. Dimon's rationale at the time to Bloomberg News: ""At what point as a patriot is your allegiance to your country rather to your president? I've always thought of my allegiance as a patriot as being to my country."" A fair critique of the president is that he didn't immediately and directly condemn the bigoted actions over the weekend and call them out for what they were — remarks that tacitly helped normalize such hate. While C.E.O.s may call out the hate, will they have the fortitude to call out the president? ",Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier left White House. What about the other CEOs

Insurance stocks can be an excellent investment for both growth and income. While there are many dividend-paying stocks in the insurance industry, here are three -- a health insurer, a life insurer, and a specialty insurer -- that could be excellent long-term investments in your portfolio. Company Stock Symbol Recent Stock Price Dividend Yield Aetna AET $155.70 1.3% MetLife MET $48.12 3.3% Aflac AFL $81.32 2.1% Data source: TD Ameritrade. Stock prices and yields as of 8/9/17. Aetna (NYSE:AET) is a leader in the health insurance business, offering HMO, POS, and PPO products, as well as Medicare Advantage, Part D prescription drug coverage, and Medicare Supplemental plans. The company has done a fantastic job of growing, with revenue up by 84% since 2010. Image source: Getty Images. As far as Aetna's dividend goes, you'll notice that it's the smallest yield on the list, by a wide margin. For starters, the current dividend represents a payout ratio of just 21% of 2017's expected earnings, which leaves plenty of room for growth. In addition, Aetna has a $4 billion buyback authorization in effect, which represents nearly 8% of the company's outstanding shares. And finally, in addition to providing a steady stream of income, Aetna has been a phenomenal total return investment. Since 2000, Aetna has returned a staggering 2,370%, which translates to a 20% annualized return over the past 17.5 years. MetLife (NYSE:MET) recently completed its spinoff of Brighthouse Financial, which should allow the company to focus on its core businesses of group life insurance, employee benefits, international operations, and asset management. Between these categories, MetLife serves about 100 million customers and has operations in almost 50 countries around the world. MetLife is the largest U.S. life insurer, and it has one of the strongest brand names in the entire insurance industry. Furthermore, the company is uniquely positioned to benefit from job and wage growth in the United States, as this could generate rising group life insurance sales. One potential caveat -- although MetLife pays the most generous dividend yield of the three stocks discussed here, there could be a dividend reduction in store for MetLife, but not for a bad reason. 21% of last year's profits came from Brighthouse, and this may need to be compensated for now that the spinoff is complete. I'm not necessarily saying it will happen, but I wouldn't be surprised. With a dividend yield of 2.1%, Aflac (NYSE:AFL) isn't exactly a ""high dividend"" stock, but there are other reasons to love this specialized insurance company. For starters, Aflac is a Dividend Aristocrat, having raised its payout annually for more than 30 years, and with a payout ratio of just 26% of TTM earnings, there's no reason to believe the streak will end anytime soon. Aflac is a unique insurer, providing coverage for situations that most traditional insurance plans don't cover. Major products include accident insurance, short-term disability insurance, and critical illness insurance. In addition, it often surprises people not too familiar with the company to learn that the majority of Aflac's revenue comes from Japan. In a nutshell, an aging population in both of its major markets and the ongoing potential for healthcare reform in the U.S. should give Aflac opportunities to provide innovative insurance solutions going forward.

Harjes: Right. This is an industry that is growing at an incredible clip. Legal weed sales grew by 34% in North America to almost $7 billion in 2016. As you mentioned, they're on track to continue growing at this kind of double-digit rate. The cannabis research firm ArcView predicts that weed sales will grow at a compound annual rate of 26% through 2021, which gets you to that $22 billion in five years. I also saw that investment firm Cowen & Co (NASDAQ:COWN) called for $50 billion in legal cannabis sales in the United States by 2026. As you mentioned, it's pretty tough to put such a precise number on this, given that there's so much regulatory uncertainty. But as of right now, 29 states have legalized medical cannabis, and residents in another eight states have said yes to having recreational weed also be legal. So, right now, you have a humongous black market in both these legal states and also all the states where it's not legal, and it's very difficult to put numbers on how much of that a legal market would eventually be able to take. But any way you slice it, this is a gigantic opportunity. Campbell: Right. I think one of the biggest drivers of growth over the course of the next few years is going to be the passage of recreational marijuana laws last November in California, which is already the hugest market for medical marijuana, with its Emerald Triangle being one of the largest producing regions in the world of marijuana. There are already a thousand medical marijuana dispensaries operating in California, and theoretically, depending on how quickly the switch gets flipped to recreational, those could be up and running relatively quickly and providing a fairly quick ramp up for market sales. You mentioned the Cowen & Company prediction, which is just an eye-popping number, $50 billion by 2026. But, that comes with a huge caveat, and that caveat is, if recreational is legalized nationally on the federal level. Because, I think one of the things that a lot of people fail to understand is, yes, individual states are going ahead and legalizing either medical or recreational marijuana, but marijuana still remains illegal on a federal level. Harjes: Right, and that raises some interesting challenges for the businesses that are operating in this space. Marijuana stocks have been on an absolute tear because of the hype around this industry. You hear these projections and it's hard to not get excited about, ""OK, let me get in on the ground quickly, and I'm going to make millions in this."" But if you actually look at the businesses themselves, they face some inherent disadvantages. For example, because marijuana is illegal at the federal level, these businesses can't take your normal corporate income tax deductions. Meanwhile, they also have pretty limited access to basic banking services like a checking account, because a lot of the financial services don't want to have this association to businesses that are technically not doing legal business at the federal level. Campbell: Yeah. You create all sorts of risks there in the banking systems, as far as transferring money across state lines and all sorts of things. So, yes, you're talking about kind of a wild wild west rush, green rush, that we're seeing here. You have the regulatory concern. And not only is it still illegal on a federal level -- I think this is the other thing that's important for investors to recognize -- but, under President Obama, the decision was made not to get mixed up at the state level. The state said it was OK, they weren't going to enforce federally in those states. That could change under President Trump, because his attorney general is a guy named Jeff Sessions, who's been a pretty big vocal opponent to the legalization of marijuana. So, there's a lot of legislative risk and enforcement risk for these stocks. It's also still a Schedule I drug. Marijuana is still a Schedule I drug. That creates some additional risks and concerns that could limit the use of it medically, or its expansion into other states. Then, from an individual stock-picking level, there's this whole other component of, what stock do I pick? Because most of these stocks are fly by-night companies. They're started, and their shares go out on the over-the-counter market or the pink sheets. They're very high risk companies that aren't held to the same level of scrutiny for listing requirements as, say, the larger companies that are on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ. So, if you go out and you're buying these stocks, you're theoretically exposing yourself not only to the risk of picking the wrong stock, but of picking the wrong stock and having it be a fraudulent company.

Chinese companies present a potentially huge opportunity for investors, but the market in China carries unique risks and challenges that bear consideration. Here is how to invest in shares of Chinese companies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available for trading in the U.S. Image source: Getty Images. Investing in China can be a real trick as companies there carry various share classes that may or may not be accessible to the average investor outside China. For example, A shares are shares of a Chinese company that are only available to investors in mainland China. H shares, on the other hand, are shares of those companies that trade in Hong Kong and are available to anyone -- assuming your broker allows you to trade on the Hong Kong exchange. The easiest way to invest in Chinese companies, though, is to buy shares that list on an exchange here in the United States. Here is a list of the largest Chinese companies available with market capitalizations over $10 billion: Company Market Cap TTM Price-to-Earnings What the Company Does Alibaba $389 billion 61.5 China's largest e-commerce network PetroChina $205 billion 29.9 An integrated oil and energy company China Life Insurance $106 billion 29.9 A life, health, and accident insurance company operating in mainland China China Petroleum & Chemical $94 billion 11.0 An integrated oil and energy company Baidu $77 billion 48.9 China's largest internet search engine JD.com $61 billion (154.1) A leading Chinese e-commerce platform NetEase $41 billion 21.3 A leading online multimedia and services provider China Telecom $36 billion 19.1 Wireline and mobile telecom services provider Ctrip.com $27 billion 760.6 Travel and accommodation booking website Weibo $19 billion 130.5 A Chinese social network and video gaming platform Huaneng Power $12 billion 15.0 A leading utility company Yum China Holdings $14 billion 27.2 KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell in China and the largest restaurant chain New Oriental Education & Technology $13 billion 49.6 A private education services provider China Eastern Airlines $13 billion 11.0 Airline and transportation services Aluminum Corporation of China $12 billion 98.2 Chinese manufacturer of aluminum products China Southern Airlines $11 billion 12.7 Airline and transportation services ZTO Express $10 billion 29.9 Delivery and logistics provider in China Data sources: Yahoo! Finance. TTM = trailing 12 months. In addition, some companies, such as China's largest social network owner, Tencent Holdings, are available on over-the-counter markets. In all, some 300 Chinese companies can be traded in some way stateside. The work in filtering through those can be difficult, but an easier option also exists. There are dozens of Chinese ETFs that have popped up over the years, covering everything from debt to specific industries operating in mainland China. If you're looking for broad exposure to the Chinese stock market, though, here is the list you should start with: Fund Fund Total Net Assets Expense Ratio Fund Composition iShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ:MCHI) $2.58 billion 0.61% The fund holds shares of Chinese companies that are available to all international investors. PowerShares Golden Dragon China ETF (NASDAQ:PGJ) $186 million 0.70% The fund is composed of Chinese companies whose shares are listed on a U.S. exchange. DB X-Trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (NYSEMKT:ASHR) $487 million 0.65% The fund holds A shares of the largest 300 Chinese companies that only trade on a Chinese exchange. Data sources: iShares, PowerShares, and Deutsche Bank. When investing in Chinese stock ETFs, investors have three basic choices: stocks listed on Chinese stock exchanges, international investor shares, and companies specifically listed on U.S. exchanges. The DB X-Trackers fund, which holds Chinese exchange-listed companies, has had the wildest performance due to the bubble-and-bust China market of 2015. Because of the extra risk involved, owning shares in China's fast-developing and changing mainland economy may not be the best route to take for the faint of heart. Data by YCharts. Of the two funds that own shares of companies listed outside of the Chinese stock exchanges -- iShares MSCI China ETF and PowerShares Golden Dragon China ETF -- PowerShares Golden Dragon and the companies it owns listed in the U.S. have fared better. Some, but not all, of that has to do with the extra risk with fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. Listing on major U.S. exchanges has also helped moderate the roller-coaster movements that investing in an emerging economy can present. For investors who want to bet on the future of the Chinese economy, there are plenty of options. There are more individual companies than ever available for trading for those of you who don't mind the homework, and a myriad of ETFs can help you get broad exposure to the whole market. Whichever option you go with, be prepared for a roller-coaster ride as China's economy continues to modernize. ","

After a complaint was filed in federal court alleging that Dunkin' Brands' (NASDAQ:DNKN) Dunkin' Donuts' steak sandwiches do not actually contain ""steak,"" a new suit makes similar charges about its blueberry bakery items. The lawsuit, which was filed in United States District Court in the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division, was filed by attorneys for Bartosz Grabowski ""and on behalf of all others similarly situated."" It seeks class action status. The plaintiff claims that the coffee chain's various blueberry-named bakery products, including Glazed Blueberry doughnuts, Blueberry Butternut doughnuts, and Blueberry Crumb Cake doughnuts, contain imitation blueberries ""that highly resemble actual blueberries due to their round shape and blue color."" Lawyers claim that if their client had known the products did not contain blueberries, he either would not have purchased them or would have paid significantly less for the products. They seek in excess of $5 million to remedy the situation. Dunkin' Donuts does not list blueberries as an ingredient in its blueberry doughnuts. Image source: Getty Images. While Dunkin' Donuts lists blueberries as an ingredient in its blueberry muffins, none of its blueberry doughnuts list the fruit as an ingredient. The company's various ""blueberry"" doughnut flavors appear to use a mix of non-fruit ingredients to simulate blueberries in the baked treats. The lawsuit charges that this is an attempt to deceive consumers. Through its manufacturing, marketing, and sale of the Blueberry Products, Defendant has represented that the Blueberry Products contain actual blueberries. Defendant has named the Blueberry Products as ""Blueberry Butternut"", ""Blueberry Crumb Cake"", and ""Glazed Blueberry"", indicating that the Blueberry Products contain actual blueberries. The lawsuit contends that blueberries have health benefits that consumers would be willing to pay more for. It also notes that when buying a doughnut in-store, consumers see the blueberry doughnuts displayed alongside other products, including various doughnuts and muffins, that contain the fruit they are named for. Food lawsuits have become common in recent years with Subway being sued over its sandwiches not being the size advertised while Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) has been sued multiple times over whether it fills its drinks properly. While Starbucks has either won its cases or seen them dismissed, Subway did have to pay up to $525,000 in attorneys fees, and take steps to ensure its 12-inch sandwiches actually measure 12 inches. In the case of the Dunkin' suit, the case is a little different because it involves whether it's OK to call a product ""blueberry"" when it contains no blueberries. There is some precedent for this as certain beverage products marketed using fruit names do list how much (or how little) actual juice they contain. If this case proceeds, it's possible that Dunkin' may have to change its marketing for these products. Given the past history of lawsuits like this, it's somewhat unlikely the plaintiffs will receive a large cash payout. That's because while the lawsuit makes a case for the benefits of the fruit, noting that ""blueberries have the potential to limit the development and severity of certain cancers and vascular diseases,"" it's highly unlikely anyone specifically seeking those health benefits does so through doughnuts.

Todd Campbell,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It may not get the attention as often as larger-cap biotech stocks like Celgene Corp. (NASDAQ:CELG) and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), but a bunch of recent drug approvals could soon change that for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN). Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals about to reward investors with a steady stream of big-time sales and profit growth? A full transcript follows the video. Todd Campbell: It was great! I don't know if, when you travel, you're always looking for investment ideas. I always am. No matter what I'm doing, when I'm traveling, or if I'm going to the dentist, or whatever, I'm trying to figure out if there's an investing angle. And I have one for you, Kristine. Harjes: OK, let's hear it. Campbell: Go long Wellfleet oysters. Oh my God, they're so delicious. Harjes: Is that an actual company? Campbell: No. [laughs] But they are delicious oysters. Harjes: [laughs] Maybe someday they'll go public, and then we can make all of the riches. Campbell: There we go! Campbell: Kristine, I'm wicked excited to talk about this company. Harjes: Wicked excited, that's such a Northeast thing to say. Campbell: I'm using the New England wicked. Because, again, you hit on, we talk a lot about companies like Celgene, one of my favorite stocks out there. But Regeneron is a very interesting stock. It's a little bit smaller than those three upper echelon players -- Gilead, Amgen, and Celgene. It has a $50 billion market cap instead of $100 billion market cap. But there are reasons to think this company could take that next step higher and become part of that commonly discussed group on this show and elsewhere. I thought it would be a lot of fun to dive in and talk about the different things that are going on at the company, because there's a tremendous amount of research and development activity going on at the company. Again, it's a big company. This is a substantial, investable idea that we can talk to our listeners about. They have 5,400 employees, a $50 billion market cap. They did almost $5 billion in revenue last year. They're profitable, and they make a lot of money. So I'm looking forward to it. Harjes: Yeah, this is definitely not one of your tiny pre-clinical stocks that we sometimes talk about on this show, but rather an established player that is clawing its way up to be at the top of the hill of biotechs. This is a company that, for a long, long time, was known for just one drug called Eylea. This is their flagship product, which was first approved in 2011 for various retinal diseases. They're just recently, within the past few years or so, starting to branch out and diversify into other drugs. They now have a handful of approved drugs and an incredibly deep pipeline. But let's start at the beginning and talk a little bit about Eylea. Campbell: Kristine, I think one of the listeners' favorite shows based on responses that we got in the past has been the catching-lightning-in-a-bottle type shows, where we've highlighted CEOs that have successfully developed drugs and then sold their companies and are now trying to do it again. I think we should really give a shout out to two proven leaders, CEOs at companies that don't leave and start over, but still catch lightning in a bottle over and over and over again at the companies that they stay at. And one of those leaders is Regeneron's CEO, Leonard Schleifer, who has proven that he's developed a very good model for discovering, developing, and now winning FDA [Food and Drug Administration] approval of drugs across a few different indications. You mentioned Eylea being the No. 1 drug, the most important drug right now for the company, in terms of revenue and everything else. But they've actually had six different drugs that they've found internally that have made it through the FDA gauntlet and have made it to market -- four of those being significant drugs, which I define as drugs that either already have $1 billion in sales, Eylea, or could end up having $1 billion in sales, which would be these three more recently discovered drugs: Praluent, Dupixent, and Kevzara. Harjes: Yes. Looking at these drugs, as you mentioned, a lot of them do have the potential to eventually hit that blockbuster status. But I think it's also important to look at Eylea and its own growth, because this is a pretty established drug that has been bringing in a lot of revenue for Regeneron for quite a while, but it's still growing fairly quickly. Sales in the U.S. were up 11% year over year. Regeneron just reported its earnings on August 3 -- we're talking about the second quarter here. In that quarter, it sold nearly a billion, just in the quarter alone. This is at nearly a $4 billion run rate just with U.S. sales. It's important to note that Regeneron receives just a share of profit from ex-U.S. sales because it's partnered with Bayer on this drug. Campbell: Right. Bayer and Regeneron are working together on commercializing the drug globally. This is a monster drug in a huge indication. I think you mentioned briefly that it's approved to treat wet stage age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. These are two increasingly common causes of vision loss within older patients. If you think about this for a second, what's the argument for the growth that you're referencing? You've got 76 million baby boomers, and they're turning 65 at a pace of 10,000 people per day. The incidence of these two indications within this patient population, as they're getting older and living longer, is increasing. What's really intriguing about Eylea and its success, this is a drug that did $1.5 billion in global sales last quarter alone. So, it has a $6 billion global run rate. That growth has come not because of price increases, but because it's being more increasingly used -- more patients are being diagnosed with these conditions, and then some market-share wins. There's other players. We'll talk about the competition, because I think that's important, too. I think this is an important drug. It's likely to remain an important drug for the company, especially given the fact that they have patent protection on the drug that stretches out into the 2020s. Harjes: Right. When you look at the indications that it is approved for, you can see the demographic trends hidden in the name of the diseases. You have wet age-related macular degeneration, wet AMD, it's age related. As you mentioned, that's a huge growing population. Its other approved indication is diabetic macular edema. This is a diabetic condition, and the population of diabetics is also something that is growing. It's also approved for diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema. You can see exactly why this drug will continue to grow. You mentioned that it does have some competition. It's competing with a drug called Lucentis. There could potentially be some biosimilars to Lucentis, which are copycat versions of it that could be a little bit cheaper once the Lucentis patent expires in 2020. There's also an interesting competition going on between Lucentis and Eylea and Roche's drug called Avastin, which is a cancer drug that's being used off-label in this indication because it's so much cheaper. Campbell: Yeah, it's way cheaper, and as a result, its market share is, I want to say it's 30%-40% in wet AMD. Harjes: It's interesting. For me, it's one of the most high-profile times that we see an off-label drug being used across an indication with any sort of huge reach. Harjes: Yeah. This is a company that recognizes it has a really strong foothold in retinal diseases. It knows how important Eylea is to it, but it also knows that it needs to diversify. It reminds me of a lot of other companies in this regard. For example, let's compare it to Gilead Sciences. This would be like Gilead Sciences saying, ""We know HIV is super important. That's been the foundation of our business,"" and I'm talking a couple years ago now. At that point, they said, ""We need to do something other than HIV, as well, to continue having new growth drivers."" And still today, you see Gilead branching out into new indications and trying to find that next step, what's going to drive future growth. Campbell: Yeah. Similar to Celgene, right Kristine? You talk about Revlimid, $8 billion in sales from Revlimid, and they're spreading out into some other indications, too. You're right, it's very important for these companies to be expanding. And Regeneron is doing it. Harjes: Yeah, it's a story that you see a lot. When you think about the life cycle of biotechs, they often do strike it big with one indication or one drug, and then they're established and they have cash flow coming in and they need to use it to fund clinical development to keep that growth moving and keep investors satisfied. We've talked a whole ton about Eylea, and don't get me wrong, that's a very important component of Regeneron. But we think it's even more exciting to discuss what else Regeneron has going on, both in its product portfolio and in its pipeline. Campbell: There are so many moving pieces to this company since 2015. It's really important for investors who are interested in buying Regeneron to understand both the positives, what the market opportunity could be for its newest drugs, but also some of the risks and the challenges that are facing these drugs. I think a great place to start, Kristine, would be to look at Praluent, which is the first of the three most recently launched drugs. That won approval in summer of 2015 for use in treating bad cholesterol -- high bad cholesterol -- in patients in which it was genetically caused. A pretty tough-to-treat indication. That drug launched with these multi-billion-dollar blockbuster expectations, but it's been a little bit disappointing. It's still selling pretty well, but it's nowhere near what those expectations were. Harjes: Right. Praluent is what's known as a PCSK9 inhibitor. We've talked about them on the show before. It's a drug that works to lower your cholesterol levels in a novel way. When you consider how many Americans take drugs for cholesterol levels, you would think this would be a huge success. The problem is, it's pretty expensive. This drug is $14,000 a year. You compare that to drugs like statins, which are not under patent protection anymore, the generics are pretty darn cheap, especially compared to $14,000 annually. So this drug is really not doing as great as people were expecting. It saw sales of just $46 million in the past quarter, and that was up from $26 million from the quarter of a year ago, so Q2 2016. But still, these numbers are really tiny for a drug that was supposed to be a billion-dollar blockbuster. Campbell: Yeah. I think a lot of investors were disappointed by that. That's one of the reasons why Regeneron shares underperformed in 2016. But I think they're looking forward now and they're saying, Praluent sales are up pretty substantial year over year. We're now at about a $200 million a year run rate. That's solid. And there is a big Phase III study that's wrapping up at the end of this year. With data coming out early 2018, they could move the needle and make this drug more commonly used, too, and that's an outcome study that's evaluating whether or not using Praluent actually reduces the likelihood of major cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes. Harjes: Which, that data is pretty darn important if you are a payer looking at whether or not a $14,000 price tag is worth it. You might want to know, is this actually going to lower the risk of a cardiovascular event? So there's 18,000 patients in this study, and we should be getting data in early 2018. That could swing things in a positive direction for this company. Let's also look at one big threat to this drug and to Regeneron -- which is the ongoing legal battle that they have with Amgen and its competing drug, Repatha. Campbell: [Dun-dun-dun.] It's not all roses and fairy tales over here. We do have a big risk, a big challenge that investors have to be aware of when it comes to this drug. And that's that Amgen has sued Regeneron and Sanofi, its partner on the drug, for patent infringement. So far, the courts have been siding with Amgen on it. As a matter of fact, previously, the courts actually said that Sanofi and Regeneron would have to stop selling Praluent in the United States. That was stayed pending appeal, which is why you're still seeing this drug on the market racking up revenue. But depending on how this all shakes out, you could run all sorts of different scenarios. You could say, Amgen ends up winning in the appeal, and as a result, Praluent disappears from the marketplace along with its $200 million in annualized sales. You could say, Amgen wins, and they cut a deal to share royalty streams somehow with Praluent sales. Or you could say, Regeneron comes out on top and Praluent continues as is, the outcome study comes out aces, and the next thing you know, you have a billion-dollar blockbuster on your hands. Harjes: Right. As with many legal matters, outcome hazy, we'll see what happens with that. But what you need to take away from this is that Praluent has, thus far at least, not lived up to the hype. But fortunately, that was not the only drug that Regeneron was developing to diversify away from Eylea. It was able to launch a drug recently called Dupixent, which is now approved for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Campbell: This is a really intriguing drug, and it may even have a bigger commercial opportunity than Praluent does. Moderate-to-severe eczema is very difficult to treat. There's not a lot of treatment options out there. The drug costs $37,000 annually, which sounds like a lot of money, but it's actually not that bad. The payers and insurers basically applauded that price tag when it was announced. The market for Dupixent could be multiple billions of dollars in a year, taken with a grain of salt because we know, as we've seen in the past, peak sales estimates oftentimes fall short. But I have seen people out there saying that if other studies that are evaluating Dupixent in asthma, for example, results coming soon, stay tuned, potential approval application getting filed by the end of this year. You could see this drug generate about $4 billion in annual sales by 2023. Now, I think that's a stretch. But I think what you can look at this drug and say, with its current indication, and with the potential in asthma, and the potential to be used in more patients over time, this absolutely could be a significant driver of sales. And Sanofi and Regeneron will split any profit on it. Harjes: Despite the little bit of skepticism there is about whether or not this drug will be able to outperform drugs like Novartis' Cosentyx, there's also competition from the likes of GlaxoSmithKline, it's definitely not a market that they have to themselves. This kind of has become the favorite child after Praluent was so disappointing. So, lots of excitement going on around this drug, particularly seeing how it launches in its currently approved indications, as well as how it performs in some of the currently ongoing trials that you mentioned, Todd. Campbell: Kristine, just to interject before we jump to the next one, Q2 sales of the drug, first quarter on the market, $28 million. So better than a $100 million run rate right out of the gate. Harjes: Yeah, that's not bad. It's pretty hard to project future sales based on the first quarter on the market, but that's definitely a good sign that payers are accepting the price tag and doctors are prescribing the drug. Off to a good start, and definitely something to keep an eye on. Oh, one more detail before we move on to the next drug: Amgen is also battling over this patent. Which is kind of interesting, because Amgen doesn't even have a rival drug here. They don't even have something in the pipeline, which also means that they can't ask for an injunction that would pull the drug from the market. Amgen is just looking for money here. It's like they're a consistent thorn in the side of Regeneron. Anyway, moving on to the next drug that we wanted to highlight, this one is called Kevzara, and it treats moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, which is another enormous indication. Campbell: Yeah, a multi-billion-dollar indication with a lot of players, dominated by anti-TNF drugs like Humira, which listeners will probably remember. Humira is the biggest-selling drug on the planet, with about $16 billion in annual sales. Kevzara is not going to be that big. It's going to be more of a niche player, because its approval is for use in patients who have tried and failed on other therapies like DMARDs and Humira and the like. However, a $39,000 annual price tag is cheaper than Humira, and that has some people thinking that Kevzara could win away sales in this indication. Again, grain-of-salt warning. Peak sales estimates could be $1 billion for the drug over time. We'll have to see, though, because again, this is a competitive marketplace, and I'm not entirely sure just how much of this market they'll end up winning. Harjes: One key question to keep an eye out for is whether doctors will eventually be able to, or want to, prescribe this as a first-line treatment. For context, they actually did test this against Humira in trials and showed that the two had similar safety. That should be really important in making the case to prescribing doctors that you might want to just try Kevzara right away. But for now, that's not going to be the case. Humira is extremely well established. There are plenty of other drugs that are established in the space. I think you're right that, for now, it will be a niche, later-line drug. Campbell: Yeah. I think you watch it over the course of the next few quarters, you see what the prescription trends look like in the quarterly reports. All of these companies, as listeners should know, they talk about their performance every quarter, you can see the transcripts online, you can go through and read them after they have their discussions. Oftentimes, they'll talk about market share, they'll talk about prescription trends, they'll talk about how these drugs are doing. I think if you evaluate this one over the course of the next three or four quarters, you'll get a feel for whether or not this is going to be a drug that does $200 million a year in sales, or potentially could do much more than that. But it's still going to be a fairly substantial drug, because think about it -- when you start poo-pooing drugs that may only do nine figures in sales, you know you're talking about a pretty strong company. Harjes: Yeah, exactly. But that's not all. They also have a humongous pipeline. We just walked you through the product portfolio -- things that are approved. But the pipeline also has 17 more product candidates in it. Five of them are in Phase III trials. Some of these are label extensions for the drugs we just talked about. For example, Todd, you mentioned earlier extending the label of Eylea. I think you also mentioned Dupixent in asthma that's going on. They're also looking at Praluent in hypercholesterolemia, so expanding that indication to a wider set of people. But they also have completely novel candidates that they're studying. There's one drug called Fasinumab, and they're studying that in osteoarthritis pain, as well as chronic lower back pain. They have a PD-1 drug, which is something we talk a little bit about on this show, and that one is called REGN2810. Campbell: Kristine, just to interrupt for a second, I think that one might be the one that investors really want to focus on in the pipeline. Harjes: Yeah, because it could be huge. These PD-1 drugs are absolutely enormous in their scope. Currently, the 2810 drug is being studied in Phase III in non-small cell lung cancer. They initiate it in the second quarter. They also have a potentially pivotal Phase II study in basal cell carcinoma that was indicated in the quarter. Because of the mechanism of action, it could absolutely be possible for this drug to treat a variety of different cancers, and could seriously rack up some sales there. Campbell: Yeah, we talked about Opdivo and Keytruda a lot on the show. Those are the two top-selling PD-1 drugs. They have combined sales of over $2 billion per quarter right now. Obviously, this is a huge market that could be targeted. What companies like Regeneron are doing, they're a little bit late to the dance, they're looking for indications that are under-treated where they can get fast-track and early-accelerated approval, so they can play a little bit of catch-up. So they're smaller indications, but they can get to the market quicker, and then they can file for supplemental approvals after that on a little bit more of an expedited time frame so they start to generate some sales. I think the thing to watch here is data from their trial in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the second most common cause of skin cancer. Data from a pivotal Phase II trial is expected in that soon. If that's good, they think they can file for approval within the next 12 months. So theoretically, depending on if they get fast-tracked or not, you could have this PD-1 drug hitting the market in, we'll call it 18 months. Harjes: Yeah, when you look at Regeneron's most recent quarterly earnings statement, the press release has this grid on it, and its upcoming catalysts. I believe, if I'm recalling it correctly, it's just for the remainder of the year. And it's packed. There are so many things in this list. If you extend that one year out, it's just incredible how many different pivotal trials will have data, or potential approvals, or filing for FDA approval. This company really has a lot going on for it. One thing that I want to highlight before we sign off, because we haven't talked about this very much, is the collaboration that they have with Sanofi. Sanofi is a partner on almost all of the drugs that we talked about. They have a huge, long-standing relationship. There's also the Bayer partnership on Eylea. So this is a company that plays well with others, and it's been very profitable so far to pursue this kind of partnership strategy. Campbell: Right. But Sanofi's walking away from this partnership, at least in the antibody development, at the end of this year. People will have to take a look and see what that means. Regeneron will end up getting reimbursed less money for research and development next year from Sanofi. I don't think that's going to be a substantial number, but it could be a number that put a little bit of headwinds on sales growth for some of the smaller drugs like Kevzara. If you lose $30 to $40 million in development revenue per quarter, that could have an impact. So you have to watch and see how that plays out. Sanofi is going to continue to work on the existing drugs with Regeneron, and they do still have a separate pact in immuno-oncology. Again, we were just talking about the PD-1 drug -- that's a Sanofi-shared drug, as well. They're going to continue to develop that together, as well. I think overall, Kristine, this is a financially stable, fast-growing company. Their earnings are growing quicker than Celgene's, for example, year over year. They have a lot going on. I think it's worth having on people's radar. Harjes: Yeah. I think that the Sanofi collaboration is ending come December, is a little bit of a sign of maturity with this company. When you're an early stage company, it's a lot more important that you have a big brother of sorts handing you money to develop your early-stage candidates, get them through all the clinical-trial processes, which are very expensive. But then you have drugs on the market, and you're kicking off your own free cash flow. So that's kind of the place where Regeneron is right now, and it's actually at a point where it can be the big brother, or the big sister, itself. For example, they have an agreement with a smaller company called Intellia Therapeutics, and they're working with them on some CRISPR research. It's very early stage, as with everything CRISPR. But Regeneron is now responsible for shouldering the development costs for Intellia, and it'll pay Intellia some milestones, it'll pay royalties on future sales. But because this company has gotten to be of a size where it has financial weight, it has money at its disposal to do things. The balance sheet is incredibly strong. They have well over $1 billion in cash and equivalents, no long-term debt. They have another $1 billion in long-term investments. This is a company that's really come into its own and deserves to be talked about in this upper echelon of biotech stocks. Campbell: Yeah, it's not a cheap stock though, Kristine. That's the final takeaway for investors, too. It's a great growth story, but you're paying up a little bit for that growth. Harjes: Yeah, absolutely. Do you want to share some of the ratios? Campbell: Forward P/E of this stock is 29. If you compare that to Celgene, Celgene's forward P/E is 15. It's P/E-to-growth ratio is 1.74. If you look at the P/E-to-growth of Celgene, it's 0.82. It's trading at 9.5 times sales, Celgene's trading at 8.4 times sales. So it's a little bit of an expensive company. Again, those ratios are reflecting what we've done so far, not necessarily what we may do going forward. So bear that in mind, as well. As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. This show is produced by Austin Morgan. For Todd Campbell, I'm Kristine Harjes, thanks for listening and Fool on! ","

See:  UnitedHealth president David Wichmann to become CEO Sept. 1 Wichmann taking over as CEO is also crucial, said Skolnick. He has been with the company since 1998 and has previously served as chief financial officer, overseen the company’s benefits business, led mergers and acquisition activities and more, according to a company press release. Wichmann is “the keeper of keys — having done practically every acquisition over the last 20 years, no one knows better where the jewels are hidden in the organization, nor how to run the still-important health plan,” she said.

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has rallied from one-month lows, and returned to the range. Near-term support (2,463) is followed by a firmer floor matching the former breakout point (2,453). The S&P’s nearly immediate reversal higher is technically constructive. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has maintained near-term support. Specifically, the index has notched consecutive session lows just above the 21,840 floor, detailed last week. Conversely, near-term overhead closely matches the 22,000 mark, and a retest is underway. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq has rallied respectably from one-month lows. In the process, it’s reached familiar resistance — the 6,342-to-6,344 inflection point — an area also illustrated below. The Nasdaq closed Monday at 6,340, and the retest remains underway. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has knifed to the 6,342 resistance from one-month lows. To reiterate, Monday’s close registered just two points lower. Separately, the Nasdaq’s primary uptrend has apparently absorbed its latest whipsaw under the 50-day moving average, currently 6,273. The prevailing series of “higher highs” and “higher lows” signals an uptrend. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark’s backdrop remains the strongest. As illustrated, the August downturn has been underpinned by 21,840 support — illustrated on the hourly chart — an area closely matching the 20-day moving average. The 20-day moving average is a widely-tracked near-term trending indicator, and the Dow’s sustained summer posture higher signals a strong uptrend. Similarly, the S&P 500’s bull trend has absorbed the August downdraft. Tactically, an inflection point spans from 2,449 to 2,453, levels matching the 50-day moving average (in blue) and the June peak. To reiterate, the S&P’s nearly immediate reversal to the former range is technically constructive. Though the bigger-picture technicals remain bullish, the prevailing backdrop is not one-size-fits-all. On a headline basis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has staged a garden-variety pullback, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have thus far weathered more aggressive August downturns.

                                   has narrowly maintained the 200-day moving average, currently 136.46. Last week’s close (136.47) registered fractionally higher, and the small-cap benchmark has extended its rally attempt this week. Tactically, resistance matches the breakdown point (138.85), detailed previously, and a retest is underway. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has bottomed slightly atop the 200-day moving average, and rallied from two-month lows. Consider that the 200-day moving average is in play partly as a product of the mid-cap benchmark’s prolonged eight-month range. The sideways price action moves the average price of the prior 200 days closer to the current price. Still, the 200-day is a widely-tracked primary trending indicator, and the quality of the prevailing rally attempt is worth tracking. An eventual violation would likely raise a technical caution flag. Looking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500

                                    remains comparably stronger. Familiar levels stand out: The SPY has reversed firmly atop resistance, preserving a bullish intermediate-term technical bias. Collectively, technical divergences have surfaced this month. The prevailing backdrop is not one-size-fits-all. The small- and mid-cap benchmarks remain comparably softer, though each has maintained the 200-day moving average, rising from two-month lows. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials’ pullback has been garden-variety, while the Nasdaq Composite’s bull trend trend has likely absorbed a respectable August downdraft. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 is acting well technically. The nearly immediate reversal atop the 2,450 area — closely matching the 50-day moving average and the June peak — places the index on firmer technical ground. This area remains an inflection point, though the S&P 500’s intermediate-term bias remains bullish pending a more technically damaging downturn.

                                    has come to life amid the recent flight-to-safety trade. Consider two time horizons — the six-month and two-year charts — initially detailed last week. To start, the shares have asserted a range-bound, or trendless, six-month backdrop. The flatlining major moving averages bisect the range, exemplifying the absence of trend. Still, the shares have challenged the range top, and the retest is worth tracking. Major resistance is frequently cleared on the third of fourth test. More broadly, the shares have cleared a one-year downtrend illustrated on the two-year chart. The trendline, circa 120, pivots to support, and a breakout attempt is in play barring a violation. Additional resistance matches the six-month range top — the 123.10-to-123.30 area — and an eventual close higher would more firmly signal a trend shift. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar has asserted a strong summer downtrend, and remains tenuously positioned.

The August low rests at 23.98, and punctuates a successful initial retest. Separately, consider that the 200-week moving average (24.23) roughly matches support. Friday marked the first weekly close lower since 2014, a precarious posture. The late-2014 rally atop the 200-week moving average preceded a massive technical breakout. More plainly, the sluggish August price action leaves the dollar vulnerable to a potential downdraft. Tactically, resistance broadly spans from about 24.55 to 24.70, an area matching the breakdown point and trendline resistance. An eventual close higher would place the brakes on dollar bearish momentum. Also see the July 25 review. Moving to U.S. sectors, the transports have survived a major technical test.

The group has established support matching the 200-day, reaching a nearly three-week high this week. Separately, consider that last week’s low registered as a “higher low” versus the early-August print, also signaling that bearish momentum is waning. More broadly, the group is traversing an eight-month range — pinned to the steep 2016 rally — and its longer-term technical bias remains bullish.

There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!

Matthew Lynn,08172017,MarketWatch,08102017,"Published: Aug 16, 2017 8:02 a.m. ET Levy taxes and fees, but don’t restrict their numbers By Across Spain, Croatia, Italy and now France, this summer has seen a growing rage against the tourists who swarm into those countries, block streets with their backpacks and selfie sticks, drive up the prices of apartments with their demand for Airbnb stays, and make it impossible to get a table at a café. Tourists have become the bane of many of Europe’s most beautiful cities — and locals are looking for new ways to clamp down — or even restrict the numbers coming to visit. This is a crazy response. The truth is Europe needs tourists — lots of them — to keep its economy humming. The region lacks a genuine competitive advantage in many industries. That’s not the case for tourism, where Europe’s mix of quaint towns, historical cities, authentic food and vibrant nightlife make it the No.1 destination. Yes, tourism has to be managed — priced correctly, to put it in economic terms — so it doesn’t become overwhelming. But the last thing Europeans should be doing is driving it away. Instead this is what’s happening: In Barcelona, anti-tourism protesters have been storming the beaches to reclaim them from the sunbathing hordes. Militant activists have slashed the tires on rental bikes and tour buses. There have already been protests in Mallorca and one is planned for San Sebastian for Aug. 17. In Venice, 2,000 people marched in protest against the cruise ships that fill the port. In Rome, there have been crackdowns on the numbers of people at major tourist sports, while the ancient city of Dubrovnik, where much of “Game of Thrones” is filmed, has started monitoring the numbers of people coming into the town. Now the Balearic Islands, which include Ibiza and Mallorca, have just introduced a tourist tax. Barcelona is considering a tax on tour groups, though it isn’t clear how high it would be, while other cities are looking at options such as restricting home rentals or directly rationing the numbers allowed in. The backlash is growing all the time. As someone who just returned from 10 days in Croatia, I can see what they are getting at. The numbers of visitors are growing all the time, and at a certain point a place becomes simply too crowded to enjoy it. A combination of low-cost airlines, the growth of rental sites like Airbnb which lower the cost of accommodation, and a generation of 20- and 30-somethings who have decided it is normal to take six or seven short trips around Europe every year have led to an exponential growth in the numbers of tourists. Read: Boorish tourists, this Croatian island doesn’t want you — and it’s far from alone in that Take Spain. The country saw a record 75.6 million tourists last year — a total that is getting close to twice its population. At current rates of growth, there will be three or four times the numbers of visitors as there are residents in another 20 years — and that may become unsustainable because the crowds will become unbearable. But that doesn’t mean Europe should be banning tourists — or even limiting their numbers. Europe doesn’t have a genuine competitive advantage in many industries anymore. Yes, it makes some great cars, airplanes, and wine, and it has lots of world-leading fashion, design and publishing houses. It even has a few world-beating technology companies. But in reality, none of those can’t be competed out of existence one day. The Japanese make great cars as well, and the South Koreans aren’t far behind. The Chinese will be making excellent planes pretty soon, and the United States is way ahead of any European nation in technology. It is hard to pin down any single industry where the continent has a definitive advantage — and with an aging population, the highest welfare costs in the world, and some of the highest wages as well, it is hard to see any emerging. There is one industry, however, where its position is just about unbeatable, and it is one of the world’s biggest and fastest-growing: Tourism. Read: As anti-tourism marches spread across Europe, how not to be an ‘ugly American’ on vacation Sure, the U.S. gets a lot of visitors, and so does China. Compared with their size, however, European destinations stand out. France is the world’s most visited country, and Spain, Italy, Germany, and even the drizzly U.K. are all in the top 10. By some measures, it is the world’s biggest single industry, accounting for 3.1% of global GDP directly, and close to 10% in total. Even better, it generates jobs on a vast scale; no one has yet really worked out how to automate a hotel. Globally, it accounts for 292 million jobs, one in every 10. It is hard to see anyone ever matching Europe’s position. Sure, you can build a Disney theme park anywhere, and you can always throw up another luxury hotel if you can find some spare beach. But you can’t suddenly create another Venice, Barcelona, Dubrovnik or London. People are always going to want to visit those cities. They have an unparalleled heritage that can’t be duplicated. In the language of business schools, the barriers to entry are absolute. Read: Move over, London and Paris — these unlikely foreign cities have seen a spike in popularity this summer True, European cities need to find ways of managing the tourist hordes. There is no reason not to charge for access to the most beautiful squares or ports at peak time. As any economist will tell you, price is a pretty good way of distributing a scarce resource. Nor is there anything wrong with imposing taxes that help pay for new transport facilities or better ways of managing the flow of people. But it would be a huge mistake to start limiting the numbers, or to allow protesters to make tourists feel unwelcome. There is nothing wrong with being a giant theme park. Indeed, that may well be the continent’s best bet economically — but it can’t get there by scaring away the tourists. Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

Market participants said they were also following reports that Gary Cohn was resigning as economic adviser to President Donald Trump, but the White House has countered those rumors. U.S. equity benchmarks had been facing selling pressure at the start of trade, as European markets ended lower after a three-day winning streak. “In Europe, we had weakness out of the gate and then we had worries about the Cohn news,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading, in an interview. “With the light volume, Barcelona is not something that the market is going to handle well.” The equity market was also digesting minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting, as well as the dissolution of a pair of Trump’s business-advisory panels, which underscores the president’s challenges in promoting his Wall Street-friendly policies. The president has faced a furor after he repeatedly blamed “both sides” for violence last weekend at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Overall, Fed minutes were read as dovish, lowering expectations of another rate increase this year. “There’s no direct market impact in what Trump has done recently, but if things continue to be so polarized that his agenda is completely dead on arrival, that would have a negative impact,” Alpine’s Spellman said.

Per CNN, a Catalan police spokesman said the incident was “most likely” a terrorist attack, and the BBC is reporting that 13 people have died. One person has been arrested, Spanish public broadcaster RTVE reports. The NCAA teams were conducting exhibition tours of Spain. According to David Amber, a studio host for “Hockey Night in Canada” who also is in Barcelona, Clemson and Oregon State both are staying at a hotel near where the attack took place. Both programs took to Twitter on Thursday to say no one from their traveling parties was hurt.

Barbara Kollmeyer,08172017,MarketWatch,08102017,"Published: Aug 17, 2017 4:27 p.m. ET Officials embark on terrorism investigation By MADRID (MarketWatch) — A popular promenade in Barcelona, Spain, became a scene of panic and devastation on Thursday after a van rammed pedestrians, leaving a dozen people dead and dozens more injured. The incident took place on Las Ramblas, a long, tree-lined street that is typically packed with tourists and locals, around 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. Eastern time). Local media were at one point reporting that hostages were being held at a bar near the scene of the attack by other assailants, but later reports cast doubt on the matter. The Associated Press cited the regional president in reporting that two suspects had been arrested. The Wall Street Journal, citing the jidahist-activity-monitoring organization SITE Intelligence Group, reported that Islamic State had claimed responsibility for the attack. Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, tweeted that terrorists would never defeat a united people who love freedom. The seaside city was on lockdown in the immediate wake of the attack, with residents told to not leave their homes and many reported to be sheltering inside stores and restaurants and bars that closed the moment news of the attack reached them. S'acaba de produir atropellament massiu a les Rambles de Barcelona, per part d'una persona amb una furgoneta. Possiblement varis ferits Media reports in Spain and the U.S. indicated the police were treating the incident as a terrorist attack. The police presence on streets in the Spanish capital Madrid, some 600 kilometers southwest of Barcelona, was sharply escalated in the wake of the Barcelona attack. Nathalie Lezcano Sticchi, a 28-year-old resident of Barcelona who lives near the area, told MarketWatch she had passed the scene of the attack just five minutes before, stepping off the Ramblas to go into a Zara clothing store on a side street. “When I was on the first floor, one of the guys who was working [at Zara] said, ‘You have to go outside, we are going to close because something is happening at the Ramblas,’ ” Sticchi said in a telephone interview. She said a friend had forwarded her a message from his mother, who had been at Las Ramblas and seen a truck crashing into people. Sticchi ran to her house, as stores drew their shutters all around her. “People were running everywhere, and no one understood what was going on,” she said, “and I started hearing ambulances.” Several metro lines were closed in Barcelona, and the area remained sealed off into the evening. Police were urging individuals not to share images of the crash site on social media. They also thanked the media for pixellating images they had chose to use of victims: GRACIAS a todos los medios y particulares que estáis pixelando y obviando imágenes duras de víctimas y de operativo policial. #RESPETO Trucks are normally allowed up the Ramblas to make deliveries, and according to Sticchi it has a fairly heavy police presence. Spain hasn’t suffered a major attack on its soil since 2004, when an al-Qaeda-inspired terrorist cell detonated simultaneous explosions on the Cercanias commuter train in Madrid on March 11. The attack, which took place three days before Spain’s general election, killed 192 people and injured thousands. The van attack on Las Ramblas killed 12 and injured 80, according to an NBC News report citing the regional president. The Barcelona scene is one that has become all too familiar in Europe. A deadly truck attack in Nice, France, in July of last year left 86 people dead and hundreds injured. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. In December 2016, a truck was deliberately driven into the Christmas market in Berlin, leaving 12 people dead and 56 others injured. ISIS has claimed responsibility for those attacks, along with a deadly attack near London Bridge in June. Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

Emma Court,08172017,MarketWatch,08102017,"Published: Aug 15, 2017 12:15 p.m. ET CEO Frazier made the decision two days after deadly violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. By Merck & Co. Inc. Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier said Monday that he will leave a presidential manufacturing advisory council, tying that decision both to his role “as CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience,” two days after deadly violence at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Two other CEOs followed his lead later that day. “Our country’s strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths, races, sexual orientations and political beliefs. America’s leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people area created equal,” Frazier said in a statement, adding: “I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.” President Donald Trump, whose immediate response to Charlottesville was widely condemned for not specifically censuring white supremacists, attacked Frazier — one of the few black CEOs of a major U.S. company and the only black member of the president’s manufacturing-jobs panel — nearly immediately afterward and later Monday evening. “Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma

Later, he added that the company was “taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES!” After the Twitter exchange Monday morning, though, the president issued a more explicit statement condemning racism and saying that “those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.” Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! .@Merck Pharma is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES! Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and Scott Paul, head of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a partnership between manufacturers and the United Steelworkers union, have also left the president’s manufacturing council, following Frazier’s lead. Under Armour “engages in innovation and sports, not politics,” Plank said. Paul called it “the right thing” to do. Intel’s Krzanich went into more detail. “I resigned because I want to make progress, while many in Washington seem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them,” he said in a statement. “We should honor — not attack — those who have stood up for equality and other cherished American values.” Other corporate executives have left White House councils in response to previous presidential actions, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co. CEO Robert Iger, but the president did not attack either after their announcements. Merck voluntarily released information about its U.S. drug-pricing practices earlier this year. Several drug makers have also done so, though they remain the exception, not the rule. Read: Merck will release average drug-price increases to ‘provide greater transparency’ TFW youre getting resoundly ridiculed for being too soft on white supremacists so you take a gratuitous slap at a black man for good measure https://t.co/eKCcKCFrV7 Violence broke out in the historic college town of Charlottesville after white nationalists marched there Friday night in advance of a planned Saturday rally against the city’s decision to take down a Confederate general’s statue and counterprotesters gathered in response. When a car plowed into another vehicle near a group of counterprotesters on Saturday, one person was killed and nearly 20 were injured. According to the New York Times, at least 34 people were injured in total that day. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides — on many sides,” President Trump said afterward. Democrats and Republicans criticized the president at the time for not singling out the white supremacists and not describing the attack as domestic terrorism.

Frazier took a principled stance and showed strong leadership, Coles said, adding, “these times try men’s souls. We need to all speak plainly vs. wrong.” Box CEO Aaron Levie also chimed in a “bravo” to Frazier’s statement. General Electric Chairman Jeff Immelt plans to stay on the president’s manufacturing council, according to a company statement, because “it is important for GE to participate in the discussion on how to drive growth and productivity in the U.S.” “GE has no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism, and we strongly condemn the violent extremism in Charlottesville over the weekend,” the statement said. We’ve seen the terror of white supremacy & racist violence before. It's a moral issue - an affront to America. We must all stand against it Other companies said recent events in Charlottesville would spur corporate changes. GoDaddy Inc. said that it will no longer host the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer, “as they have violated our terms of service.” The move appeared to be in response to a hateful Daily Stormer post about the woman who was killed in Charlottesville. Cloud-communications platform Twilio will add “an explicit prohibition of hate speech” to its acceptable-use policy, CEO Jeff Lawson said Sunday, adding that it “hope[d] other tech [companies] do the same.” See:  GoDaddy kicks off neo-Nazi site for violating terms of service Tesla’s Musk left the president’s strategic and policy forum and the manufacturing jobs initiative in June after the president pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord.

,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ohio’s Department of Insurance said on Thursday that non-profit managed care company CareSource will sell health plans in Paulding County next year - the last county in the United States that would have been without Obamacare individual coverage in 2018. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said on Wednesday that only Paulding County in northwestern Ohio was projected to be a “bare county” with no insurers in 2018, while 1,478 counties could have only one issuer next year. Just a month ago, CMS said there were 40 counties projected to have no insurers next year. Health insurers are facing an upheaval in their businesses amid growing uncertainty about healthcare legislation under President Donald Trump, who seeks to follow through on his promise to dismantle former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. Insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc have exited most of the states where they sold Obamacare plans, leaving hundreds of U.S. counties at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018. But other insurers, like Centene Corp, have filled those gaps, expanding into new counties that had lost their coverage options. In June, Centene said it would enter into three new states and would expand operations in six existing markets in 2018. ","

,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"McDonald’s, in a policy statement, said it is working on antibiotic plans for other meats, dairy cows and laying hens. McDonald’s is requiring suppliers of chicken meat to begin phasing out the use of antibiotics defined by the World Health Organization as “highest priority critically important antimicrobials” (HPCIA) to human medicine. Public health and consumer groups applauded the move, which is not as strict as the company’s policy for the United States, where already for a year suppliers have provided the chain with chickens raised without antibiotics deemed important to human health. In January 2018, HPCIAs will be gone from McDonald’s chickens in Brazil, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the United States and Europe. Only in Europe the company will make an exception for Colistin, a last resort antibiotic. By the end of 2019, suppliers in Australia and Russia will stop using HPCIAs and European suppliers plan to remove Colistin. Suppliers in all other markets will comply by January 2027. “Our goal is to have this policy implemented before this date,” McDonald’s said in its posted antibiotic policy update. McDonald’s told a group of consumer and environmental organizations on Aug. 17 that 74 percent of its global chicken sales will conform to this policy as of January 2018, Consumers Union, the policy division of Consumer Reports, said in a statement. Consumers Union also said the company told the group that it hopes to have a timeline soon for reducing medically important antibiotics from its beef supply. McDonald’s declined comment on sales figures and its plans for beef. More than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous antibiotic-resistant superbug infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health. “If fully implemented, (the plans) could be a total game changer that could transform the marketplace given the company’s massive buying power,” Jean Halloran, Consumers Union’s director of food policy initiatives, said in a statement.

 ,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"DEADLY AGENT: A sarin attack in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta killed hundreds of men, women and children in August, 2013. Despite international condemnation, attacks with chemicals continue. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh Nearly four years after President Bashar al-Assadâs government promised to get rid of its stockpile of chemical weapons, gas attacks are still commonplace. What went wrong? By  Anthony Deutsch Filed Aug. 17, 2017, 10 a.m. GMT THE HAGUE â In the spring of 2015 a Syrian major general escorted a small team of chemical weapons inspectors to a warehouse outside the Syrian capital Damascus. The international experts wanted to examine the site, but were kept waiting outside in their car for around an hour, according to several people briefed on the visit. When they were finally let into the building, it was empty. They found no trace of banned chemicals. âLook, there is nothing to see,â said the general, known to the inspectors as Sharif, opening the door. So why were the inspectors kept waiting? The Syrians said they were getting the necessary approval to let them in, but the inspectors had a different theory. They believed the Syrians were stalling while the place was cleaned out. It made no sense to the team that special approval was needed for them to enter an empty building. The incident, which was not made public, is just one example of how Syrian authorities have hindered the work of inspectors and how the international community has failed to hold Syria to account, according to half a dozen interviews with officials, diplomats, and investigators involved in eliminating Syriaâs weapons of mass destruction. Related content Slideshow: An invisible enemy Video: Anthony Deutsch on how he uncovered the problems facing weapons inspectors in Syria Video: Interview with Angela Kane, former UN high representative for disarmament Timeline: U.N.-OPCW investigations Â into Syrian chemical weapons Syria investigator del Ponte quits, blaming U.N. Security Council A promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse. They suspect that President Bashar al-Assadâs regime, while appearing to cooperate with international inspectors, secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability. They say Syria hampered inspectors, gave them incomplete or misleading information, and turned to using chlorine bombs when its supplies of other chemicals dwindled. There have been dozens of chlorine attacks and at least one major sarin attack since 2013, causing more than 200 deaths and hundreds of injuries. International inspectors say there have been more than 100 reported incidents of chemical weapons being used in the past two years alone. âThe cooperation was reluctant in many aspects and thatâs a polite way of describing it,â Angela Kane, who was the United Nationâs high representative for disarmament until June 2015, told Reuters. âWere they happily collaborating? No.â âWhat has really been shown is that there is no counter-measure, that basically the international community is just powerless,â she added. That frustration was echoed by U.N. war crimes investigator Carla del Ponte, who announced on Aug. 6 she was quitting a U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria. âI have no power as long as the Security Council does nothing,â she said. âWe are powerless, there is no justice for Syria.â The extent of Syriaâs reluctance to abandon chemical weapons has not previously been made public for fear of damaging international inspectorsâ relationship with Assadâs administration and its backer, Russia, which is giving military support to Assad. Now investigators and diplomatic sources have provided telling details to Reuters: - Syriaâs declarations about the types and quantities of chemicals it possessed do not match evidence on the ground uncovered by inspectors.Â Its disclosures, for example, make no mention of sarin, yet there is strong evidence that sarin has been used in Syria, including this year. Other chemicals found by inspectors but not reported by Syria include traces of nerve agent VX, the poison ricin and a chemical called hexamine, which is used to stabilise sarin. - Syria told inspectors in 2014-2015 that it had used 15 tonnes of nerve gas and 70 tonnes of sulphur mustard for research. Reuters has learned that inspectors believe those amounts are not âscientifically credible.â Only a fraction would be needed for research, two sources involved in inspections in Syria said. âWhy, my God, three-and-a-half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that, I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people.â - At least 2,000 chemical bomb shells, which Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons and either used or destroyed, are unaccounted for, suggesting that they may still be in the hands of Syriaâs military. - In Damascus, witnesses with knowledge of the chemical weapons programme were instructed by Syrian military officials to alter their statements midway through interviews with inspectors, threeÂ sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international agency overseeing the removal and destruction of Syriaâs chemical weapons, conceded serious questions remain about the completeness and accuracy of Syriaâs disclosures. ""There are certainly some gaps, uncertainties, discrepancies,"" OPCW Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, told Reuters. But he rejected criticism of his leadership by Kane and some other diplomats. Kane told Reuters that Uzumcu should have turned up the pressure on Syria over the gaps in its reporting and done more to support his inspectors. Uzumcu countered that it was not his job âto ensure the full complianceâ of treaties on chemical weapons, saying that the OPCW was mandated to confirm use of chemical weapons but not to assign blame. Syriaâs deputy foreign minister, Faisal Meqdad, insisted that Syria was completely free of chemical weapons and defended the countryâs cooperation with international inspectors. âI assure you that what was called the Syrian chemical weapons programme has ended, and has ended with no return. There are no more chemical weapons in Syria,â he told Reuters in an interview. Sharif did not respond to requests for comment about the incident at the warehouse. SARIN ATTACK On Aug. 21, 2013, hundreds of people died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta, a district on the outskirts of Damascus. The colourless, odourless nerve agent causes people to suffocate within minutes if inhaled even in small amounts. Assadâs forces were blamed by Western governments. He has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and blames insurgents for the attack. âThe secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil.â In the wake of the atrocity, the United States and Russia brokered a deal under which Assadâs government agreed to eradicate its chemical weapons programme. As part of the deal, Syria joined the OPCW, based in the Hague, Netherlands, promising to openÂ its borders to inspectors and disclose its entire programme â after previously denying it had any chemical weapons. Syria declared it had 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons or industrial chemical stocks, precisely the amount that outside experts had estimated. In an OPCW-led operation, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, that stockpile was shipped overseas for destruction with the help of 30 countries, notably the United States. But there were two significant problems. First, inspections did not go smoothly. Days after the Ghouta sarin attack, OPCW inspectors heading for the area came under sniper fire. They made it through to Ghouta eventually and were given just two hours by Syrian authorities to interview witnesses and take samples. The team confirmed that sarin had been used. And in May 2014 a joint United Nations-OPCW convoy was hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while attempting to get to the site of another chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita. That mission was aborted. On the return journey some of the team were detained for 90 minutes by unidentified gunmen. Syriaâs foreign ministry issued a statement blaming terrorists for attacking the convoy. Reuters was unable to determine exactly how many times the work of inspectors has been hampered, but Syrian tactics have included withholding visas, submitting large volumes of documents multiple times to bog down the process, last-minute restrictions on site inspections and coercing certain witnesses to change their stories during interviews, four diplomats and inspectors involved in the process told Reuters. The OPCW team has carried out 18 site visits since 2013, but has now effectively given up because Syria has failed to provide sufficient or accurate information, these sources said. The second problem was a switch of tactics by Assadâs forces. While the United Nations and OPCW focused on ridding Syria of the stockpile it admitted having, Assadâs forces began using new, crude chlorine bombs instead, according to two inspectors. As many as 100 chlorine barrel bombs have been dropped from helicopters since 2014, they said. Syria has denied using chlorine. Â Although less poisonous than nerve gas and widely available, chlorineâs use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria signed when it joined the OPCW, an intergovernmental agency that works with the United NationsÂ to implement the convention. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by drowning victims in body fluids. A source involved in monitoring Syriaâs chemical weapons for the OPCW said Damascus began using chlorine as âa weapon of terrorâ to gain a battlefield advantage when one of its bases in Kafr Zita was threatened with being overrun in 2014. âThe base was surrounded by opposition. The government forces wanted to depopulate the area. Thatâs why they started using chlorine,â said the source. A senior official who has worked with United Nations and OPCW investigators said two helicopter squadrons dropped chlorine barrel bombs, drums filled with chlorine canisters, from two air bases. To produce such a quantity must have required technical staff and logistical support, suggesting the operation was overseen by senior commanders, the official said.

REUTERS/Abed Kontar TEARS: A youth in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus in August, 2013, pictured after what activists said was a chemical attack by government forces. The Syrian armed forces denied using chemical weapons. REUTERS/Mohamed Abdullah The introduction of a new type of chemical weapon came at an awkward time for the OPCW, said the source involved in studying Syriaâs chemical weapons for the weapons monitoring group. It was keen to remove Syriaâs declaredÂ stockpile and reluctant to start a probe into alleged government violations that could jeopardise Syrian cooperation. The goal of removing the stockpile, which Western governments feared could fall into the hands of Islamic State, took precedence over the chlorine attacks, the source said. OPCW head Uzumcu denied there had been a reluctance to investigate reports of chlorine attacks, pointing out that in 2014 he set up a fact finding mission to look into them. This mission was not tasked with assigning blame, however. ItÂ concluded that the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread. Uzumcu said the teamâs conclusions were handed to the OPCW executive council. It condemned the use of chlorine and passed the findings to the United Nations. A spokesman for the United Nations said it was the role of the OPCW to determine whether or not a member state was in breach of the chemical weapons ban. Kane, the former U.N. high representative for disarmament, told Reuters that Uzumcu should have tackled Syria over its lapses in reporting to the OPCW, including undeclared chemicals and a failure to report the governmentâs Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which was, in effect, the programmeâs headquarters. âWhy, my God, three-and-a half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that ... I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people,â Kane said. Uzumcu said the OPCW was constrained by its founding treaty, the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW has no obligation to act when one of its members violates the convention, he said. Determining blame for the use of chemical weapons is the task of aÂ separate United Nations-OPCW mission in Syria, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, established in 2015. A spokesman for the Joint Investigative Mechanism referred questions to the OPCW. âThe secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil and will remain within our limitations as far as our mandate is concerned,â Uzumcu said. He said some states have suspicions that the Syrian government hid stocks of chemical precursors that might be used for the production of certain nerve agents, including sarin. But he said there was no conclusive evidence. Uzumcu said he regretted that relations had broken down between Russia and the United States on the OPCW executive council, which has the power to impose restrictions on Syriaâs membership and report it to the U.N. Security Council for non-cooperation. Uzumcu said his office was still seeking answers from the Assad administration about undeclared chemicals, aerial bombs and the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which has overseen Syriaâs chemical weapons since the 1970s. Syrian officials have maintained that no supporting documentation exists for the programme, which included dozens of storage, production and research facilities. POLITICAL DEADLOCK The Syrian crisis has had a profound effect on the way the OPCW operates. For two decades the organisation had reached consensus on most decisions, only calling on the 41-member executive council to vote on a handful of occasions. Syria marked a clear divide on the council. In 2016, when an inquiry by the United Nations and OPCW found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks, the United States sought to impose sanctions on those responsible through the executive council, but then dropped the proposal, the details of which were not made public. A text drafted by Spain condemned the attacksÂ but removed any reference to sanctions. It was supported by a majority, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain, but opposed by Russia, China, Iran and Sudan. The United States has since placed sanctions on hundreds of Syrian officials it said were linked to the chemical weapons programme. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian air base, but division on the OPCW governing body and at the United Nations has prevented collective action against the continuing attacks. Western governments accused Moscow of trying to undermine investigations by the United Nations and OPCW in order to protect Assad; Syria says the inspection missions are being used by Western countries to force regime change. Russian officials did not respond to a request for comment. SARIN FOUND Former U.N. chief weapons inspector Ake Sellstrom, who is now chief scientist for the U.N.-OPCW mission, said it is critical that perpetrators of chemical attacks are put on trial to deter future use of weapons of mass destruction. His team should be reporting back to the U.N. by mid-October, he said. A key unsolved question is what happened to the 2,000 aerial bombs that Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons, a process that would be costly and time-consuming. reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives âTo my knowledge, the Syrian government never furnished any details of where, when and how they changed the bombsâ payload,â said an OPCW-U.N. source, who took part in investigations in 2015-2016. He said there clearly was âa real, high-level, command structure behind this.â Syrian officials did not respond to requests for comment about the bombs. The team is also examining the deaths Â of almost 100 people on April 4 when a gas attack hit Khan Sheikhoun, a town in the rebel-held province of Idlib near the Turkish border. Samples taken from people exposed to the chemicals and tested by the OPCW confirmed sarin use. Meqdad, Syriaâs deputy foreign minister, said in the interview Syrian forces were not to blame, repeating earlier denials by Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem. Sellstrom said the presence of sarin so long after Syria was supposed to have dismantled its chemical weapons programme posed difficult questions. âIs there a hideout somewhere, or is there production somewhere and how much is available?â he said, adding that the reported use of aerial bombs in Khan Sheikhoun could point to the Syrian forces keeping some strategic weapons as well. The attack means either âthat someone can produce sarin today, or sarin has been hidden,â Sellstrom said. 2013U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reach an agreement on the elimination of Syriaâs chemical weapons. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon establishes United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic. Headed by Swedish scientist Ake Sellstrom and comprised of experts from the World Health Organization and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), it is tasked with looking into possible use of chemical weapons following reports of an attack in the northern town of Khan al-Assal. It confirms use of sarin in the Aug. 21 attack in the Damascus suburb Ghouta that killed hundreds. 2014OPCW Declaration Assessment Team begins work to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in Syriaâs declaration to the OPCW, which was supposed to include all aspects of its chemical weapons programme. By July 2016, after visiting Syria 18 times to inspect sites and meet with Syrian officials, it can ânot fully verify that Syria had submitted a declaration that could be considered accurate and complete.â OPCW establishes a Fact Finding Mission in response to persistent allegations of chemical weapon attacks in Syria, âto establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic.â The Fact Finding Mission concludes the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread. It is not tasked with assigning blame. 2015United Nations-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism in Syria is established to identify individuals or entities behind chemical weapons attacks. 2016Joint Investigative Mechanism concludes that Syrian government forces used chlorine as a chemical weapon in three cases and that Islamic State militants used sulphur mustard. OPCW executive council adopts decision condemning Syrian government and Islamic State for chemical weapons use after a vote that split the body and signaled an end to U.S.-Russia cooperation. 2017OPCW Fact Finding Mission concludes that sarin was used in an April 4 attack in the Khan Sheikhoun area of northern Syria, the most deadly use of the nerve agent in three years. It does not assign blame.

 ,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India has granted Pfizer Inc a patent for its powerful pneumonia vaccine Prevenar 13, in a blow to some health groups that said this would put the treatment out of reach of thousands in poorer nations. The decision by India’s patent office bars other companies from making cheaper copies of the vaccine and allows Pfizer to exclusively sell it in India until 2026. It’s a big victory for the U.S. drugmaker in a market that has the world’s largest number of pneumonia cases, a lung disease that kills nearly a million children a year globally. The decision also has international implications, as several poorer nations rely on India’s robust drugs industry to supply cheaper copies of medicines and vaccines. It also comes at a time of ongoing U.S. pressure on India to tighten its patent laws. The United States Trade Representative expressed concerns about India’s intellectual property laws in a report in June, and listed it among countries whose IP laws unfairly favour local companies. Pfizer’s vaccine protects children and adults from 13 types of pneumococcal bacteria, and a full vaccination course costs about $170 on India’s private market. India started giving out the vaccine for free under its national immunisation program earlier this year, but the rollout like that of most vaccines in the program, is in phases, so only about 2.1 million of the 25 million eligible people in the country will get it this year. The patent grant means Indian companies won’t be able to make the vaccine for domestic use, or exports. ""Manufacturers will have to find new routes to develop a non-infringing (pneumonia) vaccine, which may delay the availability of competing products in the pipeline from Indian producers,"" the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said in a statement. (bit.ly/2vU4rUk) MSF filed an objection to Pfizer's patent request last year on the grounds that a patent would deprive many developing nations of cheaper copies. (reut.rs/1QJEdXq) At least one Indian company, Panacea Biotec Ltd, is developing a cheaper form of the vaccine, and had also filed an opposition to Pfizer’s patent request last year. A source familiar with the matter said Panacea is considering filing a post-grant opposition. Separately, MSF said it was reviewing its legal options in the matter. Pfizer’s patent on the same vaccine was revoked by the European Patent Office last year, and is being challenged in South Korea and the United States, MSF said. The pharmaceutical giant has made the vaccine available at discounted prices under the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) - an international public-private partnership to improve access to vaccines in the world’s poorest countries. More than 50 countries are eligible to procure the vaccine through GAVI, according to the organization’s website. Following criticism over the high price of Prevenar 13, Pfizer reduced the vaccine price to non-governmental organisations last November, seeking to protect vulnerable people from illness in humanitarian crises. Pfizer welcomed the granting of the patent, saying Prevenar 13 took two-and-a-half years to produce, and was launched in India in 2010. “Pfizer remains committed towards further enhancing access of this vaccine in India, both in the market as well as through partnership with the Government to expand introduction in the public program,” a spokeswoman in India said.

 ,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"TORONTO (Reuters) - As an influx of asylum seekers crossing from the United States strains Canada’s immigration system, the country is ramping up its deportation of migrants, government data shows. Deportations of Mexicans, who have flocked to Canada in growing numbers after a visa requirement was lifted in December, was already 66 percent higher in the first eight months of 2017 than the total from the previous year. Deportations of Haitians, thousands of whom have crossed into Canada illegally in the hopes of avoiding deportation from the United States, have also soared. Canada has deported 474 so far this year, compared to 100 for all of 2016 when the government lifted its own ban on deportations to Haiti, in place since a devastating 2010 earthquake. Overall, 5,529 people have been deported as of Tuesday, compared to 7,357 for all of 2016, the data shows. Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board has called a rise in asylum-seekers through the U.S. border “unsustainable,” and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, fretting about another big surge in asylum claims, has been trying to warn people away. At the same time, Canada said this week it will be granting border-crossing asylum seekers swifter access to healthcare. They will also be eligible for work permits sooner. Refugee claimants are eligible for health coverage and work permits once their claims are processed, but that can take weeks or months. More than 10,000 asylum seekers have walked across the U.S. border into Canada to file refugee claims so far this year, including 3,800 into Quebec in the first two weeks of August alone, authorities have said. Canada is on track to record the most refugee claims in a decade. ","

 ,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"FATAL POLICE ENCOUNTER: This 2012 footage from a Taser-mounted camera shows Tom Schrock being stunned by the weaponâs electrified darts. Schrockâs wife had called 911 because he was having a mental health breakdown. He collapsed after being shocked and never regained consciousness. Taser-cam footage/Ontario Police Department Part 1: In the most detailed study ever of fatalities and litigation involving police use of stun guns, Reuters finds more than 150 autopsy reports citing Tasers as a cause or contributor to deaths across America. Behind the fatalities is a sobering reality: Many who die are among societyâs vulnerable â unarmed, in psychological distress and seeking help. By PETER EISLER, JASON SZEP, TIM REID and GRANT SMITH Filed Aug. 22, 2017, 11:48 a.m. GMT ONTARIO, California â As her husband stalked around the back yard, upending chairs and screaming about demons, Nancy SchrockÂ knew he was unraveling fast. She dialed the police. âHe needs to be in the hospital,âÂ she told a 911 dispatcher.Â It was 10:24 p.m. on aÂ Thursday in June 2012. âHeâs really, really, really bad.â Tom Schrock had struggled with depression and occasional drug problemsÂ throughout their 35-year marriage, and his manic episodes had grown more fierce since their oldest child died three years earlier of a heroin overdose. Police had visited the familyâs ranch-style house east of Los Angeles more than a dozen times. Typically, Tom was taken to the hospital, medicated and sent home after 72 hours. Not this time. Three officers answered the call, categorized by the dispatcher as a disturbance involving an unarmed man with mental health issues. Nancy took them through the house to the back; Santiago Mota, a veteran cop, drew his Taser. As officers came out the back door, Tom strode toward them, arms at his side, hands closed. They ordered him to stop, but he kept coming, muttering, âGet out.â Mota fired the Taser.

Mota followed, pressed the electric stun gun to Tomâs chest and fired again. The 57-year-old collapsed, gasping, unresponsive. He never regained consciousness. âI called for help,â Nancy said. âI didnât call for them to come and kill him.â The San Bernardino County Coroner labeled the cause of Schrockâs death âmultifactorial,â ruling Tom died from a lack of oxygen to the brain due to cardiac arrest following âlaw enforcement intervention.â First among the âcontributing causes:â use of a Taser. The SchrocksÂ sued Ontario police and the weaponâs manufacturer, Taser International Inc. They contended the stun guns wereÂ inherently dangerous, and accused the department of failing to properly train officers on the risks of using the weapons on people with mental health problems. The city settled for $500,000. The case against Taser was dismissed in June; both sides declined to say whether there was a settlement. As thousands of police forces across America have embraced Tasers, the outlines of the Schrock case have grown familiar: a Taser shot, an unintended death, a damage claim. But the episodeâs nuances â a mentally ill victim, a complex death investigation, a debate over the weaponâs use â tell a deeper story. Tom Schrockâs death is one tragedy in a larger constellation of fatalities involving Tasers explored by Reuters in a first-of-its-kind examination of deaths and lawsuits involving the stun guns. Reuters documented 1,005 incidents in the United States in which people died after police stunned them with Tasers, nearly all since the early 2000s â the most thorough accounting to date of fatal encounters involving the paralyzing stun guns. Many of the casualties are among society's vulnerable. A quarter of the people who died, like Schrock, were suffering from a mental health breakdown or neurological disorder. In nine of every 10 incidents, the deceased was unarmed. More than 100 of the fatal encounters began with a 911 call for help during a medical emergency. Itâs impossible to know precisely what role the Taser played in many of the deaths documented by Reuters.Â A review ofÂ more than 400Â of the fatal encounters â those in which court documents provide a relatively detailed account of what happened â indicates Tasers were the only form of force allegedly used by police in about one in four of the cases. The rest involved both Tasers and other forms of force. Most independent researchers whoâve studied the weapons agree deaths are rare when Tasers are used properly. But the probability of dying from a Taser shock in a police encounter may be incalculable, researchers say, citing a lack of official data on stun-gun use, the fact that deaths often have more than one cause, and other complexities. No government agency tracks fatalities in police incidents where Tasers are used. Autopsies are not public in some states. And coroners and medical examiners use varying standards to assess a Taserâs role in a death. The language of their rulings ranges from detailed and rigorous to thin and opaque. âI called for help. I didnât call for them to come and kill him.â Against thatÂ curtain of uncertainty, Taser International has insisted for years that its weapons are almost never to blame when someone dies after being stunned. Almost always,Â the company says, those deaths result from drug use, underlying physiological conditions such as heart problems, or other police force used along with the Taser. The company asserts that only 24 people have ever died fromÂ Tasers â 18 from fatal head or neck injuries in falls caused by a Taser strike, and six from fires sparked by the weaponâs electrical arc. Not a single person, the manufacturer says, has died from the direct effects of the Taserâs powerful shock to the heart or body. Official records suggest otherwise. Reuters obtained autopsy findings for 712 of the 1,005 deaths it documented.Â In 153Â of those cases,Â or more than a fifth, the Taser was cited asÂ aÂ cause orÂ contributing factor in the death, typically asÂ one of several elements triggering the fatality. Most of the other autopsies cited a combination of heart and medical conditions, drug use and various forms of trauma. The deaths pose a challenge for U.S. law enforcement at a time when protests over police killings have spurred cities to seek safer ways to control combative subjects. The Taser â a weapon nearly universally embraced since the early 2000s as an alternative to firearms â is widely seen as crucial to safer policing. About 90 percent of Americaâs roughly 18,000 police agencies now issue Tasers. Tasers fire two darts connected to the stun gun by thin wires. When the darts hit a target, a pulsed current triggers a paralyzing neuromuscular response that gives police several seconds to restrain the subject. The gun can also be pressed directly against the bodyÂ âÂ the âdrive stunâ mode âÂ causing intense pain, but without the dartsâ paralyzing effects. Many officers have taken a Taser shock in training, and they attest to its agonizing power. âThe Taser caused my whole body to lock up,Â and the pain would compare to a whole-body charley horse,â Salt Lake County Deputy Sheriff Tiana Broos once testified. âI felt like I was going to suffocate.â Independent studiesÂ have found that when used properly, Tasers lower the rate of injury incurred by both police and the people they confront. The company estimates its weapons have been deployed more than 3 million times in the field. Taser keepsÂ its own log of deadly incidents involving its signature stun guns, which it declined to share. The 1,005 deaths identified by ReutersÂ total 44 percent more than the 700 reported by Amnesty International at the end of 2016, despiteÂ the news agencyâsÂ use of stricter criteria in determining which incidents to count. Taser says these tallies give an exaggerated picture of the weaponsâ hazards because they suggest Tasers caused all those deaths, when most involved other types of police force as well.Â The devices have saved tens of thousands of lives, the company says.Â All weapons carry risks, said Steve Tuttle, the companyâs vice president for communications, but Tasers are âthe safest force option available to law enforcement.â Tuttle also said the autopsy results collected by Reuters are unreliable because they were not âpeer reviewedâ âÂ a standard for studies published in medical journals, although not applicable in courts of law. The medical examiners and pathologists around the country who decided the official cause of death in those cases may not understand the weaponsâ physiological effects, he said, and may be âover-listingâ potential factors in their rulings to avoid being criticized for possible omissions. âUltimately, Taser is not responsible for educating every medical examiner on the subtleties of electrocution,â Tuttle said.  After Reuters explained its findings to Taser, the company sent an alert to law enforcement groupsÂ summarizingÂ some ofÂ the central points of this series, describing them as ânot newâ and promising to provide âkey resourcesâ to repudiate the reports. Taser International, which acquired the stun-gun technology in the 1990s, changed its name in April to Axon Enterprise Inc. The new name, the company said, reflects its expanding business mission, including police body cameras and software used to manage evidence. MENTAL HEALTH AND TASERS Taser won immense popularity for its devices through a singular marketing focus: Instead of resorting to lethal gunfire or potentially dangerous physical confrontations, it told police departments, they could control combative subjects with a paralyzing stun. Yet as the cases explored by Reuters reveal, stun-gun encounters can turn deadly. Often, those killed include people struggling with mental illness, emotional breakdowns or seizure disorders. Encounters with such peopleÂ have become more frequent as cuts in government-funded mental health services have thrust police into the role of first responders for those in psychological crisis. One in every 100 police calls involves a person with a mental health disorder, according to research by the American Psychiatric Association. Too often, experts say, officers see Tasers as a go-to weapon in those circumstances. âCops have been turned into mental health workers on the street,â said Ken Wallentine, former chief of law enforcement for the Utah Attorney General, who advises police departments on use of force. âI fear that some police training and some police practices have allowed the crowding out of persuasion,â he said, âand the Taser has become the default tool.â Under law, it is up to police departments, not the manufacturer, to mandate when cops should deploy stun guns;Â a handful of states, such as Connecticut, have codified general rules of use. Some federal courts have held that Tasers should only be used on actively aggressive subjects, a view being adopted by a growing number of departments.Â And the Police Executive Research Forum, a law enforcement think tank, advises against using Tasers on âpersons in medical/mental crisis.âÂ But police policies vary widely. Taser itself has sent mixed messagesÂ about using its weapons on the mentally ill, Reuters found in an examination of legal filings andÂ of hundreds of pages of warnings and training materials issued by the company over the past 15 years. When Tasers began gaining popularity with police in the early 2000s, the company touted the weapons as an effective and relatively safe way to control people suffering a mental health crisis or intoxicated by drugs or alcohol. âWe did see those as potential uses of the device,â Taser President Rick Smith said in a 2007 deposition. In materials provided to police trainers in 2004, Taser said its stun gun was âbecoming widely accepted as the premier toolâ for police units that deal with âemotionally disturbed persons.â In recent years, the company has been more cautionary. Taser issued revised training materials in 2013 that advised police to avoid shocking someone âwho is actually or perceived to be mentally ill.â But that guidance, offered on the 66th slide in a 231-slide âUser Courseâ presentation, was characterized as a liability consideration â not a safety issue. The companyâs official warnings to law enforcement make no mention of people with mental illness. Instead, they caution against using Tasers on people who exhibit âextreme agitationâ and âbizarre behavior.â For police on the street, figuring out who meets those criteria can be daunting, officers and police lawyers say. Assessing someoneâs mental state on the fly is âone of the most difficult things an officer has to do,â said Eric Carlson, a training and counseling officer at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. Santiago Mota, the Ontario, California, police officer who fired the Taser against Schrock,Â said in a deposition he was unaware Schrock was mentally ill upon arriving at the familyâs home. The police dispatcher had listed the call as a â5150 hold,â code for a forced detention for mental evaluation. Mota said he missed the alert. âBy the time I'm arriving, I don't â I don't hear â5150,â â Mota said.Â After being stunned, Schrock went into ventricular fibrillation, a condition marked by a wildly erratic heartbeat. He died seven days later.Â The coroner found he had an array of heart problems, some likely exacerbated by a period of methamphetamine use two decades earlier, when he was caught making the drug and sentenced to probation. Schrock, a hospital technician for much of his working life, was a gentle father who frequently took his children on camping trips and hikes when they were younger, Nancy said. âI mean, that was the love of my life, the father of my kids, and my life will never be the same again,â she said. The Ontario Police Department declined to discuss the case or make Mota available for an interview. Taser spokesman Tuttle acknowledged concerns about using the companyâs weapons on the mentally ill. âYeah, there are at-risk groups, and that is why we identify them,â Tuttle told Reuters. The use of Tasers on people in mental health crises âcertainly is a topic thatâs out there.â Still, Tuttle said, the companyâs warnings do not prohibit Taser use on people in mental distress. âIt doesnât say, âYou shall not use this on someone that may be emotionally disturbed.â â Taserâs warnings are âguidelines,â Tuttle said, and it is up to police departments and their officers to decide when to use the weapons. Courts have largely endorsed that position, finding that police are responsible for policies on Taser use. Little research exists on Taser use against people in mental health crises and other vulnerable individuals.Â Thatâs in part because of ethical constraints on scientists, said Jena Neuscheler, co-author of a Taser study by the Stanford University Criminal Justice Center. âWe donât know how it impacts people who have a mental illness, who are under the influence of drugs, who have a heart defect, who might be pregnant,â she said. âWe canât test it on those populations.â The Stanford study foundÂ that Tasers shouldnât be used on significant swaths of the population. TheÂ center analyzed about 150 studies and concluded Tasers are safe âfor use on healthy individuals who are not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, are not pregnant, and do not suffer from mental illness â so long as the individual receives only a standard five-second shock to an approved area of the body.â Â âDONâT TASE HIM!â MacAdam Lee MasonÂ looked dazed as he stumbled outside the Vermont home he shared with Theresa Davidonis and her children â the sort of behavior they recognized as typical when he was recovering from a seizure. The state police surrounding the coupleâs house that June afternoon in 2012 saw things differently. Mason was 39,Â an artist who had struggled with seizures and mental illness since a brain injury in a high-school car accident. Troopers had visited the house earlier that afternoon after he had called a counseling center to report heâd had a seizure and was angry enough to kill himself â or someone else. Davidonis sent them away, explaining that Mason often was irrational and incoherent after seizures. He posed no threat and had no weapons, she added. Now the police had returnedÂ for a follow-up check. Davidonis was gone and no one answered the door. As troopers took positions around the property, suspecting Mason was hiding in the surrounding woods, Davidonis pulled up, returning from an errand. Trooper David Shaffer set up behind a tree to the side of the house with an M-4 assault rifle. He spotted Mason crossing the yard, looking like he was in a âhaze,â Shaffer later told investigators. Shaffer approached Mason, gun at âlow readyâ position, and ordered him to the ground. Mason held up his hands and sat on the grass. But as Shaffer yelled at him to lie face-down, Mason stood again. âShoot me,â Mason said. Shaffer later said Mason seemed angry and moved toward him as if preparing to throw a punch â a description Davidonis disputes. As she watched, Shaffer switched from the rifle to his Taser. âI was screaming, âDonât Taser him! He just had a seizure, youâll kill him!â âÂ Davidonis said. âBut the cop just fired and the barbs hit him in the chest and he kind of crumbled, like slow motion.â Mason went into cardiac arrest and died. The medical examiner attributed the cause of death to the Taser:Â âsudden cardiac death due to conducted electrical weapon discharge,â using a generic term for stun gun. Masonâs mother, Rhonda Taylor, carries his ashes with her in a small wooden box he painted with a landscape scene. âYou know, when a police officer kills someone like this, someone whoâs mentally ill, it kills their mother, too,â she said. After Masonâs death, Taylor helped the American Civil Liberties Union lobby state legislators for restrictions on Taser use. In 2014, Vermont passedÂ a lawÂ limiting the circumstances under which police can deploy Tasers and setting training standards for officers who carry them. The law, following similar legislation in Connecticut, lays out parametersÂ for using Tasers on people struggling with mental illness or emotional crises.Â For instance, Tasers should only be fired at people showing âactive aggression.â âThey canât just use a Taser on people because they donât want to take the time to talk with them,â Taylor said, sobbing. âNobody should have to lose a child like this.â The Vermont State Police declined to comment or to make Shaffer available for an interview, citing ongoing litigation with the family.Â Prosecutors concluded the trooper acted lawfully. The challenges of interacting with people in mental crises have prompted many police departments to adopt âcrisis intervention training,â or CIT. Pioneered in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1988, the training emphasizes de-escalation strategiesÂ in lieu of using a Taser or other kinds of force. A decade ago, an estimated 400 police departments provided CIT programs, according to the U.S. Justice Departmentâs Bureau of Justice Assistance. Today, the American Psychiatric Association puts the number closer to 3,000. Still, that comprises a fraction of the estimated 18,000 local, state and federal police agencies in the United States. In 2016, the International Association of Chiefs of Police urged all police forces to set a goal of having at least 20 percent of their officers undergo CIT training. The Phoenix Police Department began CIT instruction in 2000 and has put more than 500 officers through the training. Since 2015, all officers also must take an eight-hour course on managing people with mental illness. The departmentâs Taser use has dropped sharply, from 330 deployments a year in 2006 to 158 in 2016. Thereâs no way to know for sure how much of the decline stems from the training, said Sergeant Vince Lewis, who teaches Taser and use-of-force classes. But Tasers are now seen more as a last resort in Phoenix, he said. âThe best tools in our toolbox when weâre dealing with somebody suffering from mental illness are time and talk.â âSOMEONEâS TRYING TO KILL USâ People in a mental crisis often are confused and frightened when police confront them. Tensions can escalate rapidly, especially if officers are not properly trained, said Denise Juliano-Bult, who helps coordinate research on services forÂ the mentally ill at the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health. âThat can lead to unfortunate incidents where the people with mental illness can get injured and the police can get injured,â she said. On an April evening in 2015, Lucky Phounsy, 32, called 911Â from the home of his mother and stepfather in San Diego, California. Phounsy had become delusional after four days without sleep â a result, the family suspects, of drugs taken at a music festival days earlier. âThere was no effort to talk to him. It was shocking.â Phounsy was at the house with his wife, Loan Thi Minh Nguyen, to celebrate their sonâs second birthday. As the evening progressed, Phounsyâs stepfather, Greg Kelley, and Loan decided to drive him to the emergency room to be sedated. At 10:13 p.m. Phounsy called 911. âI have an emergency here,â Phounsy said. âSomeoneâs trying to kill us.â Kelley took the phone. âThe person that called you is getting very, very paranoid. We are trying to get him to the hospital.â He told the dispatcher there were no weapons in the house. In an interview, Loan and Kelley said Phounsy was âtremendously relievedâ when San Diego County Sheriffâs deputies arrived. Officers introduced themselves and immediately asked Phounsy to turn around and raise his hands, the family said. He started to comply but then asked them why. One officer cursed; another told him to place his hands behind his back and placed one hand in a handcuff. âWait a minute. Iâm the one who called you. Why are you asking me to put my hands up?â Phounsy asked, according to Kelleyâs deposition. At that, the second officer shot him with a Taser. âThere was no effort to talk to him,â Kelley said. âIt was shocking.â Stunned a second time, the family says, Phounsy became combative. He fought with the male officer, fracturing the lawmanâsÂ nose. More officers arrived, and Phounsy was hit with batons, hogtied and put into an ambulance, the family says. On the way to theÂ hospital his heart stopped. He later was pronounced brain dead and died after the family removed him from life support. The outcome could have been different, Loan said, âif there was a dialogue. There was no dialogue.â The police said Phounsy turned violent before the Taser was used and officers had to stun him several times to subdue him. The deputy who stunned Phounsy had received psychiatric emergency response training, a program similar to CIT that emphasizes de-escalating mental health emergencies. A report issued by San Diego County said Phounsyâs body contained trace amounts of cannabis and ecstasy, but no other illegal drugs. Nevertheless, Deputy Medical Examiner Steven Campman ruled the death an âaccidentâ â a heart attack after physical altercation and restraint, due to a âstimulant drug-related psychotic state.â Campmanâs office declined to comment. Phounsyâs family sued San Diego County and other first responders, citing excessive Taser use, among other factors. The defendants deny responsibility; the case remains open. âDONâT BE SCAREDâ Like scoresÂ of other fatal police encounters involving Tasers, Lucky Phounsy's death began with a call for help. Nearly half of those 911 calls came from a family member, including more than two dozen from mothersÂ or fathers, at least 10 from spouses or partners, and five from sisters or brothers, court records show. On the evening of Dec. 16, 2014, James Williams told his wife, Asasa,Â he felt a cold coming on. To help him sleep, he mixed over-the-counter flu medicine with a âhot toddyâ â a shot of rum and tea. âIâm going to knock this out,â he said. Around 4 a.m., he startled Asasa awake. His stomach hurt and he was cold. Asasa checked the thermostat in their four-bedroom home in Douglasville, Georgia: 80 degrees. Williams pulled the sheets tight over him and went into an epileptic seizure. A singer-songwriter and father of three boys, Williams, 43, had experienced a seizure before. Two months earlier, while at work delivering electrical supplies, he crashed into a telephone pole after going into convulsions. Emerging from his truck, Williams became confused and combative, running into traffic. Six or seven officers subdued him. Later in the hospital, he remembered nothing. This time, Asasa recalled the doctorâs instructions: Lay him on his side. Then she dialed 911. âMy husband, I believe, he had a seizure,â she told the dispatcher. âI need some help.â After she hung up, Williams paced and made a high-pitched groan she had never heard in 14 years of marriage â âkahhhh, kahhhhh.â âYou just had a seizure â¦ donât be scared,â she told him. He wrestled away, nearly knocking over a television. He banged his head on a toilet seat and pulled off his shirt. Asasa shouted for her son,Â Bashir, 18, to call 911 again.Â âTell them to hurry!â The dispatcher asked if Williams was violent. âNo,â Bashir said, âjust making a weird noise, acting weird.â Mike Shuler, a paramedic for 30 years, arrived about 4:39 a.m. with colleague Mark Wardlaw. Bashir waved them into the house. Asasa had just pulled her two younger sons, 6 and 13, from the upstairs bedroom Williams had entered. Shuler said he saw Williams hurl himself head-first over a childâs bed, smashing the wall and cutting his forehead. Bashir said the two men tackled his father. When Douglas County Sheriffâs Deputy Kenny Turner arrived at 4:41 a.m., Shuler was in the room alone with Williams, who had broken free, according to law-enforcement records and the familyâs lawsuit. âHeâs having a seizure,â Asasa told Turner, according to audio recorded by the deputyâs uniform microphone. Turner later told investigators he was unaware Williams was having a seizure and readied his Taser because Williams was combative. Turner shouted âstopâ and ârelax.âÂ He tried to wrestle Williams into handcuffs, pushing him onto the bed. But Williams got back up. âYou are going to get Tased,â Turner said.Â âStop acting wild.â He fired the Taser darts at Williams, knocking him to the bed. Williams stood again. âStop moving!â Turner shouted, pulling the trigger to deliver another five-second shock, state investigative records show.Â Williams, tangled in the electrified wires, fell again, his head hitting the floor. âHelp,â Williams said. âHelp, help.â As Williams rose, his head struck a bed railing, Turner said. Turner pulled the trigger again, knocking Williams down long enough to handcuff him. Shuler bound his legs and another paramedic administered two doses of midazolam, a sedative. Williams lost consciousness and died that evening. The coroner ruled the death ânatural,â caused by âcerebellar intracerebral hemorrhage.â Last August, Williamsâ family sued the Douglas County fire and police departments, along with Taser International.Â The family dropped the case against Taser after the company provided documents showingÂ it had warned against using its weapons on people prone to seizures, said family lawyer Jeff Gewirtz. Taser also questioned whether both the weaponâs electrified barbs made contact, noting the coroner found evidence of just one, and argued it was ""highly unlikely"" the stun gun delivered any charge that contributed to the death. But Turner told investigators the Taser jolts knocked Williams down. âSomehow it worked,â he said. Taser itself has saidÂ its weapons can deliver a paralyzing charge even if both darts don't touch skin. The Douglas County Sheriffâs OfficeÂ use of force policy prohibits police from using Tasers on people with âknown neuromuscular disorders such as multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy or epilepsy.â District Attorney Brian Fortner found no evidence of criminal conduct by the officers. âMr. Williams died of natural causes,â he wrote. The department did not respond to an interview request. Deputy Turnerâs personnel records show that, in the decade prior, he took 153 training courses covering 1,202 hours.Â Of those courses, one was dedicated to dealing with the mentally ill. It lasted one hour.Â He didnât receive CIT instruction. Turner did log 13 hours of Taser training over a decade. Asked in sworn testimony if he could recall any warnings in the training to avoid shocking a person afflicted with epilepsy or a seizure disorder, he paused. âI donât remember any of that.â Additional reporting by Lisa Girion and Paula Seligson In a first-of-its-kind review of court documents, police reports, other public records and news accounts, Reuters compiled the most comprehensive publicÂ accounting to date of deaths and litigation that followed police use of Tasers. In all, reporters documentedÂ 1,005 people who have died in the United States following encounters with police in which Tasers were used either on their own or, more often, as part of a larger mosaic of force. In at leastÂ 153 of those cases, Reuters found, coroners or medical examiners cited the Taser as a cause or contributing factor in the death. The number of deaths linked to U.S. law enforcement incidents involving Tasers, often with other force Among the 1,000-plus fatalities, Reuters found that wrongful death lawsuits were filed in at least 442Â of the incidents. Nearly all the suits âÂ 435 âÂ were filed against police and the municipalities that employ them. Taser International, the manufacturer, was named as a defendant in 128 cases. There were three lawsuits, from 1983 to 1987, against Taser Industries Inc, a business Taser International acquired in 2003. The company recently changed its name to Axon Enterprise Inc. ReutersÂ conducted hundreds of interviews with current and former police officials, lawyers involved in lawsuits involving Tasers, academics and other independent experts, relatives of people who died and Taser International. Here are the sources of information and the methodologies behind the projectâs key findings: Deaths following Taser shocks:To identify these cases, Reuters examined thousands of court records, police reports and news stories from 1983,Â the earliest mention of a fatality identified in a police encounter where a Taser was used, through July 31, 2017. Legal records were searched using Westlaw, a database of legal filings owned by Thomson Reuters, as well as Lexis and Pacer, two other databases of legal documents. Reuters also researched news accounts nationwide. The news agencyÂ reviewed reportsÂ by other organizations that tracked deaths in incidents where Tasers were used, including the human rights group Amnesty International, and advocacy websites Truth Not Tasers and Fatal Encounters. Reuters used stricter criteria than those organizations to decide which cases to count, so our tally does not include more than three dozen deaths those organizations identified. Nevertheless, Reutersâ listing ofÂ 1,005Â deaths is 44Â percent larger than the 700 reported by Amnesty at the end of 2016. Among the cases Reuters opted not to include were those in which a person was shot with a firearm after being stunned by a Taser. The only exceptions were six cases in which the Taser use was cited in a wrongful death lawsuit or an autopsy specifically ruled out the gunshot as the primary cause of death.Â Reuters also counted only thoseÂ deaths in which it could identify the victimÂ and confirm through court documents, police reports, other public records or credible media accounts that a Taser was used. reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives Got a confidential news tip? Reuters Investigates offers several ways to securely contact our reporters If Reuters was unable to confirm Taser use,Â the incidentÂ wasnât counted.Â For example, some lists of fatalities involving Tasers include Mark Lee, who died in a 2006 encounter with police in Rochester, New York. News reports said police disputed the familyâs assertion that a Taser was used. Reuters omitted the case after contacting the familyâs lawyer, who said the Lees were ultimately unable to prove âdefinitivelyâ a Taser was used. Reuters included 17 cases in which people died from choking on bags of drugs while being stunned. The news agency surveyed a number of pathologists on whether a Taser shock would increase the likelihood of choking under those circumstances. They offered no clear consensus but most suggested it was possible. Taser said the only deaths that can be attributed to its stun guns involve 24 casesÂ in which the person died from secondary injuries, such as falls or fires caused by the Taser. Taser International also tracks deaths in police incidents where its weapons were used and catalogs that information in a âdatabase of in-custody deaths proximal to TASER use,â according to court testimony from company officials. The companyÂ declined to share the data with Reuters.Â SeventeenÂ of the deaths on the Reuters list occurred before Taser International acquired the technology from its inventor in 1993Â and began marketing its first version of the weapons. Autopsy findings:Taser International has long argued that its weapons are almost never to blame when someone dies after being stunned. Reuters sought autopsy results and cause-of-death rulings for all the 1,000-plus deaths.Â Many states restrict access to autopsy records and do not release them publicly. But Reuters was able to collect official cause-of-death rulings for more than 70 percent of the deaths it identified â 712Â cases. Tasers were listed as a cause of death or a contributing factor or condition in 153Â of those cases. Most of the other autopsies cited a combination of heart and medical conditions, drug use and various forms of trauma. Many of the autopsies reviewed by Reuters listed the cause of death as ""multi-factorial."" The autopsies that cited a Taser shock often included it as one of several components of their ruling. To collect the autopsies, Reuters filed public records requests in dozens of states and scores of counties. In 278Â cases, Reuters obtained full autopsies. In 348Â others, medical examiners, coroners or other local officials provided the cause-of-death findings, often with contributing factors or conditions, in writing or by reciting the information over the phone. In 86Â cases, Reuters obtained cause of death information through other official records, such as reports from state investigations or court documents. Wrongful death lawsuits:Reuters set out to identify all wrongful death suits filed in cases where someone died after being stunned with a Taser during a police encounter. The process involved constructing a series of queries using different parameters to search Westlaw, Lexis and Pacer. Reuters also combed through state court filings in dozens of states to find lawsuits. Those searches yielded several thousand suitsÂ in which a stun gun was mentioned. Reporters then reviewed all the search results and identified 442Â casesÂ in which Tasers factored into a wrongful death claim, sifting out injury suits and the vast majority of suits in which the subjectÂ was shot with a firearm. In 120 of the 442 cases, or 27 percent, the Taser was the only force alleged in the claim; in the remaining 322 cases, the stun guns were alleged to have been part of a broader array of police force. Most of those cases were filed in federal court. Because not all state courts are included in Westlaw and other legal databases,Â the 442 figureÂ likely omits some state cases. Settlements and awards:More than three-fifthsÂ of the 366 concluded lawsuits against governments, or 232,Â resulted inÂ judgments or settlementsÂ for the plaintiffs: 220 settlements and 12 judgments.Â Reuters was able to determine the payouts in 193 cases, totaling $172 million paid by cities and their insurers. That dollar figure does not include three dozen cases in which settlements remained confidential or were unavailable. The settlement and judgment totals were obtained by filing public records requests with dozens of municipalities. In some cases, government agencies declined or did not respond to requests for data. In some of those instances, Reuters was able to confirm settlement amounts through court records, lawyers or media reports. Because Reuters was not able to identify settlement amounts in dozens of cases where terms werenât disclosed, the actual total of payouts by local governments and their insurers is certainly higher than $172Â million. Taser declined to share detailed information on which cases it has settled and how much it has paid to satisfy those settlements.

 ,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd said on Monday it will fund and develop multiple original drugs in partnership with Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, expanding its business scope beyond copies of existing biologic drugs. Original biotech drugs represent a business ramp-up for Samsung Bioepis, which has so far invested $1.3 billion in drug development since being founded in 2012 and has received approvals for two biosimilar drugs in Europe and one in the United States. Bioepis is part of South Korean conglomerate Samsung Group’s biopharmaceutical bet as a future growth engine, along with contract manufacturer parent Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd. The partnership will develop novel biologic drugs in “unmet disease areas”, Bioepis said in a joint statement with Takeda, adding the two companies will immediately begin working on a treatment for severe acute pancreatitis. They declined to disclose other terms of the development program. Interest in biosimilars has soared in recent years as copies of some of the world’s best-selling biologic medicines have hit the market at big discounts. As a relative latecomer to the industry, Samsung Bioepis quickly proved its development capabilities by becoming the first firm to launch a biosimilar version of Amgen’s blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel in Europe last year, generating over $250 million in sales so far, according to Bioepis. It has also received both European and U.S. approval for its copy of Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade, and awaits European regulatory decisions for its biosimilar versions of AbbVie Inc’s Humira and Roche’s Herceptin. [nL3N1KF4OL][nL4N1A40FZ][nL4N1A40FZ] Samsung Bioepis will also seek partnerships with other drugmakers to become an original drugmaker that can conduct all phases of novel biologics development in 10 years, spokesman Mingi Hyun said. Samsung Group hopes the biosimilars business will develop into a new growth driver as global demand for smartphones slows, weighing on the outlook for the mobile business of flagship firm Samsung Electronics.

 ,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - South Korea lifted a ban on imports of U.S. poultry and eggs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Thursday, allowing American farmers to resume sales to the Asian country that suffered an egg shortage caused by its worst-ever bird flu outbreak. South Korea was importing more U.S. eggs earlier this year as it fought its own outbreak of bird flu. But in March, the country limited U.S. poultry imports after the first U.S. case of bird flu of the year was detected on a commercial chicken farm in Tennessee. Prior to that, Americans “were putting table eggs in there like they were going out of style,” said Jim Sumner, president of the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council, a trade group. “They are in desperate need still,” he said. South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, was hit hard by the deadly H5N8 bird flu strain after the first case was confirmed in November, leading to a record culling of more than 37 million farm birds, more than a fifth of its total poultry population. Last month, South Korea’s government downgraded its bird flu alert by one notch from the highest level, after more than a month passed without new cases. South Korea bans U.S. poultry imports when the United States detects any cases of bird flu. The USDA is now working to convince South Korean officials to limit future restrictions on shipments to the geographic regions in which the virus is detected. “Korea’s lifting of its most recent ban is an important move for our poultry and egg industries, but it is still just the first step,” USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement. In 2014, the last full year without any bird flu-related U.S. trade restrictions in place, South Korea purchased $122 million in U.S. poultry products, including eggs, making it the United States’ tenth-largest market, according to the USDA. Last year, South Korea’s imports from all countries exceeded $350 million in 2016, but only $39 million came from the United States. ","

 ,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"(Reuters) - Specialty pharmacy firm US Bioservices Corp has agreed to pay $13.4 million to settle U.S. government claims that it pushed patients to refill prescriptions of Novartis AG’s iron overload drug Exjade in exchange for referrals from the Swiss drugmaker. US Bioservices, a unit of drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen, agreed to pay $10.6 million to the federal government and $2.8 million to states, according to a filing on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court by Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim. The deal, which must be approved by the court, would resolve a civil lawsuit filed by Kim earlier on Tuesday claiming that U.S. federal and state insurance programs were illegally billed for Exjade prescriptions that stemmed from kickbacks. AmerisourceBergen said in a previous filing with U.S. securities regulators that it was not admitting wrongdoing as part of the settlement. According to the lawsuit, from August 2010 to March 2012, US Bioservices encouraged patients to refill Exjade prescriptions by having its nurses call them with “one-sided advice,” emphasizing the dangers of not treating iron overload and downplaying the drug’s side effects. Exjade had been linked to severe side effects including kidney and liver failure and gastrointestinal bleeding, which have resulted in deaths, according to the lawsuit. US Bioservices also assigned a group of employees known as patient care coordinators to call patients and urge them to refill their prescriptions, the lawsuit said. US Bioservices competed with two other pharmacy companies that distributed the drug - BioScrip Inc and Express Scripts unit Accredo Health Group Inc - for patient referrals from Novartis. Novartis would dole out the referrals according to how many refills each pharmacy achieved, according to the lawsuit. As a result of the scheme, the government-run Medicare and Medicaid programs were billed for prescriptions “tainted” by kickbacks, violating federal law, according to the lawsuit. Novartis previously settled claims that it paid kickbacks to promote Exjade and other drugs for $390 million in 2015. BioScrip and Accredo also previously settled claims, collectively paying $75 million. The case is United States v. US Bioservices Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-cv-06353. ","

Andrew Beattie,08242017,Investopedia,08172017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Insider trading has been a part of the U.S. market since William Duer used his post as assistant secretary of the Treasury to guide his bond purchases in the late 1700s. In this article, we will look at some landmark incidents of insider trading. During the Roaring '20s, many Wall Street professionals, and even some of the general public, knew Wall Street was a rigged game run by powerful investing pools. Suffering from a lack of disclosure and an epidemic of manipulative rumors, people believed coattail investing and momentum investing were the only viable strategies for getting in on the profits. Unfortunately, many investors found that the coattails they were riding were actually smokescreens for hidden sell orders that left them holding the bag. Still, while the market kept going up and up, these setbacks were seen as a small price to pay in order to get in on the big game later on. In October, 1929, the big game was revealed to be yet another smokescreen. After the crash, the public was hurt, angry, and hungry for vengeance. Albert H. Wiggin, the respected head of Chase National Bank, seemed an unlikely target until it was revealed that he shorted 40,000 shares of his own company. This is like a boxer betting on his opponent – a serious conflict of interest. Using wholly-owned family corporations to hide the trades, Wiggin built up a position that gave him a vested interest in running his company into the ground. There were no specific rules against shorting your own company in 1929, so Wiggin legally made $4 million from the 1929 crash and the shakeout of Chase stock that followed. Not only was this legal at the time, but Wiggin had also accepted a $100,000 a year pension for life from the bank. He later declined the pension when the public outcry grew too loud to ignore. Wiggin was not alone in his immoral conduct, and similar revelations led to a 1934 revision of the 1933 Securities Act that was much sterner toward insider trading. It was appropriately nicknamed the ""Wiggin Act"". One of the most famous cases of insider trading made household names of Michael Milken, Dennis Levine, Martin Siegel and Ivan Boesky. Milken received the most attention because he was the biggest target for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but it was actually Boesky who was the spider in the center of the web. Boesky was an arbitrageur in the mid-1980s with an uncanny ability to pick out potential takeover targets and invest before an offer was made. When the fated offer came, the target firm's stock would shoot up and Boesky would sell his shares for a profit. Sometimes, Boesky would buy mere days before an unsolicited bid was made public - a feat of precognition rivaling the mental powers of spoon bender Uri Geller. Like Geller, Boesky's precognition turned out to be a fraud. Rather than keeping a running tabulation of all the publicly traded firms trading at enough of a discount to their true values to attract offers and investing in the most likely of the group, Boesky went straight to the source - the mergers and acquisitions arms of the major investment banks. Boesky paid Levine and Siegel for pre-takeover information that guided his prescient buys. When Boesky hit home runs on nearly every major deal in the 1980s - Getty Oil, Nabisco, Gulf Oil, Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Texaco - the people at the SEC became suspicious. The SEC's break came when Merrill Lynch was tipped off that someone in the firm was leaking info and, as a result, Levine's Swiss bank account was uncovered. The SEC rolled Levine and he gave up Boesky's name. By watching Boesky - particularly during the Getty Oil fiasco - the SEC caught Siegel. With three in the bag, they went after Michael Milken. Surveillance of Boesky and Milken helped the SEC draw up a list of 98 charges worth 520 years in prison against the junk bond king. The SEC charges didn't all stick, but Boesky and Milken took the brunt with record fines and prison sentences. Although not high-ranking in terms of dollars, the case of Wall Street Journal columnist R. Foster Winans is a landmark case for its curious outcome. Winans wrote the ""Heard on the Street"" column profiling a certain stock. The stocks featured in the column often went up or down according to Winans' opinion. Winans leaked the contents of his column to a group of stockbrokers, who used the tip to take up positions in the stock before the column was published. The brokers made easy profits and allegedly gave some of their illicit gains to Winans. Winans was caught by the SEC and put at the center of a very tricky court case. Because the column was the personal opinion of Winans rather than material insider information, the SEC was forced into a unique and dangerous strategy. The SEC charged that the info in the column belonged to the Wall Street Journal, not Winans. This meant that while Winans was convicted of a crime, the WSJ could theoretically engage in the same practice of trading on its content without any legal worries. In December 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it was rejecting ImClone's new cancer drug, Erbitux. As the drug represented a major portion of ImClone's pipeline, the company's stock took a sharp dive. Many pharmaceutical investors were hurt by the drop, but the family and friends of CEO Samuel Waksal were, oddly enough, not among them. Among those with a preternatural knack for guessing the FDA's decision days before the announcement was homemaking guru Martha Stewart. She sold 4,000 shares when the stock was still trading in the high $50s and collected nearly $250,000 on the sale. The stock would plummet to just over $10 in the following months. Stewart claimed to have a pre-existing sell order with her broker, but her story continued to unravel and public shame eventually forced her to resign as the CEO of her own company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Waksal was arrested and sentenced to more than seven years in prison and fined $4.3 million in 2003. In 2004, Stewart and her broker were also found guilty of insider trading. Stewart was sentenced to the minimum of five months in prison and fined $30,000. Although the cases in this article are glaring examples, insider trading is often difficult for the SEC to spot. Detecting it involves a lot of conjecture and consideration of probabilities. While it's possible that Boesky was that good at predicting takeovers, it was highly improbable. Truth be told, the SEC has made mistakes and accused the innocent in cases that are borderline, at best. This is one of the prices we pay to guard against insiders trading on information that the public doesn't yet know. That said, Stewart offers the best example of why it's best not to trade on material insider information – leaving the moral aspect aside. If she had simply held her ImClone stock, it would have hit the $70-$80 range during the Eli Lilly takeover, making her holdings worth around $60,000 more than what she sold out for. Instead, she was fined $30,000 and ended up in jail. The risks, in this case, definitely outweighed the returns. ",Top 4 Most Scandalous Insider Trading Debacles

Dan Mangan,08242017,CNBC,08172017,"A Utah-based hospital chain pledged Wednesday to slash the number of opioid pills prescribed for patients with acute pain at its facilities by 40 percent by the end of 2018. Intermountain Healthcare's pledge comes in the face of a worsening epidemic of painkiller and heroin abuse in the United States. In 2015, there were more than 33,000 fatalities from opioid overdoses recorded — almost half of which involved prescription painkillers. If nonprofit Intermountain achieves its goal, it will reduce the number of opioid tablets it prescribes to patients with acute pain in Utah and southern Idaho by more than 5 million each year at its 22 hospitals and 180 clinics. Intermountain said it believed it is the first American health system ""to formally announce such a significant and specific amount of reduction as a target."" Dr. Marc Harrison, president and CEO of Intermountain, said, ""We really want to make sure that we reduce the potential for abuse ... but still ensure that our patients have high-quality care."" Dr. Doug Smith, Intermountain's associate medical director, noted that nationslly there is a problem with health providers tending ""to write prescriptions for more opioids than patients need, and large quantities of medications are often left over after the need for pain relief is past."" That opens the door for patients abusing their own medication, or the pills being abused by relatives or friends of a patient. To reach its reduction goal, Intermountain will be using a ""data-driven approach"" spearheaded by a ""business intelligence tool"" that the health-care system developed to track prescriptions and develop guidelines for appropriate prescribing practices, Harrison said. Intermountain also already has trained about 2,500 of its caregivers as part of the opioid reduction initiative. Sales of prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999, despite the fact that ""there has not been an overall change in the amount of pain Americans report,"" according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Utah, where most of Intermountain's facilities are located, has been particularly hard hit by the opioid crisis, with the state being ranked anywhere from seventh to 12th in the nation for overdoses, Harrison noted. Intermountain, which has 850,000 members in the health insurance plan it operates, each year has some kind of interaction with 1.2 million people in Utah, which has a population of just 3 million. ""This is a big goal,"" Harrison said of the 40 percent reduction target. ""But our communities and the people in them are suffering, and we need to do something about that."" Harrison said that the prescription practices at Intermountain, which prescribes about 12.5 million opioid pills to patients with acute pain annually, have been ""no better, no worse"" than other health-care systems. But ""we can see that there's enormous variation"" in the amount of painkillers being prescribed by different doctors across Intermountain's system, Harrison said. ""What you're seeing is what happens when there are not a lot of guidelines"" about what an appropriate amount of pills are to be prescribed for various health situations, Harrison said. Given this variation and analysis of prescribing patterns by Intermountain's staff, ""they actually think that 40 percent [reduction] is a really good place to start ... there actually may be more room to move,"" Harrison said. The experience of Kaiser Permanente, a major health-care system based in California, suggests that Harrison may be correct. In 2009, Kaiser Permanente's Southern California division began an effort to reduce the number of patients who were getting high doses of opioids. That move was launched after a group of doctors in the system noticed that the opioid hydrocodone was the most prescribed medication in Kaiser Permanente's health management organization in Southern California, while another opioid, OxyContin, was also high on that list. ""People [were] getting prescriptions for a thousand pills,"" Dr. Steve Steinberg, a Kaiser physician, told Atlantic.com for a story about Kaiser's program published in March. ""The numbers were so striking that it led us to look into it,"" Steinberg told the news site. Kaiser Permanente has since expanded its opioid prescription initiative to its operations nationally. According to data from Kaiser's Dr. Sameer Awsare that was provided to CNBC, Kaiser Permanente's system nationally reduced opioid prescriptions by 40 percent from December 2014 to this past February. Awsare also said that it has decreased prescription amounts of OxyContin by 75 percent. The health system noted that OxyContin has a high potential for diversion and abuse because brand-name opioids have a higher street value.

Christine Wang,08242017,CNBC,08172017,"President Donald Trump has presided over a White House plagued by turnover amid controversy and tumult. His administration has seen a number of high-profile officials leave their posts sooner than expected. To be sure, each exit was preceded by its own set of foreboding signs and circumstances. But the departures are generally heralded by growing reports of warring factions within the Oval Office. Here's a running list of top officials who have left Trump's team, by choice or by force: Trump fired Yates after she directed Justice Department lawyers not to defend his first executive order restricting travel for people from seven majority-Muslim nations. The president slammed Yates, saying she ""betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States."" Yates previously served as deputy attorney general in the Obama administration. She then became acting attorney general, pending the confirmation of Jeff Sessions. Flynn left his role after days of intense scrutiny about his discussions with Russian officials prior to Trump's inauguration. The Washington Post reported that he discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with then-ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Yates later testified under oath that she warned the White House that Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. In his resignation letter, the former national security advisor admitted that he inadvertently misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his phone calls with Kislyak. Trump fired Bharara after the prosecutor refused to agree to the Justice Department's demand that he and 45 other U.S. attorneys submit their resignations. While it's not unusual for a new administration to appoint its own federal prosecutors, the holdovers are not typically ousted all at once. Bharara's removal was also unusual because it came months after a meeting with Trump at Trump Tower. After the meeting, the attorney told reporters that the then-president-elect had asked him to stay on in his role. Trump abruptly fired Comey amid multiple investigations into possible ties between his campaign and the Kremlin. The White House initially said Comey was removed on the recommendations of the top two officials in the Justice Department. But Trump later told NBC News that he would have fired the longtime federal agent ""regardless"" of what the department said. The president also said he was considering ""this Russia thing"" when he ousted Comey. Dubke wrote in a note to associates that he originally tendered his resignation on May 18. He said that at that time he offered to remain in the role through the remainder of the president's international trip. Dubke said he left his position for personal reasons. Spicer resigned after opposing the president's appointment of Anthony Scaramucci as communications director. The longtime Republican operative said Trump had asked him to stay in his role. His successor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said Spicer left to give the communications team a clean slate. After Dubke's resignation, Spicer had taken over some of the responsibilities of a communications director. Priebus ""formally resigned"" after the president repeatedly pressured him to exert order on a tumultuous White House. His exit came on the heels of Scaramucci's appointment as White House communications director. Despite multiple reports of tension, Scaramucci and Priebus insisted that they were friends. Scaramucci described their relationship as brotherly and that it's expected the two men would ""rough each other up once in awhile."" Many had speculated Priebus would leave the White House after Spicer's resignation. The two worked at the Republican National Committee before joining the Trump administration. The bombastic New York financier exited his post shortly after he unloaded on Priebus and then-chief strategist Steve Bannon in an expletive-laden rant to a New Yorker reporter. Bannon initially submitted his resignation on Aug. 7, a person close to him told The New York Times. The newspaper said the announcement of his departure had been delayed after violence broke out in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. Bannon, a nationalist firebrand, helped shape Trump's populist rhetoric that fueled his rise to the Oval Office. But in the weeks leading up to his exit, reports surfaced of Bannon's influence waning as the president grew increasingly angry with him. Price came under fire after Politico reported he used private jets at taxpayer expense, instead of less-expensive commercial flights. Price's exit came after he said he would reimburse taxpayers for a small fraction of the cost of his flights and vowed to not use charter planes in the future. Price was also reportedly on thin ice with top Trump administration officials who felt he did not do enough to support the last-ditch effort in Congress to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Powell served under national security advisor H.R. McMaster and was considered a close ally of the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Sanders said in a Dec. 8 statement that Powell had always ""planned to serve one year before returning home to New York."" The former Goldman Sachs partner appeared set to depart the administration on good terms. Sanders and Kushner both made statements saying Powell would continue to support the administration's Middle East policy but provided little detail. Powell succeeded K.T. McFarland as deputy national security advisor. Trump nominated McFarland for the role of ambassador to Singapore. Her confirmation process has been held up amid questions about her knowledge of Flynn's conversations with Kislyak. Newman handed in her resignation on Dec. 12 in order to pursue other opportunities, Sanders said in a statement. She had been one of the president's highest-profile African-American, female supporters. McCabe served briefly as acting director of the FBI, between James Comey's ouster and the hiring of current director Christopher Wray. His final year at the agency was fraught with political turmoil — mostly stirred by Trump and his supporters. They have heavily criticized McCabe's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, suggesting bias due to his wife's failed Virginia Senate bid in 2015. She ran as a Democrat and received nearly $700,000 from Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a close Clinton ally. McCabe stepped down immediately on Monday, Jan. 29, but will remain on the FBI payroll on ""terminal leave"" until March, when he is eligible to retire with full benefits. He was later fired less than 48 hours before his retirement. Porter, who aided White House chief of staff John Kelly in reviewing documents before they reached Trump's desk, voluntarily resigned shortly after the Daily Mail published allegations of abuse from two former wives. His first wife, Colbie Holderness, told the UK tabloid that Porter had inflicted physical and emotional abuse during their five-year marriage. She said that Porter had punched her in the face during a vacation, and provided a photo of the black eye she allegedly received from the assault. Porter had been urged to ""stay and fight"" by White House officials — including Kelly, Axios reported. In a statement following his resignation on Wednesday, Porter said the allegations ""are simply false,"" and that ""the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described."" Cordish assisted Trump's presidential transition team after the 2016 election through the so-called beachhead team, members of which filled roles prior to the appointment of official administration officials by the Senate. His work on the White House focused on technical innovation and government modernization, though he was perhaps better known as an ally Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. ""Reed has been invaluable to the Administration. His leadership on initiatives ranging from work-force development to Prison Reform to modernizing key VA services will have a positive impact for millions of Americans,"" Kushner told CNBC in a statement. Cordish told the Washington Post that he had not intended to work for the administration for more than a year. The first reports of Hicks' plan to resign came one day after she testified to the House Intelligence Committee about Russian potential involvement with the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. In that hearing, Hicks reportedly said that while she never lied about the Russia probe, she sometimes had to tell white lies as part of the Trump administration. She also reportedly refused to answer a number of questions about her involvement in drafting a misleading initial statement from Donald Trump Jr. regarding a 2016 meeting with Kremlin-connected lawyers in Trump Tower. Hicks had been entangled in White House scandals before she testified to the committee, however. When staff secretary Rob Porter resigned amid allegations that he physically abused his former wives, reports soon emerged that Hicks had begun dating Porter and that she may have helped draft his initial statement denying the allegations. Hicks joined the Trump campaign as a low-level aide before he announced his candidacy and rose through the ranks, eventually taking a leading role in crafting the White House's messaging. Cohn's departure came after Trump said he would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. A free trade advocate, Cohn had argued against tariffs in a February meeting with the president and industry executives, according to a person in the room. The former Goldman Sachs president helped shepherd tax overhaul, the administration's only major legislative achievement, which Trump signed into law in December. While Tillerson's resignation came suddenly, his uncomfortable fit in Trump's White House had been a near-constant feature of his tenure. Tillerson had clashed with Trump in private and in public. In July, Tillerson reportedly referred to Trump as a ""moron"" after a White House meeting. And in October, Trump tweeted that Tillerson is ""wasting his time"" trying to negotiate with North Korea on nuclear weapons. Just before he was ousted as secretary of State, Tillerson had cast the poisoning of an ex-spy in Britain as part of a ""certain unleashing of activity"" by Russia that the United States is struggling to understand – diverging from the White House's official response. Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil, had no prior public service experience when he accepted the role of America's top diplomat. Tillerson will be replaced by Mike Pompeo, formerly the director of the CIA. Deputy CIA Director Gina Haspel will take Pompeo's place as the head of the U.S. intelligence agency — the first woman ever to hold the position. McEntee was fired and reportedly escorted from the White House amid a Secret Service investigation into serious financial crimes. His security clearance has been ""in limbo for some time,"" a federal law enforcement official told NBC News. Shortly after being removed from his position as Trump's personal assistant, McEntee joined the president's 2020 re-election campaign as a senior advisor. While not technically a member of the Trump administration, Dowd worked closely with the White House as Trump's lead lawyer in the special counsel's Russia probe. ""I love the president and wish him well,"" Dowd told NBC News. Dowd had reportedly considered leaving Trump's legal team on multiple occasions, The New York Times reported. The Times, citing two people briefed on the matter, reported that Dowd believed Trump was increasingly ignoring his advice. It was unclear at the time of his resignation who would take over as the leader of Trump's legal team. Days before Dowd's departure, Trump brought Washington lawyer Joseph diGenova aboard the team. McMaster was the second national security advisor to leave the administration in just over one year. The army lieutenant general said in a statement that he is requesting retirement from the Army this summer, after which he will ""leave public service."" Since taking the position, McMaster has faced criticism from some Trump supporters who have attacked him as a ""globalist."" McMaster clashed with Trump when he said that the evidence that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election is ""incontrovertible,"" following indictments against 13 Russian individuals and three Russian entities. Shulkin had been under fire after an internal watchdog report revealed that the VA had improperly approved taxpayers footing the bill for a trip Shulkin's wife took with him to Europe last year. That same report found that Shulkin told a subordinate to handle personal plans for him and his wife during that trip, and that he improperly accepted tickets to the Wimbledon tennis tournament. The White House described Gribbin as a key player on the team that assembled Trump's infrastructure plan, which was unveiled in February. A White House official confirmed to CNBC that Gribbin is ""moving on to new opportunities"" now that the plan has been presented to Congress. Top economic advisor Larry Kudlow said Gribbin's ""expertise has added tremendous value to the Adminstration,"" and vowed that the National Economic Council will continue to push to implement the infrastructure plan. Bossert led the administration's efforts on security issues including mainland terrorist threats, cyber defenses and natural disasters, the White House said. As recently as Sunday, he was representing Trump's homeland security policies in television interviews. By Tuesday, however, the White House confirmed Bossert's plan to resign. ""The President is grateful for Tom's commitment to the safety and security of our great country,"" press secretary Sanders said in a statement. ""President Trump thanks him for his patriotic service and wishes him well."" A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNBC that the move ""seems like a natural turnover with a new [National Security Council] director."" John Bolton, a foreign-policy hardliner, started as Trump's national security advisor Monday, replacing H.R. McMaster. Cobb represented the White House in matters related to the special counsel's investigation into the Trump campaign. The New York Times first reported that Cobb was expected to be replaced by Washington lawyer Emmet Flood, whose prior experience includes representing President Bill Clinton in impeachment proceedings. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed Cobb's retirement shortly after the newspaper published its story. At the time Trump announced Pruitt's resignation, the embattled EPA secretary was at the center of at least a dozen ethics probes into his spending practices and workplace conduct at the helm of the agency. ""Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this,"" Trump tweeted. Trump tweet Scott Pruitt McGahn had served as the White House counsel since Trump's inauguration and had reportedly been a key player in Trump's ongoing tug-of-war with Mueller. The New York Times reported in August that McGahn had voluntarily submitted to interviews with the special counsel on multiple occasions totaling about 30 hours. McGahn's potential departure had been widely reported for months. Trump, announcing McGahn's departure, said the lawyer would be leaving after the confirmation vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. McGahn has led the administration's push to stock federal courts with young conservative judges. Trump tweet Trump announced Haley's resignation in the Oval Office in early October, saying she would be leaving at the end of 2018. The shock announcement came a few weeks after Trump attended the UN General Assembly in New York City. In remarks to reporters, Trump said that Haley told him months earlier that she wanted to take time off at the end of a one- or two-year period. Trump added that he hoped Haley would come back in a different role, telling her: ""You can have your pick."" Haley, a former South Carolina governor who is considered a rising political star in the GOP, had served in the Trump administration since its early days.

Dan Mangan,08242017,CNBC,08172017,"And there was just one. The entire United States, with the exception of a single small county in Ohio, is now on track to have at least one insurer offering Obamacare health coverage next year. That's a big change from earlier this summer when at different times a total of 82 counties lacked commitments from insurers who sell individual health plans for 2018. And the continued decline in ""bare counties"" provides more ammunition for Obamacare advocates arguing against Trump administration claims that the health-care program is failing and needs to be replaced immediately. The latest potential bare area to get coverage offered for next year was Menominee County in Wisconsin, where just 47 people buy Obamacare plans on the federal marketplace HealthCare.gov. Elizabeth Hizmi, a spokeswoman for Wisconsin's insurance commissioner, would not identify the insurer that in recent days agreed to sell plans in Menominee, saying ""at this time, service areas are not public."" Tweet Insurance regulators in Ohio are trying to get an insurer to step in and offer individual health plans in that lone ""bare"" area, Paulding County. ""The director is still working on it,"" said David Hopcraft, spokesman for Ohio Insurance Director Jillian Froment. Paulding County has only 334 people currently covered by an individual health plan sold on HealthCare.gov. Froment has several weeks left to line up an insurer to cover the county. Hopcraft, when asked what provisions Froment was considering for Paulding's existing Obamacare customers if an insurer does not step in, said, ""You know what, we're not there yet."" ""The director said in a recent interview that she was just hopeful,"" Hopcraft said. Ohio had been at risk of having 20 bare counties next year after the big insurer Anthem said in June it was effectively pulling out of the entire state in 2018. But Froment in late July announced that she had obtained commitments from five insurers that would guarantee coverage from at least one insurer in 19 of those counties. Since then, however, Froment has not been able to convince an insurer to cover Paulding County, which sits on the western edge of Ohio, bordering Indiana. ""That's a little bit discouraging,"" said Cynthia Cox, associate director for Kaiser Family Foundation's Program for the Study of Health Reform and Private Insurance. ""You would think one insurer would step in from a neighboring county to offer plans,"" Cox said, noting that such an insurer would be guaranteed a monopoly for Obamacare plans. But nationally, Cox said, ""the general trend has been a positive one"" as a steady stream of insurers stepped in to cover Obamacare customers. Cox said that over the course of the last several months 82 counties were at risk of not having an Obamacare insurer selling plans next year. Those counties contained 92,000 current Obamacare customers. The insurer Centene has been, by itself, responsible for offering coverage in more than 40 previously bare counties in 2018, including 25 counties in Missouri. Last week, Centene said it would cover the remaining 14 bare counties in Nevada next year. Despite that current positive trend in covering bare counties, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has continued to push out a negative message about Obamacare overall. HHS's pessimistic tone about the Affordable Care Act began after President Donald Trump took office. Previously, HHS had been Obamacare's biggest cheerleader. Earlier this year, HHS's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began issuing updated maps showing counties that lacked Obamacare insurers for 2018. On Monday, HHS spokesman Matt Lloyd issued a statement that noted the end of a federal Obamacare enrollment assistance program, and said, ""Obamacare failed to create a thriving, competitive market that offers the kind of coverage people want to buy at prices they can afford."" ""On Obamacare's exchanges premiums  continue to surge, insurers  continue to abandon wide swaths of the country, and choices  continue to vanish — an unfortunate reality for the American people who are required to buy Washington-approved health insurance or pay a fine,"" Lloyd said. Lloyd also highlighted an article in the Washington Free Beacon that noted that ""Obamacare's Enrollment Assistance Program spent more than $1,500 for each person it helped enroll last year."" ""By ending this program, which only managed to help 14,500 people sign up for Obamacare — 0.1 percent of total plan selections — CMS is saving taxpayers more than $22 million next year,"" Lloyd wrote. But Protect Our Care, a leading Obamacare advocacy group, on Tuesday cited the news that there remains only one bare county for 2018 to argue against HHS's messaging. ""Republicans keep saying that many people will not have access to health care plans and make discredited claims about a non-existent death spiral,"" Protect Our Care said in a statement. ""The claims have been debunked by the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office and now by the facts in the 2018 coverage map from Kaiser Family Foundation."" Anthem and other insurers that have pulled out of Obamacare markets have cited difficulties in selling individual plans at a profit, as well as uncertainty about the markets because of concern over Trump administration policies, for their decisions. Insurers have expressed fears the administration will not enforce Obamacare's individual mandate, which requires most Americans to have insurance, as well as worries that the administration will not fund key federal payments to insurers to compensate them for discounts offered to a majority of Obamacare customers.

In some parts of the country, it will barely last a decade. ""It's the benchmark everyone has in mind but it's important to be more specific, there's so much range across different states.

West-Ward Pharmaceuticals, the U.S. division of London-listed Hikma, increased the prices at the start of August by between 75 percent and 430 percent, for a mean of 237 percent, according to figures seen by the Financial Times. In the United States, generic drugmakers such as Hikma are able to dictate prices of their products that have a monopoly or face little competition, the FT said. Among the six drugs, West-Ward is either the only U.S. supplier or one of two manufacturers. The average wholesale price of a 60 ml bottle of liquid Atropine-Diphenoxylate, a common diarrhea drug also known as Lomotil, went from about $16 a bottle to $84, the FT reported.

"Alexandra Ossola, special to CNBC",08242017,CNBC,08172017,"With the exception of condoms, most forms of non-permanent contraception are under women's control. There's the pill, the patch, the implant, the IUD (hormonal or non-hormonal) and, less popular nowadays, the diaphragm. Now scientists are closer than ever to developing new techniques for male birth control ready for clinical trial. Yet some pharmaceutical companies are concerned a new birth control method for men has the potential to win as much as half the $10 billion market for female contraceptives worldwide and cut into the $3.2 billion of annual condom sales — businesses dominated by pharmaceutical giants Bayer AG, Pfizer and Merck. Nevertheless, scientists are pushing ahead — and the momentum and buzz in the field is reflecting fresh optimism. In the next year or so, researchers hope to start trials in humans using a technique called reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance, which has been under development in India for decades. RISUG works by wedging a thick substance into the vas deferens to prevent sperm from making their way through the pathway to be ejaculated. A few years ago the researchers behind it licensed their technology to an American foundation that used the knowledge to create Vasalgel. Thus far, it has been promising in trials done in rabbits and primates. Another compound, called gendarussa, which is derived from an Indonesian shrub, interrupts the way sperm enter an egg to fertilize it. Clinical trials in Indonesia have found that the compound is highly effective, with few side effects, though larger studies would be needed before the drug could be submitted for approval by the FDA. Throughout the past two decades, researchers have faced some major hurdles; primary among them are side effects and funding. Late last year, researchers published the results of a phase II clinical trial, commissioned by the World Health Organization, that evaluated a two-hormone drug designed to lower sperm count in men. The drug was effective, but the trial ended early because there were too many side effects and the hormone combination didn't work effectively in everyone. In 2012, researchers from the National Institutes of Health tested an injectable contraceptive of two hormones; their results were promising, and they will soon begin testing it in a larger population Other compounds also disrupt the production of sperm, but without hormones. CatSper, for example, can alter the function of sperm so they won't fertilize an egg without disrupting the rest of the man's reproductive system, though this is still in the research stage. JQ1, a compound initially used to block a protein implicated in various forms of cancer, was found to disrupt the production and motility of sperm; an article published last year in MIT Tech Review notes that it has not yet been tested in humans. A researcher at the University of Washington is testing a version of a compound called WIN 18,446, which interferes with the vitamin absorption necessary to make sperm. It was first tried in humans in the 1950s but was found to cause harmful side effects when combined with alcohol, according to Bloomberg Businessweek.

The story behind the new sickle cell drug 25 years in the making Another compound, called H2-gamendazole, prevents sperm from reaching their mature (and thus virile) form. In 2015 the compound was still being tested in animals; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had previously determined that more research was needed to make sure the compound didn't have any additional effects on women's bodies, Wired reports. But to some experts these sorts of chemical interventions are less than ideal. They take a long time to kick in and have more side effects than those that physically block the passage of sperm or interfere with how it fertilizes an egg, says Aaron Hamlin, the executive director of the Male Contraception Initiative, a nonprofit organization working to bring new male contraceptives to market. ""Our organization is not a fan of approaches that stop sperm production. We would rather not take that route because of the inherent delays,"" he says. Despite decades of development, few techniques have moved past initial phases of testing. Pharmaceutical companies have not been interested in developing a male contraceptive beyond what is already on the market. Efforts in the early 2000s from small pharmaceutical companies, such as Organon and Schering, have stalled. A spokesperson from Merck, which acquired Organon's parent company in 2009, says this is not an active area of research or interest. Bayer, which acquired Schering in 2007, reached a similar conclusion: ""Ultimately, the decision was made to halt male contraceptive research, and we currently do not have plans to pursue in the future,"" a spokesperson said via email. Experts have some ideas as to why big pharmaceutical companies might not be interested. According to Kenneth Kaitin, professor and director of the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, marketing a male contraceptive might be harder than some might think — it would only appeal to men in long-term heterosexual relationships with partners of reproductive age. And since the drug wouldn't be combating a rare, life-threatening illness but would rather serve patients who are already well, pharmaceutical companies would have to make it affordable to the average consumer. All in all, Kaitin says, they probably don't think they would make much money off this kind of drug. ""Getting women to stop taking her drug for a man to start taking his drug, that would take a lot of selling,"" Kaitin says. ""Ultimately, it comes down to capitalism,"" says Allan Pacey, a fertility expert at the University of Sheffield. And so far that has meant that male contraceptives don't make financial sense. It's also risky. A male contraceptive would serve a population that's already healthy with the goal of preventing pregnancy, for which men don't carry the physical risk. That would mean that regulators would have a very low bar for side effects. And for the intervention to work, it couldn't let even one viable sperm through—it just takes one to get a woman pregnant. But the argument that there's no market for male birth control is deeply flawed. Research has discovered that men, in fact, want more contraceptive options. ""A key aspect is that it gives men the opportunity to be involved in family planning. At the moment, they are excluded from being able to shoulder the burden,"" says Richard Anderson, a professor of clinical reproductive science at the University of Edinburgh. That especially makes sense for heterosexual couples in which the woman can't take birth control for medical reasons, such as a high risk of blood clots. Survey data reflects this openness to male contraceptives. Anderson, along with some collaborators, conducted a survey back in 2000 and found that 83 percent of men from various countries would take a contraceptive. A separate survey found that most women agreed that a male contraceptive was a good idea. The overall market for contraceptives is expected to balloon to $33 billion by 2013, according to another Bloomberg story. Giving consumers more options might not be a bad idea, after all. Smaller companies developing new products and techniques have a big, expensive hurdle between them and the market they hope to serve: clinical trials. No matter how promising these interventions may seem in the lab, clinical trials are needed to test their safety and efficacy before they can be submitted for regulatory approval (indeed, some of the techniques mentioned here are already going through clinical trials, though nothing has made it past the first few stages). But clinical trials are expensive and risky. The later-stage trials, which can involve hundreds or thousands of participants, are often outside the means of small pharmaceutical start-ups. To fund their development and testing, and without backing from big pharma, some small companies are receiving grants from large public health organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (in 2016 the organization doled out $600,000 for development of male contraceptives, according to MIT Tech Review) and the World Health Organization, which has funded several trials for hormonal interventions over the past few decades. Others partner with nonprofits to develop their drugs — the Parsemus Foundation, a nonprofit investigating a number of different drugs, is backing the trials for Vasalgel. As the companies push interventions through the early phase clinical trials, big pharma may get involved, after all. ""Pharmaceutical companies are looking to minimize risk while opening themselves up to large profits,"" Hamlin says. ""[In phase 2 and 3], most of the safety issues have already been parsed out and you can see how these things are working. The level of risk is lower. So pharmaceutical companies may look more seriously [into licensing the technology or acquiring the company]."" Experts were reluctant to predict which intervention would hit the shelves first. ""It's very hard to predict what is going to be the winner that gets to market first,"" Hamlin says. ""So long as we strategically put resources behind good approaches, this is something we can make happen,"" he says.

CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) has had a rough go of it during the past year. Over the last twelve months, shares in the pharmaceutical drug store chain and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) have dipped significantly, falling 19%. Rubbing salt in the wound is the fact that the S&P 500 has increased by 11% over the same time period, meaning CVS Health investors have lost to a basic S&P 500 index fund by 30 percentage points in a year's time. Ouch! The stock price has fallen as the business has struggled, losing important deals to rival Walgreens Boots Alliance and dealing with increasingly hot online competition from Amazon.com, Inc. Last November, CVS CEO Larry Merlo outlined a four-point plan for the company to return to healthy growth. The first step of the plan, as Merlo described it in the S&P Capital IQ transcript of the company's second quarter conference call, was ""leveraging our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans."" Since the plan was implemented, CVS has announced three new partnerships that seem to be of the scale and magnitude necessary to drive growth in the quarters and years ahead. CVS Health hopes its new partnerships can help drive growth. Image source: CVS Health Corp. UnitedHealth Group Inc's (NYSE:UNH) Optum is a health services business that uses technology to deliver integrated solutions. Late last year, CVS announced a new shared pharmacy platform with OptumRx, Optum's PBM, that serves 65 million customers and fills 1 billion prescriptions annually. Under the new platform, the two companies will be able to give employers better value for the health insurance plans they offer to their employees such as allowing OptumRx members fill their prescriptions at CVS locations for the same cost as they can through Optum's home delivery plan. For CVS, the idea is that some of OptumRx's massive customer base will fill their prescriptions at CVS stores, boosting foot traffic and hopefully driving front store sales. The program officially launched this July and, according to Merlo, the company has ""already seen some uptake from clients, and the pipeline of additional opportunity in the coming years is promising."" In June, CVS announced a partnership with Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) in another initiative that CVS hopes will drive traffic to its pharmacy and retail locations. Under this arrangement, Cigna members from self-funded employer-sponsored plans will be able to get discounts on preventive visits to CVS MinuteClinics and CVS Health-branded over-the-counter products. Eligible Cigna customers will also receive Health Tag Messages on their medication's prescription bags which can include anything from doctor instructions to information about Cigna's complementary benefits. As Merlo commented during the conference call, the deal ""leverages the CVS footprint"". Cigna has over 95 million customer relationships around the world, but it was unclear how many of those are eligible for benefits under this arrangement. It might be surprising to see Express Scripts Holding Company (NASDAQ:ESRX) on this list since it is one of CVS Health's chief competitors in the PBM space. That didn't stop Merlo from announcing a new partnership with the company in which CVS will serve as the retail anchor for Express Scripts' diabetes care value program, a performance-based program in which customers must meet certain medical adherence thresholds. Express Scripts also has a massive reach, with over 83 million members filling 1.4 billion prescriptions annually. CVS has an impressive number of assets it can leverage to reach out to new partners and deepen its existing relationships. These assets include over 9,700 retail stores  and 1,100 clinics. The sheer number of locations simultaneously gives CVS the advantage over nearly any other competitor in terms of accessibility and scale, making it an extremely attractive partner for insurance companies and PBMs. If CVS's existing deals drive traffic into the store, lifting front store and pharmacy sales in the process, don't be surprised to see more new deals soon. As Merlo put it in his prepared remarks during the company's second quarter conference call, ""As we look to return to healthy growth, we continue to be very focused on partnering with all payers to drive volumes and capture share, and these conversations have already yielded excellent results."" Management still maintains its long term guidance of 10% EPS growth over time, though the company has not yet given specific projections for next year. Given its projections, its relatively cheap valuation (its P/E ratio is less than 13.5), and its safe (and growing!) dividend, shareholders might want to give management time to see if its turnaround strategy will work. Even if CVS does not meet its own guidance, it seems to be one of the few stocks in the current market with a reasonable valuation and future growth prospects. If these partnerships can even add a little ""oomph"" to the company's top and bottom lines, investors might see market-beating returns for years to come. ","

The Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is more affably known as Obamacare, is arguably the hallmark legislation of former President Barack Obama. While it's been controversial since its passage, and remains so today, it's hit its primary target, which is to reduce the aggregate number of uninsured people in the United States. Before the implementation of Obamacare, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the uninsured rate was around 16%. Following its implementation, the uninsured dipped to right around 9%. This dramatic cut in the uninsured rate was credited to subsidies that allowed low-income individuals and families the opportunity to afford health insurance, as well as the individual and employer mandates that gave consumers and companies incentive to purchase health insurance, or offer health insurance options to employees. Image source: Obama White House via Flickr. Why are Obamacare premium increases suddenly going parabolic? Three front-and-center factors look to be to blame. The first concern for health insurers is there's a gigantic gray cloud overhanging one of the two critical subsidies for low-income households. Cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) are given to qualifying individuals and families earning between 100% and 250% of the federal poverty level. These subsidies are what help lower the cost of copays, coinsurance, and deductibles associated with going to the doctor or receiving medical care. Put plainly, some 7 million people would probably not be able to afford heading to the doctor without CSRs. Back in 2014, the Republican-controlled House sued Sylvia Burwell, who at the time was the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). The reason for the lawsuit was the alleged improper appropriation of CSR funds. The lawsuit argues that only Congress has the authority to appropriate funding for CSRs, which totals around $9 billion to $11 billion annually, but that it hadn't been apportioning this funding. Image source: U.S. Department of Homeland Security via Flickr. In 2016, District of Columbia Judge Rosemary Collyer ruled in favor of the Republicans, but immediately stayed her order with the expectation that the Obama administration would appeal, which it did. That appeal continues to this date, although President Trump has appointed a new Secretary of the HHS, leaving the GOP to essentially continue a lawsuit against itself. President Trump has argued that he would use CSRs as a bargaining chip to get an Obamacare repeal passed in Congress. All Trump would have to do is drop the appeal of Collyer's verdict, and CSR funding would cease. Health insurers, not knowing what'll happen to this lower-margin but guaranteed income source known as CSRs, have been raising premiums to account for this uncertainty. Presumably, higher premiums will take into account those who receive care but are unable to pay their fair share of costs. A second reason Obamacare enrollees should expect to see their premiums skyrocketing in 2018 is that the Shared Responsibility Payment (SRP) isn't working. The SRP is the penalty individuals are supposed to pay for not purchasing health insurance. It's the financial incentive that's designed to give holdouts a forceful nudge into buying insurance. However, there's a very wide gap between the actual cost of the penalty for not buying health insurance, and the average premium cost for a full year of coverage. Image source: Getty Images. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that the average household SRP for not purchasing health insurance in 2016 would be $969. For added context, the SRP in 2016 was the greater of $695 or 2.5% of modified adjusted gross income. Comparatively, HealthPocket notes that in 2017, the average unsubsidized bronze-tier premium, the cheapest tier of plans, cost a little more than $3,700 annually ($311 a month). Do the math: $969 versus $3,700. Of course healthy people are going to stay on the sidelines, because they'll save about $2,700. The reason this is such a big deal is that the SRP was designed to coerce healthy young adults to enroll. Healthy adults visit the doctor less, meaning their premium dollars are crucial to offsetting the higher costs of treating sicker patients. This last point is of particular importance, since Obamacare opened the gates and denied insurers the ability to turn away members with pre-existing conditions. In other words, insurers have been saddled with an influx of sicker patients, while the addition of healthy patients has been tepid, at best. Insurers need to ensure that they can continue to operate profitability, and one way to do so with an unfavorable mix of patents is to increase premium prices. The final factor sort of builds on the first two issues: Insurers aren't sticking around to see what happens. This year, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest insurer in the country, slashed its coverage down to just three states from the 34 it had been operating in back in 2016. Similarly, Aetna (NYSE:AET) and Humana (NYSE:HUM), which regulators denied the right to merge, chose to cut their county-based coverage by almost 70% and nearly 90%, respectively, in 2017. Those cuts are expected to steepen as we head into 2018. Image source: Getty Images. Back in mid-February, Humana announced that it would be pulling out of Obamacare's marketplace exchanges altogether in 2018, with Aetna following suit in May. Anthem (NYSE:ANTM), which is the second largest national insurer behind UnitedHealth Group, and a company that was expected to benefit greatly from the expansion of Medicaid, has announced that it'll also be pulling out of a number of markets next year. In addition, the failure of the risk corridor -- a fund designed to prop up money-losing insurers that priced their premiums too low -- wound up forcing the closure of most of Obamacare's 23 approved healthcare cooperatives. That means a lack of low-cost premium options for consumers. Add this together, and we have what looks to be an environment with minimal competition, and therefore strong pricing power for those that remain. Avalere has estimated that 41% of all U.S. counties next year will have just one insurer offering plans. That's a recipe for high premiums. With President Trump eager to see Obamacare repealed and replaced, it's unclear what the long-term holds for the program. However, the near-term dynamics pretty clearly suggest that marketplace customers are going to have to spend a lot more for coverage in the coming year. ","

That's doubly tragic because colon cancer is generally highly treatable if found in its earliest stages. Sadly, it's often not diagnosed until the later stages, where treatment options are limited. Image source: EXACT Sciences presentation Exact Sciences is on a mission to fix this problem. It developed an innovative, non-invasive screening tool that was easy for patients to use: Cologuard, a simple stool collection kit that is shipped directly to the patient's home. To use the test, a patient simply orders the kit, deposits a stool sample, and sends it back to Exact Sciences for analysis. The company analyzes the sample using its proprietary testing technology and then sends the results directly to the patient's doctor for follow up. Image source: Exact Sciences. As you can imagine, the simplicity and privacy provided by Cologuard are highly attractive to patients. Furthermore, health care providers can feel good about recommending the test since a 10,000 patient clinical study showed that Cologuard correctly identified the presence of colon cancer 92% of the time. EXAS data by YCharts Despite Cologuard's benefits and its clear potential to save lives, the product and company still had a fair number of detractors. Bears argued (correctly) that Cologuard was not as accurate as a colonoscopy at detecting cancer, and noted that it has a relatively high false-positive rate. That argument was reinforced in late 2015 when the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force suggested that Cologuard should be used as an ""alternative screening test"" for colon cancer instead of a ""recommended"" test. The news raised concerns that insurers would push back hard against covering it. Furthermore, Exact Sciences' own data showed that about a third of the kits it shipped off to patients were never sent back to the company. That's not great news, since the company can't bill for its services until it gets the kit back and tests the sample. These factors combined with the company's long history of losses and a huge short position to turn the 20-month period following Cologuard's launch into a brutal time for shareholders. EXAS data by YCharts In an effort to turn its fortunes around, Exact Sciences decided to go on the offensive and spent big on a national advertising campaign. The company also focused more effort on reaching out to non-compliant patients to persuade them to send their tests back for analysis. While this move was costly and bold, recent results clearly show the strategy is paying off. Last quarter, Exact Sciences announced that it completed 135,000 Cologuard tests, up 149% year over year. That impressive performance allowed management to up its testing guidance for the year to at least 550,000 -- a big jump from its prior outlook of 470,000. The company has also made a lot of progress with getting insurers on board. Management recently announced contract wins with UnitedHealth Group and Aetna. With these contracts in place, the company now believes that 86% of its target patient population now has reimbursement access to the test. Thankfully, this surging testing volume is translating into improving financial results, too. The company's top line jumped by 172% last quarter to $57.6 million. The increased sales leverage is also leading to margin gains and lower-than-expected losses. In turn, the shorts have been squeezed out of Exact Sciences' stock, which has help to propel the fantastic year-to-date results. EXAS data by YCharts The surging stock price also enabled Exact Sciences to complete a secondary offering on favorable terms. Its cash balance now sits at more than $484 million, which should provide it with plenty of firepower to continue to invest in the business. Even with an enormous surge in testing volume in the rear-view mirror, there are ample reasons to believe that the company's growth engine is just getting started. Management estimates that it has only reached about 2% of its current addressable market. The company also has plans to develop similar tests that will work on detecting pancreatic, esophageal, and lung cancers. Success in any of those other indications would meaningfully expand the company's addressable market opportunity. Despite those negatives, I happen to think that that the company's massive market opportunity and recent execution excellence justify a small investment today. However, those who agree with me and are willing to pay today's obscene valuation multiples to get in should mentally prepare themselves for a bumpy ride ahead. ","

Todd Campbell,08242017,Fool,08172017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A full transcript follows the video. Todd Campbell: My fingers are tired from writing ""I'm sorry, mea culpa!"" in preparation for today's episode. [laughs] Campbell: No. I think any investor that's been investing for a while recognizes that mistakes are common, and they can be wonderful teaching moments, so let's keep that in mind as we go through. Harjes: Exactly. So, we'll have a clip where I said something that was wrong, and then for the second half of the show, we'll go over to one that Todd picked out for a prediction of his that was not quite on the target. To kick things off, here's a clip from our Oct. 28, 2015, show. This show was called ""Walgreens Shows Its Hand, Scoops Up Rite Aid."" So that was my speculation. For some context, the original deal that we were talking about was for $9.7 billion. It was announced in October of 2015 that Walgreens would acquire Rite Aid for $9 a share. That was later revised down to about $6.50-$7. It all depended on how many stores were divested. For some additional context here, these are the two major retail pharmacy players in the United States, and therefore the FTC did not want the type of power consolidation that could be involved with this deal. That's why there was the first revision of the plan. And eventually, we found out in June 29 of this year that the entire deal had fallen through, and the original FTC decision had been scheduled for July 7, but Walgreens ended up saying, ""You know, they're just not going to approve this, so we're going to offer up a new deal to acquire just about half of Rite Aid's stores,"" which is a heck of a lot smaller than the original deal. And that's where we stand now. We had more details about this new version of the deal on the episode that we did on July 5, but there's no getting around the fact that back in October of 2015, I was just totally off the mark saying the FTC would let this deal go through. Campbell: You were just hopeful! You were hopeful! There's nothing wrong with hopeful. Yes, you were optimistic. As investors, we sometimes get optimistic, and we connected some dots, and the dots were, with the push to try and drive down prices, maybe they would let this go through. The reality is, however, there's no denying that the pharmacy marketplace has gotten very consolidated since 2000. You've got a handful of players who dominate that market. You have Walgreens, you've got CVS, and you've got Rite Aid. So, combining Walgreens and Rite Aid together, OK, yeah, that would have created a behemoth in the space, and theoretically, that could have eliminated competition in certain local markets to the point where they weren't going to get this deal approved. Shares of Rite Aid, Kristine, have been absolutely pummeled on the news of the new revised deal. Harjes: Yeah, they fell 26%. Campbell: I'm curious to put you on the spot again for next year's episode -- Harjes: Oh, great! [laughs] Campbell: -- and see if you have any thoughts for Rite Aid from here. Will this deal get through? Harjes: Yeah, I'm really hesitant to speculate again on it. But it's really hard not to do, because watching what has happened to Rite Aid's shares over the past 22 months -- I think that's the right number -- since Walgreens started talking to the FTC about potentially scooping up some or all of Rite Aid, it is fascinating. Rite Aid's shares are down to about one-third of the level they were before this deal was ever announced. They're down 73% just since the beginning of this year. Right now, they're hovering around $2.25 a share. If you recall, the original deal was for $9 per Rite Aid share, so the market has just completely crippled Rite Aid. Campbell: Kristine, just to jump in for one quick second because I don't want to forget this point, what's interesting to think about, in that original deal, if you include debt, that deal was worth over $17 billion. So Walgreens was willing to pay, including debts, $17 billion to get its hands on Rite Aid. Now, what's Rite Aid's market cap today? Harjes: $2.34 billion. Campbell: $2.34 billion, and they still have half their stores, and they still have their pharmacy benefit manager. So I wonder if there's a little bit of a disconnect. Maybe that's the uncertainty. The uncertainty is, we don't know whether or not the deal will close, and if it doesn't close, you still have Rite Aid as a relatively troubled and highly indebted company. Harjes: Yeah, they have $7.2 billion in debt. I think, actually, I have learned from being wrong the first time about this, because I'm so intrigued by Rite Aid as a value play right now, but I haven't bought any shares, and I think that actually is the hesitation of, I was wrong about whether or not the FTC would let this go through once. I could be wrong again, even though right now, sitting here looking at it, I'm going to say, I do think this will go through. And even if not, I think Rite Aid is grossly undervalued. But that being said, I still haven't put my money behind it, because I'm looking at this like, well, I understood the situation incorrectly the first time around, so I'm going to try to learn from that and say deals are not done deals until they go through. It's dangerous to try to grab an arbitrage opportunity, especially because if you look at what happens when these deals fall through, the stocks are absolutely crushed. And while it doesn't look like to me that Rite Aid has farther that it could really fall based on the value of the business alone, it could. And who am I to say that won't? Campbell: Right. Is this a falling knife or a value trap? Or is this truly a bargain-bin buy? That's the big question. I had a mentor back in the '90s, Kristine, and one of the things that I learned from that mentor was, don't worry too much about the bottom 10% of a move or the top 10% of a move. Focus your attention on that 80% in the middle. So I think investors should basically take a step back and say, ""I don't need to be perfect in timing my entry and trying to get to the bottom. Why don't I let this play out a little bit, because it's likely that if it does close, there will be opportunities for me to benefit and make that 80% of the move after, rather than trying to be a hero and stepping up into the uncertainty?"" Harjes: Yeah, I think that's great advice. For investors looking to do that here, take a look at the value of the stores. Consider that Walgreens will be able to cherry-pick the ones that it wants. Also consider that the way in which it will cherry-pick them will have a lot to do with what the FTC says it's allowed to choose as far as the geographical footprint goes. Also, look at its PBM. Rite Aid has EnvisionRx, its pharmacy benefits manager. That's a whole other part of this business that doesn't really get talked about a lot, and I suspect the value of that isn't really being considered in the full market cap of this company. Campbell: Yeah, Kristine, just to jump in again on that point, because it's a good one, I crunched some numbers on that not that long ago in an article I posted on The Motley Fool, and one of the conclusions I came to is, as a standalone company, that EnvisionRx could be worth anywhere between $2.4 and $4 billion on its own, which is intriguing. Harjes: Interesting. Yeah, I don't think I read that one yet, so I will definitely go ahead to the site and look for it. If anyone listening wants to read it, shoot us an email at industryfocus@fool.com, and I will dig it up and send it along for you. Todd, I'm going to take myself out of the mistakes spotlight and pivot over to you. In our July 27, 2016, show, we talked about CEOs that were enormously successful in one business venture who were back at it trying to catch lightning in a bottle again. We featured Tesaro, NantKwest, Puma Biotech, and OPKO Health (NASDAQ:OPK). And in an effort to put you on the spot, or give our readers a tidy conclusion, I asked you to pick your favorite. Here's a refresher of what you said: Harjes: Any thoughts on that? Campbell: I could have picked Tesaro's Lonnie Moulder. Tesaro got an approval for their PARP inhibitor, and sure enough, its shares have gone from $95 to a high of $180 and still trading around $120. That would have worked. I could have picked Puma. It got its approval of Nerlynx recently, and its shares have gone from $49 to $80. But no, [laughs] I settled with the safe play, going with Phillip Frost, OPKO Health. And sure enough, its shares have been flushed down the toilet bowl, falling from $10 to about $6, which is even more painful when you think about the fact that this has been one of the strongest periods for market returns in recent memory. Harjes: So. [laughs] What did you learn from this? Campbell: There were reasons that I sided with and picked Phillip Frost. Phillip Frost is a proven leader. And I love investing in companies with proven leaders. Rome wasn't built in a day. Phillip Frost has been starting, successfully, running companies, and then selling them since the 1970s, and he's one of the wealthiest healthcare entrepreneurs in America. So I think sidling up next to him was not necessarily a mistake long-term, but certainly a mistake short-term. And I think the short-term mistake I made was to fail to understand how much shares could fall if a couple of key catalysts were either slow to develop or outright disappointed. Do you me want to walk through those catalysts, Kristine? Harjes: Yeah, there's been a handful of them over the last year or so since we talked about this. Do you want to start with maybe the slow launch of Rayaldee? Campbell: Yeah. Rayaldee is a very intriguing drug, because it's a prohormone for vitamin D that works better than existing vitamin D supplements that are given to patients with chronic kidney disease, that suffer from vitamin D insufficiency. Vitamin D insufficiency can cause calcium loss in bones, bone weakness, and all sorts of other problems. So it's an important indication; it's important to have treatment options available for it. The problem is, after Rayaldee launched, it did not have widespread early-on inclusion in drug formularies at insurers. So the patient population that was covered by insurers that would pay for these drugs was pretty small, and sales, frankly, have been a rounding error and aren't even broken out in OPKO Health's quarterly results yet. Perhaps, according to Phillip Frost in the second-quarter conference call, they'll start to break those numbers out for us in the fourth quarter of this year. And there's opportunities there theoretically for Rayaldee to finally deliver on its promise. But Rayaldee wasn't the only disappointment. You also had Varubi, which is a drug that's approved for use in patients who are suffering from vomiting and nausea after receiving chemotherapy. That's a very important market. It's worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and Varubi is licensed by Tesaro, which is Lonnie Moulder's company. So far, sales have been slow to grow. Sales in the second quarter were only about $2.9 million, and with OPKO collecting double-digit royalties, again, a rounding error considering that the company is doing $300 million roughly in quarterly revenue because of its diagnostics business. Harjes: And that wasn't even the only disappointment. Campbell: Yeah. They also came up shy in a very important trial that was evaluating the long-lasting human growth hormone treatment in adults. They have a drug that's partnered up with Pfizer. A lot of people thought that if this drug reached the market and eventually got approved for use in kids, pediatric use, then this could be a big moneymaker for OPKO Health. Unfortunately, in December, they announced that the trial missed its mark. They haven't given up on the drug, but that trial was a failure. So overall, you have this confluence of disappointments over the course of the last 12 months that has really taken a toll on the company's stock price. You add that together with the fact that sales in the diagnostic business, which is basically the specialty lab that they run, have pretty much flatlined at around $300 million, a little over $300 million, there hasn't been a lot of excitement or enthusiasm to drive up the market cap of this company. Harjes: So, clearly, it's been a disappointing year for OPKO shareholders. Where do you stand now going forward on it, Todd? Do you think it's, ""Looking back on it, I was wrong, this is a terrible company, investors should stay far away from it,"" or do you think that now, at the lower share price, there might be an even better opportunity for investors to scoop up some shares at a discounted price, because now, going forward, is where the real promise is? Or something in between the two? Campbell: There's a couple different takeaways I guess I have on this whole thing. I think, yes, you stick with proven leaders, and yes, there's a lot of opportunity still ahead for OPKO. I don't like buying drug-development stocks on sale as using the value argument only because, as we saw last year, a lot can happen with clinical trials. You can say, ""There's all sorts of opportunities still in the pipeline,"" which there is, drugs that could rack up lots of sales for this company over time. But those trials could fail. You have to take a look at it and say, ""I'm not going to buy it solely because it's cheap relative to where it was last year. Things happened that the outlook now has changed."" But I think you can look at it and say, Rayaldee could still deliver on the goods. We'll know better early next year what the sales trend, the prescription trend is for that. Varubi, which again is marketed by Tesaro, there's a PDUFA date at the FDA that could approve an IV formulation. If that formulation gets approved, that opens up the vast majority of the marketplace for this type or this class of drugs. That, theoretically, could start meaningfully generating revenue in 2018. And there's a pediatric study ongoing in human growth hormone still that reads out in 2019. If that trial is good, then Pfizer and OPKO will split the profits on both OPKO's drug and Pfizer's existing drug in that indication, Genotropin, which is selling at a clip of over $100 million per quarter. So there's still reasons besides value that you'd want to own OPKO Health. And certainly, Phillip Frost remains incredibly committed as a shareholder in this company. He continues and has continued to increase the number of shares he owns over the past year, even in the face of all these disappointments. Harjes: Some of the dates that you mentioned when you were running down your list of catalysts going forward are pretty far in the future. That speaks to me about a bigger problem with investing in biotech, which is opportunity cost. Many of the stocks that look interesting today are likely to take a long time before they prove out. Something that regular listeners of the show have heard us talk about before is keeping an investing journal. That's so important, so I'm going to say it again -- keep an investing journal, specifically to combat this type of mistake, or looking at the mistake incorrectly when maybe it wasn't quite a mistake yet, is to write down exactly the dates that you're looking for. So the PDUFA dates, when the FDA might approve a drug, or a forecast for when you think a company is finally going to turn profitable, things like that where, if it's a date that's relevant to your investment thesis, you want to have it written down in front of you, so that when that date comes and goes you can reevaluate your thinking and figure out if, indeed, you were right. If, for example, your investing thesis for OPKO had something to do with a PDUFA date that's years and years out, you want to know that and you want to be very aware of it for several reasons, one of which is that, maybe it's not really the time to invest just yet. Maybe there are better places for your money now where you can get more validation sooner that you actually are placing your money in the proper place. Of course, we are long-term investors here at The Fool, but in the short term, if you're going to look at a company that is declining over the course of one year and think, ""Oh my gosh, I was wrong, I need to exit,"" but you're still waiting for a catalyst that's years in the future, then you're going to end up cutting yourself short, and you'll never even see the potential gains that you were hoping to get in the very beginning. Campbell: That's a great point, Kristine. I'm going to throw another point out there, too. We've talked about on the show previously, especially in biotech, diversify, diversify, diversify. I selected one stock out of these four -- Harjes: To be fair, I made you do that. Campbell: Yeah. Well, that exposed us to a lot more risk. If we had just invested across all four of them, you would have done very well, because of the success that we saw with Puma and Tesaro. So, I think diversification is always something that's very important across this space. Never put all your eggs in one basket hoping that you're going to hit a home run. Harjes: Yeah. And it's important not to beat yourself up too much about single mistakes, because overall, if you're right 50% of the time, you're a really, really good stock picker. Campbell: Very good stock picker, and you'd be a great baseball player. Harjes: Yeah, exactly! So, Todd, I'm not going to beat you up too much about the OPKO mistake, and I'll try not to beat myself up too much about getting the Rite Aid-Walgreens merger information predicted incorrectly. And that'll do it. Hopefully we can learn from these mistakes and move forward and be right at least 50% of the time, hopefully more! As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

It may not get the attention as often as larger-cap biotech stocks like Celgene Corp. (NASDAQ:CELG) and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), but a bunch of recent drug approvals could soon change that for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN). Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals about to reward investors with a steady stream of big-time sales and profit growth? A full transcript follows the video. Todd Campbell: It was great! I don't know if, when you travel, you're always looking for investment ideas. I always am. No matter what I'm doing, when I'm traveling, or if I'm going to the dentist, or whatever, I'm trying to figure out if there's an investing angle. And I have one for you, Kristine. Harjes: OK, let's hear it. Campbell: Go long Wellfleet oysters. Oh my God, they're so delicious. Harjes: Is that an actual company? Campbell: No. [laughs] But they are delicious oysters. Harjes: [laughs] Maybe someday they'll go public, and then we can make all of the riches. Campbell: There we go! Campbell: Kristine, I'm wicked excited to talk about this company. Harjes: Wicked excited, that's such a Northeast thing to say. Campbell: I'm using the New England wicked. Because, again, you hit on, we talk a lot about companies like Celgene, one of my favorite stocks out there. But Regeneron is a very interesting stock. It's a little bit smaller than those three upper echelon players -- Gilead, Amgen, and Celgene. It has a $50 billion market cap instead of $100 billion market cap. But there are reasons to think this company could take that next step higher and become part of that commonly discussed group on this show and elsewhere. I thought it would be a lot of fun to dive in and talk about the different things that are going on at the company, because there's a tremendous amount of research and development activity going on at the company. Again, it's a big company. This is a substantial, investable idea that we can talk to our listeners about. They have 5,400 employees, a $50 billion market cap. They did almost $5 billion in revenue last year. They're profitable, and they make a lot of money. So I'm looking forward to it. Harjes: Yeah, this is definitely not one of your tiny pre-clinical stocks that we sometimes talk about on this show, but rather an established player that is clawing its way up to be at the top of the hill of biotechs. This is a company that, for a long, long time, was known for just one drug called Eylea. This is their flagship product, which was first approved in 2011 for various retinal diseases. They're just recently, within the past few years or so, starting to branch out and diversify into other drugs. They now have a handful of approved drugs and an incredibly deep pipeline. But let's start at the beginning and talk a little bit about Eylea. Campbell: Kristine, I think one of the listeners' favorite shows based on responses that we got in the past has been the catching-lightning-in-a-bottle type shows, where we've highlighted CEOs that have successfully developed drugs and then sold their companies and are now trying to do it again. I think we should really give a shout out to two proven leaders, CEOs at companies that don't leave and start over, but still catch lightning in a bottle over and over and over again at the companies that they stay at. And one of those leaders is Regeneron's CEO, Leonard Schleifer, who has proven that he's developed a very good model for discovering, developing, and now winning FDA [Food and Drug Administration] approval of drugs across a few different indications. You mentioned Eylea being the No. 1 drug, the most important drug right now for the company, in terms of revenue and everything else. But they've actually had six different drugs that they've found internally that have made it through the FDA gauntlet and have made it to market -- four of those being significant drugs, which I define as drugs that either already have $1 billion in sales, Eylea, or could end up having $1 billion in sales, which would be these three more recently discovered drugs: Praluent, Dupixent, and Kevzara. Harjes: Yes. Looking at these drugs, as you mentioned, a lot of them do have the potential to eventually hit that blockbuster status. But I think it's also important to look at Eylea and its own growth, because this is a pretty established drug that has been bringing in a lot of revenue for Regeneron for quite a while, but it's still growing fairly quickly. Sales in the U.S. were up 11% year over year. Regeneron just reported its earnings on August 3 -- we're talking about the second quarter here. In that quarter, it sold nearly a billion, just in the quarter alone. This is at nearly a $4 billion run rate just with U.S. sales. It's important to note that Regeneron receives just a share of profit from ex-U.S. sales because it's partnered with Bayer on this drug. Campbell: Right. Bayer and Regeneron are working together on commercializing the drug globally. This is a monster drug in a huge indication. I think you mentioned briefly that it's approved to treat wet stage age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. These are two increasingly common causes of vision loss within older patients. If you think about this for a second, what's the argument for the growth that you're referencing? You've got 76 million baby boomers, and they're turning 65 at a pace of 10,000 people per day. The incidence of these two indications within this patient population, as they're getting older and living longer, is increasing. What's really intriguing about Eylea and its success, this is a drug that did $1.5 billion in global sales last quarter alone. So, it has a $6 billion global run rate. That growth has come not because of price increases, but because it's being more increasingly used -- more patients are being diagnosed with these conditions, and then some market-share wins. There's other players. We'll talk about the competition, because I think that's important, too. I think this is an important drug. It's likely to remain an important drug for the company, especially given the fact that they have patent protection on the drug that stretches out into the 2020s. Harjes: Right. When you look at the indications that it is approved for, you can see the demographic trends hidden in the name of the diseases. You have wet age-related macular degeneration, wet AMD, it's age related. As you mentioned, that's a huge growing population. Its other approved indication is diabetic macular edema. This is a diabetic condition, and the population of diabetics is also something that is growing. It's also approved for diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema. You can see exactly why this drug will continue to grow. You mentioned that it does have some competition. It's competing with a drug called Lucentis. There could potentially be some biosimilars to Lucentis, which are copycat versions of it that could be a little bit cheaper once the Lucentis patent expires in 2020. There's also an interesting competition going on between Lucentis and Eylea and Roche's drug called Avastin, which is a cancer drug that's being used off-label in this indication because it's so much cheaper. Campbell: Yeah, it's way cheaper, and as a result, its market share is, I want to say it's 30%-40% in wet AMD. Harjes: It's interesting. For me, it's one of the most high-profile times that we see an off-label drug being used across an indication with any sort of huge reach. Harjes: Yeah. This is a company that recognizes it has a really strong foothold in retinal diseases. It knows how important Eylea is to it, but it also knows that it needs to diversify. It reminds me of a lot of other companies in this regard. For example, let's compare it to Gilead Sciences. This would be like Gilead Sciences saying, ""We know HIV is super important. That's been the foundation of our business,"" and I'm talking a couple years ago now. At that point, they said, ""We need to do something other than HIV, as well, to continue having new growth drivers."" And still today, you see Gilead branching out into new indications and trying to find that next step, what's going to drive future growth. Campbell: Yeah. Similar to Celgene, right Kristine? You talk about Revlimid, $8 billion in sales from Revlimid, and they're spreading out into some other indications, too. You're right, it's very important for these companies to be expanding. And Regeneron is doing it. Harjes: Yeah, it's a story that you see a lot. When you think about the life cycle of biotechs, they often do strike it big with one indication or one drug, and then they're established and they have cash flow coming in and they need to use it to fund clinical development to keep that growth moving and keep investors satisfied. We've talked a whole ton about Eylea, and don't get me wrong, that's a very important component of Regeneron. But we think it's even more exciting to discuss what else Regeneron has going on, both in its product portfolio and in its pipeline. Campbell: There are so many moving pieces to this company since 2015. It's really important for investors who are interested in buying Regeneron to understand both the positives, what the market opportunity could be for its newest drugs, but also some of the risks and the challenges that are facing these drugs. I think a great place to start, Kristine, would be to look at Praluent, which is the first of the three most recently launched drugs. That won approval in summer of 2015 for use in treating bad cholesterol -- high bad cholesterol -- in patients in which it was genetically caused. A pretty tough-to-treat indication. That drug launched with these multi-billion-dollar blockbuster expectations, but it's been a little bit disappointing. It's still selling pretty well, but it's nowhere near what those expectations were. Harjes: Right. Praluent is what's known as a PCSK9 inhibitor. We've talked about them on the show before. It's a drug that works to lower your cholesterol levels in a novel way. When you consider how many Americans take drugs for cholesterol levels, you would think this would be a huge success. The problem is, it's pretty expensive. This drug is $14,000 a year. You compare that to drugs like statins, which are not under patent protection anymore, the generics are pretty darn cheap, especially compared to $14,000 annually. So this drug is really not doing as great as people were expecting. It saw sales of just $46 million in the past quarter, and that was up from $26 million from the quarter of a year ago, so Q2 2016. But still, these numbers are really tiny for a drug that was supposed to be a billion-dollar blockbuster. Campbell: Yeah. I think a lot of investors were disappointed by that. That's one of the reasons why Regeneron shares underperformed in 2016. But I think they're looking forward now and they're saying, Praluent sales are up pretty substantial year over year. We're now at about a $200 million a year run rate. That's solid. And there is a big Phase III study that's wrapping up at the end of this year. With data coming out early 2018, they could move the needle and make this drug more commonly used, too, and that's an outcome study that's evaluating whether or not using Praluent actually reduces the likelihood of major cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes. Harjes: Which, that data is pretty darn important if you are a payer looking at whether or not a $14,000 price tag is worth it. You might want to know, is this actually going to lower the risk of a cardiovascular event? So there's 18,000 patients in this study, and we should be getting data in early 2018. That could swing things in a positive direction for this company. Let's also look at one big threat to this drug and to Regeneron -- which is the ongoing legal battle that they have with Amgen and its competing drug, Repatha. Campbell: [Dun-dun-dun.] It's not all roses and fairy tales over here. We do have a big risk, a big challenge that investors have to be aware of when it comes to this drug. And that's that Amgen has sued Regeneron and Sanofi, its partner on the drug, for patent infringement. So far, the courts have been siding with Amgen on it. As a matter of fact, previously, the courts actually said that Sanofi and Regeneron would have to stop selling Praluent in the United States. That was stayed pending appeal, which is why you're still seeing this drug on the market racking up revenue. But depending on how this all shakes out, you could run all sorts of different scenarios. You could say, Amgen ends up winning in the appeal, and as a result, Praluent disappears from the marketplace along with its $200 million in annualized sales. You could say, Amgen wins, and they cut a deal to share royalty streams somehow with Praluent sales. Or you could say, Regeneron comes out on top and Praluent continues as is, the outcome study comes out aces, and the next thing you know, you have a billion-dollar blockbuster on your hands. Harjes: Right. As with many legal matters, outcome hazy, we'll see what happens with that. But what you need to take away from this is that Praluent has, thus far at least, not lived up to the hype. But fortunately, that was not the only drug that Regeneron was developing to diversify away from Eylea. It was able to launch a drug recently called Dupixent, which is now approved for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Campbell: This is a really intriguing drug, and it may even have a bigger commercial opportunity than Praluent does. Moderate-to-severe eczema is very difficult to treat. There's not a lot of treatment options out there. The drug costs $37,000 annually, which sounds like a lot of money, but it's actually not that bad. The payers and insurers basically applauded that price tag when it was announced. The market for Dupixent could be multiple billions of dollars in a year, taken with a grain of salt because we know, as we've seen in the past, peak sales estimates oftentimes fall short. But I have seen people out there saying that if other studies that are evaluating Dupixent in asthma, for example, results coming soon, stay tuned, potential approval application getting filed by the end of this year. You could see this drug generate about $4 billion in annual sales by 2023. Now, I think that's a stretch. But I think what you can look at this drug and say, with its current indication, and with the potential in asthma, and the potential to be used in more patients over time, this absolutely could be a significant driver of sales. And Sanofi and Regeneron will split any profit on it. Harjes: Despite the little bit of skepticism there is about whether or not this drug will be able to outperform drugs like Novartis' Cosentyx, there's also competition from the likes of GlaxoSmithKline, it's definitely not a market that they have to themselves. This kind of has become the favorite child after Praluent was so disappointing. So, lots of excitement going on around this drug, particularly seeing how it launches in its currently approved indications, as well as how it performs in some of the currently ongoing trials that you mentioned, Todd. Campbell: Kristine, just to interject before we jump to the next one, Q2 sales of the drug, first quarter on the market, $28 million. So better than a $100 million run rate right out of the gate. Harjes: Yeah, that's not bad. It's pretty hard to project future sales based on the first quarter on the market, but that's definitely a good sign that payers are accepting the price tag and doctors are prescribing the drug. Off to a good start, and definitely something to keep an eye on. Oh, one more detail before we move on to the next drug: Amgen is also battling over this patent. Which is kind of interesting, because Amgen doesn't even have a rival drug here. They don't even have something in the pipeline, which also means that they can't ask for an injunction that would pull the drug from the market. Amgen is just looking for money here. It's like they're a consistent thorn in the side of Regeneron. Anyway, moving on to the next drug that we wanted to highlight, this one is called Kevzara, and it treats moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, which is another enormous indication. Campbell: Yeah, a multi-billion-dollar indication with a lot of players, dominated by anti-TNF drugs like Humira, which listeners will probably remember. Humira is the biggest-selling drug on the planet, with about $16 billion in annual sales. Kevzara is not going to be that big. It's going to be more of a niche player, because its approval is for use in patients who have tried and failed on other therapies like DMARDs and Humira and the like. However, a $39,000 annual price tag is cheaper than Humira, and that has some people thinking that Kevzara could win away sales in this indication. Again, grain-of-salt warning. Peak sales estimates could be $1 billion for the drug over time. We'll have to see, though, because again, this is a competitive marketplace, and I'm not entirely sure just how much of this market they'll end up winning. Harjes: One key question to keep an eye out for is whether doctors will eventually be able to, or want to, prescribe this as a first-line treatment. For context, they actually did test this against Humira in trials and showed that the two had similar safety. That should be really important in making the case to prescribing doctors that you might want to just try Kevzara right away. But for now, that's not going to be the case. Humira is extremely well established. There are plenty of other drugs that are established in the space. I think you're right that, for now, it will be a niche, later-line drug. Campbell: Yeah. I think you watch it over the course of the next few quarters, you see what the prescription trends look like in the quarterly reports. All of these companies, as listeners should know, they talk about their performance every quarter, you can see the transcripts online, you can go through and read them after they have their discussions. Oftentimes, they'll talk about market share, they'll talk about prescription trends, they'll talk about how these drugs are doing. I think if you evaluate this one over the course of the next three or four quarters, you'll get a feel for whether or not this is going to be a drug that does $200 million a year in sales, or potentially could do much more than that. But it's still going to be a fairly substantial drug, because think about it -- when you start poo-pooing drugs that may only do nine figures in sales, you know you're talking about a pretty strong company. Harjes: Yeah, exactly. But that's not all. They also have a humongous pipeline. We just walked you through the product portfolio -- things that are approved. But the pipeline also has 17 more product candidates in it. Five of them are in Phase III trials. Some of these are label extensions for the drugs we just talked about. For example, Todd, you mentioned earlier extending the label of Eylea. I think you also mentioned Dupixent in asthma that's going on. They're also looking at Praluent in hypercholesterolemia, so expanding that indication to a wider set of people. But they also have completely novel candidates that they're studying. There's one drug called Fasinumab, and they're studying that in osteoarthritis pain, as well as chronic lower back pain. They have a PD-1 drug, which is something we talk a little bit about on this show, and that one is called REGN2810. Campbell: Kristine, just to interrupt for a second, I think that one might be the one that investors really want to focus on in the pipeline. Harjes: Yeah, because it could be huge. These PD-1 drugs are absolutely enormous in their scope. Currently, the 2810 drug is being studied in Phase III in non-small cell lung cancer. They initiate it in the second quarter. They also have a potentially pivotal Phase II study in basal cell carcinoma that was indicated in the quarter. Because of the mechanism of action, it could absolutely be possible for this drug to treat a variety of different cancers, and could seriously rack up some sales there. Campbell: Yeah, we talked about Opdivo and Keytruda a lot on the show. Those are the two top-selling PD-1 drugs. They have combined sales of over $2 billion per quarter right now. Obviously, this is a huge market that could be targeted. What companies like Regeneron are doing, they're a little bit late to the dance, they're looking for indications that are under-treated where they can get fast-track and early-accelerated approval, so they can play a little bit of catch-up. So they're smaller indications, but they can get to the market quicker, and then they can file for supplemental approvals after that on a little bit more of an expedited time frame so they start to generate some sales. I think the thing to watch here is data from their trial in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the second most common cause of skin cancer. Data from a pivotal Phase II trial is expected in that soon. If that's good, they think they can file for approval within the next 12 months. So theoretically, depending on if they get fast-tracked or not, you could have this PD-1 drug hitting the market in, we'll call it 18 months. Harjes: Yeah, when you look at Regeneron's most recent quarterly earnings statement, the press release has this grid on it, and its upcoming catalysts. I believe, if I'm recalling it correctly, it's just for the remainder of the year. And it's packed. There are so many things in this list. If you extend that one year out, it's just incredible how many different pivotal trials will have data, or potential approvals, or filing for FDA approval. This company really has a lot going on for it. One thing that I want to highlight before we sign off, because we haven't talked about this very much, is the collaboration that they have with Sanofi. Sanofi is a partner on almost all of the drugs that we talked about. They have a huge, long-standing relationship. There's also the Bayer partnership on Eylea. So this is a company that plays well with others, and it's been very profitable so far to pursue this kind of partnership strategy. Campbell: Right. But Sanofi's walking away from this partnership, at least in the antibody development, at the end of this year. People will have to take a look and see what that means. Regeneron will end up getting reimbursed less money for research and development next year from Sanofi. I don't think that's going to be a substantial number, but it could be a number that put a little bit of headwinds on sales growth for some of the smaller drugs like Kevzara. If you lose $30 to $40 million in development revenue per quarter, that could have an impact. So you have to watch and see how that plays out. Sanofi is going to continue to work on the existing drugs with Regeneron, and they do still have a separate pact in immuno-oncology. Again, we were just talking about the PD-1 drug -- that's a Sanofi-shared drug, as well. They're going to continue to develop that together, as well. I think overall, Kristine, this is a financially stable, fast-growing company. Their earnings are growing quicker than Celgene's, for example, year over year. They have a lot going on. I think it's worth having on people's radar. Harjes: Yeah. I think that the Sanofi collaboration is ending come December, is a little bit of a sign of maturity with this company. When you're an early stage company, it's a lot more important that you have a big brother of sorts handing you money to develop your early-stage candidates, get them through all the clinical-trial processes, which are very expensive. But then you have drugs on the market, and you're kicking off your own free cash flow. So that's kind of the place where Regeneron is right now, and it's actually at a point where it can be the big brother, or the big sister, itself. For example, they have an agreement with a smaller company called Intellia Therapeutics, and they're working with them on some CRISPR research. It's very early stage, as with everything CRISPR. But Regeneron is now responsible for shouldering the development costs for Intellia, and it'll pay Intellia some milestones, it'll pay royalties on future sales. But because this company has gotten to be of a size where it has financial weight, it has money at its disposal to do things. The balance sheet is incredibly strong. They have well over $1 billion in cash and equivalents, no long-term debt. They have another $1 billion in long-term investments. This is a company that's really come into its own and deserves to be talked about in this upper echelon of biotech stocks. Campbell: Yeah, it's not a cheap stock though, Kristine. That's the final takeaway for investors, too. It's a great growth story, but you're paying up a little bit for that growth. Harjes: Yeah, absolutely. Do you want to share some of the ratios? Campbell: Forward P/E of this stock is 29. If you compare that to Celgene, Celgene's forward P/E is 15. It's P/E-to-growth ratio is 1.74. If you look at the P/E-to-growth of Celgene, it's 0.82. It's trading at 9.5 times sales, Celgene's trading at 8.4 times sales. So it's a little bit of an expensive company. Again, those ratios are reflecting what we've done so far, not necessarily what we may do going forward. So bear that in mind, as well. As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. This show is produced by Austin Morgan. For Todd Campbell, I'm Kristine Harjes, thanks for listening and Fool on! ","

                                   companies having reported results for quarters ending May 28 or later, we’ve listed those that have increased their sales per share the most, while also improving their gross profit margins. Sales per share takes into account any dilution caused by the issuance of shares for any reason. Shares are often issued to fund an acquisition, so if sales-per-share go up after a merger is completed, it’s a good sign that the dilution was “worth it” for the acquiring company’s shareholders, or that the acquisition was partly or fully paid for with cash. The share count can also increase from stock-based compensation to executives — which companies routinely exclude from the adjusted-earnings figures that drive the “beat” or “miss” headlines. The per-share numbers also reflect any reduction to the share count caused by companies’ repurchase of stock. More on creative accounting and possible remedies: • Here’s how investors are duped each earnings season • The SEC is cracking down on made-up earnings numbers. We crunched the numbers — it hasn’t helped • Take-Two is one of five companies to say new accounting rules will have a material impact • Netflix needs to address new accounting standards if it continues licensing content • Target revises reporting after SEC calls out non-GAAP gross margin • Amazon says new accounting rule will change when it recognizes sales of its devices A company’s gross margin is its sales, less the cost of goods or services sold, divided by sales. It is a measure of the profitability of a company’s core business and, in the list below, is calculated by FactSet using GAAP numbers, not companies’ “adjusted” numbers. So if a company increases its sales per share significantly, while its gross margin also increases, it’s a good sign that it didn’t need to offer huge discounts to juice sales.

FactSet doesn’t calculate gross margins for about 10% of S&P 500 companies (mostly banks and insurance companies), because other measures of profitability are used in certain industries. So in order to represent them, we have listed the 10 companies for which gross margins are not available, that have had the highest returns on common equity during the most recent quarter: Seven of these companies with high returns on common equity have beaten the S&P 500’s 35% three-year return, while eight have beaten the index’s 94% five-year return.

                                    hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has maintained notable support, circa 2,416, a level matching the June FAANG-induced low. The question now is the rally attempt’s quality. Near-term resistance (2,437) is followed by firmer overhead matching the former breakout point, the June peak of 2,453. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has narrowly maintained its first notable support. The specific area matches its breakout point — Dow 21,682 — better illustrated on the daily chart. Conversely, the Dow’s near-term breakdown point (21,840) pivots to resistance, and the initial retest should be a useful bull-bear gauge. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has reached one-month lows. Still, a retest of the 50-day moving average from underneath, currently 6,271, is underway early Tuesday. On further strength, major overhead matches the 6,344 area, also illustrated on the daily chart below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has stalled at the 6,342 breakdown point, and violated the 50-day moving average, currently 6,271. More broadly, the prevailing downturn originates from the late-July key reversal (the long red bar) and includes two directionally sharp August downdrafts. The intervening rally attempts have thus far been flat. Bearish intermediate-term price action. Tactically, a rally atop the 50-day would mark technical progress, while a close atop the 6,342 breakdown point would more firmly neutralize the August downturn. Looking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains the strongest major benchmark. To reiterate, the index has narrowly maintained its breakout point — Dow 21,682 — an area closely followed by the 50-day moving average, currently 21,642. Viewed in isolation, the Dow’s August downturn has inflicted limited true technical damage. Meanwhile, the S&P 500’s jagged August downturn has inflicted damage. Namely, the S&P has violated its breakout point (2,453) a level closely matching the 50-day moving average, currently 2,450. Conversely, significant support broadly spans from 2,405 to 2,416, levels matching the breakout point, and the June FAANG-induced low. This week’s low currently rests at 2,417. Broadly speaking, the August downturn remains uneven — the technical backdrop is not one-size-fits-all — though damage has been inflicted. On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have tagged one-month lows, punctuating recent violations of the 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials remain comparably resilient, maintaining the first well-defined support. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF

Bearish price action. Delving deeper, important support broadly spans from about 132.40 to 133.70. This area defines the range bottom, and matches the 2017 low. A violation opens the path to less-charted territory, and potentially material follow-through. Conversely, a nearly immediate rally atop the 200-day would place the brakes on bearish momentum. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has registered three straight closes under the 200-day moving average, currently 310.50. Here again, the downturn punctuates a failed test of the breakdown point. More broadly, the small- and mid-cap benchmarks have concurrently registered three-month lows. (Separately, consider that the iShares Russell 2000 ETF was narrowly negative year-to-date at Monday’s close — by a two-cent margin. The MDY has registered about a 2.2% year-to-date gain.)

                                   remains comparably stronger than the small- and mid-caps. The 200-day moving average, currently 234.90, remains distant. Still, the SPY has violated two key inflection points: Moreover, the tandem August downturns — the violations of support — have been fueled by volume spikes, encompassing a lighter-volume rally attempt. Bearish near-term price action. A retest of the 50-day moving average from underneath is underway early Tuesday, and should be a useful bull-bear gauge. Collectively, the widely-tracked U.S. benchmarks continue to diverge. The prevailing technical backdrop is not one-size-fits-all. As it applies to the S&P 500, a near- to intermediate-term consolidation phase is underway. These respective trends are in flux. Recall that notable support spans from 2,405 to 2,416, levels matching the breakout point, and the June FAANG-induced low. See Friday’s review. The S&P has bottomed this week at 2,417 — matching support — and the question now is the rally attempt’s quality. When gauging the quality, notable S&P resistance spans from 2,450 to 2,453, levels matching the 50-day moving average, and the June peak. A retest from underneath is within view early Tuesday, and worth tracking. To reiterate, a nearly immediate reversal atop the 2,450 breakout point would place the S&P on firmer technical ground. Beyond technical levels, the U.S. sub-sector backdrop has softened, as detailed Friday, and the August rally attempts have thus far lacked quality. The S&P 500’s more important longer-term trend remains firmly bullish. See also: Bull trend intact, S&P 500 absorbs mid-August plunge.

 jumped nearly 30%. Market participants said they were also following reports that Gary Cohn was resigning as economic adviser to President Donald Trump, but the White House has countered those rumors. U.S. equity benchmarks had been facing selling pressure at the start of trade, as European markets ended lower after a three-day winning streak. “In Europe, we had weakness out of the gate and then we had worries about the Cohn news,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading, in an interview. “With the light volume, Barcelona is not something that the market is going to handle well.” The equity market was also digesting minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting, as well as the dissolution of a pair of Trump’s business-advisory panels, which underscores the president’s challenges in promoting his Wall Street-friendly policies. The president has faced a furor after he repeatedly blamed “both sides” for violence last weekend at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Overall, Fed minutes were read as dovish, lowering expectations of another rate increase this year. “There’s no direct market impact in what Trump has done recently, but if things continue to be so polarized that his agenda is completely dead on arrival, that would have a negative impact,” Alpine’s Spellman said.

Chris Edelson,08242017,MarketWatch,08172017,"Published: Aug 24, 2017 11:58 a.m. ET U.S. business leaders should call for the president to resign By In ordinary times, it would be a mistake to expect CEOs to take a national leadership role during political crisis. CEOs are risk-averse and rarely see any upside to weighing in publicly on political debate. But these are not ordinary times. CEOs already see that the biggest risk for them when it comes to President Donald Trump is failing to act. The blowback from the Charlottesville, Va. violence and the resultant implosion of Trump’s business councils shows that CEOs can play a pivotal role by taking a stand against the president. With the United States facing what Republican Senator Ben Sasse described — back in March —  as a “civilization-warping crisis of public trust,” business titans have already displayed backbone by rebuking the president in the days since Charlottesville. They can do more. CEOs have had to act because of public demand and because the Republican-controlled Congress has not. Having taken the important first step of disbanding the White House business councils, the CEOs who have left these councils (and their peers) should now go further and call for Trump's resignation. These former council members are the most important CEOs in the nation — leaders of General Electric

                                   , and more. CEOs need to act in unison, coalescing behind a common statement —  a CEO manifesto — that we provide below. This need not be a pipe dream; After all, the CEOs in the president’s councils not only agreed to disband and resign, but some were also discussing  condemning Trump. GM CEO Mary Barra’s involvement, ironically, harkens back to that classic dictum, uttered in 1953 by then GM CEO Charles Erwin Wilson when GM was the most powerful corporation in America: ""What was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa."" What Barra and other prominent CEOs seem to be saying now is that Trump is not good for the country, and the corollary: that his leadership not good for General Motors or other big U.S. companies. Yet if CEOs instead sit on the sidelines, will future generations see them as complicit in lending support to a president who threatens core American values of morality, democracy, society, and capitalism? American business, however economically motivated, has more of a moral compass than Trump, and in this moment, morality and business considerations overlap. To be sure, some  CEOs opposed Trump early on,   during the presidential campaign. After the inauguration, some CEOs (especially from technology) countered the president  on immigration, signing on to an amicus brief and making public statements.  Other CEOs spoke up  after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement. What is needed now is dramatic, decisive, and collective action to save the country from an out-of-control president.  Let’s consider how CEOs might support a manifesto calling for the president’s resignation. Step 1 —  A trigger:  One trigger for action just happened with Trump’s response to Charlottesville; but other triggers are likely in the coming weeks and months. A trigger may also result from the legal inquiries against the president.  And there may be foreign events (the standoff with North Korea); or a stock market downturn. Step 2 — Coalesce and confer:  We know that such gatherings, via conference calls, took place  soon after Charlottesville. The largest density of CEOs is in the Business Roundtable, which is aligned with Trump’s deregulation and tax reduction agenda.The Roundtable is led by JPMorgan Chase CEO

Here is a proposed document: We, CEOs of America’s largest firms, call upon Donald J. Trump to resign from the office of President of the United States of America. We believe that: We conclude that: Donald Trump is a clear danger to American capitalism, American workers, and American democracy. The threat he poses is unprecedented. This is not a partisan issue — some of us are Republicans, some Democrats, some are Independents. Our concerns are serious.  We are worried about the security and future of the United States itself.

Barbara Kollmeyer,08242017,MarketWatch,08172017,"Published: Aug 17, 2017 4:27 p.m. ET Officials embark on terrorism investigation By MADRID (MarketWatch) — A popular promenade in Barcelona, Spain, became a scene of panic and devastation on Thursday after a van rammed pedestrians, leaving a dozen people dead and dozens more injured. The incident took place on Las Ramblas, a long, tree-lined street that is typically packed with tourists and locals, around 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. Eastern time). Local media were at one point reporting that hostages were being held at a bar near the scene of the attack by other assailants, but later reports cast doubt on the matter. The Associated Press cited the regional president in reporting that two suspects had been arrested. The Wall Street Journal, citing the jidahist-activity-monitoring organization SITE Intelligence Group, reported that Islamic State had claimed responsibility for the attack. Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, tweeted that terrorists would never defeat a united people who love freedom. The seaside city was on lockdown in the immediate wake of the attack, with residents told to not leave their homes and many reported to be sheltering inside stores and restaurants and bars that closed the moment news of the attack reached them. S'acaba de produir atropellament massiu a les Rambles de Barcelona, per part d'una persona amb una furgoneta. Possiblement varis ferits Media reports in Spain and the U.S. indicated the police were treating the incident as a terrorist attack. The police presence on streets in the Spanish capital Madrid, some 600 kilometers southwest of Barcelona, was sharply escalated in the wake of the Barcelona attack. Nathalie Lezcano Sticchi, a 28-year-old resident of Barcelona who lives near the area, told MarketWatch she had passed the scene of the attack just five minutes before, stepping off the Ramblas to go into a Zara clothing store on a side street. “When I was on the first floor, one of the guys who was working [at Zara] said, ‘You have to go outside, we are going to close because something is happening at the Ramblas,’ ” Sticchi said in a telephone interview. She said a friend had forwarded her a message from his mother, who had been at Las Ramblas and seen a truck crashing into people. Sticchi ran to her house, as stores drew their shutters all around her. “People were running everywhere, and no one understood what was going on,” she said, “and I started hearing ambulances.” Several metro lines were closed in Barcelona, and the area remained sealed off into the evening. Police were urging individuals not to share images of the crash site on social media. They also thanked the media for pixellating images they had chose to use of victims: GRACIAS a todos los medios y particulares que estáis pixelando y obviando imágenes duras de víctimas y de operativo policial. #RESPETO Trucks are normally allowed up the Ramblas to make deliveries, and according to Sticchi it has a fairly heavy police presence. Spain hasn’t suffered a major attack on its soil since 2004, when an al-Qaeda-inspired terrorist cell detonated simultaneous explosions on the Cercanias commuter train in Madrid on March 11. The attack, which took place three days before Spain’s general election, killed 192 people and injured thousands. The van attack on Las Ramblas killed 12 and injured 80, according to an NBC News report citing the regional president. The Barcelona scene is one that has become all too familiar in Europe. A deadly truck attack in Nice, France, in July of last year left 86 people dead and hundreds injured. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. In December 2016, a truck was deliberately driven into the Christmas market in Berlin, leaving 12 people dead and 56 others injured. ISIS has claimed responsibility for those attacks, along with a deadly attack near London Bridge in June. Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?
