In September 2016, Wells Fargo said its employees may have created more than 2 million accounts without customer approval. Several executives were subsequently fired, but a review also turned up possible abuses with other products such as auto and life insurance. The third-largest U.S. bank has since tried to improve sales practices and restore trust with customers. Last month, Wells Fargo said the unauthorized accounts totaled as many as 3.5 million. “Since last October, we have taken numerous important steps to fix issues, make things right for our customers and build a better bank,” a bank spokesperson told Reuters via email on Thursday. Wells Fargo shares gained 0.57 percent to $54.05 in morning trading. On Aug. 1, the 11 Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee wrote to its Republican Chairman, Mike Crapo, asking that both Sloan and the board of directors be called to testify before the Committee this month. The letter lists nine new developments since Sloan's predecessor John Stumpf appeared before the Senate Banking Committee in September last year. These included ""concerns about the bank retaliating against employees and purposefully concealing evidence from regulators of systemic problems at the bank."" reut.rs/2tLsbsv During last year’s testimony, Stumpf seemed unprepared under tough questioning from Democrats and Republicans, and Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren accused him of “gutless leadership.” He resigned less than a month later. Warren has repeatedly urged the Federal Reserve to remove all members of the Wells Fargo board of directors who had served during the time the fake accounts were created. ","

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co. has hired law firm Sidley Austin to take the lead in preparing Chief Executive Tim Sloan for his appearance before the U.S. Congress next month to answer questions about a year-long sales practices scandal, according to four sources with knowledge of the decision. Sloan will appear before the Senate Banking Committee, which writes rules for his industry, at a hearing titled “Wells Fargo: One Year Later,” on October 3. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn declined to comment. No one from Sidley Austin was available to comment outside of office hours. The testimony will be Sloan’s first congressional appearance since he took over as CEO in October of last year, roughly a month after Wells Fargo reached a settlement with regulators over the creation of as many as 2.1 million unauthorized accounts. The bank has since disclosed problems with other products, including auto and life insurance, and recently revised its estimate for the number of accounts that were potentially opened without customers’ authorization to 3.5 million. In his own congressional appearances last year, Sloan’s predecessor, John Stumpf, often lacked answers to questions posed by legislators. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren accused him of “gutless leadership.” He left the bank less than a month later and was replaced by Sloan. The law firm that prepared Stumpf for his testimony, Gibson Dunn, will still be working for Wells Fargo, but in a supporting role, said one of the sources. No one from Gibson Dunn was immediately available to comment outside of office hours. Hundreds of outside law firms work for Wells Fargo on various matters, and the bank’s new general counsel, Allen Parker, recently hired a new chief operating officer for the legal team, Tom Trujillo, who is reviewing those relationships. The hiring of Sidley Austin, however, was directed by Wells Fargo’s government affairs office, said one of the sources. ","

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eight of the largest U.S. banks and 82 foreign banks will have an extra year to submit their so-called living wills outlining how they would be unwound in the event of bankruptcy, the Federal Reserve said on Thursday. The extension granted by the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) forms part of a broader effort by financial regulators to ease onerous post-crisis regulations under Republican President Donald Trump’s pro-growth agenda. “The agencies continue to explore ways to improve the resolution planning process and believe it is worthwhile to consider extending the cycle for living will submissions from annual to once every two years. Today’s action is a step towards that end,” the Fed said in a statement. The eight large domestic banks will have until July 1, 2019 to file their plans, while the 82 foreign banks will have until Dec. 31, 2018. Under the Dodd-Frank reform act, the largest U.S. banks must present plans that explain how they would be unwound in the case of a financial crisis without shaking the broader global financial system. The regulators are currently reviewing plans submitted by the big eight banks on July 1. The extension will not affect the review process, the Fed said. Banks have long argued that the annual cycle for submitting living wills - which can comprise thousands of pages - is too onerous. In a June 12 report outlining Trump’s financial de-regulatory reform agenda, the U.S. Treasury recommended extending the cycle to two years, revising the threshold for banks that must submit living wills, and increasing the transparency of guidance regulators feedback on to banks on the plans.

The company also said its Chief Financial Officer Tessa Hilado, 53, would retire. The planned stock buyback follows Allergan’s completion of a separate $15 billion repurchase, and after the company reported mixed trial data for its experimental treatment of NASH liver fibrosis. Allergan on Friday also received a “refusal to file” letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for an expanded approval for its Vraylar drug to treat symptoms associated with schizophrenia in adults. Allergan said it had begun to search for a new finance chief, but declined to provide further comment on Hilado’s departure. Analysts at Bernstein, based on discussions with Allergan’s investor relations team, said Hilado’s departure was her personal decision and should not be viewed as suggesting “issues this year or 2018.” Hilado did not have broad support among Allergan investors and her exit would not be a “particularly strong negative,” they added. Hilado joined Allergan in 2014 and will continue in her current role until a successor is named. Allergan, which said it was committed to boosting its dividend payout annually, also backed its 2017 financial guidance and its commitment to pay down $3.75 billion of debt in 2018. The drugmaker had $30.24 billion in current and long-term debt and capital leases as of June 30. “While the CFO’s departure may create greater uncertainty, we take the company’s reaffirmation of 2017 guidance and third quarter revenue projections as offsetting positives,” Wells Fargo analyst David Maris said.

Financials .SPSY, up 0.12 percent, and the Russell 2000 index of smallcap stocks , up 0.27 percent, which are expected to be among the beneficiaries of a tax reduction, turned higher after trading lower in the early portion of the session. But gains were tempered with equities at record highs and valuations elevated. The forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) on the S&P stood at 17.9 compared with its long-term average of 15.1 while the forward P/E on the Russell is 26.3 against an average of 21.3. “It looks like the market doesn’t want to sell strength here, it wants to buy weakness,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump’s proposal for a cut in the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent was “not negotiable.” The plan, which called for tax cuts for most Americans, also drew criticism for favoring business and the rich and potentially adding trillions of dollars to the deficit. A Commerce Department report showed the economy grew a bit faster than previously estimated in the second quarter, but the momentum probably slowed in the third as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma temporarily curbed activity. The storms also pushed up initial claims for state unemployment benefits for the week, the Labor Department said. “People are waiting to see if the economy actually picks up, they are going to be waiting a long time if they are anticipating it is going to pick up meaningfully,” said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,路透台北9月22日 - 美联储(FED)的决议一如所料，维持利率不变且宣布10月开始缩表。金融市场事前已有所预期，基本上没有太大惊奇。在联储后议后路透所做的调查显示，华尔街初级交易商认为美联储将在12月再次升息，资产负债表将降至3万亿美元。 量化宽松(QE)货币政策就此行将落幕。全球其他国家虽因各有烦恼，无法立刻复制美联储行动，但QE淡出舞台已是大势所趋，各家央行决策者不得不思考收紧政策路径，接下来，谁将接力缩减刺激举措？ 周四标普下调中国主权信用评级，称长时间的强劲信贷增长提高了中国的经济金融风险。虽然标普此次调降使得其对中国的评级与穆迪和惠誉相同，但鉴于中共十九大将在几周后召开，此次调降的时机颇令人意外。 展望下周，重磅数据将相继登场，有英国GDP、美国第二季GDP终值和美联储看重的通胀指标PCE物价指数。日本德国均将公布CPI、中国工业经济效益月度报告等。 此外，多位央行巨头，包括美联储主席叶伦、欧洲央行总裁德拉吉在内都有演说安排。新西兰央行将公布利率决议。 **美联储打响缩表第一枪** 美联储维持利率不变，并且将于10月开始缩减约4.2万亿美元的公债和抵押贷款支持证券(MBS)组合，最初将每月到期证券再投资规模减少至多100亿美元。 尽管近期通胀低迷，但美联储料仍在年底前再升息一次。联储主席叶伦在会后记者会上称，今年通胀下跌的原因仍是个谜，美联储随时准备在必要时调整利率前景。 联储决议发布后，金融市场几乎未受影响。虽然美联储的最新政策立场大部分被视为强硬，但也将其预估的长期“中性”利率从3.0%再次下调至2.75%，反映出对整体经济活力的担忧。 “美联储可能坚持2017年再升息一次以及2018年升息三次的意图。但是联储也下调了长期利率预估，这导致美债收益率曲线趋平，在一定程度上减缓了美元兑日圆的涨势，”大和证券资深外汇策略师Yukio Ishizuki表示。 市场对美联储的反应相当直接，短券收益率的升幅大于长券收益率。债市投资者认为，低通胀和低增长的情况将会持续。美债收益率曲线因而趋平，30年期与两年期美债收益率利差缩至近两个月最窄，距离近10年最窄纪录不远，连带地也牵动了市场对美元后市的看法。美元指数很快地就从两周峰值走下坡。 “不错，美联储是告诉大家，将会继续收紧政策，但欧洲央行、加拿大央行，甚至英国央行现在也告诉大家，它们将开始将政策正常化，”Wells Fargo Securities汇市策略师Erik Nelson说。“这与一两年前的情况形成显明的对照，当时美联储是唯一收紧政策的央行。” 安联分析师Charlie Ripley则指出，美联储向市场传递了些许鹰派的讯息，即货币政策正常化已经全面展开。他说：“不过美联储内部有很多空缺，委员会构成可能会发生变化，特别是考虑到叶伦主席的任期明年2月到期，所以我认为，在看待这次的声明时应该有所保留”。 **欧洲央行缩减刺激举措？** 欧元区经济连续17个季度增长，有助欧洲央行缩减刺激措施。不过，消息人士对路透表示，决策者对于是否在10月政策会议上敲定结束印钞计划的明确时间看法分歧，他们很有可能至少保留在2018年延长购债操作的选项。 消息人士称，欧元持续强势打压了通胀，导致决策者看法分歧。德国等北方富国为首的鹰派准备缩减2.3万亿欧元的购债计划，但鸽派只是希望缩减每月购债规模。这样一来，官员们可能在10月26日的会议寻求妥协，不会确定购债操作的结束日期，或将推迟至12月再做决定。 **英国央行跃跃欲试升息** 英国央行总裁卡尼在国际货币基金组织(IMF)的演说中表示，英国脱欧或将在短期内损害英国的增长前景幷且推升通胀，因英国要调整适应脱欧后的日子。 他还重申英国央行可能很快就要升息的讯息。不过由于卡尼在央行利率行动时间方面欠缺明确评论，他讲完话后英镑下跌。 路透调查显示，近三分之二的受访分析师目前预计英国央行将在11月升息，但四分之三的受访者认为那时候升息不是正确时机。 本周牵动英镑的更大因素是英相特雷莎·梅是否软化退欧身段。她周五稍晚将发表演说，部分媒体披露她将称英国愿在退欧过渡阶段支付200亿欧元换取单一市场准入等关税优惠。英镑由跌转升，逼近去年6月退欧公投后最高水平。 **标普调降中国评级* 标普将中国长期主权信用评级从“AA-”下调至“A+”，称因数年来为实现政府的经济增长目标而实施的信贷刺激，令中国面临控制由此滋生的金融风险的挑战。 虽然对中国信贷持续强劲增长的担忧近几季加剧，但中国上半年GDP增长6.9%的增速超过预期。一些分析师称，下调评级不会对金融市场产生太大影响。 “这一决定已不是新鲜事，降评后标普对中国的评级与惠誉及穆迪相同。此举对金融市场的影响将非常有限，”瑞穗银行驻香港亚洲外汇策略师Ken Cheung表示。“对于那些投资人民币计价债券的投资者而言，他们更关心的是对人民币的预期。下调评级的决定对资本流入的影响可能也有限。” 根据国际清算银行(BIS)数据，8月人民币实际有效汇率指数续升0.54%，名义有效汇率指数升0.41%。实际有效汇率上升代表本国货币相对价值上升，下降表示本币贬值。(完) ,"

Mark Kolakowski,09282017,Investopedia,09212017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are projected to add $15.7 trillion to global GDP by the year 2030, an increase of 14% over baseline projections, according to PwC, a leading international accounting and consulting firm. Based on this and similar projections made by another consulting firm, Accenture, analysts at Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) have issued outperform ratings on nine stocks that they believe are well-positioned to ride the AI wave to greater profits and also longterm outperformance in the stock market, Barron's reports. While computers now dominate government, Corporate America and Wall Street, the growing use of AI is moving technology many steps further by enabling computers to think, learn and reason like humans, enabling computers to perform more sophisticated tasks. Five of these companies are based in the U.S. While they are all technology leaders, they serve a broad array of markets that include consumers and corporations: Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL); e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN); social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB); online marketplace eBay Inc. (EBAY); and video streaming service Netflix Inc. (NFLX). The other four are Chinese: social networking, payments, and online entertainment provider Tencent Holding Ltd. (TCEHY); online merchants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA) and JD.com Inc. (JD); and Internet search, e-commerce platform, online payments processor, and web application software provider Baidu Inc. (BIDU).  These companies' dominance in their markets and in key sectors of the Internet position them well to exploit artificial intelligence as its influence spreads. (For more, see also: 7 Global Stocks For The Next Internet Boom.) In an attempt to put that $15 trillion or so in perspective, that's almost the current size of U.S. GDP ($18 trillion), over six times current global spending on e-commerce ($2.4 trillion), and 30 times current worldwide spending on advertising ($500 billion), according to the report by Wells Fargo as quoted by Barron's. Wells Fargo anticipates advances in neural network science that will produce stronger engagement among mobile and Internet users, with benefits for e-commerce and subscription-based business models. More specifically, artificial neural networks (modeled on the natural neural networks in human brains) are designed to facilitate machine learning, or the ability of computers to solve problems without task-specific programming. The early adoption of AI will be mainly in North America as companies boost productivity, PwC  says. However, they expect China to pull ahead in ten years, enjoying a 26% GDP boost by 2030, versus 14.5% in North America. Of the $15.7 trillion AI-driven global GDP increase forecasted for 2030, about $10.7 trillion will be in North America and China combined, or 68% of the total, PwC projects. In China, AI is projected to have its biggest industry impact in manufacturing, which is especially significant for the global economy since China is the world leader in manufacturing, Wells Fargo says, as quoted by Barron's. For the nine companies recommended by Wells Fargo, their 52 week share price gains through Wednesday, and current forward P/E ratios, are, respectively: Alphabet, 19%, 24; Amazon, 15%, 121; Facebook, 30%, 26; eBay, 19%, 17; Netflix, 87%, 89; Tencent, 54%, NA; Alibaba, 57%, 26; JD.com, 51%, 44; and Baidu, 28%, 27.

But the pullback is a buying opportunity, according to one Wall Street firm. Wells Fargo Securities began coverage of Amazon with an outperform rating on its shares and a price target of $1,400, which is 49 percent above Tuesday's closing price. It is also the highest target out of the 42 analysts who cover Amazon, according to FactSet. Wells' analyst predicts the internet giant will be able to use artificial intelligence and data analysis to dominate new industries. ""Given a strong customer experience, scaled infrastructure investments, high user engagement, and lead within Cloud, we believe AMZN is among the best positioned to apply these neural network advances [artificial intelligence] across new verticals/industries,"" analyst Ken Sena wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""We see this lead in data, coupled with the company's edge in compute efficiency, as increasingly feeding insights into supply chain, for its retail, video, and other efforts, and through AWS, for its partners."" Amazon shares have rallied 25 percent this year through Tuesday, compared with the market's 12 percent gain. But the stock is down 4 percent this month compared with the S&P 500's 1 percent gain. Amazon Web Services has 46 percent of the ""infrastructure-as-a-service"" commercial cloud computing market. Sena noted that the research firm IDC estimates the total public cloud computing market will grow to more than $200 billion by 2020. He also predicts the company can gain market share in the apparel, over-the-counter medicine and grocery product categories, which represent another $130 billion of potential sales in the U.S. The e-commerce giant operates on a so-called flywheel model in which low prices, repeat shoppers and a positive experience for buyers and sellers create a self-perpetuating cycle of growth. ""We see Amazon's famous flywheel as spinning with increasingly impenetrable force, where customer experience, frequency, and data will only grow,"" he wrote.

Evelyn Cheng,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"The Wells Fargo Investment Institute doesn't expect the S&P 500 to rise more than 2 percent over the next 15 months, according to the firm's 2018 year-end outlook released Thursday. While some Wall Street strategists have included 2018 S&P targets in their equities notes, the Wells Fargo note marks the first major outlook report for next year. Wells Fargo gave a range of 2,450 to 2,550 for the S&P next year, a decline of 2.3 percent or a rise of nearly 1.7 percent from Wednesday's record close of 2,508.24. The S&P 500 also hit an intraday high Wednesday of 2,508.85. ""The synchronized global recovery that took hold in 2017 should gain in 2018, though restrained by ongoing global headwinds from high debt, slow labor recoveries overseas and political uncertainties around the world,"" Wells Fargo's global investment strategy team wrote in a Monday note that was distributed to the media Thursday. ""We also anticipate that earnings gains will fuel moderately higher U.S. and international equity markets,"" the report said. The strategists added that since the U.S. economy is likely in the ""final third"" of expansion, investors must be particularly aware of risks. In late August, the Wells Fargo Investment Institute raised its 2017 year-end target range by 70 points to 2,300 to 2,400. At the time, the increase still forecast, at best, a roughly 1 percent decline for the S&P. Among 15 strategists surveyed by CNBC last year, Wells Fargo Investment Institute's Scott Wren came the closest to predicting where the S&P would end the year, albeit at a range. The middle of his target range was 2,240, and the S&P ended 2016 at 2,238.83. ",Wells Fargo issues first outlook for 2018 from Wall Street and it's not bullish
Stephanie Landsman,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"The stock market could come within a hair of a correction in the next three months, Wells Fargo says. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, sees problems for the S&P 500 as the record year comes to a close. ""Our midpoint of our target range for year-end 2018 is 2,500,""  Wren said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""We're basically there right now."" Wren is predicting a 4 to 8 percent dip from current levels before year's end. The official definition of a correction is a 10 percent drop. It appears his forecast may already be materializing. Just look at the Dow. The index is on its first four-day losing streak since June. But it's important to note that it has been a banner year for stocks. The Dow has soared nearly 13 percent while the S&P 500 is up 12 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has also reaped big gains, surging nearly 19 percent this year. ""Valuations are meaningfully stretched in that the trailing 12 month P/E ration on the S&P 500 is 20 and change. And, that's against about a 16½ 30-year median,"" Wren said. With stocks on the expensive side, an economy that's ""not really accelerating"" and a Federal Reserve that's firmly executing its rate-hike policy — Wren doesn't see much upside left. ""The net net move between now and the end of 2018 is probably going to be pretty small,"" he added. There's a silver lining in Wren's 2017 downward spiral forecast. His year-end S&P 500 price target for 2018 is 2,450 to 2,550, which would suggest solid gains next year. ""That would give us say a 5 to 8 percent return [in 2018],"" Wren said.

Analyst Matt O'Connor downgraded shares of JPMorgan and regional bank PNC Financial late Monday to hold from buy for this reason. The yield curve is the difference between short term and long-term rates in the Treasury market and often runs parallel to the margin banks make on their loans. ""We continue to believe the yield curve will flatten as the Fed continues to boost short term rates, the unwind of the Fed's bond book isn't likely to meaningfully impact the demand/supply of those assets, and economic growth seems unlikely to significantly accelerate (for a sustained period),"" wrote O'Connor. ""In this environment, net interest income growth is likely to slow and credit costs may begin to inch up."" JPMorgan shares rose more than 40 percent the last 12 months, more than the 33 percent gain for the Financial Select SPDR, as CEO Jamie Dimon guided the bank through a difficult trading environment on Wall Street. Bank shares have perked up again recently as the Fed indicated a December hike was likely and traders bet the move would boost both short term and long term rates, making the industry's lending portfolios more profitable. Deutsche Bank disagrees, apparently. JPMorgan fell slightly in premarket trading following the Deutsche call. ""Increased competition in investment banking/trading may erode some of JPM's recent gains,"" wrote the analyst. ""Post crisis (including in recent years), JPM has gained large market share across its investment bank (IB fees, FICC and EQ trading). However, the competitive landscape seems to have increased and even JPM mgmt (at its 2017 investor day) has acknowledged it will be difficult to maintain share."" PNC has done even better than JPMorgan, up 52 percent in one year. But that run has made the Pittsburgh-based bank too expensive. ""PNC shares now trade at 14.4 times 2018 consensus or a 10% premium to the Large Regional peer group. This compares to a 5% discount on average over both the historical 25-year and 5-year time horizon. Some premium is warranted in our view given the positives noted above, but further multiple expansion seems harder to argue for and we're less positive on Large Regional banks in general given concerns surrounding a flatter yield curve,"" stated the note. Deutsche still thinks factors such as loosening regulation and M&A activity can help the financial sector, but it favors ""turnaround"" stories such as Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo than the sector leaders.

John W. Schoen,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"Call it a plan for a tax plan.American taxpayers eagerly awaiting details of President Donald Trump's ambitious tax reform plan Wednesday were left with more questions than answers. Building on a single page of campaign bullet points promising to simply the sprawling U.S. tax code, give middle-class workers a break and help businesses compete, the administration unveiled a long-awaited ""framework"" that provided only broad brush outlines of an overhaul proposal. But while the nine-page outline proposes sweeping changes, the impact of any reforms are all but impossible to estimate until congressional committees and lawmakers on Capitol Hill agree on specific provisions, let alone bring a bill to a vote. ""We have gone from one page of detail to nine pages of detail,"" said Paul Christopher, a market strategist at Wells Fargo. ""That's still not a complete tax plan."" To be sure, the White House document acknowledges the reality of the task ahead in building a consensus among multiple congressional committees with jurisdiction over budget and tax policy. The effort is further complicated by a GOP divided between fiscal ""hawks"" who want any tax cuts paid for by closing tax breaks to raise revenue and ""supply-siders"" who believe tax cuts will eventually pay for themselves by spurring economic growth.That's why the long-awaited document is being billed as a ""framework"" for tax reform, not an actual plan. One of the biggest unknowns starts with the basic tax brackets used to assess how much each American household owes the Treasury every April 15. To simplify the current system of seven separate income cutoffs, from 10 percent to the top 39.6 percent rate, the plan proposes cutting that to three – 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But the most important detail – when each bracket kicks in — has yet to be spelled out. ""The framework will have specific rates on businesses and families but the actual income parameters will be hammered out later,"" a senior White House official told reporters in a briefing Tuesday. Further confounding those trying to estimate the impact, the plan hints that an additional ""fourth bracket"" may be needed to assure that the wealthiest earners pay their fair share. Families would lose a popular tax break for dependents but get a bigger child tax credit and a $500 credit for dependents other than children. The plan clearly spells out a call to nearly double the so-called standard deduction from the current level to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples. That would effectively shield that income from taxation for those at the bottom end of the income ladder. But anyone making more than that is left to wonder which of the dozens of lucrative tax breaks in the current tax code may be eliminated. The administration signaled at Tuesday's briefing that the popular deduction for taxes paid to state and local governments will be eliminated, but that repeal was not spelled out in Wednesday's nine-page framework. Nor did the plan address the prospects for repeal of popular deductions – the tax breaks for mortgage interest, charitable donations or medical expenses – that can lower a household's annual tax burden by thousands of dollars. The document also outlined various provisions for businesses, including a cut in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent. But while promising to ""modernize"" the dozens of tax breaks that favor specific companies and industries, those details remain to be spelled out. That process is certain to set off a fierce lobbying campaign by those favored by each provision. The document also called for a repeal of the alternative minimum tax, a provision originally intended to tax wealthy households that now reaches well into the middle class. And the plan also calls for eliminating the estate tax. Repealing those provisions may be politically popular. But doing so will be costly the U.S. Treasury. One way to make up the shortfall — and pay for lower tax rates on businesses and individuals —would be to close some of the many deductions, exemptions and exclusions that cost the government nearly $1.4 trillion in fiscal 2017, according to the Treasury. Targeting those tax breaks would spark a hard-fought political tug of war. That's why some lawmakers are hoping to avoid those battles by promising to make up any lost revenue with the prospect that tax cuts will spur the economy. Proponents of the argument claim that faster growth will generate enough new individual income and corporate profits to make up for lower rates.But the theory has numerous critics, including many economists who argue that the idea hasn't worked in the past. And, with the economic recovery now in its eighth year and unemployment at historic lows, it's unlikely a tax cut will have much impact. ""All the evidence shows that tax cuts, tax reform can be very effective, if there is considerable slack in the labor market if unemployment is relatively high,"" said Joachim Fels, a global economic advisor at Pimco. ""If you get a fiscal boost and tax reform this late in the cycle where most of the slack in the market is eroded, you're not going to get a lot of bang for your buck.""

Liz Moyer,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"The abrupt departure of Equifax's chief executive officer on Tuesday has not dampened the criticism of the company since it disclosed a massive data breach earlier this month. As in other recent corporate scandals, the departure of Richard Smith was swift if not inevitable. The credit reporting company said he was retiring effective immediately and he wouldn't get a bonus for this year, though he is eligible to walk away with at least $18.4 million in pension benefits. Some said Tuesday his departure should have happened more quickly. Wells Fargo dispatched its former CEO last year, one month after regulators said thousands of its employees opened millions of fake deposit and credit card accounts to meet aggressive sales goals. Target's former CEO held on for four months before leaving in May 2014 in the wake of a major data breach at the retailer in late 2013. But Anthem's CEO did not leave that company after a 2015 data breach that exposed personal information for 79 million people. The second-largest U.S. insurer recently settled with victims of the hack for $115 million, the biggest data breach settlement yet. What struck people as different about Equifax's situation was the company's bungled response to its crisis. For starters, Equifax waited 40 days from the time it discovered the breach in late July to its public disclosure on Sept. 7. Waiting 40 days ""is pushing it,"" said Nathan Taylor, a cybersecurity lawyer at Morrison Foerster who has represented big companies in data breaches. Equifax's hack affected as many as 143 million people, including personal identifying information such as Social Security numbers, names and birth dates. That number amounts to more than half the U.S. adult population. ""They had to have known this was going to be an area of focus,"" added Taylor. Adding to Equifax's woes, the part of its website devoted to consumers worried about protecting their information was glitchy at first, and there was confusion over Equifax's customer dispute resolution rules. The management appeared slow to react with a cohesive message or customer outreach plan. ""Speaking for everyone on the board, I sincerely apologize,"" Mark Feidler, the new chairman of Equifax's board, said Tuesday, adding it had formed a special committee to look into the data breach. Worse, says Yale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the company appeared to have no clear CEO succession plan. It named Paulino do Rego Barros, the president of its Asia-Pacific region, as interim chief while it conducts a search for a permanent successor. ""This is far less a frustration with the frontier of technology but rather just old fashioned missteps and terrible preventative practices,"" he said. Even Smith's fate, characterized as retirement, didn't sit well. Smith has been scheduled to testify about the breach in the House and the Senate next week, and his sudden departure made lawmakers react angrily. ""A CEO walking out the door just days before he is to appear before Congress is an abdication of his responsibility,"" Sen. Brian Schatz said in a statement Tuesday. Equifax's spokeswoman said Smith was still scheduled to make those appearances next week. The board's move is being interpreted as a way to get out ahead of what is anticipated to be a major grilling by lawmakers. ""The new standard with boards now is 'how badly will we look compared to other unnamed CEOs in front of Congress?'"" said Michael Peregrine, a corporate governance lawyer at McDermott Will & Emery. At the very least, Equifax's shares responded positively to the news on Tuesday, in the sense that they turned positive for the first time in a while. The stock has lost 26 percent of its value since the beginning of September. The shares closed Tuesday higher after spending most of the day lower on the Smith retirement news. Smith, who joined Equifax in 2005 after 22 years as an executive at General Electric, is staying on in an unpaid role to assist the company for 90 days, Equifax said in a securities filing. His total pay for 2016 was $14.9 million, according to the filing, including a $3 million bonus he might have been eligible to get this year as well. The rest of his 2017 compensation won't be decided until the conclusion of an independent review. ""This is akin to an oil tanker spill,"" Taylor said. ""It doesn't matter if the captain had 12 hours of sleep and tons of training, people are going to be watching everything you do."" ",Equifax CEO walks away with $18 million pension benefit

It has now been a year since industry regulators revealed the sales scandal at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). As the following timeline shows, a lot has happened since then at the 165-year-old bank. Image source: Getty Images. Sept. 8, 2016 -- The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) reveals that thousands of Wells Fargo employees opened 2 million deposit and credit card accounts that consumers may not have authorized. We have at any one time 100,000 team members in our branch and retail bank network. And we hire people, and people turn over. Of those 100,000, the vast majority do the right thing, they come to work. Their life's work and mission is to help people. And I love these people. Every year -- on average for the last five years, 1,000 did not do the right thing. Sept. 20, 2016 -- Stumpf testifies about the scandal to the Senate Banking Committee. He's panned in the media for being insufficiently contrite and unprepared for the senators' questions. Sept. 27, 2016 -- The independent members of Wells Fargo's board announce that Stumpf will forfeit $41 million in unvested equity awards and not be paid a bonus for 2016. It was also announced that the former head of the bank's retail unit, Carrie Tolstedt, had left the company and will forfeit $19 million in unvested equity awards, and similarly not receive a bonus for 2016. Sept. 29, 2016 -- Stumpf testifies before the House of Representative's Committee on Financial Services. Oct. 12, 2016 -- Stumpf resigns as chairman and CEO. President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan succeeds him at CEO, while former lead independent director Stephen Sanger becomes chairman. Stumpf says: I am grateful for the opportunity to have led Wells Fargo. I am also very optimistic about its future, because of our talented and caring team members and the goodwill the stagecoach continues to enjoy with tens of millions of customers. While I have been deeply committed and focused on managing the company through this period, I have decided it is best for the company that I step aside. I know no better individual to lead this company forward than Tim Sloan. Oct. 14, 2016 -- Wells Fargo reports third-quarter earnings, the first with Sloan as CEO. According to Sloan's prepared remarks for the conference call: As the new CEO, my immediate and highest priority is to restore trust in Wells Fargo. As you know, on Sept. 8, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency], and the Los Angeles city attorney related to sales practices in retail banking. I know that this is not the type of activity you expect from Wells Fargo and is certainly not what we expect from ourselves. We let down our customers, our shareholders, and our team members. We simply failed to fulfill our responsibility to all our stakeholders. Nov. 17, 2016 -- Issues first in a series of monthly updates on the performance of its retail unit in the wake of the scandal. The impact is seen in the 44% drop in the number of new consumer checking accounts opened in October compared with the year-ago period, as well as a 50% decline in new credit card applications. Nov. 29, 2016 -- Wells Fargo's board of directors amends the bank's bylaws to require the separation of the chairman and CEO roles and for the chairman and vice chairman of the board to be independent directors. According to the bank's newly elected chairman, Stephen Sanger: The board previously acted to elect an independent chairman to lead the board, and we believe formalizing this structure is the right decision at this time for the company and its investors, customers, and team members. Efforts to restore the trust of our customers and team members are well underway and will continue until we have fully addressed the issues surrounding retail banking sales practices. While the investigation of these practices and related matters by the independent directors continues in earnest, we believe this action will enhance the board's independence and its oversight of the company's management, and we appreciate the feedback that we received from our investors on this matter. Feb. 20, 2017 -- Wells Fargo elects two new independent board members: Karen B. Peetz, retired president of The Bank of New York Mellon, and Ronald L. Sargent, retired chairman and CEO of office-supply retailer Staples. Feb. 21, 2017 -- Wells Fargo fires four former leaders of its retail bank. March 1, 2017 -- Wells Fargo reports that no members of its executive committee will receive bonuses for 2016 and that equity awards they received in 2014 that vest after 2016 will be reduced by up to 50%. The result is an aggregate reduction in compensation totaling approximately $32 million, according to the bank. Sanger says: These compensation actions for the Operating Committee, though not related to any findings of improper behavior, are part of the board's ongoing efforts to promote accountability and ensure Wells Fargo puts customer interests first. As we seek to regain trust, the board is taking decisive actions. We will continue to work to make right what went wrong and remain focused on providing the accountability and oversight that our customers, employees, and investors expect and deserve. March 21, 2017 -- Sloan hosts a companywide town hall meeting to introduce six new long-term goals and preview a new national advertising campaign entitled ""Building Better Every Day."" From Sloan's prepared remarks: We're making things right for our customers and our team members. We are fixing problems, and we're building a better bank for the future. As we rebuild trust, we will reintroduce to our stakeholders what our Wells Fargo bankers have always been known for, and that's helping our customers to succeed financially. March 28, 2017 -- The OCC, the primary regulator for national banks, downgrades Wells Fargo's Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating to ""Needs to Improve"" as a result of ""previously issued regulatory consent orders."" Sloan says: We are disappointed with this rating given Wells Fargo's strong track record of lending to, investing in, and providing service to low- and moderate-income communities. However, we are committed to addressing the OCC's concerns because restoring trust in Wells Fargo and building a better bank for our customers and our communities is our top priority. Wells Fargo is deeply committed to economic growth, sustainable homeownership and neighborhood stability in low- and moderate-income communities and will continue to invest above and beyond what is required by CRA. March 28, 2017 -- Wells Fargo says that it reached a $110 million agreement to settle a class action lawsuit filed in May 2015 over the bank's retail sales practices. Sloan says: This agreement is another step in our journey to make things right with customers and rebuild trust. We want to ensure that each customer impacted by our sales practices issue has every opportunity for remediation, and this agreement presents an additional option. We continue to encourage customers to contact us directly so that we can act quickly to refund fees and address any concerns. April 4, 2017 -- CEO Tim Sloan publishes open letter to the bank's customers to ""thank them for their loyalty"" and share updates regarding its retail sales practices. Sloan says: As we work toward rebuilding the trust of our customers, team members, community partners, and shareholders, we are committed to keeping our stakeholders informed. This is why we are not only thanking them, but also sharing the significant progress we have made to make things right, fix problems, and build a better Wells Fargo, recognizing much work remains that we are committed to do. April 7, 2017 -- Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services issues a report urging shareholders to vote against the re-election of 12 out of the bank's 15 board members. Wells Fargo's board responds with a prepared statement laying out eight steps the bank has taken in response to the sales scandal. April 10, 2017 -- Wells Fargo releases the findings of an investigation into the company's retail sales practices overseen by a special committee of the bank's independent directors and assisted by the law firm Shearman & Sterling. Sloan says: The board's report is a necessary examination of what went wrong in our culture, operations, and governance. It's clear from the board's review that we had an incentive program and high-pressure sales culture in our Community Bank that over time drove behavior that in many cases was inappropriate and inconsistent with our values. Because of our decentralized operating model, our corporate leadership took too long to understand the seriousness and scope of the problem, and as a result, the actions we took over the years to address it weren't adequate. April 13, 2017 -- Wells Fargo reports first-quarter earnings. The bank's bottom line was flat, at $5.5 billion, but a number of other critical metrics show signs of strain, including its efficiency ratio and return on assets. April 17, 2017 -- The bank launches the previously announced marketing campaign, Building Better Every Day. April 21, 2017 -- Wells Fargo expands its class action settlement, previously announced in March, to include any customers who were affected by sales practice issues as early as May 2002, pushing the covered range back by seven years. The updated settlement will total $142 million. Sloan says: The expansion of this agreement is another important step to make things right for our customers. On our journey to rebuild trust, we want to ensure our customers feel confident that we have heard their concerns about retail sales practices, which includes offering them numerous opportunities for remediation. We encourage any customer with concerns or questions about their accounts to contact us. April 25, 2017 -- Wells Fargo holds its annual meeting. Shareholders vent their ire at the bank by, among other things, reelecting the bank's board members with such underwhelming majorities that the results are seen by corporate governance experts as a vote of no confidence in all but three members of the board. July 6, 2017 -- The bank forms a new stakeholder-relations group to ""foster a more integrated approach to engaging with its key stakeholders."" Former director of investor relations Jim Rowe is promoted to lead the group, reporting to Chief Administrative Officer Hope Hardison, who says: As Wells Fargo continues to focus on rebuilding trust and building a better bank, it's more important than ever that our key stakeholder relationships and strategies are well integrated. During a decade in investor relations, Jim has become a trusted leader at Wells Fargo. His knowledge of our businesses and proven ability to partner across the company make him ideal to advance our efforts to create an aggregated stakeholder view. July 8, 2017 -- The class action settlement for retail sales practices receives preliminary court approval. Sloan says: We are pleased that the court found the settlement to be fair, reasonable, and adequate. This preliminary approval is a major milestone in our efforts to make things right for our customers. It further ensures each customer impacted by an improper retail sales practice has every opportunity for remediation. This is in addition to our direct efforts to review accounts and provide remediation. These efforts are fundamental to restoring trust with all our stakeholders and building a better Wells Fargo for the future. July 27, 2017 -- Wells Fargo discloses that a separate internal investigation uncovered 570,000 customers with car loans form the bank who may have been inappropriately charged for failing to maintain qualifying insurance on their cars. ""For approximately 20,000 customers, the additional costs of the insurance could have contributed to a default that resulted in the repossession of their vehicle,"" says the bank. Franklin Codel, head of Wells Fargo consumer lending, states: We take full responsibility for our failure to appropriately manage the CPI [collateral protection insurance] program and are extremely sorry for any harm this caused our customers, who expect and deserve better from us. Upon our discovery, we acted swiftly to discontinue the program and immediately develop a plan to make impacted customers whole. Aug. 4, 2017 -- Sloan issues a companywide message on the bank's ""rebuilding trust efforts,"" noting among other things that ""[b]ecause there is so much interest in the work we are doing to rebuild trust, we can expect more headlines as we fulfill our commitment to identify and fix problems and make things right for our customers."" Aug. 15, 2017 -- Wells Fargo announces that three members of its board, including chairman Stephen Sanger, will retire at the end of the year. Former Federal Reserve governor Elizabeth ""Betsy"" Duke was unanimously elected by the board to replace Sanger, who says: Betsy was the unanimous choice to lead the board as it continues its focus on strengthening oversight and rebuilding the trust of shareholders, customers, and other stakeholders. Her broad understanding of the financial system and markets combined with years of main street community banking experience make her the ideal chair to work with the rest of the board and Tim Sloan as Wells Fargo continues to move forward. Aug. 22, 2017 -- Sloan issues a companywide message ""to address team member questions and provide updates on the steps the company is taking to make things right for customers and build a better Wells Fargo."" Aug. 31, 2017 -- Wells Fargo reports the results of its expanded third-party review of its retail sales practices, increasing the number of potentially fake customer accounts up from 2.1 million to 3.5 million.

As of the latest available information, Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) stock portfolio contains 44 companies' common stocks and has a market value of roughly $178 billion. Of this, about $66.9 billion, or more than 37% of the portfolio, is made up of banking stocks, many of which we know were selected by CEO Warren Buffett himself. This begs the question -- why does Warren Buffett seem to love the banking business so much? As of the latest available information, there are eight different bank stocks in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, with positions that range in size from $517 million to more than $25 billion. Company Stock Symbol Number of Shares Market Value as of 9/25/2017 American Express AXP 151,610,700 $13.4 billion Bank of America BAC 700,000,000 $17.3 billion Bank of New York Mellon BK 50,229,588 $2.6 billion Goldman Sachs GS 10,959,519 $2.5 billion M&T Bank MTB 5,382,040 $829 million Synchrony Financial SYF 17,463,000 $517 million U.S. Bancorp USB 85,063,167 $4.5 billion Wells Fargo WFC 467,987,270 $25.2 billion Data source: Berkshire Hathaway SEC Filings. Bank of America investment as per company press release. Some of Buffett's bank stocks have their own stories behind how they ended up in the portfolio. For example, Berkshire's massive Bank of America investment is the result of a savvy financial crisis-era investment that allowed Berkshire to purchase 700 million shares of the bank for less than one-third of their current market value. In other cases, Buffett simply loves to buy well-run businesses at fair prices. With that in mind, here's some color on how so many banks ended up in Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio. Image source: The Motley Fool. Simply put, banks have a lot of characteristics that Buffett is known to love. And thanks to government regulations, Berkshire Hathaway cannot simply acquire banks outright, so the company invests through bank stocks instead. For one thing, banking is a ""forever"" industry. People will always need safe places to put their money, and other companies will always need financial institutions to be able to conduct their own business. In short, Buffett likes picking the long-term winners in industries that will be around for centuries, and few industries are more durable than banking. In addition, banks receive cash from depositors for next to nothing and lend it out to creditworthy borrowers to make a profit. This is similar to the insurance business, another Buffett favorite, which provides low-cost capital through paid-in premiums, which the company can then invest at a profit. Another reason Buffett has accumulated so many bank stocks is because there have been plenty of opportunities to do so at a bargain, which Buffett has taken advantage of. I already mentioned the Bank of America investment, and the Goldman Sachs stake was also a product of the financial crisis. Another example is that Buffett initially purchased shares of American Express during a banking panic in the 1960s. Additionally, M&T Bank was purchased in the wake of the Savings and Loan Crisis in 1991. In Buffett's most recent letter to shareholders, he said, ""widespread fear is your friend as an investor, because it serves up bargain purchases."" This has been especially true in the banking industry over the years. Not all of Buffett's bank investments have been bargains. Some were just Buffett doing what he does best -- finding the best companies in a durable industry. The two biggest examples of this in Berkshire's portfolio are Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp, which are consistently among the most profitable and efficient big banks in America. Although, to be fair, Wells Fargo was purchased at a time when the bank's shares were trading at an incredibly low valuation. Take a look at the return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) of these two banks (the blue and yellow lines in the chart) compared to the rest of the five largest U.S. banks in recent years. This consistent performance is the key reason Buffett hasn't gotten rid of his Wells Fargo investment, even after the scandals plaguing the bank. WFC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts. First off, I never suggest you buy any stock simply because a billionaire owns it, even if that billionaire is Warren Buffett. Additionally, it's fair to say that at the time Buffett bought most of his bank stocks, they were trading at big discounts relative to their current valuations. Having said that, there could be some bargains to be found, here. For example, I recently wrote how Wells Fargo could be a great buy for investors who have the patience to wait out the fallout from its recent scandals. Recent addition Synchrony Financial could also be a bargain for long-term investors. However, it's important to do your own research before investing in these, or any other, bank stocks in your own portfolio. ","
      
    Why Warren Buffett Loves Bank Stocks -- The Motley Fool

Eric Volkman,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Analysts at investment banks cover a great many stocks, but some big names aren't as widely tracked as you might expect. Such is the case with Warren Buffett's investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B). It's hard to say why, but it's covered by only a handful of prognosticators. Newly added to those ranks is Sarah Dewitt of JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) J.P. Morgan unit. She recently initiated coverage with an ""overweight"" recommendation, at a price target of $210 for the company's B shares (they currently trade around $183). Let's take a look at the key points of her argument and see whether they hold water. In J.P. Morgan's initial research note on Berkshire Hathaway, Dewitt describes the company as ""a collection of best-in-class businesses with unmatched balance sheet strength."" That's broadly true. Focusing our gaze on Berkshire Hathaway's top three stock holdings by market value -- Kraft Heinz, Wells Fargo, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- shows that while all have their weaknesses (and aren't necessarily ""best-in-class""), they have plenty of advantages, too. High on Dewitt's list of pluses for Berkshire Hathaway is the earnings potential of the insurance and railroad businesses, two of the company's largest segments. Lead insurance asset GEICO has managed to take significant market share through aggressive marketing and competitive pricing during a time of rising premiums in its industry. And Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF, one of America's top rail operators, is leveraging this strong position by investing in rail network improvements. It's also expanding with new routes. Both developments sound like tasty recipes for growth to me. And they're highly significant, as insurance and rail combined were responsible for nearly 50% of Berkshire Hathaway's earnings last year. Another contributor to what is bound to be robust growth is Berkshire Hathaway's bulging war chest. Dewitt points out that the company has an eye-watering $66 billion in excess cash (i.e., the amount over the $20 billion it wants to maintain at all times). Image source: The Motley Fool. That cash is in good hands. Buffett and his team have proven they're never in a rush to plow recklessly into an acquisition. They always seem to find the right assets at the right moment to goose portfolio value. Witness the company's renewed plunge into Apple around New Year's, shortly after which the tech giant delivered Q1 earnings that broke records and sent the stock skyward. Dewitt didn't wear rose-colored glasses while examining Berkshire Hathaway; she's sober-minded and realistic about the risks it faces. Chief among these is the ""key man"" problem -- in other words, what happens when the now 87-year-old Buffett exits the scene. She's also concerned that profitability and book value ""have meaningful sensitivity"" to the broader American economy. Yet Dewitt believes, as I do, that the advantages of Berkshire Hathaway far outweigh the risks. Post-Buffett, his value investing approach will almost certainly stay in place at the company given how successful it's been. And that stock portfolio is a thing of beauty. You can probably find any number of funds that hold Apple, Wells Fargo, Kraft Heinz, and other wide-moat companies. However, there are precious few that mix these blue chips in with other investments to produce the sustained outperformance that Berkshire Hathaway has delivered. Yes, it still leans heavily on Buffett's preferred sectors -- he has always loved financials, and he enjoys riding the rails -- but it's spread out enough to mitigate the impact of an economic shock plus the insurance losses sure to arise from the recent natural disasters. The company has been through market dives before and has come out stronger on the other end. Ultimately, J.P. Morgan's assessment of Berkshire Hathaway is pretty much on the money. I think it's a good note that supports an accurate recommendation on the stock, which in my mind is unquestionably a buy candidate for any investor. ","
      
    A Major Bank Rates Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway a Buy. Should You Pull the Trigger? -- The Motley Fool

  "
"Matthew Frankel, CFP",09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Did you know that Warren Buffett earns thousands of dollars in dividends per minute? Or that lunch with the Oracle of Omaha is apparently worth millions? These are just a couple of interesting facts about Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) legendary CEO that you may not be aware of. When Warren Buffett originally bought shares in a struggling textile manufacturer named Berkshire Hathaway in 1962, he was simply trying to make a quick profit, not take over the company and grow it in to a conglomerate. Image source: The Motley Fool. Buffett became so infuriated that not only did he refuse to sell, but he bought enough Berkshire stock to take control of the company (and fire the manager who refused to honor the original agreement). Berkshire's shares are worth approximately $275,000 each as I write this. Surprisingly, Buffett has referred to his takeover of Berkshire as the worst investment he's ever made. The vast majority (about 99%) of Buffett's wealth is in Berkshire Hathaway stock, and generally when you read about ""Buffett stocks,"" you're actually reading about stocks Buffett or his team have purchased for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. However, Buffett does maintain a personal stock portfolio that's worth a significant amount of money. He rarely discusses investments in his personal portfolio, but we do know a few. Major Berkshire holding Wells Fargo is also one of Buffett's personal holdings, as is real estate investment trust Seritage Growth Properties. Buffett has said that the stocks he holds are similar in nature to what he would buy for Berkshire, but he holds some that wouldn't make the cut based on size -- Seritage is a good example of this. Warren Buffett has donated more than $30 billion to charitable organizations over the years, and is planning to give away substantially all of his remaining wealth. As part of his philanthropy, Buffett auctions off a lunch with himself every year to benefit anti-poverty charity GLIDE. The auctions, which were an idea of Buffett's late wife Susie in 2000, give the winner a lunch for themselves and up to seven friends with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in New York City. The bids regularly extend into the millions. The 2017 winner paid $2.68 million for the lunch, and 2016's winner paid $3.4 million. In all, the auctions have generated over $26 million for the foundation. Much of this amount came from Berkshire's largest stock holdings, including $148 million from Coca-Cola, $182 million from Wells Fargo, and more than $195 million from Kraft Heinz. Buffett loves dividend stocks, especially those that consistently raise their payouts, as they generate a reliable stream of cash that Berkshire can put to work in any way management sees fit. You might be surprised to learn that Berkshire regularly underperforms the markets in years when the stock market is soaring. For example, when the S&P 500 jumped by 29% in 2003, Berkshire's stock rose by less than 16%. When the S&P rebounded nearly 27% from the financial crisis in 2009, Berkshire gained less than 3%. Buffett openly acknowledges that Berkshire will often fail to beat the market during its best years. However, Berkshire's long-term success is due to beating the market when times are tough. In investing, a smart defensive strategy can generate far superior gains to an aggressive one, and Berkshire's track record is proof of this. In fact, while the S&P 500 generated total returns of 12,717% from 1964 through 2016, Berkshire returned a staggering 1,972,595%, despite underperforming the market several years along the way.

If you want to understand Bank of the Ozarks (NASDAQ:OZK), or any bank for that matter, you should look at it from different angles, one of which is the quality of leadership. Image source: Getty Images. Leadership is hard to quantify because it's subjective, but there are nevertheless metrics that measure it. My favorite is the CEO approval score on Glassdoor.com, a website where current and former employees review companies and their management. The instinct in Bank of the Ozarks' case is to assume that its chairman and CEO, George Gleason, must have sky-high scores. How could he not given the bank's incredible performance over the past 20 years? *Includes banks on the KBW large and regional banking indexes that have generated a positive return since 1997. Data source: S&P's Capital IQ. As you can see, no other bank comes close to Bank of the Ozarks in terms of total shareholder return. Since going public in 1997, the biggest bank in Arkansas has returned a total of more than 5,000%. Compared to other banks, it's like a giraffe among Shetland ponies. Yet, Gleason's approval rating is lower than any major bank CEO that I've seen. Only 65% of employees who have submitted reviews on Glassdoor approve of the job he's doing. The most popular bank CEOs -- those like U.S. Bancorp's Richard Davis, Capital One's Richard Fairbank, and JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon -- get approval scores above 90%. Even CEOs that don't do as well -- those of smaller regional banks such as BB&T's Kelly King, PNC Financial's William Demchak, and SunTrust Banks' William Rogers -- come in comfortably above 70%. Bank CEO Employee Approval Score Capital One Richard Fairbank 93% U.S. Bancorp Richard Davis* 92% JPMorgan Chase Jamie Dimon 91% Citigroup Michael Corbat 88% BB&T Kelly King 88% Wells Fargo Timothy Sloan 82% Bank of America Brian Moynihan 80% PNC Financial William Demchak 78% SunTrust Banks William Rogers 76% Fifth Third Bancorp Greg Carmichael 74% Bank of the Ozarks George Gleason 65% *Davis retired earlier this year as CEO, but remains chairman of U.S. Bancorp. Data source: Glassdoor.com. Another thing that caught my eye on Glassdoor's page for Bank of the Ozarks is the trend in Gleason's approval rating over time. At one point last year, Gleason's rating dipped below 20%. It stayed around there for months before heading higher this year. Indeed, the more you dig in, the worse Bank of the Ozarks looks when it comes to leadership. Only a third of reviewers would recommend the bank as an employer to a friend, while just 39% of them perceive the bank's business outlook to be positive. Of the five ratings categories that Glassdoor covers -- culture and values, work/life balance, senior management, compensation and benefits, and career opportunities -- Bank of the Ozarks gets the lowest score for senior management, a mere 2.3 out of 5.0. Image source: Glassdoor.com. How should investors and analysts square this with the bank's stock performance and the legendary stature of Gleason? I have no idea, but I think there's more to this story than meets the eye. ","

 ,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Supported by Breakingviews By Gina Chon A botched investigation into a hack at the Securities and Exchange Commission is a warning for other regulatory agencies. The agency’s chairman, Walter J. Clayton, told senators on Tuesday that he did not know the exact timing of a breach from last year and that his predecessor may not have been notified. That is troubling given the sensitive market data kept there. During a Senate hearing this week, Mr. Clayton shed little new light on the breach into the S.E.C.’s corporate-disclosure filing system, which the agency disclosed only last week. Mr. Clayton said he only learned about it in August, a few months after he joined the agency. He also said he did not have any reason to believe that his predecessor, Mary Jo White, had been notified. Agency bosses don’t have to be told about every hack, but the breach of the S.E.C.’s Edgar filing system, which is used by public companies and relied upon by investors, should have been reported promptly to the top. Senators asked whether the hack raises concerns about other data housed at the S.E.C., including the Consolidated Audit Trail scheduled to go live later this year. That will contain a record of orders for most equity and listed option trades, and nonpublic information about the customers behind them. Even before the S.E.C. hack was revealed, stock exchanges and traders were worried about the potential for cyberattacks targeting that data. At the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, investment firms have been worried about an automated trading plan that would give the agency access to trading-firm source codes without a subpoena. The agency is revising the rule after backlash from the industry, but it will probably still push for a database of trading records. Several other regulators also house market-moving information, including enforcement actions. Deal reviews are conducted by the Justice Department, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. And the Food and Drug Administration’s decisions on whether to approve new medications are closely watched by investors. Agencies are also hampered by insufficient resources. Their purse strings are controlled by Congress, which routinely provides less funding than the S.E.C., C.F.T.C. and other agencies request. Investor worry over their defenses is justified.

                                    disclosed on Sept.7 that criminals had exploited a flaw in its website to gain access to confidential data about 143 million consumers. An Equifax spokesperson told MarketWatch that Smith, whose retirement is effective immediately, won’t receive a “package” to retire and will not receive a 2017 bonus based on the company’s performance. Smith received bonuses of about $3 million a year in 2016 and 2015 . Smith will also will not receive severance pay, which could have been as much as $5 million. However, Smith will still receive some $18.3 million in pension benefits he is entitled to under any circumstance, according to the spokesperson. Read: After breach, Equifax CEO leaves with $18 million pension, and possibly more Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat from Massachusetts, was more focused during the hearing on Clayton’s call for more IPOs, but after the hearing she issued a statement about Equifax and Smith. “I’ve called for Equifax executives to be held accountable for their role in failing to stop this data breach and hiding it from the public for forty days,” said Warren. “It’s not real accountability if the CEO resigns without giving back a nickel in pay and without publicly answering questions.” Smith, who the board said would retire as of Tuesday, was expected to appear before the House Energy Committee and Senate Banking Committee next week. See also: Equifax faces its biggest litigation threat from state attorneys general Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and the ranking member on the banking committee, asked why, given the situation at Equifax, the SEC still had not finalized the 2010 Dodd-Frank law’s clawback policy. Clayton said that the Dodd-Frank clawback rule was “on his list” and that he intended to “finish the mandate,” but he welcomed the senators’ input on the agency’s remaining Dodd-Frank rulemaking priorities. The SEC’s regulatory agenda announced July 20 made no mention of another Dodd-Frank rule never finalized, Section 956, which prohibits incentive-based compensation that encourages inappropriate risks. However, despite the senators’ outrage and call for SEC action on clawbacks, neither one of the post-crisis policies — the Dodd-Frank clawback rule or the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley clawback rule — is applicable to the Equifax situation. Read: SEC’s clawback proposal leaves a big loophole That’s because the broader Dodd-Frank policy, not yet finalized by the SEC, and the Sarbanes-Oxley clawback law that focuses only on CEOs and CFOs, both require a material restatement of prior financial results to trigger enforcement. So do most company policies, such as the one at Equifax or the one at Wells Fargo

                                   . Equifax’s policy is even more forgiving than Wells Fargo’s, exempting executives from clawbacks unless the misstatement of financial results is the result of fraud. That's similar to the Sarbanes-Oxley policy that requires misconduct by someone. The Equifax policy, however, does leave open the possibility that if an executive engages “in certain other activities detrimental to the Company” he or she may be subject to financial consequences such cancellation of equity grants. But just like the Sarbanes-Oxley clawback policy, where the SEC has a lot of latitude in enforcement if companies fail to do so, Equifax’s clawback policy leaves a lot of the interpretation of these terms up to the board. “More and more companies are adopting fairly comprehensive clawback policies as contained in Dodd-Frank, but very few are actually invoking the policy to clawback compensation,” said Divesh Sharma, an accounting professor at Kennesaw State University’s Coles College of Business, whose research focuses on corporate clawback policies. “Companies are simply checking the compliance box.” See also:  Rarely enforced SEC rules may give green light to earnings manipulation “The terms ‘materiality’ and ‘misconduct’ are quite subjective,” said Sharma “In allowing these executives to retire, the board is signaling, at this point, they do not believe any of them committed any misconduct or failed as a manager,” he said. In the case of Wells Fargo’s CEO John Stumpf and senior executive Carrie Tolstedt, the reported eventual clawback numbers looked big but were still only a fraction of their overall compensation. In addition, the majority of the clawed-back amounts consisted of unvested stock-option awards, rather than cash already paid out. Wells Fargo clawed back approximately $28 million paid as incentive compensation in March 2016 under a 2013 equity grant, in addition to the $41 million in unvested equity awards that Stumpf agreed to forfeit shortly before his October 2016 resignation, according to a blog post by Kevin LaCroix, author of the blog D&O Diary. The $28 million already paid will be deducted from his retirement plan payouts, according to the bank’s statements at the time. Based on the findings of its board investigation, the bank was also able to support a change in view of Tolstedt’s retirement with honors, determining that “cause existed” for Tolstedt’s September 2016 termination. That permitted the board to request forfeiture of $47.3 million outstanding stock-option awards, in addition to $19 million of unvested equity awards the board caused to be forfeited at the time of her termination. The total value of Tolstedt’s compensation forfeitures was approximately $66.3 million, and as with Stumpf, the majority was compensation that had not yet been turned into cash. See also: Wells Fargo CEO’s $41 million ranks only third among executive-pay clawbacks, forfeitures Wells Fargo did more than most companies because it is a bank subject to under stricter regulatory requirements after the financial crisis. In Wells Fargo’s case, that stricter policy also allowed it justify a clawback based on reputational damage to the bank and poor risk management. LaCroix also cited an article in 2016 by Columbia Law Professor John Coffee on the CLS Blue Sky Blog, in which he commented, “Wells Fargo’s far broader clawback policy was the result of pressure from New York City’s pension funds in 2013, which had threatened to file a shareholder proxy resolution unless Wells Fargo adopted a policy broadly authorizing clawbacks beyond the context of restatements.” ","Senators press SEC chairman on Dodd-Frank clawbacks, but Equifax execs ineligible - MarketWatch"

But there were roadblocks in content licensing that made innovation tough, until now. “Netflix has been working solidly to come up with algorithms to match consumers with their content — also Netflix has a lot more power than they did back in 2009 to get people to allow them to search their video,” Johnson said in an email to MarketWatch. “The advances in [artificial intelligence] and neural networks means that they can now make sense of that data. “Essentially, they are looking for patterns in the data that equal the right output they are looking for.

Ryvicker and Sena wrote that through advancements in convolutional neural networks, Netflix can detect and analyze underlying scene elements that drive viewer engagement.

According to FactSet, fully one-seventh of the nearly $4.2 trillion in global ETF assets are in funds tracking the benchmark U.S. equity index. The result of that is that passive funds now own an average of 17% of each component of the S&P 500, per Goldman’s data (the range is as little as 10%, and as much as 35%), whereas passive ownership was “a rounding error” a decade ago. Vanguard alone has at least a 5% stake in 468 components of the S&P 500, according to a June report in The Wall Street Journal, up from just three components in 2005. Read more: Investors flock to Vanguard funds, dump Goldman, Wells Fargo, and others Also: Vanguard calls for more diverse corporate boards, better climate-change disclosures As buying and selling index-funds essentially means buying and selling every component of the underlying index, “less trading is stemming from views on company fundamentals,” Goldman wrote. “Passive holders trade stock for different reasons than active managers, and at different frequencies. Passive’s decision to buy or sell stocks is often directed by broader fund flows and larger rebalances and not typically company specific fundamentals.” The investment bank calculated that for the average S&P 500 company, the share of its stock that might trade on fundamental views has dropped to 77% compared with 95% a decade ago. Those figures are based on a measure Goldman calls “passive-adjusted float,” or the number of shares outstanding minus both restricted holdings and passive holdings. “The impact on portfolio construction, alpha and trading are not fully appreciated by investors,” Fogertey wrote. Alpha refers to outperformance over a benchmark. Earlier this month, UBS analysts wrote that worries over the impact passive investing and ETFs would have on price discovery and liquidity were “misguided.” The firm noted that while passive funds comprise 46% of total ETF and mutual fund assets, they only accounted for 8% of the overall global equity market value. “If the investment landscape were limited to ETFs and mutual funds, it may warrant the current level of attention,” they wrote. “However, the investment landscape is far more expansive than just ETFs and mutual funds. There are hedge funds, separately managed accounts, and equities managed by other institutional investors and households that should factor into the analysis.” Read more: Relax, Wall Street: ETFs aren’t the root of all evil Related: Don’t blame ETFs or passive investors for high valuations Nonetheless, the impact of this factor depends on the specific security, as “passive ownership varies in both size and scope even within sectors.” Roughly 30% of the float of energy firm ONEOK

,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"The third-largest U.S. bank by assets said its third-quarter profit fell 19 percent, due mostly to a $1 billion mortgage litigation accrual. But management also revised its outlook on a key expense-related metric, saying the bank expects to spend 61 cents for every dollar of revenue it generates this year, up from a range of 60 to 61 cents. Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry suggested Wells Fargo may also face issues hitting next year’s cost-efficiency target. Management now hopes to spend 59 cents for every dollar of revenue next year, the high end of a target range of 55 to 59 cents, he said. But much depends on loan growth and interest rates, as well as elevated costs from regulations, technology and “lingering sales practice issues,” Shrewsberry cautioned. Wells Fargo’s loan balances at the end of the third quarter were $951.9 billion, down $5.6 billion from the second quarter and down $9.4 billion from a year earlier “We are waiting for the quarter that Wells shows stronger momentum across the business and this was not the quarter,” analysts from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a client note. The mortgage litigation accrual is for a still-pending lawsuit brought by a U.S. Justice Department-led task force, Shrewsberry told Reuters. “They’re working down toward the end of that list and now we’re sort of in discussions with them,” Shrewsberry said in an interview. “The billion dollars is in connection with that activity.” The bank’s shares were last down 3.3 percent to $53.40. Wells Fargo has been embroiled in a sales practices scandal for more than a year. It has acknowledged opening perhaps 3.5 million accounts in customers’ names without their permission, signing others up for unwanted auto insurance, charging some for a mortgage rate-lock feature they did not request and tacking other costly add-ons to accounts. The bank also has the same underlying challenges as rivals, including a drop in mortgage refinancing, interest income rising slowly after a prolonged period of rock-bottom rates, expensive technology investments and new regulations. That has made it hard for outsiders to quantify how Wells Fargo’s scandal has influenced results. On a conference call, analysts asked management whether weak loan growth was attributable to consumers backing away from the bank due to the scandal, or to the bank’s caution about credit risk. The bank missed consensus revenue expectations for the fourth straight quarter due to the weak loan growth, and its lending profit fell. Overall earnings fell to $4.6 billion. On an adjusted basis, profit was $1.04 per share, scraping past estimates of $1.03, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 2 percent to $21.9 billion, hit by a 37 percent slump in mortgage banking and auto lending. Analysts had forecast revenue of $22.4 billion. Wells Fargo’s net interest margin, which measures the difference between what banks spend on funds and what they generate from lending those funds, was 2.87 percent, down from 2.9 percent the prior quarter and below some analyst expectations. The bank spent 65.5 cents per dollar of revenue during the quarter and 63.1 cents per dollar year-to-date. Shrewsberry said the bank is committed to a previously stated plan to cut costs by $4 billion by the end of 2019, half of which will be reinvested into businesses. Net income in Wells Fargo’s community banking segment, the largest of its three major businesses and the one most directly impacted by the sales scandal, was $2.2 billion, down 31 percent due to the legal charge.

,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"Roemer will leave Barclays at the end of this month, the British bank said in a statement, while Wells Fargo said in a separate statement he would join the U.S. firm in January 2018. “Hiring a leader with Mike’s credentials is an important step in our commitment to building a stronger compliance function and a better Wells Fargo,” Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said. The San Francisco-based bank is the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. U.S. senators last week slammed Sloan for his handling of a massive sales practices scandal, in which Wells Fargo employees potentially created as many as 3.5 million accounts without authorisation. Roemer, who joined Barclays in 2012, has dealt with a string of regulatory issues during his tenure. These included reforming practices in the bank’s markets division following its involvement in the Libor rate-rigging scandal and an ongoing investigation into the lender’s chief executive Jes Staley over attempts to unmask a whistleblower. Laura Padovani, currently Barclays’ head of global compliance services, will act as interim group chief compliance officer following Roemer’s departure, Barclays said, adding it plans an internal and external search for his successor. Wells Fargo is due to report third-quarter results on Friday. ","

,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"Chiang cited progress by the bank in certain areas, but expressed concern over an “alarming drumbeat of news reports of egregious or illegal actions over the past year” in extending the sanctions, which apply only to business his office oversees. In a statement, Wells Fargo spokesman Gabe Boehmer said the bank “is in the business of banking, not politics,” and had “met and exceeded all of Treasurer Chiang’s expectations.” The sanctions, announced in September 2016, include suspending Wells Fargo as a managing underwriter on state negotiated bond sales. California manages a $75 billion investment portfolio and is the nation’s largest issuer of municipal debt. The sanctions also suspend state investments in all Wells Fargo securities and halt the use of Wells Fargo as a broker-dealer for investment purchasing. Boehmer said on Monday Wells Fargo loaned $500 million this year to California’s Department of Water Resources and had underwritten $800 million in bond issuance for the state this year. He declined to disclose how much business Wells Fargo did with California before the ban was enacted. Wells Fargo has acknowledged opening perhaps 3.5 million accounts in customers’ names without their permission, signing others up for unwanted auto insurance, charging some for a mortgage rate-lock feature they did not request and tacking other costly add-ons to accounts. California’s decision comes less than a week after Ohio Governor John Kasich extended the state’s ban on Wells Fargo, saying the bank had not done enough to turn around its culture. New York City, Chicago, Massachusetts, and Illinois have all enacted similar bans, though Boehmer said Chicago recently lifted its ban. ","

,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A brokerage industry regulator on Monday ordered Wells Fargo & Co to return $3.4 million to customers after selling them inappropriate investment products, the latest sign that a culture of problematic sales practices has bled into areas outside its consumer bank. From July 2010 to May 2012, Wells Fargo brokers sold risky exchange-traded products (ETPs) to at least 1,300 affected accounts with moderate and conservative risk profiles. The bank also failed to make sure brokers unloaded the products from customer accounts within 30 days, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The products’ value shifted based on market volatility over short durations, but some Wells brokers mistakenly believed they could be used as long-term hedges against a market downturn, FINRA said. Although Wells, the third-largest U.S. lender, had procedures in place to ensure the products were sold only under certain circumstances, the bank failed to implement them correctly, FINRA said. In doing so, the bank violated two securities rules. Wells identified the problem and began remediation efforts in May 2012, around the time it faced a separate penalty from FINRA for similar violations related to other types of ETPs. “In cooperating fully with FINRA, we have made significant policy and supervision changes, including the discontinuation of the ETPs in focus,” Wells Fargo spokeswoman Shea Leordeanu said on Monday. Wells did not admit or deny wrongdoing in reaching the settlement. Wells Fargo has been embroiled in a wider sales practices scandal that was touched off more than a year ago. It reached a $190 million settlement with bank regulators and a Los Angeles prosecutor after its employees opened bank accounts in customers’ names without their permission. Since then, Wells has acknowledged that thousands of employees opened perhaps 3.5 million phony accounts to hit sales targets over a period of several years. The bank also said its employees had sold unwanted auto insurance, a mortgage rate-lock feature and other “add-on” products that customers did not request. However, the questionable sales practices appeared to have had limited impact so far on its wealth management business, called Wells Fargo Advisors. Last November, Wells’ management told lawmakers the bank had fired hundreds of employees with brokerage licenses for improper sales practices, but the workers technically were employed by the retail bank. On a conference call with analysts on Friday to discuss third-quarter results, Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said its internal reviews have found the sales scandal did not affect Wells’ wealth or investment management businesses. Last year, FINRA launched a review of cross-selling programs in which brokerages also try to sell clients products from other parts of the bank, like mortgages. The regulator said this order was unrelated to that review. Brokerages frequently reach settlements with FINRA over violations that result in refunds to clients. (FINRA corrects paragraph 2 to reflect that at least 1,300 accounts were affected, instead of at least 1,300 customers) ","

,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ohio will extend its ban on doing business with Wells Fargo & Co because the bank has not done enough to help consumers or clean up its culture, the state’s governor said on Thursday. “This bank has not yet regained the public’s confidence,” Governor John Kasich said in a statement. “Wells Fargo still has work to do.” Ohio cut ties with Wells Fargo last October after the bank reported that millions of phony accounts may have been created without customer approval. At the time, Kasich said Ohio would avoid working with the bank on debt offerings or financial services for one year. In recent months, Wells Fargo has said it found other customer abuses with mortgage auto insurance products. On Thursday, Kasich extended his ban through April. “I’m willing to revisit this situation in six months,” Kasich said in a statement. A Wells Fargo official said on Thursday that the bank is committed to repairing its image with the public. “We will continue in our efforts to rebuild trust with our customers in Ohio and nationwide,” said the spokesman. “We are disappointed in the governor’s decision.” Other cities and states have enacted similar bans, including New York City, Chicago, Massachusetts, Illinois and California. It could not immediately be determined if all of those bans are still in place. ","

,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"Chief Executive Brian Moynihan’s years-long effort to streamline the bank’s sprawling operations and keep its costs in check are finally bearing fruit as the Federal Reserve raises borrowing costs. “On balance, Bank of America’s results stack up better than those of peers,” Instinet analyst Steven Chubak said. The Federal Reserve’s three rate increases since December boosted Bank of America’s net interest income 9.4 percent to $11.16 billion and the central bank is widely expected to raise rates again in December. Bank of America’s shares, which had risen nearly 16 percent year to date, were up almost 1 percent in morning trade while Wells Fargo was down more than 3 percent. Provisions for credit losses rose 15 percent from the second quarter, driven by credit cards and loan growth and analysts pressed the bank’s executives about possible signs of problems with consumer credit. Citigroup and JPMorgan said they expect to charge-off more for bad card loans in the future. “We’re just not seeing it yet in our net charge-offs,” Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio told the analysts. He said that was true for auto loans, as well as card loans, and could be due to the bank’s shift after the financial crisis to focus on lending to customers with prime and superprime credit scores. Similar to rivals, trading revenue at the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender fell 15 percent, with revenue from fixed income trading down 22 percent. For most of the past seven years, Wall Street banks have been grappling with low bond market volatility and new regulations that have restricted certain activities and made trading more expensive. Hopes that President Donald Trump will be able to stimulate bond trading activity and boost demand for loans have yet to be fulfilled as his tax overhaul and plans to loosen financial regulations have not yet been realized. “Tax reform is going to be great for the economy ... but I don’t think people are waiting around,” Donofrio said. In the meantime, banks are sticking to their cost-cutting playbook. Bank of America’s efficiency ratio, which measures expenses as a percentage of revenues, hit 60, the management’s long-term target, for the second quarter in a row. Moynihan said expenses fell to their lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2008, the last quarter before they took over investment bank Merrill Lynch during the financial crisis. The bank inched closer to some of its performance goals but its return on equity at 8.1 percent, up from the previous quarter, is still below its 10 percent theoretical cost of capital. Overall, the bank's net income attributable to common shareholders rose to $5.12 billion for the quarter from $4.45 billion in the year-ago period. Earnings per share rose to 48 cents from 41 cents. (bit.ly/2hDYUZK) Analysts on average had expected earnings of 45 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ","

,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"Wall Street has ramped up credit card lending amid a slump in bond trading, once a growth engine for many banks, but the higher provisions for bad debts fueled worries about the future profitability of an already costly business and sent shares in both banks lower. Provisions for credit losses across JPMorgan rose 14 percent, with the bank attributing much of that to its credit card business, and 15 percent at Citi in the quarter compared to a year ago. Both banks said that the increases were a normal part of the credit cycle and did not point to evidence of consumers under stress, but that explanation did not reassure analysts. “Investors are taking exception to both companies adding to their credit card loan reserves,” said Jason Goldberg, analyst at Barclays. Citi shares were down 3 percent and JPMorgan was off 0.8 percent in afternoon trade. U.S. banks have spent hundreds of millions of dollars attracting consumers to their credit cards with offers of cash-back on spending, plane tickets and free borrowing on balances transferred from other cards. Analysts on Citi’s earnings call questioned when the incentives would end and investors would start to see a return. “In general, the promotional balances, while a range of offers vary, they do go up to 21 months ... Don’t freak out. It doesn’t mean it’s going to be 21 months before we see growth in anything,” Chief Financial Officer John Gersprach told analysts. At Citi, cost-cutting, a unit sale and a gain in investment banking fees helped the fourth-biggest U.S. bank beat Wall Street expectations for both profit and revenue. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, also topped expectations as loan growth and higher interest rates more than offset a 27 percent slide in bond trading. For most of the past seven years, Wall Street banks have been grappling with low bond market volatility and new regulations that have restricted certain activities and made trading more expensive. Banks are looking to growth in loans to help offset the trading slump. Hopes are fading that U.S. President Donald Trump will be able to stimulate bond trading activity and boost demand for loans through a yet-to-materialize tax overhaul and loosening in financial regulations. “We all would anticipate greater loan growth if there was a bit more clarity as far as you know when or if tax reform was going to pass,” Gersprach said. JPMorgan fared worse last quarter than rival Citi, which reported a 16 percent decline in bond trading. JPMorgan’s markets revenue is likely to drop again in the fourth quarter because the year-ago period was strong, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on a conference call with analysts. Executives maintained earlier guidance for full-year net interest income, expenses, charge-offs and loan growth, indicating that they expect JPMorgan’s other businesses to continue to offset capital markets pain.

 ,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Owners of Wall Street banks are being taken for a Washington ride. The S&P 500 Bank Index has surged 12 percent since Sept. 8. That is not justified by the trajectory of earnings, as JPMorgan and Citigroup showed on Thursday with results that were no better than steady. Tax cuts would support higher stocks, but they’re at best some way off. In the meantime, banks have other concerns. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo each trade around 50 percent above their book value. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are neck-and-neck at some 1.3 times book, while laggards Bank of America and Citi trade at par. Using the rule of thumb that big banks need to deliver 10 percent returns for their shareholders, JPMorgan’s valuation means it ought soon to be cranking out a 15 percent return on book equity. Yet the bank run by Jamie Dimon will only hit an ROE of 13.6 percent by 2020, according to estimates collated by Thomson Reuters. Across the first three quarters of 2017, it managed only an annualized 11 percent. If President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress succeed in cutting corporate tax rates to, say, 25 percent from the current 35 percent headline rate that could, in theory, boost any tax-paying U.S. company’s net profit by 15 percent – turning JPMorgan’s sub-14 percent return into one above 15 percent. It’s a similar story at Citi. An ROE of just over 7 percent so far this year increasing to an estimated 8.7 percent in 2020 could get near 10 percent with lower taxes. The trouble is, that wouldn’t just require difficult tax legislation. It also needs banks to dodge problems elsewhere. Sluggish loan growth is one. That’s especially true for large banks, where lending has grown just 1 percent this year, compared with 6 percent at smaller banks, according to the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan managed a 3 percent increase in the year to September - though core loans grew faster. Citi’s loan book expanded by 2 percent. Loan defaults are rising, too. Citi has already warned of higher losses in its U.S. credit-card unit. Even share buybacks, which reduce book equity and share count thereby increasing ROE and earnings per share, offer less bang for the buck: bank stocks are over a third more expensive than on the eve of last November’s U.S. election. There may be no obvious calamity ahead. But there are enough obstacles to slow U.S. bank bulls down. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

As the big banks approach the third-quarter earnings season, Bove warns that their profits cannot possibly justify the 12% rise in their share prices during the past four weeks, as evidenced by gains in the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE). JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C) are scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday, while Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) are due to report on Friday. Per Thomson Reuters data reported by Yahoo Finance, consensus third-quarter EPS estimates for these banks are, with comparisons to the same quarter in 2016: JPMorgan Chase, $1.66, up 5.1%; Citigroup, $1.32, up 6.5%; Bank of America, $0.46, up 12.2%; and Wells Fargo, $1.03, unchanged. Bove warns that bank profits and stock prices will plunge if loan growth, margins and the economy do not improve sufficiently. Indeed, he says that nearly all the big banks are ""flat to lower in growth"" than they have been in the last few years, across almost all their products. This comes as other investors worry that the market is seeing a short-term ""melt-up"" before plunging, according to Barron's. In fact, Jeff deGraaf, chairman and head technical analyst at Renaissance Macro Research LLC, tells Barron's that market melt-ups tend to be the most frenzied as they reach a climax. Portfolio managers afraid of being left behind are chasing ever more overvalued stocks, he notes. (For more, see also: 5 Forces Fueling the Market's 'Risk Rally.') A worrisome indicator to deGraaf is the purchasing managers' index (PMI), which measures the health of the manufacturing sector. The value of 60 registered in September puts the PMI in a lofty range. It typically has signaled, during the last 50 years, an impending drop of about 4% in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) in the six months afterward, deGraaf tells Barron's. Meanwhile, the spread between the Fed Funds rate and the yield on the 2-year U.S. Treasury Note suggests to de Graaf that further rate hikes by the Fed will be upcoming. He says that the equilibrium level of the former normally equals the latter, but the respective rates right now are 1.125% (the midpoint of the Fed's target range of 1% to 1.25%) and 1.5%. In the later phases of an economic cycle, a shift to less-easy credit typically terminates the expansion, Barron's notes. Looming on the horizon is the Fed's pledge to begin shrinking its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, thereby withdrawing liquidity from the financial system. (For more, see also: Stocks Face ""Nasty Shock"" From Fed-Created Bubble.) Meanwhile, both Citigroup and Bank of America are still recovering from the 2008 crisis, the Wall Street Journal reports. Shares of these two banks are down, respectively, 86% and 51%, since early 2007, the result of massive share dilution, the Journal says. To pay back their respective $45 billion federal cash infusions from the TARP program, both banks aggressively issued new shares, with Bank of America doubling its shares outstanding from the end of 2007 to the end of 2010, while Citigroup increased its shares outstanding by about six times, the Journal indicates.

Evelyn Cheng,10192017,CNBC,10122017,"Wells Fargo reported third quarter revenue that missed expectations Friday, sending shares lower. The bank reported: Revenue fell 2 percent from the same quarter last year. Shares fell more than 3 percent in trading Friday. The adjusted earnings per share excludes 20 cents of charges related to litigation for a mortgage-related regulatory case from before the financial crisis, the bank said. The litigation cost of $1 billion contributed to an operating loss of $1.3 billion in the third quarter and increased the efficiency ratio to a worse-than-expected 65.5 percent. The bank said in a May presentation that it expected a ratio of 60 to 61 percent for 2017. ""I think the company is probably going to need a more robust expense savings program in order to get down to that target,"" said Kevin Barker, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. He added that rising interest rates should have helped Wells Fargo lower its efficiency ratio. A rising efficiency ratio indicates a bank's expenses are increasing or the company's revenues are declining. Overall noninterest expenses rose $14.4 billion, more than the $13.6 billion projected by FactSet. Net interest income, a key measure of profitability, rose nearly $500 million from a year earlier to $12.48 billion, but missed expectations of $13.14 billion projected by FactSet. ""Over the past year we have made fundamental changes to transform Wells Fargo as part of our effort to rebuild trust and build a better bank,"" CEO Tim Sloan said in a statement. ""We saw total average deposit growth; loan growth in our residential mortgage, credit card and subscription finance portfolios; as well as higher assets under management in Wealth and Investment Management."" Wells Fargo has struggled to recover from a massive consumer sales scandal last year that resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties and the resignation of then-CEO John Stumpf. Sloan has since grappled with revelations of more fraudulent consumer accounts and a shakeup of board members. Asked Friday during a conference call with analysts whether the bank had reached the end of a months'-long analysis of what went wrong and how it could fix things, Sloan said the review is going to last a long time. ""We've said look we want to be the best in the industry,"" he said, admitting Wells isn't quite there yet. ""It's a mistake to put a stake in the ground and say everything's got to be done by a certain date because then what happens is people might rush to get to the answer. I don't want them to rush the answer."" Wells Fargo shares are down 2.8 percent for the year. In contrast, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) has climbed 12 percent to highs not seen since 2007. Bank of America also reported earnings on Friday before the bell, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Bank earnings season began Thursday with JPMorgan Chase reporting earnings well above Wall Street estimates but a big drop in trading revenue. Citigroup reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that beat expectations. ","Wells Fargo shares fall 3% on disappointing revenue, higher legal costs"
Jeff Cox,10192017,CNBC,10122017,"Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan predicted Wednesday that the scandal-ridden bank will achieve the growth it had lost during its fake-accounts scandal. Sloan made the comments just days after Wells reported earnings Friday of $1.04 a share for the third quarter, slightly better than Wall Street estimates. However, revenue came up light and shares fell. ""We're turning over every rock in the company and we're making really good changes not only to fix anything that was broken but also in terms of investing and making a lot of changes in terms of new products and services,"" he told CNBC in a live interview. ""I'm very optimistic and confident that over time we'll achieve the growth that we've seen historically."" Sloan took over shortly after the bank paid a settlement with regulators over the bank's fake-account scandal. Employees enrolled customers into multiple programs without their knowledge in a practice that affected some 2.5 million accounts. During a congressional hearing earlier this month, Sloan pledged that Wells ""is a better bank"" now than it was before the bogus cross-selling practices became public. However, Sen. Elizabeth Warren demanded that Sloan be fired. Sloan said he was undeterred by the criticism. ""I've got a responsibility to 268,000 team members, over 72 million customers, that's who I focus on every day,"" he said. ""I think I'm the right person to be CEO because of my experience, because of my ability to make change ... and because of the optimism and resiliency that I have and because I have the support of our team."" Despite his assurances that the bank has changed its culture, Sloan and Wells continue to come under withering criticism for conduct leading up to and since the scandal broke. Shares also have underperformed, falling nearly 3 percent in 2017 as part of a weak year for bank stocks overall. Addressing one of the more specific complains about the bank's conduct, Sloan denied that the Wells hierarchy hid the cross-selling scandal from customers and regulators, despite memos indicating that officials were aware the Los Angeles Times had been talking to disgruntled customers. ""That wasn't elevated to senior leadership, including me, until late 2013,"" he said. ""We had an incentive plan in our retail bank that drove inappropriate behavior. Since I've become CEO we've dealt with that."" ",Wells CEO Sloan confident bank will get growth back that it lost in scandal 'over time'
Evelyn Cheng,10192017,CNBC,10122017,"Steve Eisman, a fund manager at Neuberger Berman, said Thursday at a conference he is betting Wells Fargo shares will go down, while Citigroup shares will rise. Wells Fargo shares have fallen far behind other financial stocks this year as the bank struggles to recover from a consumer sales scandal that broke last year. The stock has now fallen out of favor with a noted investor. ""The cultural issues I think at Wells Fargo went very, very deep,"" Eisman told CNBC in a phone interview. ""They have to unwind these cultural issues."" Eisman expects earnings will be ""flattish"" over the next few years, and pointed to negative signs such as the bank's decline in loans in the third quarter. He said he generally doesn't give price targets. Wells Fargo declined to comment to CNBC. On the other hand, ""Citi is the cheapest large bank,"" Eisman told CNBC. He said he expects plans to reduce regulation will improve Citi's return on equity to 14 or 15 percent from around 8 percent. Citi also declined to comment. Eisman famously bet against the housing market by shorting, or betting against, U.S. banks ahead of the financial crisis, which was depicted in the movie ""The Big Short."" In May, Eisman said on CNBC's ""Fast Money"" that he is now investing in ""a whole bunch of banks and investment banks"" and specifically mentioned Citigroup. Eisman gave his presentation on the bank stocks Thursday at Capitalize for Kids, an investment conference in Toronto, Canada, whose proceeds go towards helping to solve challenges in children's brain and mental health. Wells Fargo shares are down nearly 3 percent for the year, among the worst performers in the S&P 500's financials sector. The bank paid $185 million in penalties after it was discovered Wells Fargo employees had opened about 2 million consumer deposit and credit card accounts without customers' authorization since 2011. CEO Tim Sloan took over the company in October 2016 and the bank announced a board shakeup this past August. Last week, Wells Fargo reported a revenue miss in the third quarter. Shares rose 0.6 percent in midday Thursday trading. In contrast, Citi reported better-than-expected earnings last week and shares are up nearly 22 percent this year as one of the best performers in the S&P financial sector. Shares recovered some of their losses to trade about 0.7 percent lower Thursday afternoon, amid a broad market decline. Financial stocks overall are up more than 12 percent this year.

For much of the past decade, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) found itself in the shadows of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), which emerged from the financial crisis in a powerful competitive position after avoiding the worst excesses of the subprime mortgage bubble. But Wells Fargo's advantage is beginning to wane. Looking up at the Bank of America Plaza in Los Angeles, California. Image source: Getty Images. The clearest place you can see this is in a comparison of the two banks' efficiency ratios. As the name implies, this metric is designed to communicate how efficiently a bank generates revenue -- in other words, how much it costs the bank to do so. To calculate the efficiency ratio, you divide a bank's operating expenses by its net revenue. The quotient in Bank of America's case was 59.5% in the three months ended Sept. 30. This means that the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank spent 0.595 cents out of every dollar of revenue to operate in the third quarter. For years, Wells Fargo had one of the lowest efficiency ratios in the industry, especially among megabanks such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup. It routinely came in comfortably below 60%, which is a common industry benchmark that delineates between the best-run banks and the rest. Efficiency ratios: Bank Q3 2017 Q2 2017 Q1 2017 Q4 2016 Q3 2016 Q2 2016 Wells Fargo 65.5% 61.1% 62.7% 61.2% 59.4% 58.7% Bank of America 59.5% 59.5% 66.2% 65.1% 61.7% Data source: Wells Fargo, Bank of America. Bank of America has had the opposite problem over much of the past decade. Liability incurred in its credit card division and from its 2008 acquisition of Countrywide Financial, which played the leading role among now-defunct subprime mortgage originators in the housing bubble preceding the crisis, added up to somewhere around $200 billion. Only four banks even have that much shareholders' equity. The net result is that Bank of America spent the eight years after the financial crisis absorbing very elevated costs. Its efficiency ratio for years was above 70%. But the tides have turned. Over two consecutive quarters, Bank of America's efficiency ratio has been lower than Wells Fargo's. Had you told a bank analyst two years ago that this was going to happen, they would have thought you had gone clinically insane. But that in fact was the case again in the third quarter. As I already said, Bank of America's efficiency ratio was 59.5%. Wells Fargo's was 65.5%. The catalyst for the ascent in Wells Fargo's efficiency ratio is its fake-account scandal, which came to light in September 2016. It's led to higher expenses in the form of legal and other types of professional fees. It also seems to be weighing on the bank's revenue, which was the only one of the big four not to grow last quarter. In short, while it's obvious in hindsight why Bank of America's efficiency ratio has come in below Wells Fargo's for two consecutive quarters now, this would have been hard to imagine two years ago.

    Bank of America Was More Efficient Than Wells Fargo for a Second Consecutive Quarter -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,10192017,Fool,10122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) reported earnings on Friday, it served as a reminder of how deeply the bank's performance has been ravaged by last year's revelations that thousands of its employees spent years opening millions of accounts for customers without customers' approval to do so. You didn't even need to look past Wells Fargo's top line to see the impact. Revenue at the bank fell in the three months ended Sept. 30 by approximately $400 million compared with the year-ago period, coming in at $21.9 billion. The biggest decline was in Wells Fargo's biggest unit, its community banking segment. This is also the unit that was responsible for the sales scandal, as it contains the bank's branch operations. Revenue in the unit dropped by 2.6%, or $327 million. Business Segment Total Revenue, Q3 2017 Total Revenue, Q3 2016 Change Community Banking $12,060 $12,387 (2.6%) Wholesale Banking $7,085 $7,147 (0.87%) Wealth and Investment Management $4,246 $4,099 3.6% Data source: Wells Fargo. *Wells Fargo's non-operating unit ""Other"" reported negative revenue of $1.5 billion. Wells Fargo's wholesale banking segment also experienced a revenue decline, though of a smaller magnitude. It generated $7.1 billion in net revenue for the quarter, a 0.9% drop from the third quarter of last year. The only business unit at Wells Fargo that saw its top line increase was its wealth and investment management division, which also happens to be its smallest. It saw revenue increase by 3.6%, or $147 million, buoyed by higher net interest income, asset-based fees, and gains on deferred compensation plan investments. Given that Wells Fargo's community bank saw the biggest drop in revenue and was also the locus of its sales scandal, it's tempting to think that the two are related. And, in fact, I suspect they are. I say that because Wells Fargo has seen a sharp drop in new checking and credit card account openings in the wake of the scandal. At one point, the two figures were trending lower on an annual basis by more than 40%. The Wells Fargo building towers over downtown Denver, Colorado. Image source: Getty Images. The impetus for the decline in new account openings was Wells Fargo's essentially involuntary decision to eliminate sales quotas and change the incentive compensation structure for branch-based employees. The move will help the San Francisco-based bank avoid similar incidents in the future, but it also cuts to the heart of the bank's once-revered secret sauce -- a high cross-sale ratio. Nevertheless, in Wells Fargo's earnings release, the bank attributes the drop in revenue in its community bank to other forces: A gain on the sale of a loan portfolio in the prior quarter as well as lower mortgage banking revenue. If you read closely, however, the comparison that Wells Fargo makes is to the second quarter of this year, as opposed to the third quarter of last year. This minimizes the top-line decline because both quarters were weighed down by the scandal, whereas the year-ago quarter largely wasn't. In sum, while it tends to take a year to 18 months for a scandal like this to wash over, the continued drag on Wells Fargo's performance suggests that a dark cloud continues to loom over the bank.

A full transcript follows the video. Chris Hill: We begin with a tale of two banks. Wells Fargo's third-quarter profits fell 18% while Bank of America's third-quarter profits rose 13%. Not surprisingly, B of A shares doing a little better on Friday, Jason. Wells Fargo, racking up some legal fees there. Jason Moser: Discrete fees. We'll talk about that. It's been a little bit more than a year since the news broke of the fraudulent accounts. We talked about it a lot when it happened. I think I basically came to the conclusion that we were going to make a lot of noise about it, disapprove of it, and then everybody was going to go about their business and the stock was going to be just fine. And I think that's because, generally speaking, people are lazy in relation to how sticky these bank accounts are. And fast-forward to today, the stock is up 20% since this news broke. So, it seems like everything is going to be OK in regard to that. The metric we were looking at a year ago when this happened, started following total average deposits, because I think that would be a good indicator as to whether people were really serious about closing their accounts and putting their money elsewhere. Total average deposits were up 4% from the year ago. A bit more modest on a sequential basis, but the bottom line is, people are not, in fact, closing their accounts. It figures that they're doing a good job of at least keeping people in there and apologizing, and I guess they're being taken somewhat seriously. I don't think replacing Stumpf with Sloan was the right move, honestly, because Sloan has been there since '87, so he was part of all this mess to begin with. But, obviously, they are recovering. Hill: Obviously, it doesn't matter. [laughs] Moser: It apparently doesn't matter. Wall Street is going to give them a pass eventually. It's a stock that has done very well, still, over the last five years, although if you compare it to something like Bank of America, Bank of America has outperformed it handily. That has come, not surprisingly, over the past year. ","
      
    Wells Fargo Profits Down in Wake of Account Fraud Scandal -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,10192017,Fool,10122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Managing other people's money is what banks do, but this task extends beyond just overseeing deposits and making loans. Another major source of revenue that universal banks look to comes from wealth management -- i.e., helping people oversee their investments. This is big business for banks, as you can see by looking at the assets under management held by the nation's four biggest banks at the end of the third quarter: Bank Assets Under Management ($Billions) JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) $1,945 Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) $1,036 Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $496 Citigroup (NYSE:C) $158 Source: Third-quarter earnings releases from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup. Assets under management may not be a term that the average investor is familiar with. It refers to assets that a bank, or other type of financial-services company, oversees for clients, as opposed to itself. The clients own the assets, in other words, but the company administers them on their clients' behalf. Take JPMorgan Chase, as an example. It currently has $2.6 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet. The largest share of these are loans, which account for about $900 billion. Cash equivalents -- including deposits at other banks -- come next, followed by fixed-income securities held by JPMorgan Chase. These figures alone make JPMorgan Chase seem large, but you don't get a true sense for the bank's might until you also consider that it also oversees $2 trillion worth of assets under management, as well as $23 trillion in assets under custody. The Chase Tower in Phoenix, Arizona. Image source: Getty Images. The same is true for other banks, though to a less significant degree. Data source: Bank of America. Chart by author. These so-called off-balance-sheet assets are particularly attractive to banks, as the revenue and income from them tends to be stable. This contrasts with trading revenues, which can fluctuate widely, as was the case in the latest quarter. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, saw its fixed-income trading revenues fall 27%, while Citigroup's and Bank of America's were off 16% and 15%, respectively. Additionally, unlike the loans that banks hold on their balance sheets, assets under management don't expose a bank to credit risk -- that is, the risk that a borrower will default. This is a major risk that can cost a bank like Bank of America or Wells Fargo billions of dollars in loan losses if proper risk management processes aren't in place. With all of this in mind, it accordingly makes sense that banks are focused on growing their assets under management. ","

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a Question and Answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time simply press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question press the pound key. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. Thank you, Regina. Good morning, thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today, containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings in the earnings release and quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn the call over to our CEO and president Tim Sloan. Thank you, John. Good morning, and I want to thank you all for joining us today. Over the past year, we've made fundamental changes at Wells Fargo in order to build a better and stronger bank, and John and I will be highlighting our progress throughout the call. But first I want to discuss our financial performance. In the third quarter, we earned $0.84 a share, including the impact of a $1 billion discrete litigation accruals were previously disclosed mortgage-related regulatory investigations. This is not tax deductible and reduced our EPS by $0.20. This accrual was for a pre-financial crisis mortgage-related regulatory matter. While this is accrual impacted our financial performance in the quarter, the commitment of our team members to put our customers first and helping them to succeed financially remains strong and was demonstrated by average deposits growing 4% from a year ago, client assets reaching record levels in wealth and investment management, debit card purchase volume increasing $5 from a year ago, balances in our consumer general purpose credit card portfolio also growing 5%, and illustrating the benefit of the GE capital acquisition and strong collaboration across our wholesale businesses, we lead more syndicated asset-based loans in any other firm in the third quarter. As part of our priority of rebuilding trust, we provided expanded disclosure in our second quarter 10-Q filing, detailing our efforts to identifying and addressing other areas in instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. Let me update you on a few recent actions and milestones. At the end of August, we announced the completion of an expanded third-party review of retail banking accounts covering $165 million accounts over a nearly eight-year period. As we committed to a year ago we reviewed more accounts over a longer period of time identified additional customers who may have been impacted. All customers identified as having potentially unauthorized accounts are being notified directly as to how they can produce participate in $142 million class action settlement and we are refunding customers for any of these accounts that experience fees and charges. Last week we completed another round of broad customer outreach via email and $43 million statement notifications to encourage anyone with questions about their accounts, regardless of when they were open, to let us know so we could address their questions. We also announced in August to plan to remediate auto loan customers who may have been financially harmed due to issues related to collateral protection insurance policies which we purchased on their behalf when customers insurance policies lapsed. We discontinued our CPI program last year and we began issuing checks to affected auto loan customers this month. Last week we announced plans to reach out to all home wondering customers who paid fees for mortgage rate lock extension requested from September 16, 2013, through February 28, 2017, and to refund customers who believe they should never pay those fees. In March of this year, we changed how we manage the mortgage rate lock extension process by establishing a centralized review team that reviews all rate locks extension request for a consistent application of our policies. We are working diligently to make things right for our customers. We will continue to be transparent and we will be reporting more progress in the months ahead. We are working hard to transform Wells Fargo into a better bank for our customers, our team members, shareholders and our communities. I'm proud of the progress our team members have made to strengthen our culture, improve our business practices and risk management. We've made fundamental changes to our business model, organizational structure and compensation and performance management programs. One reason I'm confident that we're on the right path is it in the third quarter total team member attrition at Wells Fargo reached its lowest level in over six years. Within Community Banking, attrition is also at its lowest level in over six years and it is improved every quarter over the past years. Our customers are also responding positively to the changes we've made. While branch customer loyalty and satisfaction with most recent visit scores declined slightly in September, after our announcement of the completion of the expanded third-party account review, both metrics had reached individual post-sales practices settlements high earlier in the quarter and we saw improvement in scores near the end of September. We also continue to invest in innovation to better serve our customers. Let me highlight a few examples. Since launching the Zelle person-to-person experience in June, we've seen significant growth in both the number of transactions in the dollar cent. In the third quarter, P2P payments that sent by our customers increased 46% from a year ago. We recently launched a pilot of our online mortgage application, it combines the power of Wells Fargo data with the digital interface to create a know-me customer experience. We expect a complete roll out in the first quarter of next year. Later this month we will roll out into it investor and new digital advisory offering providing low-cost allocation, portfolio selection, and rebalancing. We launched CEO mobile token, which allows our treasury management customers a secure, convenient way to provide secondary authentication anytime they need to complete a transaction. Since the first quarter, when we became the first large bank in the U.S. to offer card free access to all of our ATMs, through a one time access, code, our customers have used card free ATM access codes three million times. And just this last week, we announced that more than forty percent of our ATMs are now NFC enabled, which allows our debit card customers to use their mobile wallet at the ATM, providing another option for card free access. Citing our card-free ATMs, along with a number of new capabilities, Wells Fargo was also recognized IT is the industry leader in business insider's mobile banking study that was released this week. Before turning the call over to John and one with knowledge the devastation many of our communities have faced from the recent hurricanes. To help our impacted customers in those areas we cover we're providing payment relief and proactively waving fees. Our mobile response unit was deployed to impacted areas in Texas a month ago, and we were deploying three additional units to Florida so customers can receive in-person assistance from Wells Fargo disaster recovery specialist. The Wells Fargo Foundation donated $2.6 million for hurricane relief efforts in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, and our customers have generously donated over $2.6 million to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund through our ATMs nationwide. We're also working with our customers impacted by the wildfires in California and the Wells Fargo Foundation made a donation to help these communities this week. John Shrewsberry will now discuss our financial results in more detail. Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We earned $4.6 billion in the third quarter, down $1.2 billion from the second quarter. This decline was driven by higher operating losses from the $1 billion discrete litigation accrual that Tim described. Linked quarter trends were also impacted by the $100 million reserve release we had in the second quarter. This quarter we did not have a release as improvements in credit performance in certain portfolios were offset by $450 million -- by $450 million reserve coverage for potential hurricane-related losses based on initial review of our portfolio. As a reminder, our results in the second quarter also reflected $390 million gain on the sale of Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolio. On Page three, we highlight our results compared with the year ago. While net interest income increased $524 million, revenue declined $402 million, reflecting lower non-interest income, driven by lower mortgage results. Average loans declined 1% from a year ago, as growth in our commercial loans was more than offset by lower consumer loans well average deposits increased 4% from a year ago, and we've maintained exceptionally strong capital levels even as we've returned more capital to shareholders including in $96 million reductions in common shares outstanding through net share repurchases. Turning to Page four, I'll be highlighting trends in loans deposits and credit later article, so let me just call it a few items on this slide. Cash and short-term investments increased $7.4 billion reflecting lower loan balances and growth in deposits. With our strong liquidity levels, we could deploy 10s of billions of dollars and remain LCR-compliant. Investment securities increased $5 billion in the quarter. We had approximately $31.2 billion of gross investment purchases in the quarter, primarily agency MBS in the available for sale portfolio, which was largely offset by runoff in sales. Turning to the income statement overview on Page five, I'll describe revenue and expense trends later on the call so let me just highlight our that our effective income tax rate in the third quarter was 32.4%. This included net discrete tax expense of $186 million primarily resulting from the non-deductible treatment of the $1 billion discrimination accrual, partially offset by discrete tax benefits arising from favorable resolutions of prior period matters with certain state tax authorities. As shown on Page six, the benefit from higher rates increased average loan yields 5 basis points in the quarter the seventh consecutive quarter of increasing loan yields average loan yields were down $5.2 billion from a year ago with growth in commercial loans offset by declines in consumer loans, and down $4.6 billion from the second quarter, with declines in both commercial and consumer loans. H.8 data continue to indicate that there was softness across the industry particularly in certain categories like C&I but there also specific actions that we've taken, primarily driven by our own risk discipline which has impacted our growth. Let me explain the primary factors in more detail. Starting with commercial loans on page seven, line utilization rates remain stable at approximately 40% in the third quarter, and balances increased $3.7 billion from a year ago, but declined $5.7 billion from the second quarter. We've previously highlighted expected run-off within our consumer portfolios but we've also had expected run-off in certain portfolios of commercial loans. We provided $6.5 billion of financing related to our government guaranteed student loan sale in the fourth quarter of 2014, which has been securitized and several chances over the past couple of years with $1.3 billion remaining at the end of the third quarter, down to approximately $800 million from the second quarter. We fully anticipated the rundown of a couple of the loan portfolios we acquired from GE capital imperative totaled $7.9 billion over the past 18 months including $1.7 billion in the third quarter, with approximately half of the reduction in the quarter in C& I and half in Commercial Real Estate. On this slide, we provide details on the individual loan portfolios to grow commercial loan trends this quarter. We summarized our consumer loan portfolios on Page eight, this portfolio declined $13.1 billion from a year ago, primarily due to $7.4 billion of lower auto loans and $7 billion of lower junior lien mortgage loans. However, consumer loans increased $200 million from the second quarter with growth in first mortgage loans and credit card. Our first mortgage loans increased $3.6 billion from the second quarter, reflecting $7.5 billion of growth in nonconforming mortgage loans, partially offset by the continued run-off of higher yielding legacy portfolios. Our junior lien mortgage loan portfolio continued to decline as expected as loans more than offset new originations. In terms of our credit card portfolio, over the past three years our annual growth rate was the largest among the large banks. Clearly, the sales practice in those met last year had an impact, but we started to regain a bit of momentum. Our credit card portfolio increased $944 million linked quarter, driven by higher spend per active account. We've invested in our rewards program and it continued our migration to additional acquisition while staying within our risk appetite. In fact, 42% of card openings in the third quarter were three digital channels up from 17% in the full year of 2016. Our auto portfolio continued to decline as expected, and was down $2.5 billion from the second quarter as a result of tightening underwriting standards. We expect auto loans to continue to decline. Other revolving credit and installment loans declined to $252 million from the second quarter, driven by declines in personal loans and lines, which we expect to continue to decline to a lower branch referrals over the past year. As highlighted on Page nine, average deposits were $1.3 trillion up $44.9 billion or 4% from a year ago, and up $5.2 billion from the second quarter. Based on the latest F D I C data, we retained our number one ranking in retail deposits. Our average deposit cost was 26 basis points in the third quarter up, 5 basis points from the second quarter, and up 15 basis points from a year ago. We've not made material changes in rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits with our retail bank with the majority of our peers also holding these rates steady. We have implemented some incremental deposit repricing for commercial and wealth and investment management customers as market rates have increased. Net interest income increased $524 million or 4% from a year ago, primarily driven by growth in earning assets and higher interest rates. However, net interest income declined $7 million from the second quarter as the impacts of lower investment portfolio yields, driven by accelerated prepayments and lower average loan balances were largely offset by the impact of one additional day in the quarter and a modest benefit from all other growth and repricing. And that interest margin declines 3 basis points to 2.8% of the impacts of lower investment portfolio yields, driven by accelerated prepayments, lower average loan balances, growth in average deposits and growth in trading assets and related funding were partially offset by lower average long-term debt and a modest benefit from all other growth and repricing. For the first nine months of the year we've grown that interest income by 5%, which is consistent with our previously stated expectation of low to mid-single-digit growth for the full year 2017. Non-interest income declined $926 million from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage banking revenue was down $236 million from the second quarter. Let me highlight a few of the drivers of this decline. Card purchase volume increased card fees declined $19 million from the second quarter, due to higher rewards expense we offer competitive rewards in our and our expenses increased, due to higher purchase volume more spending on our highest reward card higher acquisition bonuses. Mortgage banking non-interest income declined $102 million from the second quarter. Servicing income declined $91 million from the second quarter, primarily due to higher unreimbursed direct servicing cost, driven by an increase in the estimated cost for H FHA foreclosures. While origination volume increased residential mortgage origination revenue declined, due to a lower repurchase reserve release residential mortgage origination volume was $59 billion in the third quarter up 5% from the second quarter on higher refinancing volume. The production margin on residential held for sale mortgage originations was 124 basis points in the third quarter consistent with the second quarter. Compared with the second quarter, it was a favorable impact of $72 million from net hedge ineffectiveness accounting. The FASB has issued new hedge accounting guidelines that we will adopt in the fourth quarter which will significantly reduce the interest rate related to foreign currency, related ineffectiveness associated with our long-term debt hedges, due to the way we structure our hedging instruments, we may continue to experience some ineffectiveness volatility, primarily related to require differences in the discount rates for a foreign currency denominated long-term debt associated cross-currency interest rate swaps. On Page twelve, we provide details on trading-related revenue and the impact to net interest income and non-interest income. Despite declines in customer trading activity revenue, driven by lower volatility and seasonally lower trading volumes, trading-related revenue increased $52 million from the second quarter. Trading-related revenue was down #29 million from a year ago reflecting lower volatility lower transaction volume. As shown on Page thirteen, expenses increased $810 million from the second quarter driven by the billion-dollar litigation accrual. The discrete litigation accrual increased our efficiency ratio by 456 basis points in the third quarter. Last quarter we said that we expect our efficiency ratio to approve in the second half of the year and that our full year efficiency ratio was expected to be 60% to 61% percent in 2017, not including any potential non-recurring expenses, including not-yet-accrued litigation expense. We currently expect our full year 2017 efficiency ratio to be plus or minus 61% excluding the $1 billion discrete litigation accrual and any other non-recurring expenses, including not-yet-accrued litigation expense. The reason why our 2017 efficiency ratio is now expected to be higher than we anticipated last quarter, is due to lower than expected earning asset growth and higher than expected expenses, primarily for cyber regulatory initiatives in data modernization. These expenses are part of building a better bank however we're fully committed to improving our efficiency ratio in achieving our target of a total of $4 billion of expense reductions. As you can see on Page fourteen, we had linked quarter declines across many of our expense categories except for revenue-related expenses and running the business non-discretionary expenses which is a category impacted by the $1 billion litigation accrual. The increase in revenue related expenses was primarily due to higher commissions and other incentives compensation driven by wholesale banking and brokerage. The $24 million decline in compensation expense was driven by seasonally lower payroll tax expense. Third-party service expense declined $82 million from the second quarter, driven by lower project-related legal and outside data processing expense. Running the business discretionary expense was down $34 million from second quarter primarily from lower TNE and advertising expense. On Page sixteen, we show the drivers of the year-over-year increase in expenses compensation and benefits expenses increased $338, driven by higher salaries from annual salary increases and higher health benefits expenses. Also, these expenses the third quarter of '16 were reduced by the forfeiture of unvested equity awards revenue related expense declined $131 million from lower commissions and incentive compensation, driven by lower mortgage and wholesale banking activity. Third-party service expense increased $184 million, driven by higher project spending and legal expense approximately $80 million of this expense with sales practices related in the third quarter. The $665 million increase in running the business and non-discretionary expense was driven by higher operating losses reflecting the $1 billion litigation accruals. We've previously described the main drivers of the first $2 billion of target expense saves by the end of 2018 and we've now identified initiatives and programs for the total$4 billion expense target. On Page sixteen, we summarize these initiatives in the expense categories that will be impacted and were committed to achieving these reductions. These levers have evolved slightly from Investor Day, but are still focused on areas like centralization and optimization and evaluating capacity to achieve savings in areas such as corporate properties and workforce optimization. As you can see on this page, some of these initiatives will generate savings throughout the periods, while others are expected to be realized until later. We're making progress on the work that needs to be done on these initiatives, but many of the changes to drive savings are longer-term efforts and right there are in the earlier stages are being realized. For example, while we're seeing benefits from centralizing are functional areas, the savings for corporate properties include -- including savings from the 200 branches we plan to close in 2017. We're on track as we've closed 145 branches during the first nine months of this year. However, there are minimal immediate savings recognized from branch closures, due to initial closing costs. Therefore, most of the expense benefit from the branches we close this year will not be realized until next year. It's also important to note that these initiatives do not include the benefit of the expected run-off of core deposit intangibles like 2019, which resulted in $640 million of expenses in the first nine months of the year. And also, doesn't include the expected completion of the FDIC special assessment in 2018. Finally, it doesn't include expense savings due to the sale of businesses we've announced including commercial insurance and shareholder services businesses, which are expected to close in the fourth quarter and first quarter, respectively. On Slide 17, we provide details on the expected timing of our target expense reductions. We expect to achieve 21% of the $4 billion of the annual expense saves by the end of this year, and 50% by the end of next year. The rest of the expense saves are expected to be achieved by the end of 2019. As a reminder the first $2 billion of targeted expenses will support our investment in the business, and we expect additional $2 billion targets an annual expense reductions by the end of '19 to go to the bottom line to be fully recognized in 2020Turning to our business segment starting on Page eighteen, community banking earned $2.2 billion in the third quarter. The impact from the $41 billion litigation accrual, which is reported in this segment was the primary driver of the year-over-year and linked quarter decline. On Page 19, we highlight that customers continue to actively use their accounts, branch and ATM interactions declined 6% from a year ago, this decline was driven in part by customers migrating to our digital channels with digital secure sessions up 6% from a year ago. As teller interactions migrate to self-service options, teller FTEs have been reduced 4% from a year ago, while we continue to invest in more specialty bankers, which were up 5% as part of our goal of providing better customer service and advice. Primary consumer checking customers declined modestly from the second quarter, and year-ago Waller attrition rate to remain stable declined a new account opening has impacted primary consumer checking customers growth however as we highlighted at investor day our new customers continue to have higher balances and to use their debit cards more frequently. On Page 20, we highlight balance and activity growth average consumer and small business banking deposits grew by 2% from a year ago. Debit card purchase volume increased 5%, and consumer general purpose credit card purchase volume increased 4% from a year ago customer experience survey scores predictably declined after we announced the completion of the expanded third-party review of retail banking accounts at the end of August. However, as Tim mentioned earlier, we continue to improve the scores prior to this announcement. While this past year has been challenging the numbers we've made are creating more consistency at the changes we made our creating more consistency and simplicity for a branch team members, which will result in a better experience for our customers. We know that improving the experience for customers and team members is critical to growing our business, it's more than being nice, it's offering the right products and services to meet the financial needs of our customers, it's also about making changes with real customer impact, for example, empowering managers in the branches to immediately resolve some customer issues, such as fees and service request, rather than having to redirect customers to a call center. I'm confident that the changes we're implementing will prove customer service and also drive growth. Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the third quarter, stable from a year ago, and down 14% from the second quarter results in the second quarter included the tax benefit, resulting from our agreement to sell Wells Fargo Insurance Services, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, and result in a gain in fourth quarter. Wealth and investment management earned a record $710 million in the third quarter up 5% from a year ago, and up 4% from the second quarter. Revenue increased 4% from a year ago, driven 19% increase in net interest income. Wim total client assets were a record $1.9 trillion up 8% from a year ago driven by higher market valuations and continued positive net flows. Turning to credit quality on Page 23. The quarterly loss rate was 30 basis points, up 3 basis points from the second quarter but is still near historically low levels. Commercial losses increased 3 basis points with higher losses in C&I. Consumer losses increased 2 basis points as continued net recoveries in consumer real estate and lower credit card and other revolving credits were offset by higher auto losses. Nonperforming assets continued to decline, down $512 million from the second quarter, the sixth consecutive quarter of decreases, and NPAs are now less than 1% of total loans. We did not have a reserve build or a release this quarter as continued improvement in consumer real estate and commercial loan portfolios, including continued improvement in the oil and gas portfolio, was offset by a $400 million -- by $450 million of reserve coverage for potential hurricane-related losses based on an initial review of our portfolio. Our preliminary estimate includes coverage for potential losses in our Reliable auto business, which is based in Puerto Rico, which has been especially challenging to determine the full impact from Hurricane Maria. Turning to Page 24. Our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in increased to 11.8% in the third quarter, remaining well above our internal target level of 10%. The growth in our CET1 ratio reflected lower RWA, driven by lower loan balances and commitments as well as improved RWA efficiency. We remain focused on returning more capital to shareholders. Third quarter was the first quarter under our 2017 Capital Plan, and we increased our net share repurchases by 34% from the second quarter. We returned a total of $4 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases, which was up 16% from the second quarter. Before I conclude, I want to update you on our resolution planning efforts. We have made a decision to move from a multiple point-of-entry resolution strategies to a single point-of-entry preferred resolution strategy for our next resolution plan submission. We've concluded that developing an SPOE strategy will enhance the flexibility of strategic options available to resolve the firm. This decision is not related to any agency feedback we've received in our 2017 submission and is not expected to result in any additional TLAC issuance or liquidity requirements. In summary, while our financial results in the third quarter were impacted by the $1 billion discrete litigation accrual, our asset quality, liquidity, and capital levels all remain very strong. We highlighted throughout the call the transformational changes we're making, and I'm optimistic that these changes will help drive our long-term success. And I think we'll now take your questions. Operator At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. John -- hi, guys. John, I wanted to try again to ask about the idea of the timing differences between the initial $2 billion of expense saves to be realized by the end of next year and when the spending that is offsetting that is occurring, if you could kind of comment on that. And then if you have any initial thoughts on the type of efficiency ratio that you guys might strive for next year, I'm sure folks would love to hear any thoughts on that. Sure, sure. So we provided the slide in the deck this time that shows what portion of that first $2 billion is -- should be out of the run rate by the end of this year and what portion should be out of the run rate by the end of next year, which is incremental information. The part that's hard to convey is the -- is -- what is already being spent is reinvestment of that for a variety of programs. We've talked about a lot of this, but we've had and will continue to have elevated spending around various regulatory and technology-related activities. And I'll just take a few off for you, including resolution planning this year, which doesn't completely go away; this BSA and AML activity going on; a lot of cyber work going on. I mentioned data modernization earlier in the -- in our remarks, which is a big undertaking, this technology replatforming. And there's, of course, these sales practices issues that are lingering. So some of those are in the run rate today and many of those will continue to be in the run rate throughout 2018 and maybe some of it even into 2019. There are bits and pieces of getting more efficient on those programs that are part of that $2 billion save that we're working on. So it's not dollar-for-dollar as these things roll off and that first $2 billion gets realized, there's a benefit. But with respect to efficiency ratio, we think that we'll be sort of in the, as I mentioned, plus or minus 61% from the fourth quarter, and it is definitely our goal to be at 59% or below at some point next year. Now there's two parts to that. One is expenses, which we're talking about, but it's also what happens with revenue. So rate increases, if there are any, loan growth, which is very important, will contribute to that, too. So it's both the numerator and the denominator that we're working on. But I would say we're shooting for plus or minus 61% in the fourth quarter, and were -- we like to get to 59% or below at some point during 2018. Okay. And then separately, could you talk about some of the factors affecting a net interest income and net interest margin for next quarter? With the loan growth headwinds and not having a rate hike in September, is it possible to have net interest income growth going forward? Or what are your thoughts there? That's a good question. So it depends on a few things, including what you mentioned. It also depends on what happens to deposit pricing, and what market responses in retail deposits, in particular. I wouldn't anticipate a lot of incremental growth in interest income in the fourth quarter. I think we're 5% year-to-date on a year-over-year basis and we've been we've been mentioning in telegraphing low to mid-4% to 5% for the year as a whole. I think the fourth quarter will probably reflect that, especially as because, as you said, nothing's moved on the short end, the long end's moved up a little bit. But that really matters at the margin as we reinvest. Okay. And then one quick last one for me. The business sales that you mentioned in the fourth quarter and the first are helpful to the efficiency ratio. Are those relatively earnings neutral? Is there any loss of earnings as those businesses go away? They're relatively earnings -- the run rate, which is, I think, is what you're referring to is relatively earnings neutral, going forward. Okay. Meaning when you sell them, there's no net income that goes away, they're pretty P&L neutral? Yes. The only the complications of that is indirect expense, because we have work to do to take out the associated indirect expense. But in general, I would say that we will not be giving up a lot of net income. Okay. Meaning it will just take some time to get the expenses out? Yes. Okay, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my question. You're welcome. My first question is for you, Tim. I think that as I speak with your current and prospective shareholders, the biggest sort of question mark in terms of visibility into next year is not really on the expense management side but really on the revenue side. You started out this call with a list of the remedies that you've done on the Community Bank. I know -- or I guess, the question for me is in terms of the overall culture of the bank, how much is the wholesale bank being impacted by the issues and the scandal in the Community Bank? In other words, is it impacting risk appetite? Is it impacting growth initiatives? Is it impacting your ability to hire? The short answer, as it relates to Wholesale Banking, Erika, it's a great question, is no. I mean, at the margin and our government and institutional banking business, there's a little bit impact and some municipalities that have put us on probation or just said they're not going to use as much for a period of time, though we had some municipalities that have taken us off that, because we've executed everything we said we're going to execute over the last year. So it's not impacting our ability to hire people. And I mention attrition for the entire company, but the same would go for Wholesale Banking, in terms of lower intrusion, so we're not losing people. And it's not affecting our credit appetite at all. And again, I think Wholesale Banking's performance in the quarter was good. And I would say the same thing for Wealth and Investment Management. I mean, you saw real, good performance there. So there's no question that there's impact. We've talked about that. John provided a number of details in this presentation as relates to some of our consumer businesses, but for the rest of the company, we're continuing to move forward. Got it. And just thank you so much for providing the new slide, Slide 17, in terms of what we can expect to be achieved when. And and I'm wondering as we think about 4Q '19, John, is it as simple as saying, OK, let's assume a core run rate for Wells Fargo? Let's say it's the $13.3 billion this quarter, excluding the $1 billion in litigation, accrual, assuming growth rate off of that and then deduct $500 million. Is that what falls into the bottom line means by 4Q '19? That's elegant. But I guess, the way I think about it is you have to take a snapshot of a business mix that throws off its -- each component of which throws off its own efficiency ratio. And I expect us, frankly, to get more efficient in the businesses as we roll forward. But as you look forward a year, we should have taken out, call it, 40% of the first $2 billion and the rest of it to be coming out at the end of next year. So obviously, that will be phasing in through that period of time. You'll have the harder-to-gauge elevated program-related expenses for the types of items that I mentioned that are sort of happening over the top. They have been for a little while, and I anticipate the next 12 or 18 months will be -- there'll be a lot of it going on. So I don't know how much will be rolling off exactly at the end of next -- nobody knows exactly how much will be rolling off at the end of next year. But that's a big number. And then we begin to have these structural takeouts, like the amortization of deposit intangible, the extra FDIC premium and the cost of the exited business. All of those will be happening earlier in 2018. So those are the moving pieces as I see them. Now something new could occur, too, that changes the business, but those are the big items and the way that they're moving that as we forecast through '18 and into '19 are the drivers of where we're going to be. And with that, an expectation for revenue, that's what makes us think that we'll get down to 61% for 2017 in the fourth quarter and then hope to get to 59% in 2018. And just one last question, follow-up on the on the revenue side of the 2018 efficiency equation. Are there idiosyncratic catalyst for the margin decline that you'd like to point out that impacted the performance for this year? Or maybe a better way to ask if the Fed does raise rates in in December, could you walk us through what the impact would be for 1Q '18 that would be perhaps different from what we saw this quarter? Yes. So with respect to year-over-year margin and what's going on, it's what you imagine. We've got different categories of earning assets that the price differently: investment securities, loans, short-term investments, et cetera. We've got mixed and we have repricing and that sort of weighted averages that matrix is the benefit in a rising rate environment to them. We've got deposits, you've got long-term debt, other funding, liabilities, we've got mix, we've got repricing that's the negative in a rising rate environment. And that's what gave us -- I think an extra 5 basis points up year-over-year. But if there's a move in December- and we roll into the beginning of the year, the easy calculations actually are parallel move. So, I'll give you the number for parallel move. We think that's probable, all things being equal, that's probably worth $90 million a quarter, including in the first quarter. So now things don't happen in parallel, we don't know what's going to happen at the longer end. But the big question mark about that is, what is the deposit response in retail, that bigger banks are either costs or are impacted by on the next move? Because we model a reasonably meaningful response, and yet we haven't seen one yet. So it could be upside to that. Got it. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi, Ken. Hi, guys. How you doing? Good morning. Hey, can you talk a little bit about just loan growth expectations? I know, John in your prepared remarks, you talked through a couple of the buckets where you're continuing to let things roll off. But obviously, we're seeing the period ends come in lower than the average is in part because of that. Can you just talk about and demand and try to separate and demanding customer growth from perhaps any of lagging ramifications of retail sales in slower account growth, in terms of how you expect, loans to traject forward? Ken, it's Tim. You're talking about fourth quarter next year in from the time frame standpoint? Yes. Just your general outlook, for when do we see kind of a bottoming in loan growth and how much of that kind of let-go part is weighing on the overall amount of growth that you're seeing? So, let me start with the portfolios are likely to decline over that period, and then we'll get to the ones that are going to increase. So as we've highlighted for the last few quarters, I think, it's likely that the auto portfolio will continue to decline over the next few quarters, and our expectations are probably bottom out sometime second half of next year. I think the home equity portfolio will also continue to decline, though our expectation is that next year, all other things being equal, will originate more home equity loans and what we did this year. But again, recall there's still that legacy portion that portfolio that's burning off that we used to be very concerned about from a loss standpoint. It is now performing beyond all of our expectations. I expected credit card portfolio to continue to grow, we saw that this quarter, that was absolutely terrific, driven by some really good improvement in digital acquisition, and so all the investments that we're making in the credit card business, in our digital platform, are working. I expect that on-balance sheet mortgage portfolio to grow during that period, there will be some seasonality in the fourth and the first quarter as we've seen, but again, like we saw this quarter, we saw good growth in the in the first mortgage residential portfolio. And then on the on the wholesale side, in commercial side, we expect to see growth throughout that period. John highlighted some of the idiosyncratic reasons why we saw some decline this year, but are expected. The expectation is going to continue to grow. Having said all that, the reason we became the largest lender in this country is because we look at the market, we look at our customer demand and we want to make sure we're making good long-term credit decision. So sometimes, in a quarter, it means you grow, sometimes you shrink, but over the long-term, we are very confident we'll be able to continue to grow. Okay. And then, if I could just dig in on the commercial business specifically, the biggest of the loan buckets on the wholesale side, even maybe some granularity there and in terms of, I know that this specifics that John mentioned, but obviously C&I have slowed overall, and what do you just seeing in terms of customer demand and where that growth would come from inside that commercial business? I think -- again, we called out some specifics. For example, in this quarter we had a number of-of larger CRE construction loans that are paid off and that's that's again, that's going to be a little bit episodic. But our overall view is that we're going to see growth across the entire portfolio again, because we're in so many businesses, each business is going to have a little bit different complexion in the quarter. We highlighted the fact that because of the GE capital acquisition, we're now the number one asset-based lender, and we're pretty excited about that. That hasn't necessarily happened over the last few years, so there's, we think, there's good upside there. But really, across the board, we're optimistic about being able to grow. Okay, got it. And on the flip side, this -- if I can ask the question about credit, in general, you kind of got to this point where your charge-offs bounced up a little bit and you didn't really release for the first time in awhile, did a lot of moving parts, and you mentioned the hurricane impact. But just -- can you just talk about outlooks for any credit normalization going forward in terms of also the mix and just the amount of recoveries that you've still been continuing to to to see on the commercial side? Yes, Ken. It's a really good question. I think that everybody in the industry, and it's certainly been, for us too, we've seen such a benign credit environment, except for the energy business, which was all worked through, whether you're at 27 basis points, or 30, or 33. Whatever the number is over the last few quarters, it's still really low. If you overlay the current economic environment, we continue to believe that that loss will probably bounce around at lower levels, ex-things like the impact from the hurricanes. But overall, the portfolio is never been in any better shape in my 30 years at the company, so we can be -- we continue to be optimistic. Sorry, John? I think for us, auto will get, will look better because we've taken out the low end of credit quality... That's a good point. That has just arisen quarterly, vintages of origination. I think with card, we've been adding more new cards, we've -- our card portfolio is now probably 50% what you consider to be very season vintages. So we should probably see a tick up, because newer card vintages are going to experience front-end loaded losses, that's to be expected. But again, that's not necessarily because of any fundamental deterioration in the card portfolio. That's just the natural aging of new customers. Yes. Understood. Thanks, guys. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. I had a couple of quick questions. One was on the hedge accounting treatment that you said you were going to adopt next quarter. Could you give us a sense as to why you decided to adopt that? And could you also go through what you think the impact is on balance sheet? Are you gonna be realizing any gains as you move over securities, et cetera? Yes. So this is -- this really relates to our own liabilities, when we issue the long-term fix rate, either in dollars or in other currencies, we hedge -- we often hedge back to floating, we almost -- we generally hedge back to dollars, or at least, historically, we did. So it's that accounting noise that gets reduced as a result of the new accounting. So the only real impact that you're going to see is, there'll be some catchup adjustment, a year-to-date adjustment in Q4, which, I think might amount to, call it $100 million, $200 million kind of range, we haven't finished all the math on that yet, but we'll it figure out, and that will come through in Q4. And then going forward, what you'll see is a lot less volatility. And the reason, of course, we're adopting it is because we were creating this noise in noninterest income that was bouncing around to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter, that was just as a result of different valuation schemes for the liability lag and the hedge lag on things that were permanently hedged. So we're happy with this kind of change. Okay. And I thought, in that there was a one time opportunity to move some securities from, held for -- held to maturity to AFS, I'm just wondering if you're going to take advantage of that at all or not? Not going to. The impact for us is really on the liability side. Okay, got it. And then question on the living will, and living wills have been extended, right? The next one's not, for another, what is it, 18 months or so? Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that? Because I know the way the conversation before around how you're thinking about the size of the investment bank versus living will. And maybe give some updated thoughts on that? Sure. So the MPOE strategy that we have had in our recent filings, works great for us, and I point that out because it's more unique to us among the larger bank because we've got a smaller nonbank affiliate activity going on, and that's sort of the key driver of whether that works or it doesn't work. In order to create more flexibility going forward, including more either size or complexity of some of our nonbank affiliate activity, with nothing in particular or urgent in mind, but just in general, we get more flexibility with an SPOE strategy. We had to sort of to finish the process, first of satisfying the deficiencies that were called out a couple of years ago, and then of filing the most recent plan. And so seem to be stuck to our plan and deliver that, and the feedback, thus far, has been -- it's not complete, but it's been fine. So by doing this, we think we opened up more flexibility for Wells Fargo going forward. And as you recall -- as you mentioned, the industry got word that there'll be, instead of an annual cycle, at least at this time, an extra year, and so whether we, if we wait and file it at the end of that period, or we file it in the middle of that period, we haven't really figured out yet. But the intention is to move forward SPOE, and we thought that the investment community should know that. Okay. Just on auto, specifically, I know you mentioned, your actions even taking what a portfolio. What would drive you to get back into a growth mode there? I know, there's been some chatter around demand picking up and obviously, the hurricanes have had impact. Yes, just that. I think there's two things going on, Betsy. One, there's the execution of the other fundamental changes that we're making in the auto business to make it much more efficient and much more -- much less complex. And then it's just going to be our view of what's going on in the business and if we think that there's more opportunity from a risk-reward standpoint as it relates to credit, then we'll take advantage of that. I think that the decisions that we've made over last year have really worked because, when you look at average FICO scores of our customers, we did now increase and that's exactly what we wanted. So it's going to be a function of the changes that we're making in the business and then our view of what's going on in the industry. Even said all that, I think you should expect that portfolio, and I'm not being negative, I just want to make sure you get -- reinforce the common and maybe can, that you should expand the portfolio, even if we turn things up a notch to continue to decline through the fourth quarter this year, through most of next year and probably bottom out again sometime, hopefully, it'd be second half of next year. I mean we like that business, don't get us wrong. And our expectation is, over time, we will continue to gain share in that business, but right now, we're cautious, and we've got a lot of changes going on in the business, and we've got to execute those. And those changes, which we talked about, are taking 50 or 55, distributed origination underwriting and collecting centers, down to three bigger regional centers, and so, while that's happening, we rather have a higher credit profile, the average customer just so that we're dealing with fewer defaults, frankly, quality up what we make that change. And it will be in '18. Right. And so that, that you get down to the three by the end of '18? Or is that 2019? What's happening now, so. It's happening now, it should be by the end of '18, Betsy And then just lastly, on the reserve build for hurricanes $450 million, Is that right? Yes. And it's not in that build, it's a -- we would have had a release, but for the analysis, we've done so far on the hurricane impact areas. Right. And is that, it's a little bit bigger than we've seen in other folks, can you just give us a sense of exposures or what's included in that? Is that across all credit spectrum, consumer incorporated? Is there anything that's really driving the bus on the size? It is, Betsy, and we -- again, we're the largest lender in the country, and we've had a significant hurricanes affected two very fast growing states, Texas and Florida, in particular... And Puerto Rico. And Puerto Rico. And so, it's across all product types, but I would also put it in the category of, it's early in our assessment and I think we've been appropriately prudent in wanting to be conservative, we could end up being a little bit too conservative, maybe a little bit less, but right now, because there's so much going on in in all those markets, we just sort of was prudent not to have a release until we get to the bottom or whatever the exposure would be. Our folks aren't working very hard in terms of trying to get their arms around it, and every day's a little bit different. My guess is we'll have updates throughout the quarter. Yes. One of the first things we did in Texas and Florida was offering people a 90-day forbearance on their mortgage payments, and add them onto the back end of the loan with no negative repercussions that could just get their feet back on the ground. That's a great thing, although it does complicate figuring out who's going to make your payments or not. So we have to wait, as opposed to just seeing all the information in every first-of-the-month payment cycle. We also have more complications here with our borrower's insurance, whether it's auto insurance or homeowners insurance, how are they covered for flood? How are they covered for wind? Those types of things, which will, which increases the uncertainty or what the performance is going to be, so. We noticed also that it was the bigger number than what some other people talked about. Thank you. Thanks, Betsy. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could spend just a moment or two talking about the branch footprint overall? I mean, you guys definitely -- have definitely been more aggressive here recently then you had been over, say the last several years and sort of paring back where appropriate, but I guess increasingly I'm finding myself getting questions about why your branch footprint shouldn't be like 1,000-or-so branches, if you were just given how many more branches you have than the other biggest players in the country. So I'm just curious if you could maybe offer a little color on sort of how you're thinking about the appropriateness of the footprint as you look forward and what any additional opportunities might be? Sure. So, Scott, I think it's a great question. And -- but fundamentally, I think every institution's going to have a different footprint. We're really, really proud of this footprint that we've developed over decades and decades, which is one of the reasons why we have the largest market share from a deposit standpoint. That's incredibly valuable. And I'd also just caution that it's not just about the number of branches, it's the size of the branches, it's how they're organized, it's where they're located, which drive cost and so on. But I think as Mary Mac was very clear at our Investor Day, in giving a couple of years of guidance in terms of what our plans are, and we're in the midst of executing on those plans. So far, this year, as we've detailed, that we're on track in terms of the branches that we're closing. We haven't seen any significant revenue impact, which is part of the goal, too. Most of our team members that were in those branches have now, are at other branches, which is absolutely terrific, so we've got an experienced crew. My guess is that, over time, we will continue to respond to our customers, because they're going to ultimately tell us how many branches they want. We transact billions of dollars, billions of interactions each quarter, but over 50 million times a month, somebody still comes into our branches and they want to be able to use them. So I think it's likely, over time, the number of branches that you see will decline. If our customers tell us that they want fewer of them, then we will accelerate that. But candidly, if our customers tell us they want more, we're going to listen to them. But I think you're also seeing, Scott, the impact from the investment that we're making from a digital standpoint, and it's not just the investment in terms of opening new accounts, it's also how we're integrating that into the branch experience. So we'll -- it's a long-winded answer to your question, we're going to execute on what we said for 2018 and '19, we're going to have an Investor Day next May, we'll provide you with an update, or -- I'm sorry, 2017 and '18, we'll have an Investor Day next May, we'll provide you with some updates and we'll continue to move forward. The only thing I'd add is, that I think we're thinking very, very aggressively about what the right mix is. So we own half of our branches, we have short leases on most of the other half, we're in a position to be as flexible as we need to be, if we think the opportunity presents itself. Okay, that's perfect. I really appreciate the thought. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Good morning. Just wanted to -- sorry to everybody here, but I just want to kick the dead horse on loan growth one more time, and I'll be quick on this one. But the -- so the way we should think about it with loan growth, and the potential impact of the sales practice in car and auto insurance issues, that if those issues did not happen at all, if you never had the sales practice issue emerged, nor the auto insurance gap, CPI issue and all that, loan growth headwinds that you're seeing right now, this decline in commercial, et cetera, that's still would've happened? On commercial, for sure. Yes. Commercial, yes. John, the sales practices impact for our loan growth has been primarily based on referrals from our branches to some of our other businesses. So there's been an impact in terms of credit card referrals and first mortgage, home equity and things like that. That's where the loans -- and personal loans in line, Thank you, John. That's really where the impact has been. There has not been a material -- or an impact in wholesale or Wealth and Investment management for that matter. Okay, thank you. And then a couple quick more things. On the, on Slide 16, where you give us the the the targeted savings exclude that there's items there, including the CDI and the FDIC. What is a total of those items? Is it about $1 billion? On annual basis, it's about $1 billion, yes. Okay. All right, great. And then lastly, on the on the credit side, the 90-plus days past dues, up 14% on a linked quarter basis, I'm, sorry, if I missed this, but how much of that is storm related? And is there -- and what is the amount that may be related to the storms, I guess in that, and could that continue to increase from here? Thanks. I don't have... Storm-related? I don't have a good answer for you, John. So I don't think much, because it just happened. And -- so I don't think that's a big driver. Okay. All right, great. Thank you. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. So Tim, so you've been CEO now for about a year... A year and a day, I think. All right, well not even... Maybe two, I don't know. It seems like forever, Matt. Yes. So now that you've been there for some time, do you feel like you've identified all of the issues related to, just call it, sales practices and tactics that have become headline issues for the stock and obviously, weighed on results as well, especially like you've identified those issues? Well, Matt we've been working very hard to identify all issues. I'm very pleased with the progress, obviously, I am not initially pleased if you find something that sometimes it's not particularly positive, but we made a commitment to look through everything and be very disclosive and I appreciate that can create a headline and weigh on the company and stock, and team members, and other stakeholders. But we've made a lot of progress. I can't of commit to you, Matt, that we've finished everything, because things are still in progress, but we're very far along. But I think it's also important to reinforce that our review of all of our policies. Procedures practices is going to continue for a long time, meaning, that we've got to continue to ask more of ourselves everyday. And I think that was in hindsight one of the mistakes that we made and we've -- I've taken responsibility for that, we've taken responsibility for it, but it's a long way to answer your question. We're making a lot of progress. We've been transparent about everything that we've talked about -- we've discovered, and so on, I'm really pleased with the progress. If you had to guess how much longer until you can say, we've looked through everything, this is what we found, we're done, and I can appreciate that issues can pop up at any company at any time, but when can you kind of put the stake in the ground and say, we've been through everything, it's a big company, lots of businesses, lots of employees and we're moving forward, and I can 100% guarantee nothing will pop up, but like, we're essentially on par with everybody else and we're feeling good from here. How long is that going to take? Well, Matt, I don't ever want to be on par with everybody else, I want to be better than everybody else. And that's why we rolled out our six aspirational goals for our team in March. And we said, look, we want to be the best in the industry. We're not the best in the industry in every one of those right now, but that's what our goal is. So, I think -- listen, I appreciate the question, and I understand the reason for the question and so on, but I don't have a specific date, and I think it's a mistake, notwithstanding, in the short term, that might feel good, but in the long-term, it will be a mistake. It's a mistake to put a stake in the ground and say everything's got to be done by a certain date because then what happens is, people might rush to get to an answer, and I don't want them to rush the answer. I want them to get to the right answer. But again, we've made a lot of progress. As John described, we're spending a lot of money looking through everything and building a better company. So we're going to continue on that journey. Okay. Yes, I can appreciate, it's hard to put a timeframe on it, but I do think it's important to come out when you feel confident and say that maybe If I could see issues have been addressed, we're turning the page and we're moving on. Understood. Thank you very much for taking the call. Thank you. Matt. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Marlin Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking the question. What I wanted to focus on is your deposit beta has been higher than the peers, which is abnormal, compared to your history, and that was really been, I think, reflective of you wanting to especially with corporate and wealth management customers, not give them any other reason in this period to look anywhere else. So you been defensive in your deposit pricing, which is not been the case in the past, you've been much more offensive, and aggressive in being able to hold back those deposits. When you look at your assets structure because of the duration of that would have had you to assume on your deposit side over time, you would have extended your assets. So what you're kind of getting is a fundamental shift in your deposit beta, which doesn't reflect on your asset side. So you can almost a mismatch and I'm just wondering if that's the way to kind of think about this, and is this how and why we're not seeing the margin expansion that we're seeing in some other banks? The aggregate deposit beta is a function of the component pieces of it. And as I mentioned earlier, we're the no. 1 retail deposit franchise and that beta there has essentially been zero. In Wealth and Investment Management, where we've got a sophisticated clientele with a lot of excess liquidity and a lot of options, I think our beta -- our realized beta has been on the order of 1/3, 30% to 35%. In the Wholesale, where we, as you point out, we have lots of sophistication, lots of competition, et cetera, I think the realized beta has been something on the order of 2/3, and so, to the extent that we've been growing Wholesale deposits a little bit faster, then the weighted average deposit beta moves up reflecting that mix. I don't know whether Perry would say that he's being more responsive in this cycle to get -- not give people a reason to move money away from Wells Fargo. I think they're being judicious, they're going customer by customer, or customer category by customer category. We're doing more, for example, with certain types of institutional borrowers, which probably have the most sensitivity to changing rates, but we need them for our total liquidity profile. And it sort of is what it is, on average. And when I think about NIM expansion and, in a rising rate environment, obviously, this is a big part of the outcome. But there's also the change in the rest of our liability structure as well. We've got more long-term debt than we've ever had before, and that comes at more of a cost, which has been NIM depressing during the time that we've been adding an office. There's few other structural items as well. Marlin, let me just reinforce how we think about pricing deposits for our Wholesale customers. It's very much based on -- it's very much done on a relationship by relationship basis. So it's not just about Hey, let's decide whether or not you want to keep these deposits. It's about what's the value of the overall relationship. And so, it's did you appreciate it? It's a little bit more complicated than just the deposit. It's the relationship. And it's very much coordinated with what we're doing on the well and the individual side. So there's a lot of coordination going on. There have, as John mentioned, the betas are a little bit higher. But I wouldn't necessarily jump to the conclusion that it's fundamentally changed the structure of the company. I'm always thinking that, that might be temporary, in the sense that you used to be able to be the most aggressive lagger, which helped you to be able to expand when everybody else was expanding, but also maintain a higher margin because you have extended your duration on your assets prudently, so that defended your margin in a declining rate environment, but takes away a little bit of the punch on the way up, that you used to be able to make by just being half of what everybody else did in deposit increases. And then my last question was, if you look at fee income, you've seen a disruption of activities related to these hurricanes and other things that have gone on in the last couple of months. Do you feel like we've seen what you've allocated to a loan loss reserve, but hasn't it also probably impacted some of your fee income in the third quarter? I think at the margin, Marty, there's no question that when you have such an important market like Florida without power, and still parts of Florida without power, you have an important market like in and around Houston, which has been a, very dynamic from a growth standpoint, there's some impact. I don't know how much it is, but at the margin, there's some impact. And we'll work through it. Because again, that has an impact on the company in a very short term. Over the long term, those are great markets that, are going to recover. Generally, what you see kind of post-hurricane, in a hurricane situation, you see kind of a V-shaped recovery in those markets, and we're looking forward to that. That's one of the reasons why we've really focused on making sure that we've provided all the benefits to our customers possible, to help them recover even faster. No, I think that's right, and what just was, it's a kind of a hidden impact, there's no way to put your finger on it, but it is kind of underneath the numbers, as you kind of look at it, and it will rebound quickly, but, thanks. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Good morning, Tim. Good morning, Gerard. How are you? Good. Thank you. Can you guys give us some color? Obviously, you're leading mortgage originator in the United States, residential mortgage originator, and can you give us some color on where you see the housing industry at this point, in the cycle? Are we halfway through the cycle, 2/3 the way through? Or just starting out? Any color would be helpful. Yes. I mean, I think everybody's got an opinion, and if -- I wish Franklin was on the phone, because he'd probably give you the best one. But my personal view is that I think this recovery is very different than what we've seen historically because of the impacts of demographics, and what we just see the millennials forming households and therefore buying houses at a different pace than what we saw in earlier recoveries and our prior recoveries and other demographics. So I think there's, and we believe there's a lot more room to grow. I don't know what inning it's in, but I would say it's in an early -- again, assuming kind of the steady economic growth that we've seen, we see that demographic group aging more, they're starting to form families more, we're starting to -- and we're starting to see the benefit of that. So my expectation is that we're early in that process. And we've got a lot to work to look forward to. And that's one of the reasons why we've been so focused on rolling out our new digital mortgage application because, I think, particularly for that demographic group, they're used to mortgage, then they want a mortgage experience, so maybe you and I didn't experience when we bought our first home. They're used to, when they go online, they want all the information as they should have it, and so that's what we're very excited to roll this out in the first quarter and we think that will be very positive to that demographic group. In that application you described, Tim, that's equivalent to the rocket mortgage that Quicken Loans has right now? I want to be very respectful to Quicken, I think they've done a great job with the rocket mortgage, but I would describe what we're doing as kind of the next generation, because it's not just about giving a fast answer, that's part of it, everybody expects that, and we're doing that across the platform from a consumer side. This is about you going online, you're a Wells Fargo customer, you type in a little bit of information, like who you are, and you want a mortgage, and we pre-populate your application, right? So that you're not -- we're not asking you and you're not having to give, for the 44th time, where you live, how much you make, and it's using the trusted data that we have here. What's even more exciting about that is that we're going to have the capability of pulling that data from outside Wells Fargo, too. So we're going to be -- we're going to have that same capability, both inside and outside Wells Fargo. So I would describe it as the next generation. So I mentioned in my comments earlier that data modernization is one of our big initiatives, because for reasons like this, with the breadth of reach that we have to, call it, 21 million households and 70 million customers in one way or another, we know so much about our customers that we should be able to, as in this case, pre-populate with trusted data. But present really customized, really personalized solutions when people are looking for a new product or a new service, we can use that same data in a fraud protection way, that's -- it's very, very powerful in a risk management way, it is very, very powerful. The more we know, because of the breadth of our relationship with customers, the stronger the value proposition is going forward. So it's a huge initiative, and it's going to -- it should change the way retail banking is done. I see. And maybe Tim, just sticking with home mortgage for a moment, I think, very recently, the Mortgage Bankers Association came out with the top 20 originators. And what's fascinating is the top 10, the number of nonbanks that are in there, like a Quicken Loans or Freedom Mortgage Corp., and they're growing very rapidly. How do you see them as a competitive threat to the traditional banks like your own? Well, I think the primary driver for the change in mix in the top 10, it's been related to FHA, direct mortgages. Again, set correspondent aside from that. Because the FHA has not adopted the same liability structures that Fannie and Freddie have. The larger originators, we would be 1 and our other bank competitors are the others, have just said, you know what, we're not going to sign up for the fact that 10 years from now, somebody could come back and say, a mortgage you originated today defaulted at that point in time. And that's really been the driver. Now I'm hopeful, I'm hopeful that with all the changes that are going to occur as we look at how homes are financed this country that, that issue will be dealt with, and I can assure you that, if and when that occurs, we will be back into the FHA-direct business and you'll see an improvement in our share over time. But that's been the driver, plain and simple. And I don't need to be negative about any of the competitors, they're all terrific, and I'm sure they're providing good service and so on to their customers, but that's been the driver. Great. And then with home equity loans, I think you mentioned, if I heard you correctly a moment ago, that you could see growth in the product in 2018, but the vintage home equity loans are performing much better than you earlier thought. Is there any possibility that, that type of product, whether it was an interest only product for a 10-year term, would those come back when you think about growing the portfolio since they performed so much better than expected? There's no question that we want to try to retain as many of those customers and as we can. So the short answer is, yes, I think that's part of our overall growth strategy. But many of those are just paying off, because the customers don't need them anymore. I see, and then just lastly on you guys talk about your expense initiative, of course, and it's $4 billion that you're going to reduce, I think you were, John, pretty clear that the expectations for the reduction in expenses do not include core deposit premiums that you've been running every year also the FDIC special assessment, and then also expenses associated with businesses you've sold off. Could you frame out for us what that total could be, from those three areas, in that would be on top of the $4 billion? Yes, that's why -- I think Betsy had asked about the sum of the FDIC premium and the amortization of deposit intangibles, that's about $1 billion a year in full run rate. And the expenses from the businesses that was selling, I don't think that we've called that one out yet, it's less than $1 billion, but there's a portion of it that's direct and a portion indirect. And so we need to make sure that we can drive out all of the indirect that's associated with it, in order to take the full amount out. We'll give some more clarity as those businesses actually close and are sold. Let's get the deal done and then we'll provide some more detail. Great. Thank you Operator Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning, everybody. Two questions. First, client customer growth, your primary checking account customers have essentially been flat over the last year, and that compares to sort of mid- to high-single digits historically, and it's really decelerated since the second quarter of last year. And on top of that, small business account deposit and consumer deposits have been coming in as well. So I mean, how important is it to stem that, and to start to drive some consumer account growth again? And what do you need to do to kick start that? And is it, at some point, does it suggest that maybe you do have to start to become a little bit more aggressive in terms of deposit pricing on the retail side as well? So let me answer the last question -- last part of your question, and get to the beginning, because it's a really good question. The short answer is no, we don't. The driver of this is not deposit pricing. I think that -- when you get to margin, if you're competing on price, you're making short-term decisions and you're missing the opportunity to build long-term relationships. What -- how I would think about the primary checking account growth in kind of 2 parts: one is quality, and one is quantity. You were talking about quantity, which is an absolutely fair point. Year-over-year, it's been flat. I think the reason for that is because we've been through and are going through a transformation in our retail business. And when you think about what -- how that sales practices, settlements, and related reputational impact affected our team and our customers, particularly in the third and fourth quarter, and then Mary and team have been making fundamental changes to the business, in terms of a new incentive plan, going through reducing a layer of management in terms of new training, and just there's been so much going on, and I think that what we're seeing, and I just actually was talking to Mary about this over the last couple of days, what we're seeing right now in our branches are team members that are so much more confident and working so much better with their customers to provide them with solutions, and I think you're going to see that in, not only continued improvement in customer experience and loyalty scores, but you're going to see that in terms of growth. The quality, I think, is an important point. Mary highlighted at Investor Day that our average customer deposits per account were up about 8% year-over-year. Now, we're seeing them being up about 11%. So we've got work to do on quantity, quality is already improving. But it's just the execution of all the plans that are in process right now, and we're seeing improvement every day. Okay, that's helpful. I guess I'll just follow up with sort of a bigger picture type of question. And you guys have a lot of stakeholders, does any bank or any company, employees, the communities you serve, your clients, your shareholders. You obviously want to be seen as a good corporate citizen whose actions are doing good for society at large. But sort of in the grand scheme of things, I mean how important is generating an 11% to 13% ROE for shareholders? And the question isn't meant to be confrontational or grandstanding in any ways, but it does feel like it's sort of in the background of discussions you have with investors, is Wells going to pull the cost leverage hard as they can, are they going to communicate that? Are they going to be more apt to change pricing or increase deposit pricing or whatever it is. But I kind of wanted to just ask sort of how do you think about the push and pull of how you run the business and decide how to address different stakeholders' interest? Yes. I'll start, and I'm sure John will want to jump in, but we appreciate that we have a lot of stakeholders, and it is not lost on us, that our most important stakeholders, or you, our shareholders. And we have historically provided exceptional returns on an absolute and a relative basis. I think our returns are -- continue to be very, very good. Others have caught up, we appreciate that. But make no mistake, we understand that increasing our capital return to our shareholders, like we did to this quarter, when we were up to $4 billion and continuing to grow ROE, is very important. And that's one of the reasons why then we introduced our 6 aspirational goals to our team, that we were very clear that providing the best long-term returns to our shareholders in the industry is one of our goals, and we're going to achieve that goal. Okay, that's great. Thanks a lot. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. All right. Hi, Tim. Hi, John. Just a couple of questions, mortgage applications, the issue that came out, you said you're refunding customers from September 2016, just I want to understand, did something change in the system that caused this thing to start from September 2016? Any color on that, what happened that it starts only at that point? We've changed our practice, it's done centrally now, and so -- so that's why there's a focus. Two, we've been very focused on reinforcing to the entire team that if there's something they're concerned about, go ahead and raise your hand and escalate it, and so that's working, too. And then within our centralized risk functions, we're also -- we've also created a conduct office. And within that, we're assembling data to John's point about the investment we're making in data so that we're using data better to triangulate any area that we're concerned about. So you take a call to an ethics like or attrition or complaints or whatever, you put that all together, and then you can more quickly look at something and say, hey, we got an issue or we don't. The good news is we're making lots of progress, but absolutely right, I mean we have fundamentally changed the organization -- this organization, we fundamentally changed it for the better, and we're seeing that every day. Now, sometimes in seeing that, it means that we find something, we're going to be very transparent because of it, that's what we promised you would do. It's sort of a backlog issue. Operator When you look at the C&I growth, I know it's down, I know you highlighted some of the declines and somewhat was offset by growth in the presentation, but that still only accounts for $1 billion of that $3 billion decline. So can you just highlight where the rest of the decline came from? And in light of some of your peers who are reporting really strong growth in large Corporate Banking, how did large Corporate Banking perform in the quarter? Everything else was relatively small, and we also called out the impact in terms of the Commercial Real Estate. So it's a little bit more complicated than that, in terms of the driver or the efficiency. But again, our goal is to get down to a 59% level sometime next year, so I'm sure we'll be talking about that again. Listen, I really appreciate anybody's time this morning. I know it's been a busy morning for all of you. I just want to reemphasize that, over the past years, we've made a number of fundamental changes to our business model, to the structure of the organization, which I was just mentioning, and to a number of our performance management programs to ensure that we're focusing on our customers and focusing on their financial needs. Again, I want to thank the hard work and effort of our 268,000 team members for their focus and resiliency in meeting those customer needs. We are seeking every opportunity to identify and fix any issues that we have with the company, and make sure they're done correctly. As I mentioned, we've seen very strong progress and addressing those issues and also rebuilding trust with all of our stakeholders, including all of you. And while we understand there's more work to do, I am confident that we're absolutely on the right path as we continue to build a better, stronger Wells Fargo. So again, thank you very much for your time, and have a good day. Duration: 94 minutes More WFC analysis ","
      
    Wells Fargo Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call Transcript (WFC) -- The Motley Fool

The stock market climbed on Friday to finish the week on a positive note, with both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending marginally higher. Below the surface of an otherwise placid day in the market, however, were a number of countervailing currents sending shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) meaningfully higher while Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) saw its stock suffer. Index Point Change Percentage Change S&P 500 3.73 0.14% Dow Jones Industrial Average 38.98 0.17% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Chipotle Mexican Grill, which has been struggling to regain its footing in the wake of multiple food-borne-illness outbreaks at its locations over the past two years, saw its shares climb more than 3% on Friday. The move came after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said the burrito maker will be included in the social network's food-ordering program. The service, a partnership with Delivery.com and Slice, allows Facebook users to place orders from restaurants straight from the Facebook app. Image source: Chipotle Mexican Grill. The service itself isn't new. What is new is that members of the social network can now place orders using an ""Order Food"" feature that aggregates on a single page all of the restaurants that participate in the program. Previously, Facebook users had to go a restaurant's individual page to place an order. It was a rare bit of positive news for Chipotle, which has seen its stock lose more than half its value since 2015. The company has been desperately trying to regain the trust and loyalty of customers since then, rolling out new products such as queso dip and chorizo to entice them back in. Yet its efforts have largely fallen flat to date, with Chipotle's same-store-sales growth continuing to lag its historical performance. CMG data by YCharts. Shares of Wells Fargo went in the opposite direction of Chipotle's on Friday, dropping after the bank reported disappointing third-quarter earnings. All told, Wells Fargo earned $4.6 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30, representing a steep fall from the $5.6 billion it earned in the same quarter last year. Much of the decline can be traced to a $1 billion charge Wells Fargo incurred to cover anticipated legal costs stemming from pre-crisis mortgage-related regulatory investigations. Once this charge is backed out, Wells Fargo's earnings per share came in at $1.03, which was flat with last year. Image source: Wells Fargo. Like Chipotle, Wells Fargo has also been struggling to regain its footing, after regulators revealed in September 2016 that employees in the bank's branches had spent years opening accounts for customers without the customers' authorization to do so. All told, the bank opened an estimated 3.5 million illicit accounts between 2009 and this year. The incident has wreaked havoc on Wells Fargo's once-industry-leading returns and efficiency. Revenue is being weighed down by a shift in the bank's culture away from sales quotas, while expenses have been elevated to absorb the legal and administrative costs of dealing with the fallout. It remains to be seen whether Wells Fargo can once again become a leading brand name in the United States, but it seems fair to say in the wake of the bank's third-quarter performance that investors shouldn't expect it to happen anytime soon.

John Maxfield,10192017,Fool,10122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. One look at the market's reaction to Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) third-quarter earnings offers a clear hint that the nation's second biggest bank by assets turned in an upbeat performance. On Friday, its shares notched a 1.5% gain. Bank of America earned $0.48 per share in the three months ended Sept. 30. That marked a 17% improvement over the year-ago period. It also came in above analysts' expectations. The two dozen analysts tracked by Yahoo! Finance predicted that the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank would earn $0.45 per share. ""Our focus on responsible growth and improving the way we serve customers and clients produced another quarter of strong results,"" said Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan in prepared remarks. ""Revenue across our four lines of business grew 4%, even with a challenging comparable quarter for trading. We delivered positive operating leverage year over year for the 11th consecutive quarter while continuing to invest in improved capabilities."" Brian Moynihan, the chairman and CEO of Bank of America. Image source: Bank of America. The bank's top line grew by 1% from the year-ago period, coming in at $21.8 billion. That was short of the $21.9 billion analysts had expected, but in the same quarter of 2016, Bank of America generated $21.6 billion in total revenue. Its revenue was fueled by higher net interest income, which represents the bank's earnings from its portfolio of loans and fixed-income securities. The figure grew $960 million in the quarter, or 9%, thanks to higher interest rates as well as growth in Bank of America's loan and securities portfolios. Importantly, these are positive headline figures, but they aren't the most significant metrics that investors in Bank of America should keep their eyes on. I would argue instead that the bank's profitability and efficiency metrics stole the show in the second quarter. BAC data by YCharts. By profitability, I mean first and foremost Bank of America's return on assets. This reflects how much a bank earns relative to the size of its balance sheet, and it's calculated by dividing a bank's quarterly earnings (multiplied by four to annualize them) by its total assets. Bank of America's goal is to generate a 1% return on assets, which is a standard threshold in the industry that's presumed to distinguish between well-run banks and the rest. It has come up short of this mark since the financial crisis, which cost the bank upwards of $200 billion in expenses related to elevated loan losses and legal fines and settlements, but it is closing in on the mark. In the latest quarter, Bank of America returned 0.98% on its assets. That's up from 0.90% in third quarter of last year. It's also an improvement from 0.93% on a sequential basis -- i.e., from the second quarter of this year. At this rate, it isn't unreasonable to think that Bank of America could soon achieve this pillar of its profitability targets by the end of the year, which would be a coup for Moynihan. Along these same lines, the second metric that I believe to be especially important right now for the investment thesis in Bank of America is its efficiency ratio. This measures how much revenue a bank spends on operating expenses. It's calculated by dividing a bank's noninterest expenses by its net revenue. As a general rule, a well-run bank will have an efficiency ratio below 60%, which, not coincidentally, is Bank of America's goal. The most efficient banks are even able to get the figure down to 50% or below, freeing up meaningfully more revenue to fall to the bottom line and fatten shareholders' wallets. In Bank of America's case, its efficiency ratio in the third quarter came in at 59.51%. That was even with its ratio in the second quarter, but an improvement from the 61.66% efficiency ratio the bank reported in the third quarter of last year. This is an enormous improvement from the 70%-plus efficiency ratios that Bank of America reported for years in the wake of the 2008 crisis. It also means that Bank of America, for the second quarter in a row, has outperformed the notoriously efficient Wells Fargo in this regard, which has seen its efficiency ratio eclipse 60% as it absorbs added costs and lackluster revenue growth following revelations last September of a wide-ranging sales scandal that had been going on in its branches for years. In short, it's obviously no secret that Bank of America turned in a good third-quarter performance. But to appreciate the best parts of its performance, it's necessary to go beyond the headline numbers. ","
      
    Bank of America's Third-Quarter Earnings: Why the Headline Numbers Matter Less Than You Think -- The Motley Fool

 ,10192017,Fool,10122017,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) third-quarter profits rose 7 percent from a year earlier, as the bank was able to increase revenue in its consumer banking business even though the company saw a sizeable drop in trading revenue in the quarter. The biggest bank by deposits and assets said Thursday that it earned a profit of $6.73 billion, or $1.76 per share, compared with $6.29 billion, or $1.58 a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.65 a share, according to FactSet. JPMorgan's consumer bank was the driver of this quarter's growth, reporting a 16 percent rise in net income. The bank saw higher deposit and loan growth and higher revenue in its credit card division, which the bank has been expanding aggressively in the last year with a new high-end credit card known as Chase Sapphire Reserve. Charge-offs in that business have been creeping steadily higher for several quarters, however, and the bank had to set aside an additional $223 million to cover potential losses. Despite the creep up in delinquencies, ""the U.S. consumer remains healthy,"" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement. The bank was able to grow loans across the board in its consumer business: credit cards, business loans, auto loans as well as mortgages. The gains in JPMorgan's consumer banking division were more than enough to make up for declines corporate and investment banking, its other major business. That division reported a 13 percent decline in profits from a year earlier, mostly due to lower trading revenues. Bond trading revenue was down 27 percent and stock trading revenue fell 4 percent, the bank said. Stock and bond trading revenue has languished this year at major banks because markets have been relatively quiet. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs all saw trading revenue drop in the second quarter this year, and analysts have been anticipating another decline this quarter. JPMorgan's total revenue was $26.2 billion on a managed basis, which was more than the $25.19 billion that analysts had been looking for. The firm's return on common equity, a measure of how well a bank is performing, was 11 percent in the quarter, up from 10 percent a year earlier. Major banks like JPMorgan try to keep that metric above 10 percent. JPMorgan's stock was down 24 cents in pre-market trading to $96.60. It's up 12 percent this year.

Motley Fool Staff,10192017,Fool,10122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: The Motley Fool. Operator Please stand by. We are about to begin. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JP Morgan Chase's third-quarter 2017 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over the JP Morgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. The third quarter was generally constructive across businesses and asset classes. Underlying business drivers grew broadly and we maintained or gained share in a competitive environment. The US and global economy continue to grow. Clients are active with demands on credit remaining solid, all in all resulting in 7% growth in net income driven by positive operating leverage as revenue rises and expense remains controlled. On an adjusted basis, this is a clear record for a third quarter. Of course, against the financial backdrop, I want to acknowledge the recent natural disasters. The impact on effected customers, communities, and employees has been devastating. Supporting them is our priority as they rebuild. I will note that any financial impact is not significant to our results. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $6.7 billion, EPS of $1.76, and return on tangible common equity of 13% on revenue of $26.2 billion. Highlights of the quarter include average core loan growth of 7.5% year-on-year and the FDIC recently released its survey showing that the firm has surpassed the competition and now ranks number one in total US deposits and in deposit growth, driven by strong consumer deposit growth up 9%. Client investment assets, credit card sales, and merchant volumes were all up 13% and we continue to rank number one in global ID fees. We had record revenue in the commercial bank and delivered record net income and assets under management in asset and wealth management. The credit environment continued to remain benign across products and portfolios. Card charge-offs were fully in line with our expectations and guidance. Outside of card, our charge-off rates remain at historically low levels. Turning to Page 2 and some more detail about the third quarter. Revenue of $26.2 billion was up approximately $700 million or 3% year-on-year. Driven by net interest income, up $1.2 billion, reflecting the impact of higher rates and continued loan growth, partially offset by lower markets revenue. Adjusted expense of $14.4 billion was flat to last quarter and to last year if you exclude $175 million of one-time items in CCB in the prior year period. Credit costs of $1.5 billion were up about $200 million year-on-year, driven by higher net charge-offs in card. In the quarter, we built card reserves of $300 million primarily due to seasoning of new ventures. And, we saw a wholesale release of over $100 million partly driven by select names in the energy sector and reflecting improvements in portfolio quality in commercial real estate. Switching to balance sheets and capital on Page 3. What is most notable on this page is that all of the numbers are basically flat quarter-on-quarter, with the exception of growth and tangible value per share. Our capital generation was fully offset by distributions, reflecting a payout of about 100% for the first time in a long time, in line with our previous capital plan. And, from here, we expect the direction of travel for our CET1 ratio to be lower over time. Moving on to Page 4 and consumer and community banking. CCB generated $2.6 billion of net income and an ROE of 19%. We continued to grow core loans up 8% year-on-year, driven by mortgage, up 12%, and business banking, cards, and auto loans and leases were up 7%. Year-on-year, we saw 13% growth in each of client investment assets, card sales, and merchant processing volumes. Nearly half of the growth in investment assets came from net inflows and our deposit margin continued to expand up six basis points this quarter. Revenue of $12 billion was up 6% year-on-year. Consumer and business banking revenue was up 15% on higher NII, approximately equally due to margin expansion as well as strong average deposit growth. Mortgage revenue was down 17% on loan spread and production margin compression, as well as lower net servicing revenue driven by the MSR. Underlying that decline, the mortgage business is performing well relative to the market. Our originations are down only 1%, versus the market down an estimated 15% as we gain share in purchase. Finishing up on revenue, card commerce solutions and auto revenue was up 7% as higher auto lease income and growth in card loan balances outpaced the continued impact of investments in new account acquisitions. Expect CCSA fourth-quarter revenue to be relatively flat sequentially as higher net interest income will be offset by the anniversary net impact of Sapphire Reserve last year. Expense of $6.5 billion was flat year-on-year, or up 3% excluding the one-time items I mentioned. Higher auto lease depreciation and continued underlying business growth were partially offset by lower marketing expense. The overhead ratio was 54% for the quarter as positive operating leverage despite significant investments in the businesses moves us closer to our medium-term target. Finally, on credit performance, in terms of net charge-offs, as I said, cards increased in line with expectations and guidance. And in auto, charge-offs included approximately $50 million of a catch-up, reflecting regulatory guidance on the treatment of customer bankruptcies. Excluding this, loss rates in auto was only 41 basis points. In general, it feels like the auto market has plateaued at current levels with inventory incentives, used car prices we saw, all having stabilized over the last few months. In terms of credit reserves, I've previously mentioned we built $300 million in card reserves in the quarter as we grow. Although there were no mortgage reserve actions, portfolio quality improvements allowed us to absorb the expected impact of the hurricanes into our current reserves. Now turning to Page 5 and the corporate investment bank. CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $8.6 billion and an ROE of 13%. The third quarter of 206 revenue, in both IBCs and markets, benefited from a number of large fee events and higher levels of volatility, creating tough comparisons across the board. This quarter in banking, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was strong and relatively flat from last year's record levels. Year to date, we've gained some share and maintained our number one ranking in globally IDBs. We also ranked number one in North America and India. We printed record advisory fees for a third quarter, up 14% on broad strengths across sectors and [inaudible] [00:11:16], particularly in Europe, making up for a smaller wallet in North America. Equity underwriting fees were down 21%, however, we ranked number one in wallets, number of deals, and volumes globally for the quarter and for the year to date. The market remains active and the pipeline healthy. In desk underwriting, there was a reasonably high run rate coming into the quarter, and we broadly maintained it. Landing fees slightly down year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, driven by strong repricing and refinancing activity and high yield bond issuance. We ranked number one in fees year to date and gained share overall and across products. Treasury services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 15%, and while higher rates are a driver, we are also seeing positive momentum in organic growth in the business globally as our clients are responding favorably to the investments we've made in our platform and products. Moving on to markets, total revenue was $4.5 billion, down 21% year-on-year against an impressive third quarter of 2016 in a quieter and very competitive environment. Fixed income revenue was down 27%, a solid performance given a backdrop of low volatility and tight spreads. At the risk of laboring the point, you may recall that we gained 240 basis points a share in fixed in the third quarter of 2016, which will mean our year-on-year decline will look larger than most. Equities revenue was down 4%, but underneath that is a diversification story. Consistent with last quarter, lower flow and exotic derivatives activity were substantially offset by strength in cash and prime, which continues to be a bright spot for us this year. Before I move on, the fourth quarter environment so far feels consistent with the second and third, with no obvious catalysts on the horizon for that to change. But, of course, change it could. So, it's worth pointing out that the fourth quarter last year was also a record fourth quarter since the crisis. As such, we expect next quarter's markets revenues to be lower year-on-year. Security services of $1 billion was up 10% driven by rates and balances, with average deposits up 15% year-on-year as well as by higher asset-based fees on market levels globally. Finally, expense of $4.8 billion was down 3% year-on-year, driven by lower compensation expense of lower revenues, and the comp to revenue ratio for the quarter was 27%. Moving to commercial banking on Page 6. Another excellent quarter in this business, with net income of $881 million with record revenue and an ROE of 17%. Although we recognize that our results are flattened by a benign credit environment, the performance is very strong and broad-based, and is driven by the investments we've been making in the business, the differentiated platform capabilities we can offer our clients, and our commitment to business discipline. Revenue grew 15% year-on-year, driven by deposit NII and on higher loan balances, with overall spreads remaining steady. While IB revenue was down some year-on-year, we grew 9% sequentially with particular strengths in middle markets, which is starting to feel like a trend. Expense of $800 million was up 7% on continued investment in the business, focused on technology as well as banker coverage, having added over 200 bankers since the beginning of 2016. Since our investment agenda is ongoing, expect fourth quarter expenses to remain at about this level. Loan balances were up 10% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were up 8% year-on-year, driven by strengths in expansion markets and specialized industries, but were flat sequentially in line with the industry on flat utilization despite decent flow and stable pipelines. Commercial real estate full growth is 13% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter. Although growth rates are decelerating, we continue to outpace the industry. However, we remain very disciplined in client selection, products, and pricing and are sticking to what we know well. Finally, credit costs were a benefit of $47 million, predominantly driven by commercial real estate. Credit performance remains strong with a net charge-off rate of four basis points. Leaving the commercial bank and moving on to asset and wealth management on Page 7. Asset and wealth management reported record net income of $674 million with pre-tax margin of 33% and ROE of 29%. Revenue of $3.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and by strong banking results on higher deposit NII. Expense of $2.2 billion was up 2% year-on-year, driven by a combination of higher compensation and higher external fees for which there is an offset in revenue. This quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $21 billion with positive flows across fixed income, multi-asset, and alternatives, being partially offset by outflows in equity products. We also saw net liquidity inflows of $5 billion and continue to increase our global market share. Record AUM of $1.9 trillion and overall client assets of $2.7 trillion were up 10% and 9% respectively year-on-year on higher market levels globally as well as net inflows. Deposits were down 6% year-on-year and 4% sequentially, reflecting continued migration from deposit accounts into investment-related assets, and we are retaining the vast majority of these balances. Finally, we had record loan balances up 10% year-on-year, driven by mortgage up 19%. Moving to Page 8 and corporate. Corporate pulled in net income of $78 million. Treasury and CIO's results improved year-on-year, primarily due to the benefit of higher rates. You'll remember that last quarter, other corporate included a legal benefit, which is driving the quarter-on-quarter decline you see on the page. Finally, turning to Page 9 in the outlook, all of NII expense charge off and loan growth remain broadly in line with previous guidance. To wrap up, this quarter and this year, we continue to consistently deliver for our clients. Our businesses are performing strongly across the board, maintaining or gaining share. Our financial performance clearly demonstrates the power of the platform, the benefits of diversification and of scale, as well as an investment strategy focus on long-term growth and profitability. We remain very well positioned to continue to benefit in a growing global economy. ... Operator, we can open up the line for questions. Operator And our first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck. Hi. Good morning. Two questions -- one on the revenue list in the consumer and community bank. I know on Slide 4 you highlighted that the 6% up year-on-year is driven by the higher NII and deposit margin expansion. Could you describe a little bit if this is just the start of an improvement in transfer pricing that the consumer banking division is benefiting from? Is there a lag that we should expect would continue to drive up this revenue list over the next several quarters? Betsy, there's no change in our transfer pricing methodology, or even the way we compute it. It's to do, as you appreciate, with higher rates and the fact that we are in a very disciplined environment at this point on deposit reprice. We would expect to continue to see the margin expand over the course of the next several quarters, but we would also expect to continue to drive higher NII as we're growing our deposits. [Crosstalk] Right. But that FTP methodology should continue to drive up deposit margin over the next couple of quarters. Yes. How are you dealing with the Equifax fallout? Does the breach that occurred drive any changes to how you are assessing credit requests that come in? How are you filtering for what you perceive as fraud risk? And, how are you managing the book of outbound credit requests that you're looking for from a proactive perspective on your loan book? I think the way to think about it -- not to diminish the importance of any individual breach or situation -- is that we are honestly under constant attack in a more general side and from a fraud perspective. While we will always react and learn lessons from every individual situation, this is not the first breach, nor will it be the last breach. As a result, we have been constantly evolving and refining the way we think about fraud prevention, detection, and underwriting. We continue to move to a multi-factor protocol around customer identification. Looking to leverage all of our data to better inform our underwriting decisions. The reality is that, as important as it is and as much as each individual breach could impact the overall equation, we have had to evolve over an extended period to the position we're in now. As a direct result of this, there will be specific meaningful changes, but a continuous evolution. Whether we're looking at sending out preapprovals or marketing offers or receiving inbound applications, we are increasingly looking at a number of different data points and facts to be able to identify the customer and understand the application. And let me -- as part of a breach. So, if your name was taken and we know that -- a Social Security or driver's license -- we can put in a lot of enhanced controls if we do your name specifically. We don't have to rely on those things. We can do some alliance. We can greatly, dramatically increase anti-fraud on your account. We do that and it dramatically diminishes any effect on our customers. The reality, Betsy, is that we've operated over an extended period now on the presumption that, while we happen to know about this breach, there will be others that we don't know about right now or over time. So, we have to be proactive and not reactive. We'll obviously look to learn anything we can, but we continue to evolve so we can use all of the information at our fingertips. As a practical matter, we are not seeing a specific increase in fraud. As a result, expense impact, loan growth impact, are minimal from your perspective? Correct. As a result, we're already spending the money we need to spend to keep hopefully ahead of the curve on all of these things. Our operating losses -- I will say, the combination of all of the information that has been compromised over the course of the last several years has put pressure on fraud costs, but nothing incremental from this. So, no -- no impact on expenses or loan growth that would be measurable. Operator And our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up to your responses, Marianne, on no pressure on deposit pricing. Especially in light of your deposit growth strengths, especially in the consumer, give us a sense on how repricing trends are today in terms of the consumer wealth management versus wholesale deposits. Apart from the rate hike in June, nothing has really happened much since last quarter. So, the landscape is looking pretty similar. Not because that's surprising. There's been very little to no movement in the repricing of deposit accounts. There have been some incremental movements in certain savings and CDs, but nothing systematic in the consumer space. But, that's pretty much as we would have expected with rates at these absolute levels. At some point in time -- that may be a couple or three rate hikes from now -- the dynamics may start to change. We haven't changed our perspectives about what we think the ultimate reprice will look like. In asset wealth management, the story on deposit pricing is somewhat similar -- a little bit more movement, but nothing particularly meaningful or dramatic. The story there is very much as expected. At these levels or rates, you are seeing customers start to make choices to move certain deposit balances into investment assets. That's normal migration -- migration that we expected and modeled. We are retaining those balances. We are starting to see some of the dynamics we expected play out. That started happening at the beginning of the year and has continued to progress. And in the wholesale space, there is a spectrum as well. I would start with we're firmly on a reprice journey in wholesale no doubt. Depending on where you are in the spectrum, it ranges from the smaller and lower middle market companies where the reprice is modest but present to the higher end where it's reasonably high. Overall, if I step back and say, ""Have we learned something new in this cycle that we didn't know,"" the answer is no, not really. If you look at the first four rate hikes of the previous normalization cycle, the overall cumulative deposit reprice was pretty much the same as it is now. So, we continue to believe that the dynamics we've been talking about over the last several years and that we've expected will play out. They may not play out exactly as we have them modeled, but they will ultimately play out that way. We have appropriately conservative reprice assumptions. Got it. You're one of the few firms that have been really talking about anticipating the impact from a fed balance sheet reduction over the next several years. The question I often get from investors is -- obviously, in particular retail, is valuable and not just for the price of it today but on an LCR basis. How would you respond to the question, given the 6% growth in digital in the consumer bank and 12% growth in mobile, does technology help with the stickiness of the consumer deposits? Or, does it potentially aid in the velocity of switching? At the risk of hedging, it's a bit of both. There have always been two different camps on the reprice theory for consumer. There's been the camp of acute market awareness, floats along, technology enhancements allow movement of money to be easier. Competition for retail deposits and good liquidity is high therefore reprice higher. The counter to that, which has merit and we're seeing to a degree, is customers feel that they're weighing a more balanced scorecard of things when they choose where to keep their deposits. Customer satisfaction, the suite of products and simplicity, the digital and online offerings, as well as the safety, security, and brand all matter. Price is a factor, but not the only one. I would say we certainly feel that having a leading digital capability is critical to overall customer franchise and it will, in all likelihood, have an impact on the stickiness of deposits. Customers value that kind of convenience very highly. I would also say one other thing about where we are right now. As you know, as much as you're right about the potential demand for these high liquidity value deposits, there's a lot of excess liquidity in the banking system. Although loan growth is solid, it's solid. So, we aren't seeing a friendly -- albeit, we're very proud of our deposit growth. Operator And our next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Hi. My question on the consumer and community bank is a three-part question. First, what percent of your customers have online bill pay? I'm trying to get back to that stickiness of the deposits. I don't have that off the top of my head, but we can get back to you. Okay, can you give a ballpark? I don't think you've disclosed that before. Is it to the nearest quarter or -- Here's what we'll do. I fear if I give you a ballpark, I'll get it wrong. While we're on the call, we'll get someone to send the details, and let you know. Okay. The second part is the deposit data's been lower. You gave your caveat. But, mobile bank customers are up 12% year-over-year. Why do you still need 5,200 branches? Isn't this a good time to close branches when deposit competition isn't as tough as it might be in the future? We're doing a bit of all of the above. Branches still matter. 75% of our growth in deposits came from customers who have been using our branches. On average, a customer comes into our branches multiple times in a quarter. I know that all sounds like old news, but it's still current news. The branch distribution network matters. Customer preferences are changing and we not being complacent to that. Underneath the overall 5,000-plus branches, we're continuing to consolidate, close, move, grow, change all of our branches in line with the opportunity in the market that we're in. Net for the year will be down about 125 branches. We've closed more than that, consolidated some, and added some. So, we're not being complacent to the consumer preference story, but branches still matter a lot. We're building out all of the other omnichannel pieces, as you know, so that we have a complete offering. If the customer behaviors start changing in a more accelerated fashion, we will respond accordingly. Operator And our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Hi. Good morning. First, on the loan side, on the yields -- the last quarter held flat and this quarter they're up 16 basis points. Can you help us understand? Was that more just a mechanics of timing of hikes moving through your variable rates? Is there an element of pricing or any other things you can help us understand why we saw that great, nice improvement there? Yeah. Over the two quarters, it's normal. You may recall last quarter there were a couple of things we talked about. First, there was a $75 million one-time interest adjustment in mortgage, which artificially reduced loan yields for the quarter. Secondly, there's a mix in cards similarly. We would normally, in the law of extraordinarily big numbers, expect for a 25-base-point rate hike, that we see about 10-is basis points of improvement in loan yields across the whole portfolio. We didn't see that last quarter. What you'll see in this quarter is the reversal of those factors and the normal benefit of the June rate hike. Got it. With the card build, you took the reserve for card to around 3.3%. I know you had talked about staying below a 3% card wash rate for this year. As we get into next year, you had a medium-term idea of 3-3.25. How are you feeling about that in terms of the seasoning of the card book and loss rates? As we look at the loss rates for this year, they're coming in as we expected at less than 3%. As we look out to next year, based on what we know today, it's still in that 3-3.25% range, albeit maybe at the higher end of that range. So, it's broadly in line with our expectations. In the consumer space, we move our reserves not in dollar increments. But, the reserve build is about a little less than one-third on the growth and a little more than two-thirds on normalization of rates. Operator And our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Hi. Maybe it's a little nitty gritty, but you're definitely the person for this. Point to point, the yield curve was about the same. However, throughout the quarter, the curve was much flatter. I'm just curious if that has any dampening effect in any given quarter? And, maybe the better way to ask it is could it have a little bit more of a positive run rate as we go forward? A couple of things. First, to repeat -- as a macro matter, we're more sensitive to the frontend of rates than to the low end of rates, particularly over any short period of time. Intra-quarter volatility in the 10-year -- while it's not nothing, it's not likely to have a material impact on our run rate. We're clearly, overall, generally flatter on the long end of the curve on average through the year. All other things being equal, we'll have had a dampening pressure on our expectations. It's part of the reason why it went from 4.5 to 4 -- not the only ones -- as we progress through the year. But, generally speaking, intra-quarter volatility is not something that would have a meaningful impact on our run rates. Cool. In terms of the loan growth, I think it's completely normal to see some moderation and you're still doing reasonably better than the industry. I'm curious on the main source of maybe the moderation ticking down a little bit, and then more importantly, is it too soon to ask if any of this talk on tax reform and decent economic data is having a pick-up in the conversations on the loan growth side? On the first, it is quite important to not look at the average and to decompose it into constituent parts. We talked before about the fact that we use our balance sheet strategically in the CIB, but loan growth is not really a sting there. So, this quarter, we saw no loan growth in CIB, so no big deal. But, it means that that 7.5% core growth for the whole portfolio would have been outside of CIB, closer to 9%. So, we'll start with that. Consumer has been pretty consistent. Across the consumer space, where it's jumbo mortgages, the business banking, card, also loans and leases -- they've been growing at reasonably solid and consistent high single-digit territory, or even low double-digit for mortgage, over the last several quarters. At this point, we don't really see anything that is suggesting that that will moderate meaningfully. So, the way you're seeing -- and similarly, in asset wealth management on the banking side. Where you're seeing the growth moderate is in commercial and it's in both the C&I loans and the commercial real estate loans. They each have a story. With the C&I loans, for us, the story is about moving from meaningfully outperforming the industry to being more in line with the industry. So, over the course of the last couple of years, as we've added expansion markets, opened new offices, added a couple hundred bankers, developed industry coverage models -- we've been growing meaningfully better than the industry. So, you see that even in this quarter in our year-on-year growth at 8%, as compared to the quarter-on-quarter growth although it's flatter. That, to me, is a factor of the fact that in this phase of the cycle our clients have strong balance sheets, a lot of liquidity, have had access to the capital markets, and so CDC top growth is not unlikely to be a level for the foreseeable future. With commercial real estate, it's slightly different. We're still outpacing the industry, but we've gone from very strong to strong and we would continue to expect that to slowly moderate. That's a number of things. It's some higher rates. It's actually a lot of competition. It's also about client selectivity, given where we are in the cycle. We are being very cautious about new deals we add to the pipeline and the client selection we have. So, all of those factors weigh into the commercial real estate space. Tax reform, fiscal stimulus -- the reality right now, we're all hopeful that tax reform is done for the right reasons and the economy responds accordingly. At this point, it's not front and center in the dialogue we're having with our clients about whether they should or shouldn't do a strategic deal or take an action. It's neither holding up business nor spurring business, but that could change. At this point, I would say it's a factor but not a driving factor. And that could change. Operator And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Good morning. Just a quick question on the outlook of the net interest margin. Should we still expect some grinding of higher asset yields even without rate hikes? How do we think about that trajectory, assuming we don't get any more rate hikes from here? We'll just deal with the fourth quarter. The landscape of rate hikes for 2018 is an open question. We would expect loan yields to hold relatively flat, all other things being equal. It's a very competitive environment. We're seeing some pressure in commercial real estate spread. We're seeing generally spread holding up, but I would expect competitive pressures to keep loan yields relatively flat. This may be on the reserve build outlook. Should we still expect it to track with its growth and keep the reserve ratio similar in cards where we are now? Do you still anticipate some additional building? How do we think about that? If you could size the hurricane impact, that would be great this quarter. At this point, we are at that 3% charge-off rate, rising to 3-3.25 next year and growing. So, you should continue to expect that we'll be adding to reserves. Our outlook for reserve add to next quarter is below this quarter, but we will continue to observe that. With respect to the hurricanes, right now in quarter's results, in the credit lines in mortgage particularly -- and to a much lesser degree in wholesale -- we respectively built $55 million of reserves. To contextualize that, we have used our unfortunate experiences of Sandy and Andrew and other natural disasters to calibrate the assumptions we're using. At this point, it's early to be able to say how the losses will actually manifest themselves. It could be that it's lower than that, but that's the central case right now. $50 million in mortgage and just a handful of million in the wholesale space. Operator And our next question comes from John McDonald of Berstein. Good morning. Marianne, could you discuss how you're balancing all of the investments you're doing in IT and business growth with the efficiency mindset that you guys always have? One of the frameworks is, if I look at the three-year simulation you provided in February, a lot of the expense growth needs to happen this year. We have a $2 billion increase in adjusted expense and post 2017 the expense growth looks very modest. Maybe just talk a little bit about the leverage you're using to keep expenses in check as you're doing all of the investments. I'll start with a bit of a philosophical discussion, which is it is our opinion that now -- as much, if not more so than ever -- the investments we're making in technology will effectively breed and deliver the efficiency. To the degree that we are able to find incremental investments or accelerate them, we'll be willing to do that. Our expense numbers, our outlook, have never been targets. That's the mental, philosophical point of view that we would deliver any technology innovation or investment that we could execute well that we think would increase our returns through revenues or efficiency. Specifically, when you look at the simulation, this is a point of technicality. In 2018, probably middle of the third quarter, we are expecting that the FDIC fund will reach its level at which the surcharge will be able to be reduced. That's a meaningful positive for us. If you look at the implied growth and expenses from '17 through the medium term, they are larger than implied. But, if we found the opportunity to do more or accelerate more, we would do it and explain it to you. So, we'll come back to that and investigate. Thanks. You mentioned the card revenue run rate has moved up again and I'd say this quarter you might be able to get to your target by the early half of next year. Is there an upside to that revenue run rate target? Are things coming in better than expected in terms of the moderation of promo rates and things like that? Maybe you could just give a little color there? When we did some conferences at the end of last year, I think we said we'd expect the revenue rates for the full year this year to be 10.5%, and it will be a little better than that. The revenue rate increase in the quarter speaks to a little bit of spread and a little bit of lower premium. It will go down next quarter because of the fourth quarter effects of the Sapphire's travel credit for an overall -- call it 10.6% for the year. But, yeah, we do expect to hit the 11.25% in the first half of next year. We've reached the inception point at the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter where growth is offsetting the impacts of the significant upfront investments in Sapphire Reserves. They will see revenues grow from here. Operator And our next question is from Jim Saul Martinez of UBS. Good morning. Following up on the commercial banking business, you've obviously had very good momentum there over the last couple of years. You did talk about credit dynamics and moderation in credit growth and a normalization back toward industry trend. Can you just comment a little bit more broadly about some of the initiatives you've had there from a revenue standpoint, whether it be the middle markets initiative, growth in IB, international, and whatnot. Your earnings growth has obviously been very, very strong in this business. It's starting to move the needle a little bit. Can you just give us a bit of color on the opportunity set you see there? Although we absolutely expect at some point we're going to see normalization of credit, we haven't seen that yet. I want to make that clear. We are appropriately cautious considering everything but we're not seeing any deterioration or any thematic fragility in our portfolio that we're concerned about at this point. With respect to the revenue side of the story and the efficiency side, it really is a story of all of the things you've mentioned all coming together at the same time. We have been adding -- we have our expansion markets from the position. We've been adding new markets and opening offices. We've been adding bankers. As you know -- We're in all 50 -- Yeah, we are in all 50 of our [inaudible] [00:45:40] now. We've been adding bankers. As you know, when you add all of these investments, for a period of time, when they are still in the buildup mode, we don't see that drop to the bottom line. Now, we're starting to see our bankers hit their stride. They've become very productive. The balances are building. And then, I would also say that this is the epicenter of delivering the whole platform to our clients. If you think about what we're able to offer our clients in terms of international capability, banking coverage across industries, core cash, global payments -- we have a platform that is certainly complete and somewhat differentiated. And then, I would say it's a buttoned-up business. We have been looking at efficiency, expenses, and really working on making sure that, through the simplification processes we went through in 2013-2015, we are focusing all of our efforts on our core strategic plan. And, it's paying off. That's great. Obviously, the administration and Congress released a blueprint so congress can now start to flesh out a tax plan. Obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty as to the content, timing, or whether it even happens or not. But, if we do see something that is sensible, how quickly do you think we could start to see that feeding through into better sentiment and into increased demand for credit. There are so many uncertainties that it's almost talking about a hypothetical at this point, as encouraged as we are with the ongoing dialogue. My view is sentiment is relatively high. In fact, it's ticked up slightly over the course of the last short while. So, from that vantage point, we're in a position of strength. There will necessarily be some lag, so whether that is a couple of quarters or longer, it's certainly in the foreseeable future that you would hope to be able to see increased demand and confidence leading to action. Operator And our next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Good morning. Can you talk a bit about how you're managing the excess liquidity? You've continued to build cash. The securities book as shrunk. It makes sense given the flatter yield curve, but you combine that with the still good deposit trends and the slowing loan growth and a challenge as you think about protecting them going forward. So, maybe talk about the dynamics there and how you think about the yield curve and how to manage it. I thought we'd answered the liquidity question because, while we feel very, very good about our liquidity position and you will have seen in the recent disclosures where everyone is positioned unnecessarily -- even if LCR was the only consideration, people would want to be running a buffer to LCR. But, LCR is not the only consideration. The other most noticeable one I would point out to you would be resolution planning. Know that when we have our overall liquidity position, we take into consideration a combination of constraints. What may look excess on one lever may not as excess on another. I would also say that, when we look at the deployment of our H2H, we look at in the context of our target for what we want the duration of the equity for the company to be over the course of the normalization in rates. It's not just about liquidity all throughout that duration, so we're comfortable with our liquidity position. We have a framework for deploying it and thinking about the forward-looking duration of the company. That's not to say that we are not opportunistic in taking advantage of moves that are technical in the long end of rates, to either deploy or to un-deploy and we still have some. It's more than just liquidity. It's also duration and we've taken the overall balance sheet and our expectations and targets into consideration, albeit that we still have some dry powder. And we maximize between loans, securities -- Yeah. To follow-up on the rate sensitivity, you mentioned before you're more leveraged through the short end of the curve. If we get continued increases on the short end of the curve, but the 10-year doesn't go anywhere, is that still indicative as it's been thus far? It will be over the short while, and our full expectation, outside of any other stimulation, is that as the front end of rates goes up and gradual unwind happens, you'll be able to see the long end of rates go up, albeit more slowly. It's pretty typical at this point in normalization cycle to have a curve flatten. That's what we're seeing. That's what we would expect. I would expect to continue to see the long end unwind and it should be indicative. Operator And our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Good morning. You touched on this a little bit, but maybe you can give us a little bit more color. You mentioned in your opening remarks you increase your market share in investment banking. Are you getting a bigger wallet share or are you winning more customers? Also, some of your competitors are still struggling. Is that also a factor? I would say it's wallet share. It's blocking and tackling. We did pretty well in Europe. But, there is still a lot of competition. I would say it's less about the specifics of any one competitor because the environment is pretty competitive and about reasonably broad strengths. Two things I would point out is that in equity underwriting, similar to in fixed, we gained a couple hundred basis points a share in the third quarter of last year. On an apples to apples basis to where we would normally expect our share to be, we're still doing very well. I would say the competition is fundamentally fully there. Most of the players roll out there -- some specialize in certain areas, but it's fully competitive. You have new and consumer -- the shiniest banks, etc. Very good. What's your read on the new Treasury report on changes coming in the capital markets that was released in early October? Any specific items in there that you guys looked at that would be specifically beneficial that you'd like to see changed? What's the probability of it happening? Could it happen sometime next year? Okay, that was a lot. First of all, we welcome the report and it's a long report -- a couple of hundred pages. There are a lot of recommendations. It's very comprehensive, so kudos to the treasury for delivering it. We are supportive of all those recommendations at large. I think the most important thing to remind you is that this is not about materially changing the legislative landscape. It's about sensibly recalibrating the specifics of individual rules over time. We're still digesting the report, but we are supportive. It is very comprehensive and it could be very beneficial to the liquidity index of the capital market, which is what we should all hope for, and not contrast to safety and fairness. In that sense, very supportive and all good. It's going to be complicated and it will take time. But, the will is there. Whether it's the administration or the regulators, there's a general recognition that there's the ability and appetite to want to make rational change. If that helps grow the economy and all of the things that come with that, we're working as constructively as we can on that. Operator And our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Nomura Instinet. Jamie, I was hoping you could update us on your efforts to launch your online brokerage offering. It's something you had mentioned in your last letter. It comes up with investors quite often, so how do you view the opportunities in that business for JP -- whether it's an effort to just build a moat around your current client cash balances and maybe fill a void, or is your intention to become a bit more disruptive in the space and actually attract many more customers and potentially even offer more aggressive pricing and terms? We're building, and are in beta, platforms. We're creating and investing in things like that. Also, the P2P are doing quite well. We look at all of those things that, from the clients' standpoint, you want to offer the client. At one point, we'll be talking about more testing and what we think might or might not work. Then, we'll give you a more strategic view of that, probably around investor data. Got it. Marianne, I wanted to follow up on some of the discussion around access liquidity management. I appreciate the fact that you guys certainly want to be conservative in thinking about duration and maybe taking a more holistic view of the asset side of the balance sheet. But, looking at the LCR disclosures and given the stark contrast in terms of how much you have parked in the way of excess reserves, and relatively low levels of NBS compared with your peers, how you're thinking about duration management and whether you do have additional capacity to remix some of that cash of the fed into higher yielding NBS, especially as we think about the Fed balance sheet on dynamics. We have a fairly large mortgage loan portfolio in addition to having a large portfolio in our investment securities in NBS. So, we are already reasonably equivalently mixed in terms of our percentage of mortgage exposure to our total accessible loans to the competitive landscape. Trust me when I tell you that you talk about excess liquidity because of LCR and we are thinking about more than just LCR. As I said, while we do maintain a sure position and the cost of being sure is relatively cheap, we don't have the kind of capacity to invest $100 million-plus in NBS right now, or anything that's meaningful like that, to generate higher returns without blowing our duration target. Operator And our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Good morning. Just a quick question on loan growth. You've had another decent quarter of good growth in residential mortgage. Looking at cross consumer, is there anywhere where you've had to open up the credit box in order to get growth there? I know you mentioned that loan yields are expected to be tight on competition and not increase as much. But, have you had to go down market at all for loan growth? No, we haven't. As we talked about before, a while ago we made some surgical changes to our credit box in the car space, but that's -- if anything, I would say incredibly granular and incredibly surgically tightening, not the reverse. Whether that's in card, certain microcells, or in auto, I would say we've been pretty conservative and we're probably doing at the very margin a little bit of tightening. Operator Good morning. Could you talk a bit more about the timing of return of excess capital? Of course, one of your national competitors has given a very detailed strategy of how to do this by the end of 2019. Are you in a situation to adopt a similar strategy? Congratulations to them if they have a high degree of confidence of what 2018 cards are going to look like. I will tell you this, we said very clearly that we feel that the company should operate with the range of 11-12.5%. We feel like it should be lower in that range. Having a capital plan approved of $19.4 billion of share buybacks over the next four quarters and over 100% payout based on analyst estimates is a thought. Nothing has changed about that objective, but we would want to be measured about the pace at which we do it until we have a bit more final clarity on what the new generation of capital rules will look like. We hopefully will know more as we go into the next cycle of capital planning. We haven't changed our point of view that we should be able to continue that journey down into the range. That would be our objective. To tell you that we could give you the roadmap for that today is not accurate. You can and have done your own math. You can look at our earnings outlook in your models and payouts of over 100% and you can see that we can move down in that same timeframe to something much lower than we are now, if not toward the bottom. But, that's not to say that we will be able to do that. We need to go through the cut. Fair enough. Thanks. [Inaudible -- crackling connection] [00:59:55] is high on everybody's minds. I think they once focused on the impact on research, but there are more implications on how that might impact the trading -- not just from your point of view, but also from the point of view of clients who might not be compliant by the end of the year. How does that weigh on your mind and what impacts could we expect there? I think I got that. The compliance burden and work to be ready is a significant heaviness, not just for us, but all market participants. There is the possibility that, effective at the beginning of the year, there will be ongoing work that needs to get done. We feel like we're really well positioned to defend our position. But, there's no doubt that, over the course of the year and beyond, as people get clearer and clearer on transparency and costs to execute versus advice versus content, that there may be competitive dynamics that change. We feel like we've been building for the last several years to be ready for those dynamics. There could be some bumps. I don't think it's anything that we're concerned about at this point. We'll all learn a little more as we go through 2018. Operator And our next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Thanks. Good morning. About the credit -- you pulled out and highlighted auto after we went through an episode of possible deterioration. You put that together with energy and what we experienced last year. Those are our first two pressure points on the credit cycle. We've come through without any real heartburn from either. Does that tell us something about the de-risking and underwriting discipline that the banks, in particular, have adopted since the financial crisis? I would say that for sure has to be part of it. Even with the auto situation, you're seeing a marketplace that is much more responsive. While we felt like we got ahead of the issues and tightened early, you see the industry generally moving in that direction. I think there's no doubt that the environment, in totality -- the capital liquidity controls regulation has led to higher quality loan books. We have been pressure tested. Energy was a one-in-a-hundred-year flood. I think the industry, and specifically our portfolio, performed quite well. That's not to say there isn't a point of pain out there somewhere that we don't see. We just feel like we're in a good position to get through that. Flipping over to deposit growth, what we saw is layered deposits and institutional deposits, corporate deposits, and retail deposits. We're starting to see a little bit of a pressure in the sense that institutional deposits and wealth management began to decline. Corporate and retail still show a lot of strength. Just think about that dynamic because that's where you really begin to see pressure on betas -- typically when you pressure on volumes. We just haven't seen it in the core deposit base yet. A premium for liquidity that's been kind of pushed into those core customers from corporate and retail seems to be pretty persistent, which will mean the duration and the length and the growth of deposits will be much longer than we probably anticipated before? Yes. I will tell you are seeing that rotation start. If you go back even three years ago, we gave you an outline of what we thought would happen. We said we were going to see rotations from the higher wealth segment into investments assets, followed ultimately by the consumer space. We'll see retail deposits move into money funds. We'll see outflows of wholesale loan op deposits as the fed shrinks its balance sheet. But those things are going to pay out over the course of the next -- depending on the rate cut -- two to four years. We've begun to see it. It should be expected. I don't think it tells us anything new or different necessarily at this point. Operator And our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Hi, a follow-up question. Card revenues are tracking well per your other comments, but year-over-year card spend growth has moderated some. Can you talk about the trend with the Sapphire Reserve card? Our card spend growth at 13% up year-on-year is still very strong. When we say moderated, it's from very strong to very strong. It is in part due to the number of new products we've had. The Sapphire Reserve card spend engagement is very strong. We're very pleased with it. I wouldn't say it's a moderation necessarily. It's just that at these very high levels -- from a slightly higher to very strong is still a great story. And it was such a great deal a year ago. What's the attrition like with the customers? If you think about our first acquisitions were in August and September, so we're kind of at the early stages. So far, very encouraging. So far, better than our expectations. But, a little early to draw firm conclusions on it, but very encouraging. Operator And we have no further questions at this time. Okay. Thank you, everyone. ...

    JP Morgan Chase Co Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call Transcript (JPM) -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,10192017,Fool,10122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. At the 2013 economic conference in Davos, Switzerland, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan analogized the bank's predicament to a mountain climbing competition in which the bank was weighed down by a 250-pound backpack. He was referring to the tsunami of costs that washed over the bank in the wake of the financial crisis. At one point, Bank of America estimated that the crisis had cost it nearly $200 billion in legal costs and loan charge-offs. The Bank of America building in Dallas, Texas, towers over Dealey Plaza.

Over the past two quarters, Bank of America's efficiency ratio has come in below 60%, better than even the notoriously efficient Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). In fact, you'd be hard pressed to find any non-regulatory remnants from the crisis anywhere in Bank of America's financial documents. The only place you are likely to come across them is in its ""All Other"" unit, a non-operating unit that houses, among other things, $77 billion worth of residential mortgages and home equity loans dating back to the pre-crisis period. Paradoxically, it's a trend in this business segment that's so auspicious for Bank of America. Image source: Bank of America. Over the past year, the bank's average total loans and leases have increased by only $17 billion, growing from $901 billion in the third quarter of last year up to $918 billion in the third quarter of this year. One reason the total figure grew so little, at 1.9%, is because the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank had to absorb a $28 billion decline in loans in the bank's All Other segment that either matured or were written off. Excluding that, the growth rate in Bank of America average total loans would have more than doubled. The good news is that, relatively soon, the loans in Bank of America's All Other unit will dwindle so far that the portfolio's run-off will no longer have a material impact on the growth rate of the bank's total loans. As you can see in the chart above, the nation's second biggest bank by assets has $77 billion in loans in its All Other unit today. But at the current pace of the portfolio's run-off, it could be gone within three years. In sum, assuming that the economy doesn't descend into a recession, Bank of America appears positioned to grow its loan portfolio at an increasing pace for the foreseeable future. ","

Daniel Sparks,10192017,Fool,10122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Three tech juggernauts surfaced with some intriguing stories last week. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) helped further the increasing domination of mobile technologies, as Apple's mobile payments gained significant traction and as Facebook announced mobile food delivery. In addition, PayPal Holdings' (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock came into the limelight, as its surging price helped the financial technology company's market capitalization surpass major credit card player American Express. Here's a quick look at why these stories matter. Apple Pay. Image source: Apple. ""According to Forrester, by 2021, mobile payments volume in the U.S. will triple,"" said Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) lead of virtual channels, Jim Smith, last week. ""Our customers are increasingly using mobile to manage their finances and make payments, which makes it ever important for Wells Fargo to provide our more than 20 million mobile banking and mobile wallet customers with a seamless mobile authentication and access experience at our ATMs, online, and in our branches."" To this end, Wells Fargo announced it is rolling out near-field communication (NFC) functionality at 5,000 of its ATMs across the U.S. By 2019, the company plans for all of its 13,000 ATMs to support the technology. The technology will work with Apple Pay, Android Pay, and other major mobile wallets. The move is a major endorsement for Apple Pay, the world's leading NFC-based payment technology. Already accounting for 90% of NFC transactions on mobile, this will help increase Apple Pay's rapid adoption globally. The news comes just before Apple is adding a new major feature to Apple Pay, called Apple Pay Cash, which will allow person-to-person payments. Apple Pay's ongoing adoption at retailers and ATMs will likely make users more inclined to use this new Apple Pay feature. Ahead of its third-quarter earnings report this week, and following an analyst upgrade on the stock, PayPal stock climbed 4% last week. The stock's gain during the week brings PayPal stock's total year-to-date return to an incredible 74%. PayPal's soaring stock price brought the mobile-payments company's market capitalization to about $82.6 billion by the end of the week, notably ahead of credit card company American Express' $81.1 billion market cap. The milestone highlights the success of mobile payments and the Street's increasing bullishness on fast-growing financial technology platforms. PYPL Market Cap data by YCharts In PayPal's most recent quarter, the company reported an 18% and 27% year-over-year rise in revenue and earnings per share, respectively. Investors will be looking for strong growth to persist when the company reports earnings on Thursday. Facebook closed out the week with a surprising announcement that it's rolling out the ability to order food for takeout or delivery on iOS, Android, and desktop across all of the United States. Facebook said that by offering this as a feature within Facebook, the company is taking the next logical step after enabling users to read reviews of nearby restaurants and to see what their friends are saying about them. Facebook is approaching food delivery with a partnership strategy instead of trying to reinvent the wheel. The company will use existing food-ordering services, including EatStreet, Delivery.com, Door, and Dash. The service builds on the company's efforts to make Facebook much more than a place to communicate, but also a place to connect with businesses and make transactions. Check back at the end of the week for more updates on the top tech stories. ","

                                    is not a standard bank – or at least not a bank in a standard situation. Just a few weeks ago, several members of Congress raked the bank’s CEO, Tim Sloan, over the coals for the ongoing customer fraud scandals that have engulfed the bank for over a year. “At best you were incompetent, at worst you were complicit. And either way you should be fired,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the populist Democrat from Massachusetts, told Sloan. Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, asked Sloan why regulators shouldn’t simply shut down the bank, a question Sloan struggled to answer. Read: ‘What in God’s name were you thinking?’ senators grill Wells Fargo CEO But on the bank’s third-quarter earnings call Friday, equity analysts took a completely different tone. In fact, it took over half an hour for the call’s sole “sales practices” question, from Matthew O’Connor of Deutsche Bank, to emerge. “Tim, so you’ve been CEO now for about a year,” O’Connor began. “A year and a day, I think,” Sloan cut in. “Maybe two, I don’t know. It seems like forever, Matt.” O’Connor pressed on. “So now that you’ve been there for some time, do you feel like you’ve identified all of the issues related to – just call it sales practices and tactics that have become headline issues for the stock and obviously weight on results as well? Do you feel like you’ve identified those issues?” There’s an obvious logic to O’Connor’s question. The bank’s scandal first surfaced in Oct. 2016, when it announced a settlement with regulators for the customer abuses. Then-CEO John Stumpf went to Capitol Hill to answer for illegally opening nearly two million customer accounts. The bank made leadership changes, including terminating Stumpf and elevating Sloan. It also began to reach out to customers to offer restitutions, and to train and streamline the management team for the retail division. But then this summer, Wells Fargo disclosed that it had discovered that the number of unauthorized account openings was nearly double the original count. And a New York Times investigation determined that the bank’s shady customer practices extended to forcing unneeded auto insurance on hundreds of thousands of customers without their knowledge — a practice which caused many to overdraw their accounts, pay excessive fees, or even have their cars repossessed. Earlier this month, several senators asked Sloan a version of the question O’Connor posed, but most felt they didn’t get a satisfactory response. “‘I’m not familiar’ is not an answer we should be hearing,” Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, told Sloan toward the end of the hearing. “I do not hear a level of culture change that satisfies me today and I think that’s something that’s very problematic for Wells Fargo going forward.” On the earnings call, Sloan’s immediate response to O’Connor had a ring of corporate PR-speak (Wells’ actual PR department declined to comment to MarketWatch.) “Well, Matt, we’ve been working very hard to identify all issues. I’m very pleased with the progress,” Sloan began, before catching himself. “Obviously, I’m not necessarily pleased that if you find something, it sometimes is not particularly positive. But we’ve made a commitment to look through everything. And be very disclosive and appreciate that that can create a headline, and weigh on the company and stock and team members and other stakeholders but we’ve made a lot of progress. I can’t commit to you, Matt, that we’ve finished everything because things are still in progress. But we’re very far along.” It’s worth noting that Wells Fargo’s stock has lost nearly 3% in the year to date, a period in which a broad basket of bank stocks included in the KBW Bank Index

The rest of the analysts on the earnings call seemed to have moved on. There were no other questions about the “sales practices” — even when there was one. “Your primary checking account customers have essentially been flat over the last year,” Saul Martinez, an analyst with UBS, began. “That compares to the sort of mid- to high-single digits historically,” Martinez continued, “and it’s really decelerated since the second quarter of last year. At some point, does it suggest that maybe you do have to start to become a little bit more aggressive in terms of deposit pricing on the retail side as well?” It fell to Wells Fargo’s CEO to remind Martinez that there were other reasons why customers may have shied away from his bank over the past twelve months. “I think the reason for that is because we’ve been through and are going through a transformation in our retail business,” Sloan began. “And when you think about how the sales practices settlements and related reputational impact affected our team and our customers, particularly in the third and the fourth quarter.” After some more discussion of the “fundamental changes” at the bank, he concluded, “I mean, just there’s been so much going on.” Read: Where was KPMG, Wells Fargo’s auditor, while the funny business was going on?

Andrea Riquier,10192017,MarketWatch,10122017,"4 Min Read NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday following upbeat economic data and gains in technology shares, pushing the Dow and the S&P 500 to a fifth straight week of gains. Data showed U.S. retail sales jumped in September, and the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index hit its highest since January 2004. Another report showed consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in eight months as hurricanes Harvey and Irma boosted demand but underlying inflation remained muted. Netflix (NFLX.O) shares closed 1.9 percent higher after hitting an intraday record high at $200.82 on a slew of price target increases ahead of its earnings report on Monday. Apple (AAPL.O), up 0.6 percent, gave the S&P 500 its biggest boost, while the S&P technology index .SPLRCT was up 0.5 percent. Shares of big banks were mixed following reports from Bank of America and Wells Fargo. “We’re seeing a continuation of the strength in the market combined with low volatility. There seems to be money searching for stocks and looking for investments, simply because the momentum is still positive,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “Also we’re entering a seasonal period where it’s difficult to fight the tape. So I imagine there’s cash coming in off the sidelines.” The CBOE volatility index .VIX remains at historically depressed levels, closing at 9.61 on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 30.71 points, or 0.13 percent, to end at 22,871.72, and the S&P 500 .SPX gained 2.24 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,553.17. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 14.29 points, or 0.22 percent, to 6,605.80, a record closing high. For the week, the Dow was up 0.4 percent and the S&P 500 was up 0.2 percent. The Nasdaq rose 0.2 percent for the week, registering a third week of gains. Bank of America (BAC.N), the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, rose 1.5 percent after the lender’s profit topped estimates due to higher interest rates and a drop in costs. But Wells Fargo (WFC.N) tumbled 2.8 percent after it reported lower-than-expected revenue for the fourth straight quarter due to a decline in mortgage banking revenue. The reports from the Wall Street banks kicked off the third-quarter earnings season, with investors hoping profit growth will help justify valuations after a rally that has sent the S&P 500 up about 14 percent so far this year. Also limiting the day’s gains, the healthcare sector .SPXHC was down 0.3 percent as health insurers and hospital operators tumbled on news that President Donald Trump scrapped billions of dollars in Obamacare subsidies to private insurers for low-income Americans. Centene (CNC.N) sank 3.3 percent, Molina Healthcare (MOH.N) dropped 3.4 percent and Anthem (ANTM.N) fell 3.1 percent. Tenet Healthcare (THC.N) dropped 5.1 percent and Community Health System (CYH.N) declined 4 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.43-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.08-to-1 ratio favored decliners. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 6.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Upbeat earnings reports from banks and the highest consumer-sentiment reading in 13 years supported modest buying. Against that backdrop, the Trump administration said it won’t certify Iran’s compliance with a 2015 nuclear agreement, declaring Tehran a regime that continues to sponsor terrorism and alleging that Iran “intimidated international expectations” sent to inspect it from building up nuclear armaments. Trump laid out a new strategy to deal with Iran and warned that he could cancel U.S. participation in the nuclear pact at any time. The strategy includes placing additional sanctions on the Iran regime to block its “financing of terror,” said Trump. The president also ended billions of dollars in subsidies to insurers under the Affordable Care Act program. The White House said the government can’t lawfully make the payments as there is no appropriation for them. What did the data show? The consumer-price index rose 0.5% in September, the second increase in a row and the largest in eight months. However, economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 0.6%. Stripping out volatile food and energy costs, core CPI rose at a much smaller 0.1% rate. A reading on retail sales showed a rise of 1.6% in September, reflecting the largest increase in 2½ years, coming in line with Wall Street expectations. The University of Michigan’s preliminary reading of the consumer-sentiment index for October came in at 101.1, marking its highest level since 2004.

Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said the weaker than expected inflation report reinforced the view that the Fed will take a more tempered approach to tightening monetary policy, even if the central bank appears committed to hiking rates in December. “The weaker than expected inflation results set the stage for some risk taking,” he said. “As long as we have reasonable economic growth with low inflation than the path of least resistance is higher,” he continued.

                                    shares, which plummeted 35% after the announcement, were down over 50% in Thursday trading. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts say there was a “poor response” to the Labor Day delivery, particularly woven tops. And with items normally for sale for eight weeks, both September and October were hurt. See also:  Artificial intelligence will be important this holiday shopping season even if shoppers don’t know it “A one-two punch of poor selling new product and slow-moving markdowns should lead to elevated discounting, a rarity for J. Jill that could jeopardize customer willingness to pay full-price in the future,” the note said. SunTrust downgraded J. Jill to hold from buy, and slashed its price target to $7 from $16. J. Jill’s Chief Executive Paula Bennett said in a statement that the company is “reacting quickly” and should “regain momentum,” but SunTrust is cautious. Read:  How Nordstrom is changing the department store game “While we are cautiously optimistic regarding improvements, we believe that it typically takes more than one quarter to recover merchandising missteps,” analysts said. RBC Capital Markets also downgraded J. Jill, to sector perform from outperform, citing a lack of clarity about the future. Its price target was halved to $7 from $14. “While execution missteps are being called out for the slowdown, the second consecutive guidance miss suggests a lack of visibility to J. Jill’s earnings algorithm, with comps now negative on the company’s superior 15% earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization margins,” the note said. J. Jill began trading in March. Wells Fargo analysts led by Ike Boruchow note that the second quarter was “choppy,” with this latest announcement showing a swift deceleration. “The real issue is that following their recent IPO, the J. Jill story was predicated on sustainable, steady mid-single-digit-to-high-single-digit comp growth and margin expansion, meaning that something may have gone very wrong over the past six months,” Wells Fargo said. Wells Fargo rates J. Jill stock market perform with a $10 price target. Also: Here’s why flagship stores for retailers like Apple and Starbucks have become tourist attractions Analysts at Cowen & Company maintained their optimism, and their outperform rating, despite the gloomy news. However, they cut the price target to $9 from $12. “We believe J. Jill is well-positioned to gain market share and consistently execute to drive comps and leverage margins over the long term,” analysts wrote. They cite four reasons for optimism: sales channels are varied, with 43% attributed to direct sales, mostly e-commerce; a “prudent” store base of 274; a large, wealthy, loyal, and tech-savvy target shopper; and decision-making that relies on data. “We are hopeful that J. Jill can quickly improve their product and marketing strategy before holiday, and this is possible given they have 12 deliveries each year, which is a strategy to mitigate a past miss,” the note said. “However, we do note that overall retail environment pressures of negative store traffic, aggressive promo environment across the mall and department store channels, increasing competition in the apparel space from online pure-plays, and volatile weather could be structural headwinds.” J. Jill shares are down more than 60% for the last three months while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF

 ,10192017,MarketWatch,10122017,"CNET también está disponible en español. Don't show this again Moves by rivals AT&T and T-Mobile raise the question of whether Verizon needs to offer a video perk, even as customers flock back to its unlimited plan. Verizon remains surprisingly resilient, adding 603,000 retail postpaid  customers in the third quarter. AT&T dangles HBO and the promise of ""Game of Thrones"" when you sign up. T-Mobile throws in Netflix for its family plan customers. Where's the Verizon entertainment bundle? The New York telecommunications company has waded into the media world with its acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo, but those deals are more about delivering advertisements, not video. It also has an investment in digital media company AwesomenessTV, which has a following among younger viewers. Then there's Go90, a free mobile video service -- that hardly anyone watches. That puts Verizon at a disadvantage if you happen to be looking for some sort of media throw-in with your plan. And let's face it, you're spending more of your time on your phone watching video. Consumers on average spend nearly half an hour each day watching videos on their phones, according to media agency Zenith. Just wait until the second season of ""Stranger Things"" comes out. Video has become the latest weapon in the carriers' battle for your business. Yet even as things stand, Verizon remains surprisingly resilient, adding 603,000 retail postpaid customers -- or people who pay at the end of the month and generally have higher bills and stick around longer -- in the third quarter. That follows a rebound in the second quarter that was helped by the reintroduction of an unlimited-data plan. As such, Verizon CFO Matt Ellis doesn't believe the company needs to throw in any video perks. He noted the still low customer turnover rate (known in the industry as churn). ""We can have good churn without bundling any offering,"" he said on a conference call with investors on Thursday. Verizon's postpaid growth got some help from the addition of 91,000 new tablets and 238,000 new wearables and other connected devices. The company added a net 274,000 new phone customers in the period. Beyond video, the extras have flown fast and furious. Sprint offers a year of service for free (excluding taxes and fees), and its prepaid arm Virgin Mobile boasts an all-iPhone lineup with a rate of $1 for the first year of service. In addition to the bundling of free HBO, AT&T offers its DirecTV Now streaming video service at a discount when bundled with a phone plan. The lack of an online video service is hitting Verizon's home entertainment business. The company lost 18,000 Fios video connections, although it added 66,000 Fios internet connections. Many traditional pay TV providers are starting to feel the sting of competitive online video offers and the rise of ""cord-cutters"" who ignore traditional cable in favor of streaming video. Verizon is considering its own full-blown video-streaming service, comparable to DirecTV Now or Sling TV, CEO Lowell McAdam told Bloomberg last month. Ellis, speaking on the call, said that Verizon doesn't want to launch a me-too product and that it would continue to look for ways to offer a different product built around live programming. ""How and when is still TBD,"" he said. For now, the unlimited data offer seems to be keeping things stable. Verizon reported a third-quarter net profit of $3.7 billion, or 89 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, it earned 98 cents a share. Revenue rose 2.5 percent to $31.7 billion. Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings of 98 cents a share and revenue of $31.45 billion, according to Yahoo Finance. Verizon shares rose 2.4 percent to $49.80 in premarket trading.

Ryan Knutson,10192017,MarketWatch,10122017,"Published: Oct 18, 2017 11:33 a.m. ET By Verizon Communications Inc. is scheduled to report third-quarter results before the market opens Thursday. Here's what you need to know: EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts are expecting adjusted earnings of 98 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters, down from $1.01 a share in the year-ago period. REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts estimate revenue of $31.5 billion, a 1.7% increase from a year ago. WHAT TO WATCH: PAY-TV SUBSCRIBER COUNT: AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. both recently blamed the hurricanes in Florida and Texas, in addition to competition and cord-cutting, for pay-TV subscriber losses. Verizon's results may help shed light on how much cord-cutting is actually accelerating industrywide. Verizon, with about 4.7 million pay-TV subscribers, doesn't have any customers in Texas or Florida. But it does face the same competition from streaming services like Netflix and Hulu. Verizon's pay-TV customer base has stayed relatively flat the past two years. Analysts at Wells Fargo expect Verizon will add about 5,000 video subscribers. WIRELESS COMPETITION: Promotions around the latest iPhone have been much softer than in previous years, and rivals have been quietly raising prices. That should benefit Verizon, which is the largest carrier by subscribers. Monthly cancellations, or churn, is likely suppressed in part because the high end iPhone X doesn't go on sale until later this year, and customers are more likely to switch carriers when buying a new device. Average analyst expectations are that Verizon will net 445,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter, according to Wells Fargo. That would be roughly in line with the 442,000 the company netted last year. COST CUTTING: As a mature business in a saturated market, Verizon increasingly looks to find profit by spending less. Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said last month that Verizon is aiming to cut $10 billion in costs over the next four years by moving to zero-based budgeting. Expect the company to share more details about where those costs will come from. CONTENT DEAL: In September, Mr. McAdam said the company would likely announce a content deal by the end of the month. But the end of the month came and went, and there has been no announcement. Mr. McAdam said the company is putting together content deals that would play across both mobile and Fios pay-TV.

                                   plunged into a bear market in a lone trading session on Oct. 19 that year, in what would later be described as the single-most horrendous panic-induced selling in Wall Street’s history. Here are some of the voices from that infamous day of trading. “When I got to work that day, standing on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and organizing my work, I realized there would be a tidal wave of blood hitting the United States,” recollects Kenny Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities. The culprit in Polcari’s view was the unintended consequences of everyone buying the same hedging products. One of those main products was portfolio insurance designed to protect investors from unexpected falls in the market. A rules-based automated strategy, structured to buy Treasurys and sell stock futures when markets fell to protect investors’ portfolios, instead exacerbated the very fall from which it was supposed to protect, he said. See:  Here’s one key factor that amplified the 1987 stock-market crash “It was the first big failure of technology in the market, and a massive human failure, because no one questioned what the computer told them to do,” said Polcari said. Read: 30 years after Black Monday, could stock market crash again? Also see: What would ETFs do in a 1987-style stock-market crash? Polcari, who was 26 years old at the time, vividly remembers the days leading up to that fateful Monday. “Trading [in the preceding three days] was very heavy, and the types of orders were different. Three days of heaviness, three days of getting kicked in the gut and listening to the other guys—my mentors—who were saying something felt different,” Polcari said. “We were getting orders to sell 150,000 of Johnson & Johnson [shares], when there were five other sellers of the same quantity. There was not one buy order. Everything was a sell order,” Polcari said. “There was absolutely not a single person saying it was a buying opportunity. On that day it was sheer panic,” Polcari said. On the Chicago Board Options Exchange, volumes in the S&P 500 options contracts spiked on Friday, Oct. 16, due to expiration of monthly options but also offering a whiff of what was to come. “There were incredibly immense volumes and we were down big and the market overall looked bad,” said J.J. Kinahan, currently chief strategist at TD Ameritrade but who at the time was a 24-year old trader in the CBOE’s S&P 100 options pit, known as OEX. By Monday, the situation in the pit turned really ugly. “There were grown men crying in the pit as their entire world unraveled. Some men lost everything they had ever worked for,” Kinahan said. Scott Wren, who was a 27-year old currency trader at that time, remembers a strange day, saying he was happy he was trading currencies and not stocks or stock futures. “Currency markets stood still on that day and the dollar did not move for hours, as people stopped trading,” said Wren, now senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “By the end of that day, by 3 p.m., we were in disbelief—how can a stock market be down so much in one day?” “I was holding my breath, just like everyone else at the firm I was working in,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. “At the time, as a broker I remember telling clients to hold tight and not sell, because there was no fundamental reason to sell,” Cardillo said. But many clients didn’t want to sit tight. “Because we were involved in portfolio insurance we knew what was causing the drop—this was a true case where there were more sellers than buyers,” said Diane Jaffee, currently senior portfolio manager at TCW, who was working as a young analyst at Kidder Peabody in 1987. “We were all crowded around the Quotron terminals, watching prices moving lower and lower and nobody knew why they were moving lower,” Jaffee said. In the days before Bloomberg machines and other modern terminals, many brokers relied on Quotron machines, which only had the latest price of a stock or index. “By that fateful Friday, we were 100% out of stocks and our clients were happy not to have lost money in the market over the next few days. But to some degree it was scary to be out of the market and we probably waited a bit too long to get back in,” Jaffee said. Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

Ryan Vlastelica,10192017,MarketWatch,10122017,"Gaye LeBaron is a columnist for the Press Democrat in Santa Rosa, Calif. Sonoma County, Calif., is 1,550 square miles of valleys circled by coast range mountains. Two of its nine cities — the largest, Santa Rosa (population 175,000) and its neighbor to the southeast, Sonoma (population 10,600) — spent 10 days under siege from wildfires that have, at last count, destroyed 6,700 structures, most of them single-family homes. Sonoma, once a Mexican pueblo and mission, is generally regarded as a cradle of California history. Santa Rosa is the county seat, central to an agricultural region that has been known in the past three decades as ""wine country."" It is a border town, an ""edge"" city, separating the densely populated San Francisco Bay Area from the rural northern counties. It is an area with a population proud of its landscape. Citizens have allocated tax money for ""forever wild"" land for more than a decade. Many of the hilltops still smoldering around the towns are burning in state parkland, nature preserves and designated open spaces. Nature had actually provided Santa Rosa with a warning that went unheeded. In 1964, a similar fire burned the same path from Calistoga in northern Napa County over the Mayacamas Mountains, along Mark West Creek, heading west and veering into a kind of wind tunnel that sped up the flames, propelling them all the way to town. What makes this fire different is the scope of it and the fact that the ensuing half-century has placed so much development in its path. In 1964, there were very few houses in the area that burned. As the city limits extended and the population increased by 135,000, the open land in that earlier fire corridor became a destination for developers. Fountaingrove Ranch, directly north of the city, had been in its 100-year history a utopian community, with several hundred acres of vineyards producing prized wine. The last owner of the 2,000-acre ranch began selling off the acreage not long after the 1964 fire. The first sale was welcomed by the town — it resulted in a campus-style complex built by computer pioneer Hewlett-Packard. The rest of the property changed hands frequently, each new owner with his own ideas — two hotels, a golf course and finally a tract of imposing two-story homes crowded on 60-by-100-foot lots. A sudden wave of regional prosperity occasioned by the arrival of a cluster of telecommunications companies brought a new, young moneyed class of homebuyers. Bigger homes were built on larger parcels in the open land to the north — land that had burned 40 years before. While it is still closed to viewers, we know that almost all of this is gone now, leaving a core of older citizens, pioneers of the embryo environmental movement of the time, to think: ""We told you it was a bad idea."" And indeed they did. In the 1990s, when the last of Fountaingrove was being sold off, a persistent core of protesters turned up at contentious late-night hearings, arguing for preservation of the remaining ranch as parkland and against a parkway deemed necessary for easy access. But in the eagerness to embrace this addition to the city's economic life in the lean years of the 1990s, certain rules were overlooked, as city planners and engineers would later admit. One was a ridge-top ordinance that prohibited development on the hills surrounding the Santa Rosa Valley. It had been in place for several years but seems to have been forgotten. We will certainly hear more about it now, and about climate change and history repeating itself, when the plans for rebuilding come before our civic leaders. The conversations have, in fact, already begun, even as the fires are still burning. Elsewhere in the country, we can expect similar conversations in Houston and in San Juan and in the next community to be visited by disaster in what has been a season of them. The environmental movement in Sonoma County is an embryo no longer. Since the early '90s, there has been an open-space district that funds protective land purchases. Citizens organizations such as the Land Trust, Landpaths, Conservation Action are all powerful in a county where housing was already expensive and in short supply. The political landscape has changed as much as the physical one. We will need more wisdom going forward. Santa Rosa's — and all of Sonoma County's — future is at issue. The ill winds, blowing cinders in all directions and sending fireballs big enough to contain burning tree limbs across four lanes of freeway traffic, have blown us no good. But of one thing we can be certain: We have entered a before-and-after zone. In future years we will view our history through a screen of the smoke and flames of October 2017. Things will happen ""before the fire"" and ""after the fire"" and those who are here today will understand.

Mike Murphy,10192017,MarketWatch,10122017,"Published: Oct 18, 2017 7:09 a.m. ET Utility company under investigation in devastating Wine Country blazes By PG&E Corp., Northern California’s largest public utility, should be broken up if it is found to be at fault for the devastating wildfires that swept across Wine Country, a state senator said Tuesday. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that state Sen. Jerry Hill — whose district includes San Bruno, which suffered a deadly gas explosion and fire from a PG&E natural gas pipeline in 2010 — said PG&E may need to be held accountable. “If we find that in this particular case —and we don’t know the cause yet — then frankly I don’t think PG&E should do business in California anymore,” Hill said, according to the Chronicle. “They’ve crossed the line too many times. They need to be dissolved in some way, split.” PG&E

                                    has been found responsible for wildfires in the past, most notably a 1994 blaze in California’s Sierra Nevada foothills, in which it was found liable for 739 counts of criminal negligence for failing to properly trim trees near power lines. Earlier this year, PG&E was fined $8.3 million for a deadly fire in Northern California that burned more than 500 homes in 2015. The causes of the destructive swarm of wildfires that have burned swaths across Northern California for more than a week are not yet known, but there have been reports that downed power lines and exploding electrical transformers may have been responsible. California’s Public Utilities Commission and Cal Fire, the state’s firefighting agency, are both looking into PG&E’s possible role in the fires. PG&E Chief Executive Geisha Williams told the Chronicle that it was too early to cast blame. “It’s very, very early days, and it’s a bit of a chicken-and-egg,” Williams said. “What we don’t know is, did our equipment start the fire, or did the fire damage the equipment?” Firefighters have made significant progress against the fires, with six of the seven Wine Country blazes more than 50% contained as of Tuesday night. At least 41 people have been killed, and almost 250,000 acres have burned in the past week-plus, including more than 3,000 homes. Property losses in Wine Country are expected to total in the billions of dollars. PG&E shares have plunged 17% since Oct. 11, when the PUC investigation was announced. Shares jumped 7.5% Tuesday after a Monday report that an arson suspect had been arrested in Sonoma County. However, that arrest was in relation to a fire that started Sunday, and appeared unrelated to the earlier, far bigger blazes. The company’s stock has been downgraded by Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan over the past week. PG&E’s market cap stood at about $29.5 billion Tuesdays, and its shares are down 5.4% year to date, compared to the S&P 500’s

Victor Reklaitis,10192017,MarketWatch,10122017,"Published: Oct 13, 2017 9:25 a.m. ET Critical information for the U.S. trading day By It’s Friday the 13th, and the bears surely are ready to see our relentless bull market finally run into a bit of bad luck. The edifice of Obamacare certainly looks haunted, with the Trump administration poised to cut off key payments to health insurers that are worth billions. That would follow yesterday’s executive order that gives a shot in the arm to low-cost plans that are not subject to the Affordable Care Act’s rules. “Trump is going to kill Obamacare, and there is nothing you can do about it,” writes iBankCoin blogger The Fly in his not-at-all-understated take on the turn of events. The former Wall Street broker says he’s neutral on ACA and “would prefer that the insurance and drug rackets be punished to hell via rigorous restrictions,” but he then reveals his cold-blooded trader streak. The main thing now is how to play the 45th president’s push to undo what No. 44 wrought, The Fly says, delivering our call of the day. “What is relevant,” he writes, “is the way we might profit from it. Might I interest you in a little HIIQ?” He’s not alone in sounding bullish about Health Insurance Innovations Inc.

Alessandra Malito,10192017,MarketWatch,10122017,"Published: Oct 19, 2017 12:40 p.m. ET The authors, as well as the characters, are rarely people of color By When it comes to romance novels, people of color are underrepresented, and it isn’t just the characters on the covers or in the pages that lack diversity — it’s the authors too. Only a small percentage of romance novels by major publishers were written by people of color in 2016, according to a recent report on the state of racial diversity in romance publishing by Culver City, Calif.-based brick-and-mortar romance bookstore The Ripped Bodice. The bookstore owners asked publishers to provide their lists. The owners, sisters Bea and Leah Koch, conducted the study after noticing the lack of options available to customers seeking books by people of color. Only three of 20 publishers who reported their statistics had more than 10% of romance books published by people of color, while half of the publishers surveyed had fewer than 5% of their romance books written by people of color. It’s been a problem for a long time,” said Farrah Rochon, a black romance novelist based in New Orleans, who has been in the romance writing business for 10 years. The problem lies in what publishers choose to publish, what bookstores choose to promote, as well as what readers choose to read, she said. Also see:  It’s getting harder for white supremacists to find romance online Diversity in romance novels is similar to another subsection of literature: children’s books. Around 28% of all children’s books are by or about people of color, up from 10% in 1997, according to Lee and Low Books, a multicultural children’s book publisher. The same publisher conducted a study in 2015 and found 80% of more than 40 publishers and review journals self-identified as white. It wasn’t that much of a shock to Harper Miller, another romance author. “It is very rare, and I mean rare, to see people of color represented on the cover, or an author of color’s work being depicted,” she said. Will it change? Yes, the authors said, but it’ll take some time. In the meantime, there are plenty of established authors of color who represent various walks of life and perspectives. Beverly Jenkins, a black author who writes historical romance books with many black characters; Sonali Dev, an Indian author who has published novels focused on Bollywood; Courtney Milan, who includes characters with disabilities and all backgrounds; Rebekah Weatherspoon, a queer black author; and Jeannie Lin, who writes novels focused on Chinese characters, according to WomenWriteAboutComics.com. “Hopefully it will get better,” Rochon said. Why is diversity such a problem in romance novel publishing? There’s a myth that certain types of authors write books that only appeal to certain audiences, such as Asian-American authors writing for Asian-American readers, or gay authors writing for gay readers, said Voda Engstrand, director of communications at Kensington Publishing Corp, the publishing house that had the highest representation of books published by people of color last year (19.8%). Publishers don’t market books by people of color the same way they do other novelists, and sales represent that, the authors said. “It’s awful, but this typecasting of authors and readers happens at every level, and not just within the publishing houses,” she said. “Many bookstores, libraries, reviewers and members of the media — whether consciously or not — look at a book and instantly try to fit it into some mold.” Readers do the same thing, she said. What will it take for the industry to change? Publishers need to embrace more authors of color, Miller said, citing Kensington as one of the few actually making moves in their staffing and publishing. She suggested that publishing houses should revamp their hiring processes as well as how they review submissions. One strategy: start at the college level and reach out to historically black universities to offer paid internships so aspiring authors and editors who want to break into the industry. Stores should market all books by all types of authors, not just best sellers, Miller said. Getting some books publicity and into stores is difficult, and some stores “segregate” their books, Engstrand said. Romance novels written by people of color would go in a multicultural section rather than the romance section. Also see: Why American teenagers are not interested in adult activities like sex, drinking — or working Why does it matter? Romance novels are becoming more popular, and accounted for a quarter of traditional publisher’s e-book sales in the U.S. in 2016, up from 19% in 2010, according to research firm Nielsen. Given that upward trend, the number might be even larger if including self-published novels. Organizations are starting to take note and help resolve the issue. Romance Writers of America, a nonprofit trade association, has a grant for romance authors from historically underrepresented backgrounds to attend its annual conference for development and networking, and recently held a Diversity Summit with industry professionals and romance authors to discuss strategies for improving promotion of books by and featuring people of color. Readers can make a difference too Readers are also responsible for changing the industry, Engstrand and Rochon said. “Every reader who walks into a store and buys a romance novel by an author of color, or goes to their local library and requests a book by Jamie Pope or Sonali Dev or Priscilla Oliveras, or recommends one of these books to their friends — those readers are making change happen,” Engstrand said. By not catering to people of color, this part of the industry is neglecting a much-underserved market. The majority of romance novel readers are white, according to a 2014 online survey of romance readers by book and website Dangerous Books for Girls. About 86% of respondents said they were white, followed by 4% who said they were Asian or Pacific Islander, 3% who said Hispanic or Latino, and 2% who said black or African-American. And yet more than half (57%) said they read romance novels with diverse characters, described as non-white and non-heterosexual, while 20% said no, 28% said they had a hard time finding them and 9% said they would if they knew of them. But diversity in books needs to go beyond representing people of color, Rochon added. “The world is not all white, and man and woman, and able-bodied people,” she said. “That needs to be reflected more.” Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

,10262017,Reuters,10192017,"The report from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) criticized the Wall Street bank for forcing numerous borrowers to buy unneeded auto insurance, as well as for its handling of the problems once they were unveiled, the newspaper reported. (nyti.ms/2yBV90D) The preliminary regulators’ report said that Wells Fargo may have underestimated costs related to reimbursing harmed customers and that the bank’s practices could be curbed or kept under close watch, according to the New York Times report. The OCC uses such reports to build its case against a bank. For weeks, the OCC has contemplated fresh sanctions against Wells Fargo for abusing customers with both insurance and mortgage products, sources have told Reuters. Wells Fargo was slapped with costly lawsuits involving auto insurance and mortgage loans in July, even as the third-largest U.S. bank tries to put a year-old phony accounts scandal behind it. In that scandal, employees were found to potentially have created as many as 3.5 million accounts without customer authorization. OCC spokeswoman Stephanie Collins said the agency does not comment on individual banks or ongoing supervision. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Catherine Pulley said the bank aimed to help any customers who were wrongly charged for car insurance. ","

,10262017,Reuters,10192017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Not every financial firm will be able to reap the benefit of Wall Street’s victory in dismantling the threat of class-action law suits. The U.S. Senate killed a rule late on Tuesday that allowed consumers to band together to sue banks and credit card companies even when the small print of their contracts forced them into closed-door arbitration with their grievances. It was a huge win for banks, who feared a flood of costly lawsuits. But for financial firms already in the spotlight for poor treatment of customers, the bad publicity may make it difficult for them to avoid court. “Every company is not now sitting up and saying ‘let’s take advantage of this.’ It’s more complicated than that. Each does its own cost/benefit analysis,” said Christine Scheuneman, senior partner at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. Equifax initially turned to arbitration clauses in the face of its cyber hack but public pressure and threats from state attorneys general forced it to drop the requirement for 145.5 million consumers affected by the breach. But the bank is fighting some customers in federal court in Utah over their attempts to take legal action against it. “I don’t think that (vote) is going to change our case at all,” said Steven Christensen, an attorney at Christensen Young & Associates who represents the plaintiffs in the Utah case. A hearing on Wells Fargo’s motion to compel arbitration is set for Oct. 31, he said. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment on the case or on how the bank would respond to the Senate move. The agreements offer customers a limited opportunity to opt out of the arbitration requirement. JPMorgan also includes arbitration clauses with auto loans and Citi includes them with its credit card accounts. ","

T-Mobile’s net income was $550 million, or 63 cents a share for the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $366 million, or 42 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Revenue was $10.02 billion, up from $9.31 billion a year earlier. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of 46 cents per share and revenue of $10.01 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares were up 1.6 percent to $61.44 in pre-market trading. The company added 595,000 subscribers who pay a monthly phone bill, down from the 851,000 net additions it reported in the year-earlier period. Analysts at Wells Fargo had expected 646,000. T-Mobile said the increase was less than last year due to more competition in the marketplace, the timing of a new iPhone launch and negative impact from hurricanes. The company said it now expects to add 3.3 million to 3.6 million customers who pay a monthly bill, up from 3 million to 3.6 million. ","

,10262017,Reuters,10192017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc’s quarterly results missed Wall Street estimates as the U.S. No. 2 wireless carrier lost video subscribers to traditional and online TV competitors and fewer of its existing customers upgraded their devices ahead of Apple Inc’s launch of the iPhone X. The battle for the growing market in providing video entertainment on phones has taken on greater importance as AT&T slugs it out with industry leader Verizon Communications Inc and smaller rivals Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc for customers in a saturated wireless market. The company is in the process of buying Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion in an effort to turn itself into a media powerhouse that can bundle mobile service with video. It has said it expects the deal to close by the end of the year. “Bundling of wireless and video, bundling of broadband and video, bundling of broadband, wireless (and) video is definitely the strategy,” Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said on the company’s post-earnings conference call. “We definitely believe that works and definitely believe that can add value for the overall customer base, shareholders and customers alike.” AT&T, which owns satellite television service DirecTV, said it lost 89,000 U.S. video subscribers in the quarter, slightly fewer than the 90,000 it said earlier this month in a regulatory filing, due to intense competition in the traditional pay-TV and online market and the impact of recent hurricanes. In the same filing, AT&T also reported 900,000 fewer handset equipment upgrades than in the year-ago period, which negatively impacted wireless equipment revenue. Analysts have said many consumers are putting off upgrades until the fourth quarter when Apple’s iPhone X is expected to launch. AT&T said it lost 97,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill in the quarter, compared to a loss of 268,000 a year earlier. Wells Fargo analysts had expected a net loss of 100,000. AT&T reported net income of $3.0 billion, or 49 cents a share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30, down from $3.3 billion, or 54 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding some items, it reported earnings of 74 cents. On that basis, analysts on average were expecting earnings of 75 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Its shares dipped 1.64 percent to $34.29 in after-hours trading. Revenue was $39.7 billion, down from $40.9 billion in the year-earlier period. Analysts had expected $40.1 billion, on average. ","

,10262017,Reuters,10192017,"Sources told Reuters this week that T-Mobile and Sprint were laying the groundwork for special committees of their boards of directors to decide on a merger between the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers. T-Mobile and Sprint have tentatively agreed on a range for a stock exchange ratio which, even at its low end, would offer Sprint a modest premium to its current trading price, the sources added. Sprint shares surged 2.2 percent to $7.15 in mid-morning trading. “We continue to believe the market is underestimating upside to Sprint,” said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, in a research note on Wednesday. Analysts at JPMorgan estimated in a note earlier this month that a deal would result in annual synergies of $5 billion to $6 billion, with savings of 30 percent on T-Mobile’s selling, general and administrative expenses and 25 percent of its network costs within three years of closing. Like T-Mobile, which reported earnings on Monday, Sprint declined to elaborate on talk of the merger. Sprint reported net additions of 279,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill in the quarter, driven by a 10 percent increase in gross additions. Analysts at Wells Fargo had expected 225,000 net additions. But churn, or the rate of customer defections, rose to 1.59 percent from 1.37 percent a year ago. “Net net, we do not necessarily view the trade-off between higher churn and higher gross adds as a favorable one,” said Matthew Niknam, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, in a note. The No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier reported a net loss of $48 million, or 1 cent per share, in the second quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to a loss of $142 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier. Net operating revenue was $7.93 billion, down from $8.25 billion in the year-earlier period. According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, analysts had expected a loss of 2 cents a share and revenue of $8.05 billion. ","

,10262017,Reuters,10192017,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - The global economy is on its best roll in years and set to do better in 2018, but economists in Reuters polls around the world mostly said synchronous growth is not about to spawn significant price pressures. Indeed, while several major central banks have shifted their bias away from ultra-easy monetary policy, with a few notable exceptions, inflation remains below their targets and is generally set to stay that way in the year ahead. “It is becoming a familiar refrain. Another quarter, another set of upward revisions to our global growth forecasts, another downward revision to our global inflation forecasts,” said Janet Henry, global chief economist at HSBC. “But for developed world central banks, the task is getting ever harder. Tackling both low inflation and rising financial stability risks will demand a delicate balancing act by central banks and a more nuanced approach to inflation targeting if the global expansion is to be sustained.” In Reuters surveys taken Oct 3-24 of more than 500 economists across Asia, Europe and the Americas, 2017 and 2018 growth forecasts for nearly three-quarters of the 48 economies polled were raised or left unchanged. Global economic growth as a whole is forecast at 3.5 percent this year, steady compared with a poll published three months ago but a tad lower than the recently upgraded view from the International Monetary Fund. While the consensus forecast for 2018 also remained steady at 3.6 percent, a majority who answered an additional question said the risk to their forecasts were skewed more to the upside. However, respondents cut their 2017 inflation forecasts for nearly two-thirds of the economies surveyed. Around 40 percent of the 134 economists who answered an extra question said global inflation pressures won’t pick up until 2019 or beyond while a quarter said they were unlikely to rebound at all. The rest said they will before end-2018. Erik Nelson, a strategist at Wells Fargo in New York, said for their global growth forecasts, which are roughly in line with the Reuters consensus, inflation picking up faster than expected is the number one risk. “If inflation picks up a lot more than we are expecting, either in the United States or other economies, and central banks have to tighten a little more aggressively than we currently think, then there is probably some downside risk for those forecasts,” Nelson said. Global central banks are at different stages in removing monetary policy accommodation, with persistently weak inflation nearly everywhere complicating decision-making. “Low inflation expectations may have become self-fulfilling, so low inflation is likely more persistent than what central banks think,” said Mikael Milhoj, senior analyst at Danske Bank. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates in December and twice next year, according to economists who largely said risks were skewed more to a slower pace of hikes. Uncertainty over who U.S. President Donald Trump will choose to head the Fed when Chair Janet Yellen’s term ends on Feb. 1 has also clouded the outlook. One of the candidates Trump has interviewed and is seriously considering according to reports, former Treasury undersecretary John Taylor, was deemed in a Reuters poll as likely to adopt the most radical change to current policy were he to be appointed. After more than two years of purchases worth over 2 trillion euros in total, the European Central Bank is expected to announce at its meeting on Thursday that it will trim asset purchases to 40 billion euros a month from January and continue buying securities for another six or nine months. The rising risk of a disorderly Brexit won’t deter the Bank of England - the only major central bank dealing with inflation running well above its target - from making what a majority of economists say will be a policy error by raising rates for the first time in a decade on Nov. 2. The Chinese economy, Asia’s largest and the world’s second-biggest, is forecast to expand 6.4 percent next year but faces twin risks of managing its massive debt pile as well as a highly inflated property market. Inflation there is expected to be more muted at 1.6 percent this year, down from last year’s 2.0 percent, due to weak food price rises, but is expected to pick up to 2.2 percent in 2018. Asia’s third-largest economy, India, is predicted to grow 6.7 percent in 2018 - its weakest pace in four years - following disruptions caused by a government currency ban late last year and a new national tax launched in July. And the biggest economy in Latin America, Brazil’s, is likely to outpace Mexico for the first time in five years this year thanks to record-low interest rates. It will grow 2.3 percent in 2018, the poll found. (For other stories from the Reuters global long-term economic outlook polls package) ","

In a press release, the company said the public offering of the depositary shares represents 1/100th interest in a share of its fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock Series F. It has a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share, which is equal to $1,000 per depositary share. Charles Schwab said the company will use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including to redeem Series B Preferred Stock and the depositary shares. Each represents an interest in a share of the Series B Preferred stock, Schwab said in the press release. Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith and Wells Fargo are handling the offering for the San Francisco discount broker. The offering comes days after Charles Schwab declared a quarterly dividend of $0.08 cents a share, in line with the previous quarter's dividend. In a press release last week, the discount brokerage said the dividend will be payable on Nov. 24 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 10. Annualized, the dividend is $0.32 a share and has an annual yield of 0.7 percent. It also weighed in with third-quarter results that were mixed, beating on the EPS front but posting revenue that was short of Wall Street estimates. For the three months ended in September, the discount broker reported earnings per share of $0.42 and revenue of $2.165 billion. Analysts had expected the San Francisco-based brokerage firm to report earnings of $0.41 a share and revenue of $2.9 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Net interest revenue increased 28% to $1.08 billion while revenue from asset management fees jumped 8% to $861 million. During the quarter Schwab was able to open 216,000 new retail brokerage accounts, up 29% from last year’s third quarter. Total client assets increased 17% to $3.18 trillion and core net new assets jumped 72% to $51.6 billion. On the negative side, trading revenue declined 21% to $151 million.

Michael J. Kramer,10262017,Investopedia,10192017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs (Note: The author of this fundamental analysis is a financial writer and portfolio manager.) Bank of America Corp's (BAC) recent trading patterns suggests the stock could be headed higher - by nearly 50 percent - to $40 from its current level of around $27.25, according to a technical analysis.The stock has recently broken out to trading levels not seen since 2009, and if that wasn't enough, the company could be getting a substantial fundamental tailwind in the form of corporate tax cuts and interest rate hikes. Shares of Bank of America have hit resistance levels a number of times around $25.50 since March and recently broke out at the end of September. Strengthening the bull case is how the stock was able to retest the $25.50 and hold strong, helping the shares move even higher.   The chart above shows that shares of Bank of America consolidated, then rallied sharply after the November, 2016 Presidential election. The $25.50 level has served as resistance in the past with the shares testing that level in January. But since September, the stock has risen sharply higher and is currently trading at roughly $27.25. One can derive a price of about $40 for shares of Bank of America based on the next potential area of resistance, which dates back to 2008.   Further supporting the bank's stock is the Trump administration's plan for corporate tax reductions, which could be a huge benefit for the company if they become law. In the latest quarter, the bank had an income tax expense of nearly $2.279 billion on pre-tax income of $7.866 billion, representing an effective tax rate of almost 29 percent. Any reduction in the corporate tax rate would go right to the bottom line, boosting earnings. Additionally, the company had net interest income in the quarter of nearly $11.16 billion, representing 51.1 percent of its revenue for the quarter. Bank of America could generate more revenue in net interest income if the Fed continues to raise rates or push forward with plans to pare its $4.4 trillion balance sheet. Both steps would cause rates to rise. Bank of America has another advantage. It trades at a discount to peers JP Morgan and Wells Fargo based on its price to tangible book value. Currently, shares of Bank of America trade at 1.62 times its tangible book value, which stands at $16.86, according to data from YCharts. Bank of America shares would need to rise to nearly $33 just to trade at parity with the other banks.  BAC Price to Tangible Book Value data by YCharts The strength of Bank of America's stock is a dramatic change from the 2008 financial crisis, when a deteriorating portfolio stemming from two major acquisitions threatened the bank's very existence.

 ,10262017,CNBC,10192017,"Banks, credit card issuers and other financial companies will be able to block customers from banding together to sue over disputes, after the U.S. Senate on Tuesday narrowly killed a rule banning the firms from using ""forced arbitration"" clauses. Republican Vice President Mike Pence appeared on the Senate floor at 10:11 p.m. EDT (0211 GMT) to cast the tie-breaking vote as the chamber's president and approve the most significant roll-back of Obama-era financial policy since President Donald Trump took office vowing to loosen the leash on Wall Street. The final count was 51 to 50. The Republican-dominated House of Representatives has already passed the resolution repealing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule released in July. The resolution also bars regulators from instituting a similar ban in the future. After a signature from Trump, expected soon, the resolution will abruptly end a years-long fight that has included multiple federal regulators, consumer advocacy groups, and financial lobbyists. CFPB Director Richard Cordray, a Democrat appointed by former President Barack Obama, rarely comments on congressional action but on Tuesday night said, ""Wall Street won and ordinary people lost."" ""This vote means the courtroom doors will remain closed for groups of people seeking justice and relief when they are wronged by a company,"" he added. Customers must agree to the clauses as a condition of opening accounts, saying they will take any disputes to closed-door arbitration instead of joining class-action lawsuits, where complainants band together to share litigation costs. The clauses are used for nearly every U.S. consumer product and service since the Supreme Court ruled them legal in 2011. Victims of the Equifax hack were outraged last month when the company included forced arbitration fine print in offering them free credit monitoring. The company later removed the clauses. At the same time, Wells Fargo customers whose identities were used in last year's phony accounts scandal have had difficulty sueing the bank because they are bound by arbitration clauses in contracts they signed for legitimate accounts. The CFPB rule, set to go into effect next spring, was not retroactive and would not have helped Equifax or Wells customers. Members of Trump's administration have relentlessly assailed the regulation, and on Monday the Treasury Department laid out arguments against it in a special report. Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Norieka said on Tuesday the Senate's action stopped a rule ""that would have likely increased the cost of credit for hardworking Americans and made it more difficult for small community banks to resolve differences with their customers."" Meanwhile, major bank lobbying groups who sued last month to block the rule cheered the resolution's passage. One of the groups, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said Congress had reined in the ""overgrown and unaccountable"" CFPB, an independent agency created to protect individuals' finances that conservatives say consistently reaches beyond its authority in its rulemaking. Critics of the rule had said class actions only benefit trial lawyers and arbitration generally wins larger settlement awards for customers. Supporters said forced arbitration harms customers by putting companies in control of the process and taking away the right to sue enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. The CFPB created its rule after conducting a five-year study that found customers struggle to have banks open arbitration cases about their complaints, but that those few cases have led to slightly higher individual awards than class actions. ""The Senate today prevented a cash grab that would have transferred wealth from consumers to the pockets of wealthy attorneys,"" said Ted Frank, director of the center for class-action fairness at the free-market group Competitive Enterprise Institute. Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, the most senior Democrat on the Banking Committee, meanwhile, said Tuesday's vote ""will make the rich richer, and the powerful more powerful.""

Emmie Martin,10262017,CNBC,10192017,"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is one of the wealthiest people in the world, and he keeps getting richer. On Tuesday, Buffett's wealth reached an all-time high, topping $81.5 billion,  Money reports. The Oracle of Omaha's net worth rose even further to $81.6 billion on Wednesday,  according to Bloomberg. He's seen an increase of over $8 billion in the last 12 months alone, and he currently stands as the third richest person on the planet, behind Amazon's Jeff Bezos at No. 2 and his good friend Bill Gates at No. 1. The Nebraska native got started early: He purchased his first stock at age 11. After earning a master's degree from Columbia University in 1951, Buffett bought Berkshire Hathaway in 1962 and took over as CEO, using the textile manufacturer as a holding company. It has since grown to encompass major brands such as Geico and Kraft Heinz. The majority of Buffett's wealth comes from his 18 percent stake in the business, but he also independently owns shares in Wells Fargo, IBM and a few other companies. While reaching the same level of wealth as Buffett himself is near-impossible, there's plenty to learn from his investing style. Here are three tips for growing your wealth, straight from the legend himself. After all, if it worked for him, it could work for you. Buffett decides a business is worth investing in because it will last. He purchased See's Candies with longtime business partner Charlie Munger in 1972 and spent  more than $1 billion on Coca-Cola stock in 1988 — both of which turned out to be good bets and which he still owns today. ""We sort of know it when we see it,""  Buffett said during the the Berkshire Hathaway 2017 Annual Shareholders Meeting. ""It would tend to be a business that for one reason or another we can look out five or 10 or 20 years, and decide that the competitive advantage that it had at the present would last over that period."" Once Buffett makes a purchase, he tends to hold on to it. ""His approach is to be really sure of something before he buys it, and one of the ways he exercises that discipline is to sort of almost never sell. Not never sell, because he does sell stocks, but he sort of says to himself, 'I know I'm almost never going to sell it, I've really got to like it before I get into it,'"" Buffett's biographer Roger Lowenstein, author of ""Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist,""  explained to Yahoo's Alexis Christoforous. No one can predict the ups and downs of the stock market, including top tier investors like Buffett and hedge fund titan Ray Dalio. To truly grow retirement savings, Buffett advises investing in index funds, which he says are ""the thing that makes the most sense practically all of the time."" Index funds hold every stock in an index such as the S&P 500, including big-name companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Google. Because this type of fund is highly diversified, it stays relatively constant and avoids the risk that comes with picking individual stocks. They're also pretty cheap, which maximizes the amount investors take home. Even when choosing low risk options like index funds, there are going to be inevitable highs and lows in the market. But don't let dips scare you out of investing at all. Stay the course, Buffett says, even when you see market fluctuations or a bad headline: ""Keep buying it through thick and thin, and especially through thin. … American business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe is going to do very well.""

Jeff Cox,10262017,CNBC,10192017,"What in the world is happening in corporate America? The past couple of weeks have provided a bevy of embarrassing headlines about some of the country's most prominent companies. Investors last week had to digest a major disappointment from General Electric, while also learning that the problems at Wells Fargo extended beyond the retail banking business and into the investment side, suggesting a companywide culture issue. Yet the market still rambles on, with October shaping up to be one of the best months of the year.  The Dow is up about 4 percent for the month, suggesting that stocks could end the year with some serious momentum. Here's what investors will be munching on this week: As seems to be the case often these days, we'll have to wait until the end of the week for the biggest economic news. On Friday, the government will release its first reading of third-quarter GDP, an accounting of all the goods and services the economy produces. Current estimates vary widely: FactSet figures the number will be around 2.2 percent, the Atlanta branch of the Federal Reserve pegs it closer to 2.7 percent, but the New York Fed sees growth of only around 1.5 percent. This all matters because stocks have surged this year on two principal beliefs: that the economy is going to start running hotter than the 2.1 percent average growth since the Great Recession ended, and that Congress would pass some sort of tax reduction/reform before the year is out. With Washington legislators on the verge of a budget deal (more on that later), economic growth should be coming along as well. This year's rally could hinge largely on that . If profits drive stocks, then this week the market will be in the fast lane. Investors will hear third-quarter earnings reports from 189 members of the S&P 500, the biggest week of the season and one sure to move markets. That group includes 12 of the 30 companies that make up the Dow industrials. So far, earnings season has been pretty ho-hum. About 76 percent of companies reporting so far have beaten Wall Street's bottom-line profit estimates, while 72 percent have exceeded sales expectations, according to FactSet. That's out of 17 percent of the index that has reported so far. While that sounds pretty good, actual profit growth has been pretty tame at 1.7 percent. That's not much for a market that continues to power forward. There has been one interesting change in trend: Recent earnings quarters have seen investors not reward companies much for topping estimates. This quarter, companies beating estimates have risen an average 1.6 percent in the two days after reporting, which is considerably above the long-term average of 1.2 percent, according to Fact Set. If you trade the market, that's an important number. The Senate's move last week to approve a budget for 2018 was a milestone — partisan though it was. It not only represented the breaking of a political logjam when it comes to passing a full annual spending plan, but it sets the stage for getting tax reform done. Many Wall Street pros had begun to dismiss the possibility that the Trump administration would be able to achieve its hopes to cut corporate and personal taxes and reform the tax code before 2017 runs out. That still seems like a lofty goal. But even if Congress can get something down by early 2018, that would be a major development, opening up the possibility of getting true tax reform through for the first time since 1986. Greg Valliere, the astute observer of how Washington and Wall Street tie together, had this to say about the current state of affairs: ""We've been predicting enactment of a bill by spring; now we think late winter is possible. These folks are serious — they want a victory, and they want it fast. Avoiding a House-Senate conference committee is a strong signal that they plan to steamroll a bill through Congress ASAP."" A quicker-than-expected move in Washington could have big market ramifications. We'll close this week on the earnings theme. Getting tax reform through would be great, but for the bull market to really rock on, we'll need to see that companies can keep profits rolling. Michael Arone,  chief investment strategist for U.S. SPDR Business at State Street Global Advisors, sees cracks growing in the earnings foundation that investors need to watch: ""Like many investors, I believe that earnings are the most important determinant for the future path of stock prices. Better earnings certainly have been the major driver of the post-election rally. ""Now, however, earnings growth is decelerating at a time when valuations are stretched, potentially creating a big risk for the market. If tax reform fails to get off the ground while monetary policy conditions tighten and earnings decelerate, it could finally spell the end for the long bull market. ... Investors must prepare to protect portfolios from unexpected and unwelcome risks in the market."" ","Wall Street week ahead: Big news for earnings, the economy and taxes"
Evelyn Cheng,10262017,CNBC,10192017,"China's central bank chief just warned about a potential bubble in China: Rising household debt. ""Regarding household debt levels, China doesn't rank that high on a global scale, but the pace of growth has picked up in the last few years,"" People's Bank of China governor Zhou Xiaochuan said Thursday. He didn't expect any action should be taken immediately but said the debt levels should be monitored for quality and a steady pace of growth. His comments from the sidelines of the 19th National Communist Party Congress notably contrasted with the overall positive tone on China's economy from party officials. The bigger worry about China has been high levels of corporate and local government debt. The Chinese government has spoken about the need to limit that growth, and most analysts expect authorities will gradually rein it in. But this year, household debt has arisen as another area of concern about financial leverage in China.""China's household debt has been rising at an 'alarming' pace over the past two years,"" Citi analyst Li-Gang Liu said in an Oct. 10 note. The report pointed out that outstanding household debt in China has doubled from 29.6 percent of gross domestic product at 16 trillion yuan ($2.41 trillion) in 2012 to 44.3 percent of GDP at 33 trillion yuan last year.Mortgage loans for buying property are the largest driver of that household debt growth, Liu said. Property prices, especially in major Chinese cities, have shot higher as ""the returns on property investment were much higher than interest rates on savings and loans.""During a key address at the twice-a-decade party congress on Wednesday in Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated that ""houses are for living in, not for speculation,"" according to global media reports.""While the comment isn't new, to reiterate it at such an important meeting is highly unusual,"" Larry Hu, head of greater China economics at Macquarie, said in a Thursday note. Hu does not expect the Chinese government to relax its restrictions on property purchases in the next 12 months.In order to prevent speculation from sending property prices even higher, local Chinese governments have implemented policies to restrict purchases such as limiting the number of apartment units someone can own and how soon they can resell them.Soon-to-retire central bank governor Zhou also made headlines Thursday when he said in the same question-and-answer session that excessive optimism could lead to a ""so-called Minsky Moment,"" or a drop in asset prices.The Minsky Moment, named after economist Hyman Minsky, describes the time when a market suddenly collapses after an extended period of speculation or unsustainable gains. On Thursday after Zhou's remarks, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell nearly 2 percent, Dow futures tumbled more than 100 points ahead of the open, and Treasury yields fell.""This is what Zhou says now, but where was this recognition along the way?"" said Leland Miller, head of a private survey of Chinese businesses called the China Beige Book. ""On his watch, China created the largest credit bubble in human history. It's a little late to distance from it now.""The IMF pointed out in its Global Financial Stability Report earlier this month that Chinese banking sector assets are now 310 percent of GDP, up from 240 percent at the end of 2012 and nearly three times the emerging market average. ""Debt in China is our No. 1 risk in the whole world,"" said Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. But rather than worrying about financial disruption from China, ""I would worry more about the prospect of slowing China demand.""Worldwide, stocks have rallied partly on stronger economic growth in a ""global synchronized recovery."" Stabilization in the world's second-largest economy, China, has played a major role in that more optimistic outlook. The International Monetary Fund increased its outlook for Chinese gross domestic product by 0.1 percent to 6.8 percent this year — exactly in line with what China reported for the third quarter last week.But property purchase curbs and Chinese household debt could spill over into the Chinese consumer growth story. In a report last Monday about how increasingly wealthy Chinese will boost demand for high-end products, Sanford C. Bernstein analysts said the property market has been the ""single largest driver"" of the increase in Chinese wealth. They estimate the property market has increased in value by about $12 trillion since 2010, while overall private wealth among Chinese households has increased from $10 trillion in 2010 to $34 trillion.""As one example, since 2010 the owner of an average 90-square-meter apartment in Shenzhen has experienced a capital gain of almost US$500,000 (nearly a quadrupling in value),"" senior equity research analyst Euan McLeish and a team of analysts wrote.

Over the past year, shares of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) have climbed 19%. That may seem like a lot until you consider that the KBW Bank Index is up 38% over the same stretch. Given this lagging performance, it's reasonable for investors to ask: Is Wells Fargo stock a good value right now? Banners hanging outside a Wells Fargo branch. Image source: Getty Images. Wells Fargo's price-to-book value ratio The usual way to think about a bank stock's valuation is to use the price-to-book value ratio. This is calculated by dividing a bank's price per share by its book value per share. The quotient tells you how much investors think a bank is worth relative to how much the bank says its worth on its balance sheet. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. Wells Fargo's stock trades for 1.50 times its book value per share. That equates to a 50% premium. This suggests that Wells Fargo is reasonably priced. The average bank stock on the KBW Bank Index is valued at 1.41 times its book value. That's less than Wells Fargo, but the California-based bank has proven over the years to be able to generate higher profitability than the industry average, which justifies a higher valuation. One could thus be excused for concluding that Wells Fargo's stock seems reasonably priced, neither excessively low nor high. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. A second way to measure the valuation of bank stocks is to use the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio. You calculate this by dividing a bank's share price by its earnings per share. The result shows how much it costs an investor to buy $1 worth of a company's earnings. If the P/E ratio is 22, then it costs $22. If the ratio is 4, it costs $4. There's no golden rule for what constitutes a good P/E ratio for a bank stock. That said, you can compare a bank's P/E ratio to other stocks, both within the bank industry and outside of it -- a key benefit of the P/E ratio over the price-to-book value ratio. *The median was used for the KBW Bank Index and the S&P 500. Data source: YCharts.com, The Wall Street Journal. Chart by author. In Wells Fargo's case, its stock trades for 14.2 times its earnings. That compares to a median PE ratio on the KBW Bank Index of 16.8 and a median ratio on the S&P 500 of 23.2. By both measures, then, Wells Fargo's stock seems reasonably, if not modestly, priced. An important caveat Just because Wells Fargo's stock trades at a lower valuation than the typical bank stock in terms of its price-to-earnings ratio doesn't mean that its share price won't fall in the future, even by a large margin, because it can. This seems particularly relevant right now, in light of the multiyear bull market in stocks since the financial crisis. But holding all else equal, if you're going to buy a bank stock in this environment, it doesn't hurt to buy one that's reasonably priced -- such as Wells Fargo. ","

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",10262017,Fool,10192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The largest U.S. banks have now reported their third-quarter earnings, and the results were generally positive. Investment banks Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) reported strong asset growth and merger-and-acquisition activity, and of the five largest consumer banks -- JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) -- four reported strong performance. With that in mind, here are seven takeaways from bank earnings that investors who are interested in the financial sector should know. Image source: Getty Images. Loans and deposits are growing across the banking industry, investment assets have grown because of strong market performance, and rising interest rates have resulted in higher margins for banks. The combination has resulted in higher revenue for banks. With the exception of Wells Fargo, which we'll discuss in more depth later on, the big U.S. banks saw strong revenue growth during the third quarter. Bank Q3 2017 Revenue Growth (Year Over Year) Morgan Stanley 3% Goldman Sachs 2% Bank of America 1% JPMorgan Chase 3% Citigroup 2% U.S. Bank 4% Wells Fargo (2%) Data source: company earnings reports. One major focus within the banking industry is efficiency. Banks are investing heavily in their mobile and online platforms and as a whole are reducing their physical footprints. Just to name one example, Bank of America has closed more than 100 branches in the past year and has seen a big increase in its mobile user base. Thanks to improving efficiency, while bank revenue is rising, expenses haven't increased proportionally, which translates into profit growth that's far more impressive than the revenue growth indicated in the chart in the previous section. Continuing with the Bank of America example, its 1% revenue growth isn't too exciting, but 17% growth in earnings per share (EPS) is. Bank Q3 2017 EPS Growth (Year Over Year) Morgan Stanley 15% Goldman Sachs 3% Bank of America 17% JPMorgan Chase 11% Citigroup 11% U.S. Bank 5% Wells Fargo (18%) Data source: company earnings reports. As I mentioned, the banking industry had a generally strong quarter, with the exception of Wells Fargo. The fallout from the bank's infamous fake-accounts scandal has resulted in significant legal expenses and a general reduction in business. For example, Wells Fargo was the only big U.S. bank whose loan portfolio shrank over the past year. In addition, the bank's net interest margin was flat year over year, despite rising interest rates, and its r returns on equity and assets (ROE and ROA) of 9.1% and 0.94%, respectively, failed to meet the industry's 10% and 1% benchmarks. While there's no way to know for sure how long and how much Wells Fargo's business will be feeling the effects of the scandal, it's certainly apparent in the bank's recent results. Instead of valuing banks with the commonly used price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E, a better metric to use is the price-to-tangible book value (P/TB or P/TBV) ratio. This is a measure of how expensive a bank's stock price is, relative to the value of its tangible assets. Over the past year or so, bank stock prices have risen considerably, and their valuations have soared as a result. However, there is significant variation in the big banks' valuations, as well as in how much they've improved. Bank Q3 2017 P/TB Year-Over-Year Change U.S. Bank 2.94 17.5% JPMorgan Chase 1.85 39.1% Wells Fargo 1.77 19.4% Bank of America 1.58 63.2% Morgan Stanley 1.49 43.7% Goldman Sachs 1.35 35.6% Citigroup 1.08 39.7% Data source: company financials. Year-over-year change from YCharts. In the P/TB chart, you can see that while bank stock valuations have risen across the board, no company's valuation has grown as much as Bank of America's. And there's good reason for this. Specifically, in the years following the financial crisis, Bank of America was one of the least profitable and most inefficient of the big banks, and for this reason, the stock traded for a discount to tangible book value for much of that time -- even thoughout most of 2016. Its ROA and ROE were simply awful compared with what bank investors typically look for. BAC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts Recently, Bank of America has done an excellent job of improving its asset quality and the efficiency of its operation, and the company is now on the verge of achieving profitability that meets the 10% ROE and 1% ROA benchmarks that investors generally like to see. Share buybacks have been a major focus of the big banks this quarter, after their capital plans were approved earlier this year. Now, there are several potential reasons companies could choose to buy back stock. For example, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently said one reason the bank is prioritizing buybacks is that it's easier to reduce a buyback than a dividend. However, the major reason companies focus on buybacks is that they feel their stock is attractively priced. During the third quarter, Goldman Sachs spent more than $2 billion on buybacks and reduced its share count to less than 400 million for the first time. JPMorgan Chase spent $4.5 billion on buybacks during the quarter, while Wells Fargo spent $2 billion, and Bank of America has spent nearly $8 billion on its stock so far in 2017. At this point, there's no way to know for sure if a tax reform or tax-cut package will be passed, nor do we know what the exact corporate rate would be. Having said that, it's fair to say that tax reform could be a big catalyst for bank profits, whether the corporate rate turns out to be 20% as the GOP tax plan suggests, or even if it's as high as 25% like some experts think it will be. Banks are highly taxed -- here are the big U.S. banks' effective tax rates for the third quarter. Bank Q3 2017 Effective Tax Rate Morgan Stanley 28.1% Goldman Sachs 22.6% Bank of America 32.6% JPMorgan Chase 29.6% Citigroup 31.1% U.S. Bank 27.3% Wells Fargo 31.2% Data source: company earnings reports. Bank stocks have performed tremendously well over the past year or so, but there's a good reason for the upward movement. Revenue is up, profits are rising, and there are potential catalysts such as tax reform that could cause the banks' bottom lines to improve even further. ","
      
    Third-Quarter Bank Earnings: 7 Things Investors Need to Know -- The Motley Fool

Motley Fool Staff,10262017,Fool,10192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A full transcript follows the video. Chris Hill: We begin with a tale of two banks. Wells Fargo's third-quarter profits fell 18% while Bank of America's third-quarter profits rose 13%. Not surprisingly, B of A shares doing a little better on Friday, Jason. Wells Fargo, racking up some legal fees there. Jason Moser: Discrete fees. We'll talk about that. It's been a little bit more than a year since the news broke of the fraudulent accounts. We talked about it a lot when it happened. I think I basically came to the conclusion that we were going to make a lot of noise about it, disapprove of it, and then everybody was going to go about their business and the stock was going to be just fine. And I think that's because, generally speaking, people are lazy in relation to how sticky these bank accounts are. And fast-forward to today, the stock is up 20% since this news broke. So, it seems like everything is going to be OK in regard to that. The metric we were looking at a year ago when this happened, started following total average deposits, because I think that would be a good indicator as to whether people were really serious about closing their accounts and putting their money elsewhere. Total average deposits were up 4% from the year ago. A bit more modest on a sequential basis, but the bottom line is, people are not, in fact, closing their accounts. It figures that they're doing a good job of at least keeping people in there and apologizing, and I guess they're being taken somewhat seriously. I don't think replacing Stumpf with Sloan was the right move, honestly, because Sloan has been there since '87, so he was part of all this mess to begin with. But, obviously, they are recovering. Hill: Obviously, it doesn't matter. [laughs] Moser: It apparently doesn't matter. Wall Street is going to give them a pass eventually. It's a stock that has done very well, still, over the last five years, although if you compare it to something like Bank of America, Bank of America has outperformed it handily. That has come, not surprisingly, over the past year. ","
      
    Wells Fargo Profits Down in Wake of Account Fraud Scandal -- The Motley Fool

Sean Williams,10262017,Fool,10192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. To put it mildly, cryptocurrencies are redefining ""investment gains"" for folks in 2017. Whereas the stock market has traditionally returned 7% a year, inclusive of dividend reinvestment, the aggregate value of more than 1,100 digital currencies has increased from $17.65 billion to begin the year to $167 billion as of Oct. 18. You know, just your standard 846% gain in a span of nine-and-a-half months. Leading the charge higher have primarily been bitcoin and ethereum, the largest and second largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Bitcoin's value has more than quintupled year to date, with its market cap recently approaching $100 billion. For context, bitcoin was valued closer to $3 billion just two years ago. Meanwhile, ethereum is up more than 3,800% since the beginning of the year. Combined, ethereum and bitcoin make up $123 billion of the aforementioned $167 billion in digital currency market cap. Image source: Getty Images. There are a number of reasons investors have been excited about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole. To begin with, there's the blockchain technology that underlies most virtual currencies. Blockchain is the digital and decentralized ledger that records transactions without the need for a financial intermediary such as a bank. Because these are usually open-source networks, altering data within blockchain would be almost impossible to do. Thus, blockchain could be the next-generation platform for secure peer-to-peer and business-to-business transactions. A falling dollar has also lent to bullish moves higher in digital currencies -- especially bitcoin. When the U.S. dollar falls, investors holding cash will often seek a safe-haven asset like gold. Gold and the dollar have historically moved in opposite directions, and gold is a finite resource, making it a perfect store of value. In other words, what gold is on the planet right now is all there will ever be, unless we figure out a way to mine asteroids or foreign planets. Bitcoin shares this perceived scarcity with gold, given that its protocols limit the number of minable coins to 21 million. In effect, bitcoin has been a go-to safe-haven asset of late. We also shouldn't overlook the power of momentum in pushing the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies higher. The gains in cryptocurrencies can aptly be described as once in a lifetime, so it's possible that investors simply fear missing the boat if they don't buy in now. Image source: Getty Images. But not everyone is a fan of bitcoin and the digital currency movement. This past week, the CEOs of the largest and third largest money center banks in the U.S. voiced their opinions on bitcoin, and you simply have to see what they said. The most recent interjection came from Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) CEO Tim Sloan, who, when questioned about bitcoin by CNBC, said that ""in terms of it as a cryptocurrency, I'd probably rather own a dollar than a dollar of bitcoin."" Of course, that's just a tiny slap compared to what JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) CEO has said about bitcoin. In September, Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a ""fraud"" and suggested he'd ""fire in a second"" any of his investment employees who were actively trading bitcoin. Last week, Dimon was at it again while taking questions from a moderator at an Institute of International Finance conference. Said Dimon: If you're stupid enough to buy it [bitcoin], you'll pay the price for it one day. The only value of bitcoin is what the other guy'll pay for it. Honestly I think there's a good chance of the buyers out there are out there jazzing it up very day so that maybe you'll buy it too, and take them out. What is noteworthy, though, is that while both men could care less for bitcoin the virtual currency, they both appreciate the blockchain technology that underlies cryptocurrencies. ""I think in terms of the underlying technology, it's very interesting. Distributed ledger technology is very interesting in terms of how it can be applied to all sorts of products and services within financial services,"" Sloan said. Similarly, Dimon has said he believes the underlying blockchain technology is valid, but he has no interest in the non-fiat digital coins. Image source: Getty Images. While you could construe the comments of big-bank CEOs as blunt and opinionated, one factor that can't be spun is just how exposed digital currencies are to competition. Right now, bitcoin and ethereum are sort of a one-two punch in terms of popularity. Investors have latched on to bitcoin as a payment platform, although recent software upgrades to its blockchain are designed to attract big businesses. Meanwhile, ethereum derives its valuation from the potential for its blockchain. More than 150 organizations, including nine brand-name companies, are testing a version of ethereum's blockchain in pilot and small-scale projects. But none of these technologies is protected or guaranteed to remain popular. For instance, six banking giants, including Credit Suisse and Barclays, recently joined a project UBS began in 2015. These banks are working on technology that'll allow for the clearing and settling of transactions worldwide over blockchain. This partnership also comes with its very own digital coin, which is being called the ""utility settlement coin."" The point is that all it really takes is some time and capital, and anyone can be a blockchain player. There's nothing particularly unique at all about bitcoin, other than its current size, that could keep a consortium of companies from dethroning it with superior blockchain technology Now that's a real-world concern that should have bitcoin investors seriously worried.

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",10262017,Fool,10192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A full transcript follows the video. Matt Frankel: I'm going to blame that on the time change. Let's go with that. Before we get into things, I wanted to highlight something. We heard 15 stock pitches last week. Maybe you missed an episode, or maybe you just didn't get them all written down. E-mail us at industryfocus@fool.com, and we'll happily send you the list of all 15 stocks that we discussed and their tickers. Again, that's industryfocus@fool.com. With that, let's talk about big bank earnings. That's, for those who are keeping score at home, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). Generally speaking, most everyone did well, except for Wells Fargo, but we'll get into that. Let's start with some generalities, and then we can get into some specifics about each. One of the first things that really I saw was, trading revenue was a lot lower pretty much across the board. Frankel: Yeah, that tends to happen in low-volatility environments like this. The prices are moving around a lot less, so people tend to trade a lot less. That's kind of a negative thing, with volatility being at historic lows right now. Douglass: Sure. I guess this is the drawback of stocks doing so well so far this year. On the flip side of that, a good thing for the banks, I noticed a lot of cost cuts. They're reducing branches. They're also cutting staff. And that's helping them better control their expenses. Frankel: Definitely. In Bank of America's case, they closed 113 or 114 branches this past quarter alone. This is why you see revenues up across the board, but earnings are up even more, and the big reason for that is, costs are going down. Douglass: Absolutely. On the flip side, one other issue. It's a slight concern. You're seeing some bumps in delinquencies and defaults, particularly credit card charge-offs. That's something we'll want to monitor going forward. Frankel: Yeah. You're not anywhere near the danger zone just yet. But a lot of experts are saying that credit card debt is at a record high level, even from before the financial crisis, and this is something to keep an eye on, that people are maybe buying a little too much and we can see an uptick in defaults. Douglass: Right. Let's turn to specifics about the banks. Of course, Matt, you're a talker, I'm a talker -- we're going to need to get through this pretty quickly just so we don't bog down the entire episode. Let's just take a minute to look at each of these big banks, and how they got to their win or, in Wells Fargo's case, loss, compared to analysts' expectations. Starting with Morgan Stanley, wealth-management business seems to be doing really well. They have $2.3 trillion in assets under management. Lots of opportunity there in cross-selling other products to wealth-management clients. Think mortgages and other kinds of loans to further enhance the bank's profitability. I think they have a lot of really interesting opportunity from here. Frankel: They do. Both big investment banks have a lot of big opportunities, especially as they start to branch out into more traditional banking areas. Douglass: One of the interesting trends that you'll see with banks right now is -- there is a lot of this -- you have your traditional investment banks. That's Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. And they're kind of hopping into a lot of things that have not traditionally been in their purview. And you're seeing this in a lot of banks. There's this attempt to cross-sell and be a one-stop shop across the board for people and businesses in different stages. Certainly, with Goldman Sachs, they had a lot merger-and-acquisition fees. That's the other investment bank, by the way. Frankel: Yeah, Goldman Sachs actually has the No. 1 market share in mergers and acquisitions. And IPOs, for that matter. Douglass: Right. It's interesting. They are really focusing a lot of effort on consumer lending right now, with their Marcus online lending platform. I don't know about the rest of you, or you, Matt, but I get a lot of Marcus Loans advertisements on Facebook, so I'm certainly hyper-aware of that particular attempt by them. Frankel: And it's been successful so far. They hit $1 billion in loans quicker than Lending Club or pretty much any of the other big players. And they have a big advantage in that they have tons of capital to lend. They don't have to wait for investors to put up money. They can grow it as quickly as possible. Douglass: And speaking of having lots of capital, the Fed cleared them to raise their dividend next year. So that's good news for Goldman Sachs shareholders as well. Let's hop on over to the commercial banks. Wells Fargo -- that's going to be the headline here. Not a great quarter by really just about any measure. Frankel: Right. Like you said, revenue was pretty much up across the board except for Wells Fargo. Interest margins were up across the board except for Wells Fargo. Efficiency was up across the board except for Wells Fargo. I could keep going with that. But it was just all over the place. It was tough to find things to be happy about in this quarter for Wells Fargo. Douglass: In a lot of ways, Wells Fargo is still struggling from the fake-accounts scandal last year and any number of other investigations and negotiations with the federal government over practices of various sorts. This is a lot to dig into there, more than we can in this episode. But a lot of concerns for Wells Fargo. I think that's reflected in relatively poor stock performance. Frankel: One thing to point out with Wells Fargo, if you don't mind, is a lot of the negative results this quarter were also partly attributed to legal costs. It's not just their business that's suffering. It's, they're being hit with all kinds of fees and fines, and there's really no telling if there's going to be more at this point. Douglass: Yeah. So a lot of uncertainty there right now. Let's turn to U.S. Bancorp. Frankel: Sure. U.S. Bancorp is historically one of the most profitable banks in the country, especially for its size. And actually, for the past few years, it's been Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, and then everyone else. Now it's just U.S. Bancorp and everybody else. Their return on equity, return on assets, which we're going to get into in a minute, is way above everybody else's. Same could be said for efficiency. Well, it's lower than everyone else's, but it's much better. Douglass: Just across the board, when you look at the metrics, U.S. Bancorp looks like it's in a pretty darn strong spot. Let's turn to the universal banks. These are your traditional banks that really have been involved in a lot of different areas. They've had, if you will, their fingers in a lot of different pies. Let's start with Bank of America. Good news for Bank of America shareholders in that they've really done a good job of expense management. Their efficiency ratio is now down to just below 60%, which is a massive improvement from the Bank of America of the past. Frankel: They're getting more efficient, not just because they're reducing their physical footprint. They're really doing a good job of pushing mobile and online banking. Mobile especially. A check deposit costs the bank something like one-tenth of what a deposit in a branch costed. So the more people they can get to use their online tools, their peer-to-peer payment solutions and stuff like that that are really starting to take off, the better off they'll be. And it's still a pretty small percentage of their transactions that are being done through mobile. Douglass: Yeah, so there's a lot of opportunity to continue mitigating costs going forward with all these upfront investments they've made in technology. Frankel: Yeah. They've probably done, in my opinion, the best job of the big banks in really leveraging their online platform. Douglass: Sure. Let's turn over to Citigroup. With Citigroup, two important things to point out. Efficiency ratio is down to 56%, which is sort of unheard of in the old Citigroup. So that's really good news, to see that they're doing a good job of expense management. And on the flip side, credit cards are showing more charge-offs. And that's, I think again, something that we're going to need to watch moving forward. Frankel: Yeah. Citigroup is the only one of the big banks with a long way to go before their profitability is where it needs to be. They still have a relatively low return on equity for their shareholders. Douglass: Yeah. And finally, JPMorgan. So one of the interesting things about JPMorgan is, JP Morgan Chase, the Chase Sapphire Reserve card is beloved among credit card hackers. And management reports that it's finally starting to pay off for the bank. So this is a credit card with a lot of perks, and they're finally able to, they're attracting the sort of people they want to with those perks, and then are able to make money in other ways off that credit card. So that's good news. Frankel: Yeah. Credit cards in general -- the Sapphire card was not very profitable at first, because they were pretty much giving away a sign on-bonus worth about $1,000. So it took them a long time before that was recouped by the increased business. But it looks like it's finally starting to pay off. A lot of people in the industry thought they were crazy for giving away, I think it was 100,000 frequent-flyer miles at first, something like that. Douglass: Something like that, yeah. So it's good to see that working out. And wealth management is also paying off well for them, too, so that's good news. Frankel: Definitely. They're doing a great job all around. There's really nothing negative to say about JPMorgan over the past few years. Douglass: Absolutely. Let's go back now to the overall sector. There are a few catalysts for banks moving forward that investors should be aware of. First off, interest-rate increases. Frankel: Yeah. Generally, when interest rates go up, the banks profit. They call it net interest margin. The bank's profit margin expands. That's the difference between what a bank can make on its loans and what it's paying for deposits and things like that. So as the Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates at least a handful of times over the next few years, this should also increase bank profits. Frankel: That's especially true in these big banks, once they're above that $50 billion asset threshold, which everything we've talked about is. Then the regulations just jump to another level. Douglass: Right. We'll talk more about how to think about big banks in a minute. By that, what I mean is, unpacking some of those ratios we talked about and really thinking about how to identify a moat, and frankly, whether any of them is a compelling investment today. So before we hop into bank metrics, I just want to point out, this is going to be a very high-level look at them. If you really want to understand how to invest in banks, we have a great article that breaks down how to understand a bank piece by piece. When I took over our financial coverage in 2014, it was my Bible, and really still is today. Send us an email at industryfocus@fool.com, and I will be happy to share it with you. Again, that's industryfocus@fool.com. Let's talk about investing in big banks. I think the first thing we should talk about is, at their core, banks taking money as deposits and then lending that money out as loans. So you want to know, frankly, whether they're good at lending that money to people who aren't going to default on the loan, which would impact their profitability very negatively. One of the ways you can measure that is with the net charge-off-to-loan ratio, which is what percentage of loans are so delinquent and so unrecoverable that the bank thinks it won't get its money back. So lower is, of course, better. Other thoughts on that, Matt? Frankel: To follow up on what you just said, this is why Citigroup and Bank of America crashed after the financial crisis, while U.S. Bancorp never even had a quarter where they were in the red. Their defaults, they ticked up, but it was never to the point where they were losing money. This is what you were talking about with, they're much better at figuring out who they should lend money to. Douglass: And actually, you've made a point that I want to draw out a little bit more, which is, when the economy tanks, those numbers are going to increase. There are going to be more people who become delinquent, whether you're a great lender or a really bad lender. But one of the things to keep in mind is, look at each lender in comparison to the others. If you have one that has a much lower net charge-off-to-loan ratio versus another, that's a good sign for that company. And that's just something to keep in mind. The absolute numbers matter, but a rising or sinking tide will affect all the boats. So you want to keep that in mind and compare them to each other. Let's talk about expense management a little bit. Frankel: Sure. This is where a metric called the efficiency ratio comes into play. It's actually really easy to calculate. Take the bank's non-interest expense and divide by the total revenue it generates. It's basically how much a bank is paying in order to generate its revenue. Lower is better. Generally, 60% or so is what you're looking for for a big bank. About half of the banks we talked about are lower than that; about half of them are higher than that. But that's kind of the benchmark for a big bank. Douglass: Right. And U.S. Bancorp, to give it a shout out, has the lowest efficiency ratio of that bunch at 54.3%. Frankel: JPMorgan is actually in a close second, and surprisingly, Citigroup is up there, too. Douglass: Right, it's interesting. Again, this is not what you would historically expect, given the history of the banking industry. But it's a new day, and new things are happening. Let's talk about bank profitability as well. That's return on assets and return on equity. Looking at both of those, that's how you can understand how well the bank takes that hopefully low credit risk and makes money off it. Frankel: The two benchmarks you want to look at are 1% return on assets and a 10% return on equity. Return on assets is a measure of how well a bank takes all of the money it has and uses that to make more money. Return on equity is how well it's using the money shareholders have invested to turn a profit. Douglass: Exactly. And let's also talk a little bit about what happens if everything bad hits the fan. There are a ton of different ratios that you can use to try to stress-test a bank a little bit. Of course, the banks actually go through stress tests with the Federal Reserve. But one that's pretty commonly used is the tier 1 common capital ratio. It's reported on by every big bank, and it basically measures how much strain they can take before really bad things start happening. So the higher the ratio, the better. Frankel: Right. At this time, all of the banks are well above the regulatory threshold. I think most of them are probably double the regulatory threshold at this point. This just kind of tells you, under a worst-case scenario, which, I think the stress-test worst-case scenario is something that's even worse than the financial crisis was, something like 10% unemployment, things like that, and how well a bank would hold up before it would start losing money or need a bailout like they did during the financial crisis. Again, this is another metric you compare with other banks and take with a grain of salt at this point, because everything is going well. Banks have really recapitalized because regulations are high. This is another thing to keep an eye on, if regulations get rolled back. Right now, it's actually looking pretty good across the board. I think the highest capital ratio is Morgan Stanley at this point, and Goldman Sachs. Both investment banks have really high capital. Among the other banks, Citigroup surprisingly is the top, with a 30% tier 1 capital ratio. Douglass: Right. And of course, when thinking about each of these metrics, the next question is, of course, OK, cool, that's what you're getting, but what are you paying for that? And there are a lot of different valuation metrics out there. The one that I prefer for banks is price to tangible book value. Book value is essentially what the business' assets are worth. That includes intangible assets and goodwill, which, frankly, those are hard to value. So I tend to prefer tangible book value because it's, well, tangible assets, so it's easier to get a precise valuation for, and then price over that basically gives you a sense as to what that valuation looks like -- again, in comparison to other banks. Frankel: And this is a good one to use in conjunction with the return on assets, return on equity, and efficiency ratio we were talking about. You want to know how much you're paying for a bank, given its profitability. For example, U.S. Bank trades at by far, by far, by far the highest price-to-tangible book value. Just to kind of give you a reference without telling you too much, going too much into the numbers, they're about 3 times tangible book value right now. For comparison, JPMorgan is a distant second at 1.8 times book value. The industry average is between 1.3 and 1.5 times book value. So U.S. Bank is by far the most profitable of the big banks, but you pay for it. Douglass: Right. So that's one of the things you have to weigh when you're engaging in an investment thesis about these companies. Let's turn to thinking about a moat. When you've got a big sector like this, and a bunch of different players that frankly are a little bit inscrutable, how does an investor identify a moat for them, and really figure out which one to invest in? Frankel: That's a really good question. The moat, you can identify basically by something that differentiates the banks from the others and that should keep it going no matter what the market or the economy is doing. U.S. Bancorp is the obvious example, just because they're always profitable, have very few loan losses. The recent stress tests actually found that U.S. Bank would not only survive, but they would make money even in an absolute worst-case scenario. That's a pretty nice moat. That's a good margin of safety to have, too. Douglass: Yeah, absolutely. I tend to agree. I think one of the other things to keep in mind is management. When you go back to a lot of these metrics that we've talked about, what they really come down to basically is, how smart is management at deploying capital, and how much risk are they taking on by doing so? And the more that you can read about management, hear what they say, hear how they talk about their business, I think the more you can understand a little bit, when you combine it with these metrics, what their credit risk looks like and how they think about investing in the company. Keep in mind, every bank is going to say they are a conservative lender that's really careful about how it lends out money. That's just sort of par for the course for them to claim that. The reality, though, is going to be that when you combine these different ratios with what management is talking about and really try to better understand how they do this and what risk they're taking on by doing it. Frankel: Definitely, just to see who's putting their money where their mouth is, I guess, is the best way to sum it up. Douglass: Exactly. And one more time, as I mentioned earlier, my favorite article on banks is written by Anand Chokkavelu, who's a CFA at fool.com. Drop us a note, industryfocus@fool.com, and I'll be happy to send you that article, which really breaks down how to think about investing in banks. Frankel: I actually learned a lot of what I know about things from that article. Douglass: Yes, me too. Let's go ahead and take a step back. We've talked about big banks, we've talked about their news, we've talked about what's going on, we've talked about how to analyze them. Well, are there any that are actually worth investing in today? Frankel: As a general statement, I think the potential catalysts we discussed are priced in at this point. Bank stocks, a lot of them have doubled in the past year or two, Bank of America being one. That's my personal biggest stock holding, Bank of America. But I don't know I would buy more today at the current price. I personally like Wells Fargo, if you have a long time frame to let the drama play out. They're still a pretty expensive bank relative to the industry, but not compared to what their business was valued at before the scandal started. So if they're successful in recovering from the scandal over time, this current price could look pretty cheap. And U.S. Bank is always a good long-term investment. You really can't go wrong with that one at any point. Douglass: It's expensive, and for a reason. When I think about Wells Fargo, my general thing is, I think the key question that you need to ask before you choose to invest in Wells Fargo is, this bank really did well on a lot of metrics for a very long time, in part because they did an aggressive cross-selling culture. Can they retain that aggressive culture? Can they in some way effectively cross-sell their products and grow their revenue and their underlying earnings without these negative externalities that often come with that, which is, people trying to cheat the system, creating fake accounts, things like that? If the answer to that is yes, then Wells Fargo is undoubtedly cheap compared to where it used to be. It's still reasonably priced by most bank stock standards. But if you're concerned about that possibility, I think Wells Fargo is a stay-away. Personally, I don't have enough data points, so I'm staying on the sidelines. I actually don't own any of the big banks. I'm only invested in a small bank right now. But I'm going to be keeping an eye particularly on the turnaround at Bank of America, because I think that's a very interesting story. ","
      
    Investing in Bank Stocks: What You Need to Know -- The Motley Fool

It's often said that emotion makes investors their own worst enemies. It causes them to buy high, sell low, or grow attached to losing stocks for the wrong reasons. Even professional analysts often follow that trend, by issuing buy ratings after big rallies and sell ratings after big declines. That herd-like mentality makes human analysts seem unreliable, and it has opened up a new market for artificial intelligence-powered solutions. Robo-advisors, for example, can feed a client's financial background and goals through an algorithm to offer advice or automatically invest their assets. Image source: Getty Images. Some financial institutions are even testing out bot analysts that issue buy or sell ratings on individual stocks. One such bot, Wells Fargo's (NYSE: WFC) AIERA (artificially intelligent equity research analyst), recently surprised Wall Street by issuing sell ratings on two market darlings -- Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Should investors care what this robo-analyst believes? Wells Fargo analyst Ken Sena led a group that worked with Bryan Healey, a former Amazon.com data scientist, to create AIERA. The bot currently tracks 13 stocks, and formulates daily, weekly, and overall forecasts for their growth. Wells Fargo hasn't said much about the data AIERA crunches, but it's likely a combination of fundamental, technical, and news-driven trends. Sena has emphasized that the bot is intended to enhance, not replace, the jobs of human analysts, and that it remains in a test-and-learn mode that has ""no current bearing"" on the brokerage's actual ratings on. Wells Fargo's human analysts have assigned ""outperform"" ratings to Facebook and Alphabet, with respective price targets of $215 and $1,250 -- more than 20% higher than their current prices. Image source: Getty Images. Among the 44 analysts tracking Facebook, there are 37 buy ratings, three overweight ratings, three hold ratings, and one sell rating. The lone sell rating comes from Pivotal Research, which claimed that the European Commission's ruling against Google Shopping and its ongoing crackdown on U.S. tech companies posed a threat to Facebook's expansion. The bears also often claim that Facebook's valuation is a bit frothy at 39 times earnings. Forty-three analysts track Alphabet, 34 of whom rate the stock as a buy, four rate it overweight, and five think that it's a hold. Analysts who issued a hold rating, like Canaccord Genuity, mostly believe that the stock's valuation is too high at 37 times earnings. Facebook and Alphabet have also been hit by investigations regarding their sale of ads to Russian operatives during last year's election. If those investigations drag on, they could adversely impact both companies' ad revenue growth. In a note to clients reported by Bloomberg, Sena wrote earlier this month that ""AIERA’s approach this week appears decidedly more conservative (than last week), as she places a 'hold' recommendation on 11 names and even going so far as to place Google and Facebook in the 'sell' category."" Facebook and Alphabet both face near-term speed bumps, but the world's biggest social network and search engine don't face much long-term competition. Facebook's monthly active users rose 17% annually to 2.01 billion last quarter. Google processes about 2 trillion searches annually, reaches over 2 billion users with Android, and streams videos to another billion users on YouTube. Based on those facts, we can conclude that Facebook's and Alphabet's ecosystems will get bigger as they conquer adjacent markets and invest in next-gen technologies like virtual reality, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, home automation, and driverless cars. AI-powered analysts like AIERA might not factor in the growth potential of those markets, which limits their view to shorter-term trends. They also can't factor in the mainstream appeal of stocks like Facebook and Alphabet, which younger or inexperienced investors might buy as a brand with little regard for their actual fundamentals. Bot and human analysts might think Facebook and Alphabet look pricey, but neither stock is that expensive. Analysts expect Facebook's earnings to rise 26% this year and 22% next year, which justifies its forward P/E of 26. Alphabet's earnings could dip 11% this year on higher investments, but rebound 31% next year, according to estimates. It trades at just 24 times forward earnings. Bot analysts might spot unusual spikes in trading volume, scan headlines, read earnings reports, and crunch that data against a company's fundamentals faster than their human counterparts. But many moves in the market, like the appeal of certain cult stocks, often defy technical and fundamental explanations. I also doubt that bots can fully understand why human investors are willing to pay a premium for companies like Facebook and Alphabet. Therefore, the rise of the robots on Wall Street is interesting, but I doubt that AI analysts will completely replace human ones anytime soon. ","
      
    A Robot Says It's Time to Sell Facebook and Alphabet. Should You Listen? -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,10262017,Fool,10192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. At the 2013 economic conference in Davos, Switzerland, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan analogized the bank's predicament to a mountain climbing competition in which the bank was weighed down by a 250-pound backpack. He was referring to the tsunami of costs that washed over the bank in the wake of the financial crisis. At one point, Bank of America estimated that the crisis had cost it nearly $200 billion in legal costs and loan charge-offs. The Bank of America building in Dallas, Texas, towers over Dealey Plaza. Image source: Getty Images. But those costs are now in the rearview mirror. Over the past two quarters, Bank of America's efficiency ratio has come in below 60%, better than even the notoriously efficient Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). In fact, you'd be hard pressed to find any non-regulatory remnants from the crisis anywhere in Bank of America's financial documents. The only place you are likely to come across them is in its ""All Other"" unit, a non-operating unit that houses, among other things, $77 billion worth of residential mortgages and home equity loans dating back to the pre-crisis period. Paradoxically, it's a trend in this business segment that's so auspicious for Bank of America. Image source: Bank of America. Over the past year, the bank's average total loans and leases have increased by only $17 billion, growing from $901 billion in the third quarter of last year up to $918 billion in the third quarter of this year. One reason the total figure grew so little, at 1.9%, is because the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank had to absorb a $28 billion decline in loans in the bank's All Other segment that either matured or were written off. Excluding that, the growth rate in Bank of America average total loans would have more than doubled. The good news is that, relatively soon, the loans in Bank of America's All Other unit will dwindle so far that the portfolio's run-off will no longer have a material impact on the growth rate of the bank's total loans. As you can see in the chart above, the nation's second biggest bank by assets has $77 billion in loans in its All Other unit today. But at the current pace of the portfolio's run-off, it could be gone within three years. In sum, assuming that the economy doesn't descend into a recession, Bank of America appears positioned to grow its loan portfolio at an increasing pace for the foreseeable future. ","
      
    1 Reason to Be Optimistic About Bank of America Stock -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",10262017,Fool,10192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is the fifth-largest U.S.-based commercial bank by assets, and it is widely considered to be one of the best-run banks in the nation. In fact, the company is one of Warren Buffett's major bank stock holdings. In its third-quarter earnings report, U.S. Bancorp not only lived up to expectations, but continued to show investors why it has such a strong reputation. As its profitability and efficiency show, the bank is truly in a class by itself. Image source: Getty Images. (Note: Image does not necessarily depict a U.S. Bancorp branch.) U.S. Bancorp's top and bottom line numbers weren't too exciting. The bank's earnings of $0.88 per share matched analysts' expectations, and its revenue of $5.61 billion surpassed expectations, but just slightly. Earnings grew by nearly 5% year-over-year, and revenue grew by 4%. Additionally, the bank's growth was impressive in many key areas of the business. Net interest income grew 8.3% year-over-year due to a combination of 3% higher loan balances and net interest margins that grew by 12 basis points (0.12%) over the past year. And while U.S. Bancorp has historically had relatively small loan losses compared with peers, the bank's non-performing assets dropped by an impressive 25% from last year, and by 7.3% from the second quarter. In a nutshell, the bank produced solid results with few surprises. U.S. Bancorp is well-known for being a highly profitable and efficient banking operation. The bank's return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) profitability metrics came in at 1.38% and 13.6%, respectively. The industry benchmarks are 1% and 10%, respectively. In addition, the bank's efficiency ratio is 54.3% (lower is better), which is one of the best among brick-and-mortar banks. As far as the five largest U.S. banks go, U.S. Bancorp has consistently been the most profitable and efficient, while Wells Fargo has been a close second. However, the fallout from Wells Fargo's fake-accounts scandal has depressed the bank's profitability and has left U.S. Bancorp in a class by itself when it comes to big-bank profitability and efficiency. Company 3Q17 ROA 3Q17 ROE 3Q17 Efficiency Ratio U.S. Bancorp 1.38% 13.6% 54.3% Wells Fargo 0.94% 9.06% 65.5% Bank of America 0.98% 8.1% 60% JPMorgan Chase 1.04% 11% 56.5% Citigroup 0.87% 7.3% 56% Data source: Company financials and author's own calculations. In fact, in this year's Federal Reserve banking ""stress tests,"" U.S. Bancorp was one of a select few that was actually projected to make money in a hypothetical deep recession. To be fair, U.S. Bancorp's earnings report wasn't 100% excellent. For one thing, noninterest income dropped by about 1% year-over-year, mainly due to a drop in mortgage banking revenue. Also, while the loan portfolio increased by 3% year-over-year, this was the slowest annual growth rate of the past five quarters. The same can be said for the 5.2% growth in deposits. None of these things should necessarily be taken as a sign of trouble, but they are certainly worth noting. With a rock-solid loan portfolio, lean and profitable operation, and solid growth, U.S. Bancorp is one of the best-run banks in the United States and could be worth a look for investors who want financial-sector exposure. It's worth mentioning that U.S. Bancorp isn't cheap. In fact, on a price-to-book basis, it's significantly more expensive than the rest of the five largest U.S. banks. However, when it comes to U.S. Bancorp's quality as a bank and as a long-term investment, you get what you pay for. ","

 ,10262017,Fool,10192017,"The job of leadership is about leading and managing change.Shutterstock Visionary leadership requires three core capabilities. 1. See potential. The first step to becoming an effective visionary leader is learning to see potential – both in individuals and organizations. To do that, you need to free yourself to imagine how the world in which you work could be better. Then you need to imagine how your team or organization would need to act differently in order to make that change happen.  For example, over the last six years I’ve had a front row seat as a board director for Abbott Laboratories. From there, I’ve watched a masterful CEO develop and enact vision at a more than $20-billion scale. Each time Miles White has set a vision, it has completely transformed the organization. Through a combination of acquisition and investment, Abbott has created and spun off Hospira (2004) and AbbVie (2013), and created a medical diagnostics and devices powerhouse with the recent acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere. Since becoming CEO of Abbott in 1999, Miles has delivered more than 360 percent total shareholder return and, more importantly, has helped patients by getting hundreds of breakthrough drugs and medical technologies into the market. To enact this type of vision, it isn’t just about engaging your brain. You also have to have the “stomach” for making real change happen – for challenging and reshaping the status quo. Many people can envision needed change. Fewer have the guts and the fortitude to see those changes through – the public accountability, the very visible risk of failure, and the many, many, many conversations needed to bring employees and external stakeholders on board. 2.  Identify the pathways. Once you have a vision you’ve decided to take on, you need to build a team and a stakeholder strategy for enacting it. To achieve something big, you’ll need the right talent by your side. And you’ll need to cultivate key supporters and isolate or neutralize powerful opponents. To do this, you need to map out who your allies and blockers are and develop strategies for shifting them to where you need them to be. Sometimes you may need to reorient a department or function. Sometimes you may need to reframe the thinking of your whole senior team. That’s what happened when Ulta CEO Mary Dillon realized her senior leaders needed to spend less time in their corporate offices and more time in stores listening to their front-line managers. 3.  Harness the conversations. Once you identify the human pathways, you and your team need to work them. You need to get in the right rooms with the right people, saying the right things. Whether it’s changing people’s understanding of how your business works, changing people’s beliefs and behaviors to align with a new understanding, or getting people to work really hard to make significant change happen – each conversation matters. Often it means overcoming the cynicism that can accumulate in organizations from prior failed change efforts. Sometimes it may mean convincing external stakeholders why change is needed. This is what we did at Kellogg in 2010 to get both Northwestern University and our local city council to approve a lakefront site, that hadn’t been under consideration, for the construction of a new 415,000-square-foot building we opened in March. Each conversation requires planning and intention. Persuasion doesn’t just happen on the fly or by accident, and it rarely happens through e-mail or text. Persuasion requires leaders to be fully present. It requires knowing what to say, when to say it and whom to say it to. It doesn’t matter whether the conversation is a 500-person town hall presentation, a small team meeting or a one-on-one coaching conversation. Bottom-line: The job of leadership is, at its core, about leading and managing change. The best leaders see potential all around them and decide that they want to take on the gritty task of turning some of that potential into reality. They map out the human pathways needed to achieve their vision, and they leverage each meeting and conversation to bring people along with them. In the end, the only real tool any leader has is people and his or her ability to engage them in the task of human progress.

Motley Fool Staff,10262017,Fool,10192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) Image source: The Motley Fool. Operator Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. During the question and answer session, you will be able to ask your question by pressing the *1 keys on your touchtone phone. Should you become disconnected throughout this conference call, please redial the number provided to you and reference the Abbott earnings call. This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question and answer session, the entire call, including the question and answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President of Finance, and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian will discuss our performance outlook in our detail. Following our comments, Miles, Brian, and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements today may be forward-looking for the purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2017. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Respectors to our Annual Report, and Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10K for the year ending December 31, 2016. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that third quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS, and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory findings from today, which are available on our website at Abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to comparable operational sales growth, which adjusts the 2016 basis of comparison to include results for St. Jude Medical, and to exclude the impact of exchange, as well as current and historical results for Abbott's medical optics and St. Jude's vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of 2017. Comparable growth also reflects a reduction in St. Jude's historic sales related to administrative fees paid to Group Purchasing Organization in order to conform with Abbott's presentation. Earlier this month, Abbott concluded its acquisition of Alere. Given there are only three months remaining in the year, I'd note that comparable sales growth guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 do not include Alere, which is consistent with the guidance methodology we've utilized since the beginning of the year. With that, I will now turn the call to Miles. Okay. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, we report an ongoing earnings per share of 66 cents at the high end of our guidance range and reflecting double digit growth. We also raised the midpoint of our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to 248 to 250, which is at the upper end of the range we set at the beginning of the year. Sales increased more than 5.5% in the quarter, led by strong performance in established pharmaceuticals and medical devices. At the beginning of the year, I commented that we were entering a period where innovation and new product launches would enhance our competitiveness and fortify our leading market positions. We're seeing this play out through the first three quarters of the year, with significant growth contributions from several recently launched products and important advancements across our innovative new product pipeline. I'll highlight several examples as I summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Brian. I'll start with diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of more than five% in the quarter, which was led by strong international performance. During the quarter, we continued the initial European launch of our new Alinity family of systems, which now includes five recently launched instruments in the areas of immuno assay, clinical chemistry, blood screening, hematology, and point of care testing. As we've stated previously, our primary focus during this initial launch period has been to convert a number of long-tenured Abbott customers to Alinity, and we continue to make progress on that front across all the major European countries. We continue to anticipate CE mark for our Alinity molecular diagnostic system in the coming months, and expect to begin the Alinity launch of the Alinity instruments in the U.S. in 2018. During the quarter, we also announced our acquisition of Alere, establishing Abbott as the global leader in point of care testing. This combination creates the broadest point of care testing portfolio in the world, with leading positions across cardio, metabolic, infectious disease, and toxicology testing. In nutrition, sales grew very modestly in the quarter. In pediatric nutrition, continued above market performance in the U.S. was led by recently launched infant formula products and strong growth of our PediaSure toddler brand. Internationally, we've seen some market stabilization in China, and we prepared for pending new food safety regulations that are set to go into effect on January 1st of next year. Outside of China, as expected, we continue to see soft market conditions across a few international markets, and in adult nutrition, international growth of 5.5% was led by our market leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. In established pharmaceuticals, or EPD, double digit sales growth was led by strong performance across our key emerging markets, including double digit growth in Brazil, Russia, India, and China. As expected, as contemplated in our third quarter guidance, we saw a modest level of channel restocking in India after the implementation of a new tax system in that country on July 1st, which contributed approximately two-and-a-half percentage points of growth in the quarter. Excluding this impact, total EPD sales would have grown around 12% in the quarter. With our unique geographic footprint and business model, as well as our scale and leading positions in several geographies, EPD is well-positioned for sustained above market performance. And in medical devices, sales growth was led by double digit growth in heart failure, electrophysiology, structural heart, neuromodulation, and diabetes care. In addition to strong growth, we achieved several new product approvals and clinical trial milestones across our portfolio during the third quarter. In heart failure, we received U.S. FTA approval and launched our HeartMate 3 pump, which provides crucial support for advanced heart failure patients as they wait for their treatment, including heart transplants. HeartMate3 offers a number of advantages compared to existing options, and further strengthens our global leadership position in this area. During the quarter, we also received U.S. FTA approval of our MRI-compatible ICD, or implantable defibrillator, which follows up the approval of our MRI-compatible pacemaker earlier this year. These approvals significantly enhance our competitive position in the U.S. cardiac rhythm management market. In structural heart, double digit growth was drive by continued global update microclip. During the quarter, we achieved several important clinical milestones, including completion of enrollment in our U.S. trial for Portico, our Taber product. And we began enrolling patients in a new bicuspid valve disease trial, which utilizes our market leading trans-catheter valve repair system. In neuromodulation, we achieved growth of approximately 50% for the third consecutive quarter, driven by recently launched products that offer improved relieve for chronic pain patients, and help for those suffering from movement disorders. With our broad portfolio of innovative solutions, we continue to advance our leadership position in this fast growing market. I'll wrap up with diabetes care, where an international sales growth of nearly 35% was driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovate glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks. Libre now has more than 4,000 users internationally. And during the quarter, we obtained national reimbursement status in Japan and the United Kingdom, which represent two of the largest diabetes markets in the world. In the U.S. during the quarter, Libre received U.S. FDA approval as a replacement for blood glucose monitoring. This revolutionary technology is the only system available that comes factory-calibrated, thus eliminating the need for daily finger sticks that are required to calibrate other systems currently available. So, in summary, we exceeded expectations for the quarter and raised the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance, which is now at the upper end of the range we set at the beginning of the year. Our sales growth increased sequentially, and recently launched products are contributing significant growth across our portfolio. And we're particularly pleased with the productivity we're seeing across our new product pipeline, which is delivering a steady cadence of approvals and launches of innovative technologies. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian? Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable basis and do not include Alere, which is consistent with the guidance methodology we've utilized since the beginning of the year. Turning to our results, sales for the third quarter increased 5.6% on an operational basis. Exchange had a positive impact on sales at 0.6%, resulting in a reported sales growth of 6.2% in the quarter. The favorable impact of exchange rates on our sales this quarter was driven primarily by strengthening of the euro and other developed market currencies, which, considering our European cost base and hedging program, have a relatively modest follow through impact on our earnings. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.3% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.9% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expenses was 29.4% of sales. Turning to our outlook for the full year 2017, today we narrowed and raised at the midpoint our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.48 to $2.50. Before reviewing our outlook in more detail, I'd note that Alere, which we acquired earlier this month, is expected to contribute around $475 million dollars to our reported sales, and we forecast a mutual impact on adjusted earnings per share this year. We continue to forecast full year 2017 comparable operational sales growth in the mid-single digits. And based on current exchange rates, would expect exchange to have a positive impact of nearly 0.5% on our full year reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 7.5%, and SG&A expense of approximately 30% of sales. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017, we forecast an adjusted earnings per share of 72 to 74 cents. We forecast comparable operational sales growth in the mid to high single digits, and at current rates, would expect exchange to have a positive impact of somewhat above two% on our fourth quarter [inaudible] [0:12:34] sales. Before I open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our fourth quarter operational sales growth outlook by business. For established pharmaceuticals, we forecast double digit sales growth. In nutrition, we forecast low single digit sales growth. In diagnostics, we forecast sales to increase mid-single digits. And in medical devices, we forecast sales to increase mid to high single digits, which reflects continued double digit growth in diabetes care, as well as several areas in our cardiovascular and neuromodulation business. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press the star and then the number one key on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the pound key. We kindly ask that if you are using a speakerphone, to please pick up the handset before asking your question. And again, that's *1 to ask a question. Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Miles, I was hoping we could touch on two topics. First is Alere, now that it's closed, and second is Libre, now that you have an FDA approval. First, Alere. Can you talk now about how we should think about the outlook for Alere, both top line growth and then accretion? Obviously, everybody's familiar with what you initially were expecting from accretion, with 12 to 13 cents year one, more than 20 cents, year two. But a lot happened with your business over that time. You renegotiated terms, you had to divest some assets. So, I think everybody would appreciate an update on how you're viewing that business, and then we'll circle back on Libre. Thanks. Yeah, I think it's premature, Mike, to get real specific about Alere. We closed the deal a couple of weeks ago literally. And our new management team has taken over the business, but obviously very rapidly getting up to speed, meeting all their employees, going through all the things you do to start integration and so forth. And I'd say, first of all, that's gone very well. The management team we've put in place has moved very quickly, and I have to say, very deliberately to get their hands around everything. But that takes some time. So, as we've said to people, given the timing of when we closed it, we expect no accretion this year, so I wouldn't look for any particular impact on the bottom line in 2017. With regard to '18, since our initial estimates of accretion that were quite some time ago, as you know, when we first announced this deal, because it's taken a very long time to close, there have been a number of changes, including divestitures and so forth. So, I don't want to give you a specific number. I'd say it's fair to think that the accretion will be much more modest than what we initially indicated for the first year. We will get a full year. We'll get a quarter's headstart, and obviously, our intent is to be accretive to our company and our business, so we believe that with the acquisition, we've positioned ourselves as the leader in point of care testing worldwide. All of that has the intent of good solid growth and profit growth for our investors. But I'm gonna be cautious about what I communicate for '18 at this point until we've really had a chance to assess it more thoroughly  And do you think that business kind of as you own it, and call it the pro forma Alere under Abbott, does that business grow in 2018, and is low single digits an appropriate expectation? I think it's a good target. I don't know that we know yet. But that's certainly, I think, an expectation we at Abbott ought to have. And the question is how rapidly we can do that. So, yeah, look, I think it's a fair expectation. And if I was -- and I am -- totally honest with you, yeah, I wouldn't have a lesser expectation. Okay. All right. Let me switch to Libre, if I can, and maybe try asking you a couple questions then. So, one, obviously everybody's excited, not only based on all your success outside the U.S. with Libre, but now that you have this opportunity in the U.S. What would you view as a successful launch for Libre in 2018? Is there something you could characterize [inaudible] [0:17:10] than a number? Is it 50 million? Is it 100 million? If you want to take a stab at that. And then second, what is your expectation for commercial payers? Can you tell us about the conversations you've had and the willingness and the timing that you see commercial payers getting on board? Thanks. Well, I'd say a couple things. Your estimate is -- let's just say your estimate, I'll take, and you gave me a nice range there, so thank you. And I think that you can assume that we'll be looking at this from a lot of perspectives, because we've got a lot of data. Having had a run rate in Europe -- we launched in Europe, and it basically went country by country. We started it as full patient pay, and we had really terrific uptake and consumer interest. And that was the first introduction of Libre to the market. The fact that there was no reimbursement early on was an unknown to us. And it was a new concept and a new way for diabetics to test. And we experienced tremendous demand. Our first year, we were capacity limited, and yet we had a fair bit of demand. The second year, obviously, has gone exceptionally well. And so, as I indicated, we've got over 400,000 customers. It was remarkably well-embraced for reimbursement by government bodies in Europe and regions in Germany, etc. That's extremely gratifying, that the value proposition that we see with Libre is strong, and it's intended to be. And consequently, we believe that part of the appeal is not just what Libre can do and the information that it provides to a diabetic, who's a very informed patient and a very self-managing patient. It provides them tremendous information from just guidance and the management of diabetes. And I know that firsthand. I wear one. And I gotta tell you, it's just a phenomenal device. It's a super product. I can see why consumers like it as much as they do. And that's true for both type ones and type twos. And we're seeing the universally across the board. They use it in different ways, or at least information means something to them in different ways, whether they're managing insulin or whether they're managing diet and exercise and other things. So, I'd say first of all, I expect demand to be pretty strong. Secondly, the U.S. market knows about Libre. It knows a lot about Libre because of all the experience that we've had in the last year in Europe. So, I do expect a more educated, ready, prepared, anticipating, demanding market in the U.S. As relates to payers, which I would call the second dimension of this, I think our value proposition is quite strong. The product is priced at a very economic and affordable level. The intention there is as much and broad access as possible and as rapidly as possible. And I think that value proposition is stunning compared to competitive offerings, and I think that's gonna make it strong. We are in discussions with payers, and we are in discussion with payers about that value proposition, and I believe that will all go very well. I know that's not as much detail as you'd like to have, but it's as much as I'm willing to share at this point, because right now, I would tell you we expect a good strong out of the box performance, like you described. And beyond that, I mean, right now, Mike, we're adding about 50,000 patients a quarter, and that's across a continent that we had to go at one country at a time, one reimbursement system at a time. Of course, the U.S. is quite large, and Japan and the U.K. in addition to this are also quite large. So, I mean, we have a fair amount of optimism, and try not to get too far ahead of ourselves. Sounds good. I have a lot more questions, but I'll let some others jump in. Thank you, Miles. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open. Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. The first thing I wanted to ask about was certainly, it was encouraging that you got MRI conditional labeling for your ICD in the quarter. So, I was hoping we could get an update on how things are going in Somar, and then when we might expect the approval for CRTD, and maybe the ICM as well.  Yeah, I'd say a couple things, Matt. First of all, let me back up and give a bigger context to this. Over the course of the year, there was a lot of skepticism on the part of analysts and/or investors about all the things that we had to get accomplished that were backend loaded. A lot of third quarter, fourth quarter things. And depending on how you're looking at it, it looks pretty daunting. But we all know everything doesn't go right. And the Somar inspection put some of that in doubt. Now, having said that, we stuck to our guns on what our estimates were and our projections were about when we would get product approvals and claim approvals, licensure approvals, and so forth. And the third quarter alone here has been pretty gratifying, in that we basically got every approval we forecasted, and within -- let's call it within 30 days or so of what we forecasted. And I think that's been pretty gratifying, that what we said is what happened. And that includes Libre, that includes the high voltage MRI claim, that includes HeartMate, in includes the closure of Alere, it includes Libre -- it includes a lot of things. I don't generally like being backend loaded because it feels like a lot of risk that everything has to go right. But everything did. And our progress with Somar is no exception, because I've indicated on prior calls our team that has been working with the Somar team and so forth has done an exceptional job. We've provided all information, taken all actions, done all remediation, everything basically done on time, delivered to FTA, discussed with FTA, etc. And at this point, we're just experiencing those new systems, populating them with new experience, new data, new decision making, etc. And all of that is going exactly as planned, exactly as forecasted, exactly as communicated with the FTA, and thus far, without a hiccup. And I think that's recognized by the FTA. I think it's recognized they have discretion. They don't have to license new products out of that facility, but they have. And I think that that is evidence of how we're progressing with Somar, and the fact that the FTA is giving it all the scrutiny that they would and should, and that what we've submitted to them for approvals has been given fair and objective consideration, and we've gotten our approval so far. With that said, the remaining ones, I'm not gonna change my estimates on. I'm not gonna change what we forecasted. I have no reason to believe otherwise. They clearly have the discretion not to, but that's not been our experience. And so, consequently, I remain optimistic that we're on a track that will deliver what we said. Thanks. And I wanted to turn to another thing that you mentioned in the prepared remarks. On China, you said that you're preparing for the regulations, the change in nutrition in the new year, and did improve a little bit sequentially. Could you talk about what kind of opportunity you could have in China if that comes to pass on time with regards to being able to maybe soak up some of the capacity that gets lost as local players have to shut down or change their operations? Well, I'll tell you what. I'm not sure. I would tell you this. First of all, we have the product approvals we need. We're ready for the transition, building inventory for such, etc. So, as far as responding to the new law -- and I think this is true for at least the large multinational competitors, I think most of us, if not all of us, have our product approvals. We're ready to transition, etc. How we all manage that, who knows? But I think at least we are, and I think others are, ready with new approved replacement products, etc., as we've been required to do. So, I think we're all ready for the transition on January 1st. What you can't know very well, at least about everybody else, is how much inventory everybody has in various channels -- how long that transition'll take for any given competitor and so forth. We're comfortable with our inventory levels. We're comfortable with our inventory levels both on current product and post-Jan. 1st product. So, we're comfortable with what we think we have to do with our own transition. What's hard to project is not just multinationals, but all the hundreds of other Chinese competitors that are facing the same regulations. So, I'd say we've seen a stabilizing of China. It hasn't been as choppy as it was in the last two years. I'd say our estimates around market growth are hard to pin down. We were more conservative on market growth than recent data we've seen. Market growth is better than we indicated or better than we believe, or better than we thought, and we're looking pretty closely at all the sources of our market data, because there are many, and they're not all perfectly comprehensive across all channels and in all sources of products, or even all geographies. So, it's a hard one. China's a particularly difficult one to pin down because there are a number of channels. There are a lot of competitors. There are a lot of data sources. It's not like going to A.C. Nielsen in the U.S. or something. So, I'm cautious about it. I think we've seen the tough part, and I think we're going back into a phase where it's the same kind of end to end competition we've opened across multiple channels. I like that. I think that's better, because at least then whether we do well or don't do well is a function of our execution. I haven't been particularly pleased with our execution, and I don't exclude a number of other countries where we do see soft market conditions, but I also see less than great execution on our part. So, this business is getting a lot of attention from us and from all of us top to bottom. And it will get some attention. I think it's probably the one soft spot in our release. I think a lot of things are going awfully well, as I just commented to you in the device area. But this one's gonna get a lot more attention. I feel that China is at least reasonably stable or predictable. We haven't been right about the market growth rates. Those look better than we expected. So, that's a plus. And I guess I'll just leave it there. Great. Thanks, Miles. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi, thanks and good morning. So, first, I just wanted to clarify something you said on Alere. Obviously, I heard you that the accretion for '18 will be lower than you originally thought. That's not surprising. But I just wanted to confirm, do you still think it'll be accretive in 2018? And is roughly half the original accretion a reasonable placeholder? Yeah, I expect it to be accretive. We've got a lot of work to do to identify our synergies and identify our growth opportunities. We're going through a reorganization of the business right now, and I mean, that's actually gonna be a plus. I don't want to describe how it was organized, because I think that's kind of a waste of time and will take a long time. But we went through a restructuring of the ordering structure of St. Jude. And we did it within six months, and as you know, organized integrated business units that -- I'd say that organization is still kind of setting. The glue is still kind of setting. But we moved to it within six months. That might have been aggressive, but the organization's very stable. The restructuring activities that we had to go through and a lot of synergizing as far as people go -- we've gone through changes in management, we've gone through -- etc. That all got done at about the six-month level at St. Jude. It all got done at Alere in six days. So, that's a running start. And what we're moving to, I think it's an organization -- look, all organizations, all people want to do well. They want to achieve. They want to grow. They want to be proud of the businesses they're running. They do want to do well. And I'd say our early days with the employees of Alere have been positive. And we announced that we're gonna go to that kind of a structure. We've announced how we're gonna do it, why we're gonna do it, etc. And I think that's well-received at this point. So, as far as we look into 2018, I think your question about is half of that a good placeholder, yeah, it's a good placeholder. I can't tell you with any precision that that's what it'll be. But I think it's a good placeholder. Okay. That's very helpful, thank you. And then I'm sure there will be a lot of other questions on Libre. But I wanted to focus on the rest of the pipeline for a second, because there are a number of other things in addition to Libre that could help in 2018. And you touched on the MRI Safe approvals. But I just want kind of ask specifically on some of the other things that you've got in the pipeline, and just to make sure that the timelines and your thoughts on those haven't changed at all relative to what you've been saying previously. And so, that would include things like the new stents that you talked about, Sierra, the Confirm implantable cardiac monitor that's entering what is a very attractive market. And so, I'm just curious on those couple things that the timeline's still the same as what you've been saying previously. Well, a couple things. First of all, with regard to Sierra, the stent, yeah, same schedule, no change. That'll be first quarter of the year, we think. And with regard to Confirm, it's partly approved already. As you may understand, it gets approved in pieces, and so far, so good. There are some peripheral pieces we are waiting for approval on. But the first and very critical portion of that is approved, so yeah, I think that's -- so far, everything we've seen is very encouraging, and no change. No change. So, Confirm can be a full launch in 2018? Well, right now, that's what I'd bet on. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. That's all I have. Okay. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Seful. Your line is open. Good morning, Miles. Miles, just after a solid quarter, again, coming out in '17 to the upper end of the range, I know it's early to put all this pieces together in '18. But as I reflect on it, in '18, with multiple large new product opportunities, launching St. Jude, Alere working, shouldn't we expect at least similar top line growth and potentially better, if not accelerating top line growth against -- especially when you think about some of the headwinds you've faced and worked through in '17? Is that the right way to think about it? I'm trying to think about how to sound conservative to you. Look, we got our acquisitions closed. We're gonna have a number of product approvals that happened in the third quarter and fourth quarter that obviously should hit their stride. I mean, ideally, you look at '18, and you'd like to have your product approvals exactly where we got them, going into the next year. We got a really good 2017. We beat all expectations, not just in the numbers, but in the approvals. And you all have to admit you had a lot of skepticism about some of this. And maybe rightly so, after 2016. But look, we've hit every target we had for this year. And with all those approvals, one ought to think that should bode positively for 2018. That said, we go through our budgeting every year. It's kind of a negotiating hustle with our managers around the world about what's possible in their given markets and so forth. But yeah, we ought to have pretty good momentum going into '18. What can I say? All the organic R&D projects, and system projects, and launches, and approvals, and so forth, they're all happening. And the Alinity products, probably most miraculously, five of those have begun their launch process in Europe, and they'll start in the U.S. next year. That's been a huge, huge undertaking. We're extremely excited about Libre. We're excited about all the medical device products. Everything that St. Jude represented to Abbott about its pipeline has come to fruition and is coming to fruition. And so, we're very, very bullish about all that, and I think there's an awful lot of validation in this about that acquisition. We don't know as much about Alere yet, but we will. And whether it's a big impact during '18, or if it's beyond '18, either way, I think we're pretty happy to have that business. So, Rick, I think your assessment's right. I mean, it'd be kind of hard for me to say, no, it's gonna be a tough year. All right. Well, that's a great answer, and I'll take it. Another big picture reflection. One of the concerns, obviously, with two major acquisitions was balance sheet, cash flow. But my sense is, in the first half, at least, you ran ahead of your cash flow generation commitments and goals. Can you give us any feeling about how the third quarter went? Remind us what your targets are in terms of leverage, and just again, as we think about the next six, 12 months, where do you think you'll be from a leverage and cash position? Thank you. Any color would be welcome. Okay. Well, first, I'd tell you that this got great leadership and attention from our CFO and our EVPs and SVPs from day one. And I'm gonna let him answer that question, because they've exceeded all of our targets, not just by a little, but a lot. Cash flow is strong, and I'll let him tell you about it.  All right, thanks, Miles. Yeah, we continue to make great progress in our programs. If you recall, I talked about operating cash flow being around four-and-a-half billion for the full year. I won't quote you an exact number for Q3, but I think you'll safely assume that when you see the quarter filed, that we are well on track to that, and I would say ahead of it. And so, we are going to continue to make that progress. As you talk about some of the ratios, I think it's important to keep in mind both that and that debt. So, at the end of the year, we projected a debt to EBITDA dollar ratio of around four. However, when you look at the cash flow programs and look at our net debt position, we'll be closer to three when you look at the net debt as a ratio to EBITDA. So, we're in great shape, and we want to keep the momentum going, because this is the number one priority to build max strategic flexibility here. I think, Rick, I would comment -- I just want to get a commercial out there. This all gets even better if there's tax reforms. So, I'm hopeful. I wouldn't put it odds on it anymore than anybody else watching our government. But we are extremely hopeful of a territorial system that gives us access to our cash flows and earnings around the world at a reasonable rate and at a competitive rate. And that does make a difference to us in addressing current debt and cash flows. But cash flow itself? Super good. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.  Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on a strong quarter. Just two. One, it was noteworthy that you didn't mention the impact from the weather. You still had a strong quarter despite the weather. I imagine it had to have some impact. So, is there any color you can provide? And I have one follow-up. Yeah, it did. I would comment on a couple of things. First of all, it was a strange quarter for us, in that multiple hurricanes, whether in the Texas Gulf Coast or across Puerto Rico, impacted anybody who had operations there. The earthquake in Mexico impacted us. The brushfires and forest fires in California actually impacted us the day after we closed the Alere -- a key Alere facility there. And to be honest, it was more an impact on our employees than on our plant operations. We had a little bit of roof damage and a little water leakage here and there. But it would appear the hurricane affected different countries different ways going across Puerto Rico, because I've noted that some competitors have indicated more damage or more impact than we've experienced. It took a superhuman effort by a lot of our people to try to address some of that, which we did. The biggest issue was access to power generation in Puerto Rico. And our folks addressed that really rapidly, and we're very happy about that. Our plants are -- I guess back up and running is the right way to say it. There's one that we're starting this week, and we're back up, is what it amounts to. And so, I would call it a modest impact. It's affected us, I'd say, at a modest level, not a material level. Our first priority was to find all of our people and aid them, which we've done. And so, in Puerto Rico, we have not experienced the kind of disruption that some others have. I noted that another large healthcare company yesterday I think had similar comments, that they've been able to address it. We're kind of large in Puerto Rico, so it could have been worse, but it wasn't. And the St. Jude facilities that we inherited there with the acquisition of St. Jude were not particularly impacted. I mean, they were, but not to the degree we might have expected. I mean, everything has been more about power generation than damage. And unfortunately, that's not true for our employees, and it's not true for some other competitors, and I wouldn't wish that on anybody. But we've been pretty fortunate to get everything back up and running. So, we don't have an impact to report for the fourth quarter that we haven't somehow managed or absorbed already in our estimates. The facility that was threatened in California was not damaged. We were able to move things out of that facility and prepare for damage, but there wasn't damage. And so, we'll be back up and running soon. We did have employees who unfortunately lost homes and so forth, and we're dealing with that as a company. But from the standpoint of the operation of the business, we are in good shape, relatively speaking, and to the extent that there's any impact, we've already included it in our estimates for this quarter and absorbed it. That's good to hear. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about whether RX management -- it's the one business where if you improve that dramatically, it could really impact positively your growth. So, I'm just curious what your expectations are for that business going forward. Could it be potentially flat in 2018, and just if you could clarify or confirm RX is gonna be booked in that line or not? Thanks for taking the questions.   Okay. I'm gonna have Scott answer that one for you. Good morning, Larry. Yeah, as you know, on the MRI Safe side, we continue to see good progress on the pacemaker. We received approval for the ICD very late in the quarter, so that certainly didn't have an impact this quarter, here in the third quarter. But we do expect it to have an impact, a positive impact, in the fourth quarter. So, yes, I do think you will see a nice step up in growth, starting, quite frankly, next quarter, and then as we move into 2018.   And it's gratifying that our experience with the pacemaker has matched our experience in Japan and Europe with the MRI approvals in terms of share recovery and so forth. So, I think that bodes well for the ICD as well. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Glen Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Miles, you guys are doing a great job in terms of cash flow generation. You're gonna get to your targets faster for 2018. But it sounds from Brian's commentary that 2018 is not gonna be any type of deal here. It's gonna be paying down debt. Is that a fair assumption, or do you actually have more flexibility, that if something does pop up that's really interesting, that you can do it next year? Then I have just some housekeeping questions after that. Well, let me answer it this way. I don't really want the organization focused on M&A right now. And I think I'd give you that answer regardless of what Brian said about debt and cash flow and so forth. And secondly, I wouldn't forecast it even if I had it in my gun sights. My experience with you guys over the past 19 years has been you like to have some indication of what's coming. And usually, I surprised you with most of the acquisitions or other things that we've done. That hasn't always been particularly well received, but they've always turned out pretty well. But I generally don't like to forecast where we're going and what we're going until we announce it. And so, I probably wouldn't tell you anyway. But is there some power for next year, or is next year really, let's focus on St. Jude, let's focus on Alere before we think about anything else?   Well, honestly, I think there is a focus on St. Jude and Alere. And right now, that is paying off. Look, the focus on St. Jude, it's clearly paying off. The focus on Alere will pay off. The focus on the internal product launches of Alinity and so forth, these things will pay off. These are fundamental drivers of sustained growth. I mean, if the hallmark and the identity of the company is sustained growth, and we target double digit earnings growth every single year, your organic performance, both in terms of R&D, pipeline, commercial performance, etc., has to be sustainable. And that is where the focus is. And we've acquired a couple of businesses that initially were criticized as not growth, and I beg to differ. And I think that we're demonstrating so far with St. Jude that there's a terrific pipeline and growth and share gain, etc., and I think you can see that. And you can see that in the initial couple of quarters here, so yeah, I think there's gonna be a lot of focus on not just St. Jude and Alere, but the fundamental organic performance of all of our business. It took a while for analysts and investors to appreciate the uniqueness of our strategy in established pharma, and I think it sort of called out that there's a segment of pharma that's not commodity generic, that's branded generic, that's higher market and higher growth, etc., in pretty key markets around the world. And right now, that's our fastest growing business, other than neuromod. And the neuromod's hard to touch. But we're growing that business at double digits. But the team is doing a terrific job. Those markets represent the kind of opportunity we said they did. And those kinds of growths, from an operating standpoint, growth rates out of the business, that's what you want. So, to some point, if we can add to our footprints and add to our strategies, if we want to be in a flexible position to do that, we obviously want to get to a position where we have the strategic flexibility that we've always felt we had. So, I don't think it's a bad idea for us to focus on the operations, keep pushing our cash flow, keep pushing that debt down. So, that's where the focus will be next year. And I think we get ourselves back to strategic flexibility quicker that way, which is a good thing. Yeah. Okay, and just -- I agree with everything you just said. Just some housekeeping that's maybe for Scott. You said Portico, you finished enrolling, that's the U.S. trial. Would that put you on pace for a 2019 U.S. launch? And then I think you talked about Mitro, which is the Tendine program, and I think you said you started enrolling. Is that enrolling in the European trial, and then is there an update on the start of the U.S. trial? Thanks. I'm gonna let Scott answer that.   Sure. Glen, on Portico, we would expect to file in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2019, to your question, so now you have the regulatory process after that. With respect to the Tendine in Europe, we expect to complete enrollment here in the first quarter. It's a one year endpoint, so you can kind of do that math after that. We're on the 2020 range or so on approval on the Tendine product. Really great opportunity, though, really. And the structural heart portfolio here in portfolio has really come together with the [inaudible] [0:49:01] which St. Jude brought to bear here, so we're excited about Avonaterm.   Yeah, it's a really good one to note. I mean, that's one that came out of our own venture group from our own investments and so forth. And we've been able to combine these things with St. Jude in a way that I think is pretty synergistic, pretty favorable. So, we're pretty excited about that one. Any update on when you start a U.S. trial for Tendine? Yeah. We could initiate a U.S. trial here in 2018. Okay, great. Thank you. Okay, thanks. Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator  Thank you. And our final question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.  Thank you. Good morning. Miles, I thought I'd end on a couple of questions on growth. And I guess I'm a little surprised the neuromodulation has not come up in this call, given it's been the biggest growth driver for St. Jude this year, 50% growth through the first three quarters. I think every single quarter, we expect that growth rate to come in a little bit. It's been extremely durable across the three quarters. Can you just give us a sense of factors that are driving that growth and sort of how you think about the sustainability of that growth into 2018? And I have a quick follow-up for Scott. I mean, I think anybody that claimed a 50% growth rate was sustainable would be an idiot, but -- so, I'm not gonna be one. Look, we're very pleased with the performance of neuromod. I think it's obviously drive by the fact we've got three great products there. They're being exceptionally well received by the market. They have an impact on real life on patients and their pain levels. We're seeing great real world results from Burst and ERG. I think it's a really great group of products and a strong organization. I think that products hit a segment that's in crying need of improvements for patients, and particularly at a time when pain drugs and so forth are a national issue. So, I don't know. I think the new products are driving the growth, and the execution's been strong. The uptake's been strong. We've had three quarters in a row of 50% or better growth. How long will it be like that? We'll start to lap it, and the law of big numbers will start to diminish the growth rat. But the actual raw growth will still be pretty strong. So, I don't know. I like what we see, but it's hard for me to hold it up as an example to all the other businesses that you should do this.  Sure, very clear. And then, hey, Brian or Scott, just to wrap up here, into the fourth quarter, because I think it could set the tone for investors as they think about next year's growth rate, you're certainly guiding to sequential acceleration, sort of mid to high. Can you just kind of run through kind of sequentially, what are those key components that get that acceleration? Because as I said, I think it sets the tone for '18. Thanks so much.  Hey, I'll take this. I think it's just been what Miles has talked about, the continued growth of our brand and generics business. It's been performing at the double digit range, and I think you should expect more of the same there. If we look in diagnostics, to sustain what you're doing, we do expect improvement of that business over time as we continue to roll out our Alinity platforms across the globe. Diabetes care, you know that story. It's growing very strong, and we're excited to bring that here to the U.S. And most notably -- and I mentioned this in my guidance on the medical device side -- that's where the step-up is, where I talked about a mid to high single digit, and Scott kind of brought color to that by saying you should expect further sequential improvement on the Sierra RM side of the business. Because we've always had the magic formula, is just bring that back to flat, and the double digit growth of all these high growth areas will shine through and deliver five or six% on our medical device business. Those are really the key catalysts here, so we're looking forward to a good fourth quarter here. Okay. Thanks so much. Very good. Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. And that concludes Abbott's conference call. A replay of this call will be available after 11:00 AM Central Time today on Abbott's investor relations website at abbottinvestor.com.

    Abbott Laboratories Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call Transcript (ABT) -- The Motley Fool

  "
"Rich Duprey, Travis Hoium, and Brian Feroldi",10262017,Fool,10192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There are worse investment strategies than copying the stock picks of investing legends. Following the lead of Warren Buffett can offer especially rich returns because he has a buy-and-hold philosophy that means you can expect these stocks to grow immensely in value over the years. While many times Buffett employs tactics unavailable to the average investor, Moody's (NYSE:MCO), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) are stocks the Oracle of Omaha owns that are still worth buying. Image source: Getty Images. Brian Feroldi (Moody's): Warren Buffett is infinitely quotable, but one of my all-time favorites is the following: When I dig through Buffett's portfolio, I can't help but think that Moody's easily qualifies as a ""wonderful"" business. Moody's is a credit rating agency and financial services provider that has been a market leader for decades. When a company or government wants to issue a bond, one of their first steps is to get the bond rated. More often than not, that causes them to give Moody's a call. Moody's then rates the bond and collects a healthy fee for its trouble. MCO Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Image source: Apple. Travis Hoium (Apple): Believe it or not, Warren Buffett's third biggest holding within Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) is Apple. The stake is relatively new, acquired in only the past two years, but Buffett currently controls $18.8 billion of Apple stock, or 2.5% of the company. Only stakes in Kraft Heinz and Wells Fargo are bigger. What makes Apple such a good Buffett stock that's worth buying is the company's wide moat and huge cash hoard. At the end of the fiscal third quarter, Apple had $261.5 billion in cash and investments and a net cash level of $171.7 billion. On top of that stable balance sheet, Apple generated $51.2 billion in free cash flow over the past year and is paying a $0.63 dividend per share, or 1.6% dividend yield. While the balance sheet is great, the moat is arguably more important to Buffett. Apple's iPhone business is at the center of its operations and creates a platform that Macs, iPads, and Apple Watches are sold from. With the easy interoperability and lock-in of things like iTunes, the App Store, and iCloud, Apple can keep customers in the ecosystem for years. And regular new product launches drive a profitable upgrade cycle that keeps cash coming in. That's exactly the kind of company Warren Buffett loves. Image source: Getty Images. Rich Duprey (Costco): Shares of warehouse retailer Costco are getting crushed despite beating analysts estimates on the top and bottom lines. At a time when most retailers are feeling the impact on their business from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Costco continues putting up stellar numbers. Yet the market is clearly worried about the effect Amazon is having on Costco membership numbers, which slowed in the latest period. While Costco attributes that more to no longer accepting American Express and raising fees this year (something it does periodically), Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods and deeper forays into online grocery shopping has investors worried. Yet it's not as though Costco is completely ignoring the threat. Costco offers same-day delivery of dry and fresh goods via Instacart, and it just launched Costco Grocery, a new platform where members can get two-day delivery for non-perishables and sundries, with free shipping on orders over $75. It's true that Costco largely ignored the e-commerce channel as it considered its business to be Amazon-resistant, if not Amazon-proof, but as many are learning, that's not the case. To its credit, management has woken up to that fact and is moving quickly to address it. Buffett owns about 1% of Costco's outstanding shares, valued at around $670 million. At 26 times earnings, the warehouse retailer is trading at around the market multiple, and with a business that really hasn't been damaged by its online rival, it's a Buffett stock still worth buying.

    3 Warren Buffett Stocks Still Worth Buying -- The Motley Fool

  "
Maria LaMagna,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 25, 2017 12:44 p.m. ET It will become harder for consumers to sue their banks or companies like Equifax By Consumers may have a harder time suing financial companies they feel have wronged them. The Senate voted Tuesday night to overturn a rule the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau worked on for more than five years. The final version of the rule banned companies from putting “mandatory arbitration clauses” in their contracts, language that prohibits consumers from bringing class-action lawsuits against them. It applies to institutions that sell financial products, including bank accounts and credit cards.

Now that Senate has done the same, the resolution goes to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it into law, and companies will maintain the ability to put arbitration clauses in their contracts. The Senate vote was “a giant setback for every consumer in this country,” said the CFPB’s Director Richard Cordray. “It preserves a two-tiered justice system where banks can have their day in court but deny their customers the same right.” Here’s what consumers should know: What is the forced arbitration rule? Many consumer advocates, in addition to the CFPB, favored the bureau’s rule. Mandatory arbitration clauses typically say that companies or customers must resolve disputes through privately appointed individuals known as arbitrators, but not through the court system, allowing companies to save time and money and avoid negative publicity. When consumers sign forced arbitration clauses, which they may not realize are included in contracts, they waive their right to participate in a class-action lawsuit against companies. Why are class-action suits important? Cordray had argued that class-action suits are one of the few courses of action consumers can take against companies, particularly when the arguments are over relatively small amounts of money. Only about 2% of consumers with credit cards said they would consult an attorney or consider formal legal action to resolve a small-dollar dispute, according to the CFPB. Separately, 89% of consumers said they wanted the right to participate in class-action suits against their banks, when the Philadelphia-based nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts surveyed about 1,000 consumers in 2016. Why did lawmakers vote for mandatory arbitration? Those who opposed the rule, including a group of Republican senators led by Mike Crapo, a senator from Idaho who is the chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, said the CFPB is too powerful. He had also criticized the CFPB’s research process in creating the rule. The Senate's vote against the CFPB’s rule “is a win for consumers,” said Rob Nichols, the president and CEO of the trade group American Bankers Association. “As we and others made clear in our multiple comments to the CFPB, the rule was always going to harm consumers and not help them.” But Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts who is a proponent of the CFPB, has said the rule would have allowed “working families to hold big banks accountable when they’re cheated.” Warren sent letters to the CEOs of major financial firms this year to question their silence on the rule. “If your lobbyists are taking such strong positions against the rule, is there a reason both you and your bank have been unwilling to take a public position?” she wrote. How did the CFPB rule impact the Equifax fallout? Mandatory arbitration became relevant during the recent controversy over credit agency Equifax, which experienced a data breach that impacted more than 145 million U.S. adults’ personal data. Consumers noticed that when they signed up for Equifax’s monitoring services after the breach, the company originally had a forced arbitration clause in its contract. After consumers and advocates raised alarm, the company removed that language. It was “a prime example of why we need the CFPB rule,” said George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumers Union, a consumer advocacy group based in Yonkers, N.Y. Will it impact class-action suits against Wells Fargo? Consumer advocates also often cite the controversy around Wells Fargo opening bank accounts in customers’ names as an argument in favor of a forced arbitration rule. In the aftermath, consumers joined class-action lawsuits against the bank, and wouldn’t be able to if they were prohibited by a contract. But those against the rule said the CFPB was too slow to identify the problems at Wells Fargo, turning that case into evidence of the CFPB’s ineffectiveness. The CFPB did not immediately respond to MarketWatch’s question about whether the Senate’s vote will impact existing class-action suits against companies. But Lisa Gilbert, the vice president of legislative affairs at Public Citizen, a nonprofit based in Washington, D.C., said the Senate vote shouldn’t impact cases that are already ongoing. However, there will “certainly” be more forced arbitration clauses in contracts in the future, and fewer cases brought against companies, she said. What can consumers do now? “Senate Republicans voted to give companies like Wells Fargo and Equifax a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Karl Frisch, the executive director of Allied Progress, a consumer watchdog organization based in Washington, D.C. “This repeal will hurt millions of consumers.” Consumers can still submit complaints to the CFPB about company practices they believe are unfair, on the CFPB’s website. “I urge President Trump to stand with consumers and veto this resolution,” Cordray said.

                                  said last week it is planning to spend $7 billion to $8 billion on content next year, up from $6 billion in 2017. Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said plans include the release of 80 films in 2018, a particularly startling number when compared with the 106 films the six major Hollywood studios combined released last year. See: Hollywood has never seen competition like Netflix Also:  Netflix plans huge movie push as it faces post-Disney reality The new 10.5-year bonds will mature in 2028 and priced at a yield of 4.875%, Neflix said in a statement. That was in line with early price talk and above its outstanding 4.375% notes that mature in 2026, the closest maturity to the new notes. Those notes were trading at 99.50 cents on the dollar Tuesday to yield 4.442%, compared with 101.44 cents on Friday, according to MarketAxess. The deal is the streaming giant’s biggest so far, exceeding its May issuance of €1.3 billion ($1.53 billion) of euro-denominated bonds that mature in May 2027. Moody’s rates Netflix at B1, while S&P rates it at B-plus, both four notches into speculative, or “junk,” status. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo were bookrunners on the deal.

The report, “Remaking the bank for an ecosystem world,” notes the tepid “new normal” state of play for banking in the post-financial crisis world. “The industry is bogged down in a flat and uninspiring performance rut,” the McKinsey authors wrote. What’s more, it seems to be getting worse.

While there was a slowdown in big brands like Timberland—due to a shift in the timing of the fall order book—and a lack of visibility in the U.S. jeanswear business, the Vans brand had “record-setting growth,” according to VF Corp. Chief Executive Steven Rendle. Vans reported a 26% revenue increase for the quarter, helped by a more than doubling of sales for the iconic black-and-white checkerboard and Old Skool designs, a new franchise, called UltraRange, that beat expectations during the back-to-school period and a new “aspirational boutique” known as The General opening in Brooklyn. Read also:  Teens are spending their money on Amazon and Adidas, while Nike loses favor “Some of you may be wondering whether this level of growth for Vans is sustainable,” Rendle said on the Monday earnings call, according to the FactSet transcript. “While we see a strong growth trajectory for this brand as we move into 2018, the year-over-year comparisons are going to be difficult. Then again, over the past six years the Vans brand has grown at a mid-teen rate, so comparisons have always been somewhat difficult.” Last year, the brand gained viral fame outside of any company action, when the liftoff of the “Damn Daniel” meme drove a spike in sales of white Vans sneakers. Don’t miss: American teenagers, just like their parents, crave this status symbol more than ever Rendle said the company now expects about 15% growth for the Vans brand in 2017. The previous outlook was on the high end of the low-double-digit range. “Direct-to-consumer continues to be a highlight across the brand globally, and inventories remain healthy, as management continues to see strong growth trajectory as they get into 2018,” wrote Wells Fargo analysts led by Ike Boruchow in a Monday note. Analysts highlighted the 30% growth in direct-to-consumer sales and the 60% digital growth for the quarter. Analysts note “softness” in the Lee jeans business, calling the jeanswear category “the lone issue” for the company. But otherwise, the company delivered on heightened expectations. Also:  Under Armour and Gap add to the growing list of Stitch-Fix-style subscription services “Specifically, the company provided another beat and raise quarter, including the second straight top-line beat (after two years of misses) with better gross margins as well,” the Wells Fargo note said. “Clearly momentum is building, as growth continues to accelerate across all channels, while VF Corp. continues to focus/invest in their highly productive direct-to-consumer business (+17% in Q3).” Wells Fargo rates VF Corp. shares market perform with a $67 price target.

Baby wipes volumes were down in the mid-single digits compared with double-digit growth last year. “[I]t is what it is, and those babies aren’t born this year, and they won’t be in the category next year or the year after that,” said Thomas Falk, Kimberly-Clark chief executive on the Monday earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.

With that in mind, the company believes “being sharp and competitive on price is even more important, so we’ve probably invested a little bit more there.” Read:  The future of grocery shopping is all about data Government data covered in global media has analyzed the birthrate issues facing both countries. An August Quartz story quotes census numbers showing that the number of people over the age of 65 in South Korea reached 6.8 million in 2016, equal to the number of people up to the age of 14. And the birthrate in the U.S. dipped to a record low in 2016 of 62 births per 1,000 women of childbearing age, with births among teenagers falling to the lowest point for the age group since at least 1940. J.P. Morgan analysts believe the birthrate declines in both countries will put pressure on sales growth until trends shift. “Importantly, we see near-term birth rate declines as a profitability headwind longer term as training pants for older children bring higher margins to Kimberly-Clark than diapers for infants,” analysts led by Andrea Teixeira wrote in a note. Even if birthrates grow, the impact will likely pressure profitability for longer, analysts said.

Macquarie Research analysts led by Caroline Levy note the declining birthrate in the U.S. due to delayed childbearing by millennials, calling the baby market here “challenging” with “diapers and wipes facing greater private label competition.” In South Korea, the birthrate is “inexplicably down 7% to 9%,” the note said, figures Falk also highlighted on the call. “Additionally, the quickening pace of e-commerce uptake in the U.S. and around the developed world will likely result in more aggressive pricing, given that per capita consumption rates are high and birth rates are modest,” the note said. “This shift online also allows private label and local competitors to vie for parents’ wallets.

That’s the bad news—and the good news. There is no shortage of risk on Wall Street, and cautious investors can point to any number of factors—including high valuations, geopolitical tensions, and policy uncertainty surrounding both the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government—as a reason why the market’s seemingly unending bull market could come to a screeching halt. Such headwinds could limit the market’s upside potential. At the same time, however, the mere acknowledgment of such concerns could diminish how risky they actually are, as the more investors fret about them, the more they’re priced into shares. “We do not expect an imminent drawdown, but the risks identified most frequently by clients may limit medium-term S&P 500

However, the investment bank added: “Persistently cautious investor sentiment is one reason we expect limited downside from any economic or policy-related disappointment.” Read more: Stocks are incredibly overbought—why that’s not nearly as scary as it sounds Don’t miss: What could derail the stock-market rally? Here’s one thing to watch Goldman has previously stated that because investor euphoria is “nonexistent, an imminent start of a long decline seems unlikely.” However, the analysts did see reasons why the market could struggle going forward, noting that the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index was above 60, a strong reading that nevertheless “typically marks the peak of growth and presages economic and equity deceleration.” “Investors buying the S&P 500 at ISM readings of 60 or higher have gone on to suffer negative three- and six-month returns on average as economic activity slowed,” wrote David Kostin, the firm’s chief U.S. equity strategist. “In other words, an environment of synchronized global growth acceleration today raises the risk of coordinated global slowdown tomorrow.” Despite that, it speculated that near-term market direction would be dependent on whether tax reform passes in Washington, saying the issue was “the key potential upside and downside risk to equity markets.” “We estimate tax cuts could lift 2018 earnings per share by 7%…, suggesting that tax reform optimism has contributed to the 5% S&P 500 rally since late August,” Goldman wrote. “If developments in Washington lift the odds of tax reform closer to 100%, or hint at larger cuts than we currently expect, S&P 500 could continue to rise toward 2,650. On the other hand, a collapse in expectations would likely mean the reversal of the market’s recent 5% rally.” Other institutions joined Goldman in seeing near-term risks. The Wells Fargo Investment Institute wrote that “this is a good time to take profits from U.S. equities and reallocate to areas of the markets where allocations are below target weightings.” It added that valuations “appear more reasonable” for overseas markets. Morgan Stanley noted that the 14-day relative strength index for the S&P 500 has been above 70 for 15 straight days, a level it said was considered “overbought territory from a momentum perspective.” In the past, such rallies have been followed by pullbacks in the subsequent 30 days, with a median decline of 4.5%. “We now believe the market may take a pause here before ultimately ascending to 2,700 early next year,” the investment bank wrote. A pause is long overdue, historically speaking. It has been 20 months since the most recent S&P 500 correction, defined as a 10% drop from a peak, and 332 trading days (16 months) since the latest drop of 5%, the fourth-longest such streak in history. Historically, there is a 5% drop every 92 days, on average. Even smaller dips have been nonexistent. The S&P 500 hasn’t had a 3% decline in more than 11 months, the longest such streak ever, and it has gone 33 straight days without a 0.5% decline, “the longest streak since 1995,” according to LPL Financial. Beyond the bull market, the U.S. economy overall has been enjoying an atypically long period of growth. Bespoke Investment Group noted that the current economic expansion “has now joined the 100-month club,” a rare occurrence, and more than twice the average length of expansions, which is 46 months. Going back to 1900, there have only been two expansions that lasted for longer, with the lengthiest, at 120 months, starting in March 1991. While the bull market started in March 2009, when the stock market bottomed after the financial crisis, the economy resumed expanding in June 2009.

Alessandra Malito,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 19, 2017 12:40 p.m. ET The authors, as well as the characters, are rarely people of color By When it comes to romance novels, people of color are underrepresented, and it isn’t just the characters on the covers or in the pages that lack diversity — it’s the authors too. Only a small percentage of romance novels by major publishers were written by people of color in 2016, according to a recent report on the state of racial diversity in romance publishing by Culver City, Calif.-based brick-and-mortar romance bookstore The Ripped Bodice. The bookstore owners asked publishers to provide their lists. The owners, sisters Bea and Leah Koch, conducted the study after noticing the lack of options available to customers seeking books by people of color. Only three of 20 publishers who reported their statistics had more than 10% of romance books published by people of color, while half of the publishers surveyed had fewer than 5% of their romance books written by people of color. It’s been a problem for a long time,” said Farrah Rochon, a black romance novelist based in New Orleans, who has been in the romance writing business for 10 years. The problem lies in what publishers choose to publish, what bookstores choose to promote, as well as what readers choose to read, she said. Also see:  It’s getting harder for white supremacists to find romance online Diversity in romance novels is similar to another subsection of literature: children’s books. Around 28% of all children’s books are by or about people of color, up from 10% in 1997, according to Lee and Low Books, a multicultural children’s book publisher. The same publisher conducted a study in 2015 and found 80% of more than 40 publishers and review journals self-identified as white. It wasn’t that much of a shock to Harper Miller, another romance author. “It is very rare, and I mean rare, to see people of color represented on the cover, or an author of color’s work being depicted,” she said. Will it change? Yes, the authors said, but it’ll take some time. In the meantime, there are plenty of established authors of color who represent various walks of life and perspectives. Beverly Jenkins, a black author who writes historical romance books with many black characters; Sonali Dev, an Indian author who has published novels focused on Bollywood; Courtney Milan, who includes characters with disabilities and all backgrounds; Rebekah Weatherspoon, a queer black author; and Jeannie Lin, who writes novels focused on Chinese characters, according to WomenWriteAboutComics.com. “Hopefully it will get better,” Rochon said. Why is diversity such a problem in romance novel publishing? There’s a myth that certain types of authors write books that only appeal to certain audiences, such as Asian-American authors writing for Asian-American readers, or gay authors writing for gay readers, said Voda Engstrand, director of communications at Kensington Publishing Corp, the publishing house that had the highest representation of books published by people of color last year (19.8%). Publishers don’t market books by people of color the same way they do other novelists, and sales represent that, the authors said. “It’s awful, but this typecasting of authors and readers happens at every level, and not just within the publishing houses,” she said. “Many bookstores, libraries, reviewers and members of the media — whether consciously or not — look at a book and instantly try to fit it into some mold.” Readers do the same thing, she said. What will it take for the industry to change? Publishers need to embrace more authors of color, Miller said, citing Kensington as one of the few actually making moves in their staffing and publishing. She suggested that publishing houses should revamp their hiring processes as well as how they review submissions. One strategy: start at the college level and reach out to historically black universities to offer paid internships so aspiring authors and editors who want to break into the industry. Stores should market all books by all types of authors, not just best sellers, Miller said. Getting some books publicity and into stores is difficult, and some stores “segregate” their books, Engstrand said. Romance novels written by people of color would go in a multicultural section rather than the romance section. Also see: Why American teenagers are not interested in adult activities like sex, drinking — or working Why does it matter? Romance novels are becoming more popular, and accounted for a quarter of traditional publisher’s e-book sales in the U.S. in 2016, up from 19% in 2010, according to research firm Nielsen. Given that upward trend, the number might be even larger if including self-published novels. Organizations are starting to take note and help resolve the issue. Romance Writers of America, a nonprofit trade association, has a grant for romance authors from historically underrepresented backgrounds to attend its annual conference for development and networking, and recently held a Diversity Summit with industry professionals and romance authors to discuss strategies for improving promotion of books by and featuring people of color. Readers can make a difference too Readers are also responsible for changing the industry, Engstrand and Rochon said. “Every reader who walks into a store and buys a romance novel by an author of color, or goes to their local library and requests a book by Jamie Pope or Sonali Dev or Priscilla Oliveras, or recommends one of these books to their friends — those readers are making change happen,” Engstrand said. By not catering to people of color, this part of the industry is neglecting a much-underserved market. The majority of romance novel readers are white, according to a 2014 online survey of romance readers by book and website Dangerous Books for Girls. About 86% of respondents said they were white, followed by 4% who said they were Asian or Pacific Islander, 3% who said Hispanic or Latino, and 2% who said black or African-American. And yet more than half (57%) said they read romance novels with diverse characters, described as non-white and non-heterosexual, while 20% said no, 28% said they had a hard time finding them and 9% said they would if they knew of them. But diversity in books needs to go beyond representing people of color, Rochon added. “The world is not all white, and man and woman, and able-bodied people,” she said. “That needs to be reflected more.” Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

Ryan Vlastelica,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 26, 2017 2:39 p.m. ET ‘Let’s take the foot off the accelerator and ease it gently over to the brake,’ Bogle says By Has Vanguard, the asset-managing giant that has dominated its competition as investors trend toward the kind of low-fee and passive products it specializes in, become too big for its own good? A perhaps-unexpected expert says it is nearing that point: Jack Bogle, Vanguard’s founder, who is often considered the father of passive investing. “The economies of scale just can’t keep going on much longer,” Bogle said during an interview with Christine Benz, Morningstar’s director of personal finance. Bogle suggested that if Vanguard hit $4.7 trillion in assets, that might be too large. It currently manages $4.08 trillion. Bogle retired as Vanguard’s chief executive officer, and he noted he doesn’t advise the firm’s management team. “I don’t decide anything, I don’t have to take the consequences—but I do think that when you get down to these kinds of issues, one of the things I would say was, let’s take the foot off the accelerator and ease it gently over to the brake,” said the 88-year-old investment luminary, in the interview that was published last week. Bogle said any scaling back of the investment behemoth, if it were to even happen, wouldn’t happen soon and would be fraught with challenges. “That’s a hard thing to do. We all know it’s going to have to be done sometime. I mean, maybe 25 years from now,” he said (Check out the full interview below). Vanguard has been massively successful, with the assets it manages ballooning in recent years, as investors increasingly move into both passive funds and low-cost funds. Passive funds track the performance of an underlying index like the S&P 500

                                   which has had $156.5 billion in inflows. Flows drop off dramatically from there. Dimensional Fund Advisors, the firm with the third-highest flows, had a comparably paltry $24.3 billion flow into its funds in 2017, or nearly 9% of Vanguard’s haul. Over the past month, nearly $28.1 billion have gone into Vanguard’s passive funds; only $2.8 billion have flowed into its passive offerings. Even that demonstrates Vanguard’s dominance, however, as actively managed funds as a category saw broad net outflows over the month. Only Pimco, which focuses on fixed income, an asset class where active management is seen as delivering more value than stocks, had higher active inflows, at $3.2 billion. Read more: Investors flock to Vanguard funds, dump Goldman, Wells Fargo, and others Data have repeatedly shown that passive funds outperform a vast majority of actively managed products over times. This is a cornerstone belief of Vanguard’s business model, which emphasizes passive investments. Another one has been rock-bottom fees. The average expense ratio, a measure of how much the fund charges customers to cover operating costs, for a Vanguard fund was 0.12% in 2016, according to the company’s own data, compared with an industry average of 0.62%. Opinion: Jack Bogle is right: Don’t be a passive investor, be a frugal investor Don’t miss: The reason Jack Bogle doesn’t fly first class says everything about his investing legacy However, Bogle suggested there wasn’t much room for fees to go any lower. “We’ve only got 12 basis points to go, and let me say it: There’s an irreducible minimum, no matter how big you are.” He said it costs “a lot of money to run this business,” and said that if the average fee was eight basis points (or 0.08%, amounting to $8 for every $10,000 invested), that might not be tenable. “I just don’t think it’s worthwhile, hyping and trying to bring in more and more money,” he said. Another factor Bogle said could be on the horizon, as pertaining to Vanguard’s size and popularity, involved the regulatory environment. He noted that the Investment Company Act of 1940 essentially prohibits a mutual fund from owning more than 10% of the voting shares of any security. “If you had an index fund that owned 10% of the company, they’d have to stop buying it,” he said. “They couldn’t own any more.” He suggested that if such a case were to occur now, the manager could simply create another index fund to bypass this issue. Such a workaround is “totally legal right now,” he said, though this could be changed, speculating that the limit could be raised above 10%, or that it could even apply to “all the holdings of a given management company or fund sponsor,” which he said would be “a limiting factor.” According to data from ETFGI, a research firm, Vanguard holds 18.7% of the ETF industry’s market share, with some $835.8 billion in ETF assets. That puts it behind iShares, which has $1.66 trillion in ETF assets, and 37.2% of the market share, but above State Street, which sponsors the SPDR suite of ETFs. SPDR funds have 13.6% of the market, and $607.7 billion in assets, nearly half of which are in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust

The popularity of both ETFs and passive instruments—each of the “big three” ETF providers focuses on index funds—has created a three-firm oligopoly, Bogle said. “Oligopolies are not attractive to U.S. governments or world governments,” he said, adding that “this phenomenon for exchange-traded funds, and index funds generally, is all over the world.” It is at its strongest in the U.S., “but it exists almost everywhere, and I don’t see how it’s going to back down.” ",Vanguard’s Bogle says asset-management giant he founded 42 years ago is almost too big and successful - MarketWatch
,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"(Reuters) - Federal prosecutors are investigating foreign-exchange trading at Wells Fargo & Co and have subpoenaed information from the firm, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The investigation, according to the report, relates to a single trade and ensuing dispute with client Restaurant Brands International Inc, owner of Burger King, Tim Horton and Popeye’s. An email to the company’s press office was not returned. The investigation, which is in early stages, is being conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California, the Journal reported. A spokeswoman for that office did not respond to inquiries. “Wells Fargo learned of an issue associated with a foreign exchange transaction for a single client. The matter was reviewed, the client was promptly notified regarding the issue and Wells Fargo leadership took steps to hold accountable the individuals who were involved,” bank spokeswoman Elise Wilkinson wrote in an email message to Reuters. Wilkinson said last Friday that four Wells Fargo forex employees, Simon Fowles, Bob Gotelli, Jed Guenther and Michael Schauffler were no longer with the bank. The third-largest U.S. bank has been trying to recover from a sales scandal over as many as 3.5 million fake accounts created by its employees in an effort to meet aggressive sales targets. The lender has since uncovered other problems, including with auto loans, life insurance and mortgages. The forex problems are the first indication Wells Fargo’s issues may extend to its institutional businesses, which according to Wells Fargo have seen relatively little impact from the scandal. ","

,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co on Thursday unveiled a new digital bank account app intended to help people who may be new to banking keep track of their finances more easily. The new Greenhouse account is set to launch in the first half of 2018, said Avid Modjtabai, Wells’ senior executive vice president and head of payments, virtual solutions and innovation, during a presentation at an industry conference in Boston. Greenhouse can be opened without walking into a branch, used within minutes, and does not allow for overdrafts. While many of the features are already available to Wells Fargo customers, its cash management offerings, such as keeping track of spending, are a marked improvement, according to Steve Ellis, head of innovation at Wells Fargo. “We’ve been working on this pretty aggressively for the past nine months,” said Ellis, who said it is one of a handful of his pet projects. JPMorgan Chase & Co launched a similar digital banking product called Finn last month, as banks face pressure to court millennials and cut back on branch-related costs. ","

,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A leading U.S. regulator wants to make it easier for Wells Fargo to pay employees when they leave, loosening a restriction in place since a phony accounts scandal hit the bank last year, according to people familiar with the matter. The initiative comes as President Donald Trump is trying to lighten rules on Wall Street and the bank regulator, Keith Noreika, acting Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), must weigh whether to vet new Wells Fargo executives. If Noreika’s approach prevails, the OCC could go easier on Wells Fargo and any other large banks sanctioned in the future. Since Noreika took control of the OCC in May, he has advocated easing up on sanctions imposed on Wells Fargo in the wake of the scandal over abusive sales practices, according to current and former officials. Wells Fargo reached a $190 million settlement in September 2016 after admitting that its sales staff opened as many as 2.1 million accounts without customers’ consent. Since then the estimate has climbed to as many as 3.5 million. As part of the deal with regulators, incoming Wells Fargo executives can face a vetting from the OCC while severance payouts must be cleared by the OCC and a sister agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. But Noreika wants officials to work faster when they review severance pay and the agency can choose to waive its check on incoming executives. Wells Fargo declined comment on the reviews. Hundreds of Wells Fargo employees have had their severance payouts frozen when they left as regulators tried to determine what role those employees might have had in the scandal. Under one proposal floated by the OCC, departing employees would collect severance automatically if regulators could not finish their review within weeks, according to one current and two former officials who were not authorized to discuss an internal debate. Under another scenario, the OCC could push for payouts to a Wells Fargo employee without waiting for the FDIC to concur. The FDIC has the final say on severance and until now the decisions have always been made jointly. The FDIC has resisted hurrying its severance reviews, according to those familiar with the discussions. But the current FDIC chief, Martin Gruenberg, could be replaced within weeks by a President Trump nominee. If that happens and Noreika prevails, it could provide relief for Wells Fargo as it faces fresh scrutiny for wrongly charging customers for car insurance and mortgages. Noreika is expected to leave the OCC in coming weeks, but the matter could be settled by Joseph Otting, the former banker who is Trump’s permanent pick for the OCC. Otting is expected to favor a similar, light touch approach to financial rules. The “golden parachute” rule is meant to halt payouts to employees who played a role in a bank’s problems, but Noreika has said too many innocent Wells Fargo employees are caught up in the reviews. In a June 5 letter to a former Wells Fargo employee made public by the OCC, Noreika said that he had personally called Gruenberg to expedite a payment. In the weeks after that letter was sent, sources said, the OCC has proposed speeding up the reviews, but the FDIC pushed back against setting “artificial” deadlines, according to one official. “The OCC has sought ways to make regulatory reviews more efficient (and) complete in weeks not months,” OCC spokesman  Bryan Hubbard said, while declining to discuss inter-agency deliberations. The FDIC defended the pace of its severance audits, which in some cases have taken months to finish. “When delays occur, it is generally because the applying institution provided incomplete or inconsistent information,” said Barbara Hagenbaugh, spokeswoman for the FDIC. Severance payouts are simple to calculate for rank-and-file Wells Fargo employees who can get two weeks’ pay for each year of work. It gets more complex for senior executives who get a mix of salary, bonuses, stocks and other perks. For example, James Strother, the bank’s former chief counsel who retired this summer, was among senior Wells Fargo executives that had $32 million in payouts frozen in March. But Strother has yet to repay a $310,000 interest-free loan Wells Fargo granted him in 2001, a year before such insider loans were banned, according to securities filings and the bank. “Mr. Strother has informed us that he does plan on paying back the loan, as required and expected,” said Diana Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo. Strother declined to comment. According to several former officials, the FDIC has authority to scrutinize such loans under their ‘golden parachute’ review, adding another layer of complexity to the process. ","

,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Large U.S. banks more than doubled their borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank System in the past decade in the aftermath of stricter regulations to avert a global credit crisis, a report from the Office of Financial Research released on Tuesday showed. The FHLB System, which are made up of 11 regional FHLB banks, funds the mortgage market by making loans called advances to its members that include banks, credit unions and insurers. At the end of June, its advances totaled $706 billion or 65 percent of its assets. U.S. banks with more than $250 billion in assets accounted for about 30 percent of FHLB advances in June, up from 14 percent from a decade ago. JPMorgan had $68 billion advances or 10 percent of total advances; Wells Fargo $63 billion or 9 percent and Citigroup $36 billion or 5 percent, the report showed. “Over the past few years, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup have increased their aggregate FHLBank funding. The funding comes from multiple FHLBanks because the three have subsidiaries that are members of multiple FHLBanks,” wrote  Kenechukwu Anadu, a financial markets specialist at the Boston Federal Reserve and Viktoria Baklanova, senior financial analyst  at the Office of Financial Research. Under current liquidity coverage ratio requirements, FHLB advances receive easier regulatory treatment than those in private markets, stoking demand from banks for them, they said. Anadu and Banklanova’s report centered on their findings on FHLB’s role in the U.S. money market due to tighter bank regulations and money market fund reform in response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The implementation of money market reform had boosted FHLB’s issuance of short-term debt to fund its advances, which tend to have longer maturities. “This funding model could be vulnerable to ‘runs’ and impact financial markets and financial institutions in ways that are difficult to predict,” Anadu and Baklanova wrote. At this time, a funding run on FHLB is low, they said. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates FHLB together with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is taking steps to reduce the FHLB’s reliance on short-term funding, they noted. ","

,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A renewed willingness to lend to US oil and gas companies, as oil prices stabilize well above lows, is driving down pricing for borrowers after two straight years of steep increases. The volume of credit lines provided to exploration and production companies, using their oil and gas reserves as collateral, so far this year has already topped full-year 2016, although it is a shadow of the 2014-2015 tallies reached before oil and gas prices tanked, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. While some banks have left the industry, those remaining are chasing relatively low lending volumes, leading to pricing competition on the smaller pool of loans. Loan pricing over Libor has dropped persistently since peaking in this year’s first quarter. After increasing for two straight years, spreads on these so-called reserve-based loans now average 194bp to 294bp over Libor, LPC data show. That’s well below recent highs of 270bp-370bp reached in the first quarter of this year, and nearer to the 180bp-280bp range in full-year 2015. “There’s more capital coming back to the market,” said one industry source. “For some of these banks, including JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of Oklahoma and Texas Capital, oil and gas lending was one of the pillars of their business and they’re getting back to it.” Texas Capital declined to comment. Bank of Oklahoma was not immediately available for comment. Wells Fargo declined to comment. The bank’s third quarter earnings report showed a modest 1% growth in oil and gas loans outstanding versus the prior quarter, to US$102m. “This industry has been very resilient through the cycle and we remained committed to our clients throughout, providing them with unwavering support to help them succeed,” said Mike Lister, head of JP Morgan’s Corporate Client Banking Energy group. “There is more bank capital available today for oil & gas companies.” Lending to the upstream sector has reached US$35bn so far this year, surpassing the US$29bn lent in all of last year, LPC data show. However, this volume is starkly lower than the US$112bn in 2014 and US$61bn in 2015. The upturn this year reflects the stabilization of oil prices at improved levels, and a shake-out of weaker credits after the plunge in oil and gas prices spurred a wave of bankruptcies in the sector. Oil prices earlier on Wednesday reached their highest levels since mid-2015, Reuters reported, as global supplies pushed markets higher. US West Texas Intermediate crude settled at US$54.30 per barrel. “Lessons learned from the 2015 and 2016 bankruptcies are that, although relative position of the debt instrument on the balance sheet matters, extremely low firm-wide recoveries can produce abnormal losses for even the most secured creditors, such as reserve-based loan holders, despite their substantial debt cushions,” Moody’s Investors Service wrote in a September report. The subsequent energy price upturn and stability has led to better recovery rates since the second half of last year, the rating agency said. ","

,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Jerome Powell’s nomination by President Donald Trump to serve as the next head of the U.S. Federal Reserve, if announced later this week, could be a boon for smaller lenders given his desire as a current Fed board governor to focus on bank size when reviewing rules introduced after the 2008 crisis. Powell is seen as the favorite among five candidates with current Fed chair Janet Yellen’s term due to expire in February 2018, and an announcement is possible on Thursday this week. Trump is choosing from a slate of candidates ranging from Yellen, an economist who is seen as the most cautious on changing the so-called Dodd Frank banking reforms of 2010, to economist John Taylor, a proponent of deregulation. Trump has pledged to deregulate the financial sector to boost economic growth, but the industry has had to wait for several key federal agency appointments. The chairmanship of the Fed is widely seen as one of the most important of these positions, due to the central bank’s extensive banking oversight role. If picked, Powell, who is a lawyer and former investment banker, rather than an economist, will bring to the job both knowledge of the financial industry and a stated desire to lighten the regulatory load, especially on smaller banks. Powell, who has been a Federal Reserve board governor since 2012, played a key role in drafting new bank regulations after the 2008 crisis and will likely offer more continuity for Wall Street than other candidates, analysts said. However, as Fed chair he would be freer to pursue his stated agenda of adjusting or eliminating some rules that he sees as redundant or inefficient. John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo, said Powell’s experience at the Fed equipped him to maneuver the institution through a difficult period, adding: “As an attorney, he can probably look critically at a lot of regulations that have emerged.” Handed broad new powers by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, the Fed plays a leading role in the oversight of the biggest financial institutions in the world, including overseeing annual bank “stress tests” and monitoring any non-banks deemed critical to the financial system. The Fed has recently begun to review how it wields its newly-acquired powers to potentially offer some regulatory relief, given the crisis is now ten years ago. Powell has been at the heart of this debate. “There was always going to be a time when we would look back and say all this innovative new regulation..is it done right?” Powell, 64, said at a Reuters event this month. “Can we achieve this safety and soundness objective, this stability objective, at a lower cost to consumers and financial institutions, can we do it more efficiently, what parts of it are essential, what parts of it are redundant?” Speaking during the same Reuters event, Powell said higher capital and liquidity requirements, and stress tests to show how a bank could handle market shocks, along with so-called “living wills” outlining how a bank can be unwound, have made the financial system safer and must be preserved. But his top priority, he continued, is to ensure the rules are better “tailored” to the institution concerned, and that smaller banks should enjoy a lighter touch. In particular, Powell has said that the so-called “Volcker Rule” banning banks from proprietary trading is not appropriate for smaller banks who pose less systemic risk and should be re-written to include a narrower range of institutions. The Fed governor is also open to improving the transparency of the stress-testing process and tweaking other rules such as the “enhanced supplementary leverage” ratio which requires banks to hold more capital. As Powell gets to work, he will have a close ally on the Fed board in the form of Randal Quarles, a lawyer who was appointed to the role of Fed vice chair for supervision on Oct. 13 to lead the bank’s regulatory work. A former private equity investor, Wall Street lawyer and Under Secretary to the U.S. Treasury, Quarles has also advocated tempering some of the Dodd-Frank banking regulations. As Fed vice chair for supervision, Quarles is considered the  official in charge of regulatory matters, but he will still report to and have to work closely with the new Fed chair. “I have known him for 25 years as a close friend, I think he’s a terrific appointment, and I look forward to reuniting with him,” Powell said in October.

,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump signed a Congressional resolution on Wednesday that lets banks block customers from filing class action lawsuits, partly delivering on his election campaign promise to lighten U.S. financial regulation. The White House confirmed Trump signed the resolution, which kills a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule released in July, despite heavy lobbying for a veto by the president. The rule, set to go into effect next spring, gave bank customers the option to band together in lawsuits known as class actions to lower their legal costs, but Republicans say the suits only benefit attorneys who reap large fees. They also argue arbitration is faster and leads to larger awards. Democrats say arbitration is rigged against customers and the U.S. constitution guarantees a right to a trial. Trump vowed as a presidential candidate to lighten the bank regulation introduced after the 2007-09 financial crisis, but this was his first concrete action since taking office in January. Regulation critics, who say federal bureaucracy suffocates economic growth, now hope Republicans will use their control of both Congress and the White House to swiftly undo more financial rules. The CFPB rule barred banks, credit card issuers and other financial companies from requiring customers to sign away their rights to join group lawsuits and agree to take potential disputes to closed-door arbitration as a condition of opening accounts. The resolution was passed under the Congressional Review Act, which stops regulators from creating a similar rule in the future, and “mandatory arbitration clauses” will likely remain in contracts for consumer financial services for decades. Trump and the Republican party could also have an easier time protecting companies’ ability to block customers from suing in a wide variety of non-financial services. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is working to keep the clauses in contracts related to higher education. CFPB Director Richard Cordray, a Democrat appointed by former President Barack Obama, took the unusual step on Monday of directly asking Trump to veto the resolution. The country’s largest veterans service organization, the American Legion, made a similar plea. The Supreme Court ruled arbitration clauses are constitutional in 2011, and they are now standard for almost every consumer product. Equifax Inc. included a mandatory arbitration clause in free credit monitoring it offered to victims of its massive cyber hack earlier this year, and later removed it. Wells Fargo & Co customers caught up in last year’s phony accounts scandal have had difficulty suing the bank because they are bound by clauses in contracts they signed for legitimate accounts.

 ,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"Supported by WASHINGTON — Tony Podesta, a prominent lobbyist and Democratic donor who has come under scrutiny from the escalating special counsel investigation, stepped down on Monday from the firm he co-founded, according to people familiar with the firm. The firm, the Podesta Group, has lost clients as it has been increasingly drawn into the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. On Monday, the Podesta Group and another company with which it had worked, Mercury Public Affairs, were referenced — though not by name — in an indictment of two former Trump campaign officials, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. No charges have been brought against Mr. Podesta or officials from the Podesta Group or Mercury. But both firms have been subpoenaed for records and testimony about their work on behalf of a client referred to them in 2012 by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates, the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, a nonprofit group based in Brussels. The work for the European Center, which ended in 2014, was cited in the indictment on Monday as part of a “scheme” by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates to gain support in Washington for their longtime client, the pro-Russian leader Viktor F. Yanukovych, a former president of Ukraine, while evading disclosure requirements for foreign lobbying. Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates were charged with violating tax, banking and foreign lobbying laws in an effort to hide more than $75 million in income from their work in Ukrainian politics. The indictment was the subject of intense interest on K Street, where the Justice Department’s enforcement of the foreign lobbying requirements under the Foreign Agents Registration Act is widely seen as toothless. The charges against Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates that are related to the act, coming as powerful members of Congress are demanding more enforcement of the law, were seen by some as a shot across the bow of Washington lobbyists. Mr. Podesta announced his departure at a staff meeting on Monday. He is the brother of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign chairman John Podesta, who co-founded the firm. Tony Podesta has become the target of attacks from conservatives looking to shift attention away from Mr. Mueller’s scrutiny of President Trump’s campaign team. A person familiar with Mr. Podesta’s remarks at Monday’s staff meeting said he cited attacks from Fox News and the conservative media as making it “impossible to run a public affairs shop.” That person was not authorized to publicly discuss the internal meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity. A partner at the firm, who also did not want to be identified discussing delicate internal affairs, said that even before Mr. Podesta announced his departure, some senior partners were trying to convince clients to remain with them as they worked to reintroduce the company with branding that would not include Mr. Podesta’s name. The partner added that the effort had been fueled partly by Mr. Podesta’s aggressive efforts to defend himself against coverage by the conservative news media on the special counsel’s scrutiny of the Podesta Group. The firm has been among Washington’s highest grossing lobbying shops for years. Mr. Podesta’s resignation was first reported by Politico on Monday afternoon. Mr. Podesta’s lawyer on Monday sent a cease-and-desist letter to a Fox News host over his  claims on air that Mr. Podesta and his brother, John Podesta, worked closely with Mr. Manafort on behalf of Russia. The host, Tucker Carlson, said that the Podesta brothers and Mr. Manafort were the “central figures” in Mr. Mueller’s investigation. A lawyer representing Tony Podesta, a powerful Democratic lobbyist, sent a letter to Tucker Carlson, a host at Fox News, demanding a retraction of claims by Mr. Carlson about Mr. Podesta's foreign lobbying. Mr. Podesta’s lawyer, Geoffrey R. Garinther, wrote to Mr. Carlson on Monday that his “false and defamatory statements have caused damage and injury to the reputation of Mr. Podesta and the Podesta Group.” The indictment on Monday did not name the Podesta Group or Mercury, instead referring to them as “two Washington, D.C., firms” that were recruited by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates “to lobby in the United States on behalf of Yanukovych, the Party of Regions, and the government of Ukraine.” Mr. Podesta and a spokesman for his firm did not respond to requests for comment. Michael McKeon, a partner at Mercury, said in a statement that the firm “takes its obligations to follow all laws, rules and regulations very seriously” and “has and will continue to fully cooperate with the Office of the Special Counsel in its investigation.” The companies were paid more than $1.1 million each, according to lobbying filings, to try to rally support among American policymakers and opinion leaders for Mr. Yanukovych, and to quell concerns about his leadership and his government’s jailing of a political rival. Neither firm initially registered with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires firms that lobby or conduct public relations for foreign individuals, companies, governments and political parties to reveal detailed information about their work. The Podesta Group and Mercury said they relied on assurances provided by the nonprofit group that it was neither funded nor controlled by any foreign government or party. But both firms were compelled this year to belatedly — and, in the case of Mercury, begrudgingly — register under the act, after their activities came under scrutiny from the Justice Department. In his statement, Mr. McKeon said Mercury followed the advice of legal counsel in its disclosure of its relationship with the European Center and noted that it registered the relationship under less detailed congressional lobbying disclosure rules. The Podesta Group also reported its relationship with the European Center under those disclosure rules. Glenn Thrush contributed reporting.

Manafort, a longtime Republican operative, and Gates pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment with charges ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. The indictment against Manafort and Gates listed two unnamed  firms as “Company A” and “Company B” that lobbied several lawmakers on behalf of Ukraine at Manafort’s request. The indictment did not name Podesta Group. A spokesperson for the Podesta Group said after Podesta stepped down on Monday that it had been in contact with investigators on special counsel Robert Mueller’s team and was fully cooperating with the probe. The spokesperson also said the Podesta Group fully complied with the law in disclosing its lobbying on behalf of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, a group linked to Manafort and named in the indictment. Podesta Group filed lobbying disclosures with the Department of Justice in April and August saying it did work in 2012 for the same pro-Russian Ukrainian group for which Manafort had worked. Podesta Group work alongside another Washington lobbying firm, Mercury LLC, which also said on Monday that it was cooperating with Mueller’s team. No charges were filed against anyone with Podesta Group or Mercury. Tony Podesta did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. Podesta was the head of the firm that bore his name. It did  $10.7 million in lobbying in the first nine months of 2017, according to disclosures the firm filed with the U.S. Congress. He is the brother of John Podesta, who served as chairman of the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, and as a senior White House adviser to Democratic former President Barack Obama. Mueller’s team has been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign, but neither Trump nor the campaign were mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates. While Podesta Group is seen as a mainly Democratic lobbying firm, Mercury is viewed as mainly a Republican shop. Mercury is a subsidiary of Omnicom Group and does public relations work in addition to lobbying. Omnicom did not reply to a request for comment. Podesta is listed as a lobbyist on several of the firm’s largest accounts including Wells Fargo, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, Wal-Mart, Textron and General Dynamics.

 ,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"The bank’s announcement on Monday comes amid a changing competitive landscape for the securities industry. Top advisers are increasingly leaving major brokerages to join independent registered investment firms, the majority of which are not party to the pact. Morgan Stanley said in a statement that quitting the agreement would allow it to invest more in its advisers and their teams. Industry recruiters said that by exiting the industry accord, Morgan Stanley will be able to act more aggressively to keep its top advisers and fight for the clients of those who  leave. “If you’re going to be a net loser rather than a net gainer in terms of recruiting, why stay in the protocol?” said Danny Sarch, president of the recruiting firm Leitner Sarch Consultants. Morgan Stanley is the first Wall Street brokerage to exit the industry truce, called the Protocol for Broker Recruiting, and its departure could trigger a wave of defections. The agreement was struck in 2004 when major broker-dealers still dominated the wealth management industry. Increased regulation of major banks in the wake of the financial crisis has made independent firms increasingly attractive to financial advisers seeking relief from red tape. They often taken their clients with them when they leave, and under the protocol, their former firms cannot sue them. From 2006 to 2016, the top four U.S. securities brokerages, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and UBS Wealth Management Americas, lost 10 percent of the industry’s asset market share and now account for 36 percent of assets under management, according to research firm Cerulli Associates. Cerulli estimates that so-called registered investment advisers, a popular type of independent firm, will control 28 percent of assets under management by 2018 and 24.6 percent of the advisers. In 2016, they controlled 23 percent of investor assets. Morgan Stanley’s decision comes just a few months after several large wealth management firms made changes to their recruiting practices, including reducing adviser recruiting. For years, brokerage executives have complained about endless competition among Wall Street firms to offer ever more lucrative recruitment packages to gain top advisers and their clients and assets.

If Noreika's approach prevails, the OCC could go easier on Wells Fargo and any other large banks sanctioned in the future. Since Noreika took control of the OCC in May, he has advocated easing up on sanctions imposed on Wells Fargo in the wake of the scandal over abusive sales practices, according to current and former officials. Wells Fargo reached a $190 million settlement in September 2016 after admitting that its sales staff opened as many as 2.1 million accounts without customers' consent. Since then the estimate has climbed to as many as 3.5 million. As part of the deal with regulators, incoming Wells Fargo executives can face a vetting from the OCC while severance payouts must be cleared by the OCC and a sister agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. But Noreika wants officials to work faster when they review severance pay and the agency can choose to waive its check on incoming executives. Wells Fargo declined comment on the reviews. Hundreds of Wells Fargo employees have had their severance payouts frozen when they left as regulators tried to determine what role those employees might have had in the scandal. Under one proposal floated by the OCC, departing employees would collect severance automatically if regulators could not finish their review within weeks, according to one current and two former officials who were not authorized to discuss an internal debate. Under another scenario, the OCC could push for payouts to a Wells Fargo employee without waiting for the FDIC to concur. The FDIC has the final say on severance and until now the decisions have always been made jointly. The FDIC has resisted hurrying its severance reviews, according to those familiar with the discussions. But the current FDIC chief, Martin Gruenberg, could be replaced within weeks by a President Trump nominee. If that happens and Noreika prevails, it could provide relief for Wells Fargo as it faces fresh scrutiny for wrongly charging customers for car insurance and mortgages. Noreika is expected to leave the OCC in coming weeks, but the matter could be settled by Joseph Otting, the former banker who is Trump's permanent pick for the OCC. Otting is expected to favor a similar, light touch approach to financial rules. The ""golden parachute"" rule is meant to halt payouts to employees who played a role in a bank's problems, but Noreika has said too many innocent Wells Fargo employees are caught up in the reviews. In a June 5 letter to a former Wells Fargo employee made public by the OCC, Noreika said that he had personally called Gruenberg to expedite a payment. In the weeks after that letter was sent, sources said, the OCC has proposed speeding up the reviews, but the FDIC pushed back against setting ""artificial"" deadlines, according to one official. ""The OCC has sought ways to make regulatory reviews more efficient (and) complete in weeks not months,"" OCC spokesman Bryan Hubbard said, while declining to discuss inter-agency deliberations. The FDIC defended the pace of its severance audits, which in some cases have taken months to finish. ""When delays occur, it is generally because the applying institution provided incomplete or inconsistent information,"" said Barbara Hagenbaugh, spokeswoman for the FDIC. Severance payouts are simple to calculate for rank-and-file Wells Fargo employees who can get two weeks' pay for each year of work. It gets more complex for senior executives who get a mix of salary, bonuses, stocks and other perks. For example, James Strother, the bank's former chief counsel who retired this summer, was among senior Wells Fargo executives that had $32 million in payouts frozen in March. But Strother has yet to repay a $310,000 interest-free loan Wells Fargo granted him in 2001, a year before such insider loans were banned, according to securities filings and the bank. ""Mr. Strother has informed us that he does plan on paying back the loan, as required and expected,"" said Diana Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo. Strother declined to comment. According to several former officials, the FDIC has authority to scrutinize such loans under their 'golden parachute' review, adding another layer of complexity to the process.

According to Wells Fargo, 20 percent of young people said they will ""never"" be invested in the markets and 53 percent said they will ""never be comfortable investing in the markets."" The findings come from a June survey the bank conducted of more than 1,750 people ages 20 to 36. ""I think that lack of confidence is something that we really need to find a way to work through with them. If they continue at this rate, they will never have enough savings for retirement.

The majority, 70 percent, also said the Great Recession made them skeptical of stock market experts. For the sake of their future happiness, it may be time to get over these anxieties. Wells Fargo developed a Positive Financial Indicator to measure how well a person is doing financially. It consists of five attributes of an individual in good financial standing: Interestingly, the bank found that those who score higher tend to be happier and more confident with their money.

Sharon L. Lynch,11022017,CNBC,10262017,"An increasing share of aspiring U.S. homebuyers are getting mortgages from ""non-banks"" that can accommodate borrowers in ways traditional lenders may not.  Six of the top 10 home lenders by volume now fall into this category. Customers include the self-employed and those who rely on bonuses as a substantial part of their income. Even homeowners who simply want to preserve cash for other investments often can find a way. The trick is knowing where to apply.  Guy Cecala, publisher and chief executive officer of Inside Mortgage Finance, recommends comparing interest rate and underwriting information from a credit union, a big bank such as Wells Fargo or JPMorgan Chase, and a non-bank lender.  ""There's nothing wrong with getting a loan from a non-bank,"" Cecala said. ""Often you'll get better terms, better service and looser underwriting."" PennyMac Financial and loanDepot.com are among the biggest such players, according to Cecala.  Given that an estimated 15 million Americans were self-employed in 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the two groups may be natural partners.  June Richardson, a vice president at mortgage lender GuardHill Financial Corp. in New York, is a loan officer who works with the self-employed and other variable-income borrowers, as well as foreign nationals and applicants to cooperative and condominium buildings.  If a prospective loan doesn't fit Guardhill's criteria, Richardson might still be able to put together a deal with a local savings bank or a lender that serves high net-worth clients.  ""Life is not a cookie-cutter circumstance. Everyone has their own set of baggage that they come to you with,"" Richardson said. ""You need to have the right team behind you in order to get the deal done.""  Although an increasing percentage of households headed by 65- to-74-year-olds carry debt backed by their homes, obtaining a mortgage can be challenging. Fannie Mae's HomeReady program allows the income of adult children to be considered in an application even if they don't plan to reside in their parents' home. In other cases, lenders may count a percentage of assets in qualifying for a loan. Richardson's gamut of options still includes interest-only loans that might be right for people who earn a low base salary and periodic bonuses and even adjustable-rate mortgages that fluctuate every month, something Richardson says may be best suited to borrowers who can pay off the mortgage if payments rise too high.  Unlike Wells Fargo or Chase, Guardhill is not a bank because it doesn't accept deposits.  The financial crisis of 2008 essentially sent the mortgage market back to big banks and the sudden dearth of competition meant those institutions didn't necessarily have to offer the best rates or most flexible underwriting.  ""All they had to do was open their doors in the morning and they got as much business as they wanted,"" Cecala said.  Tighter regulation and mortgage-related lawsuits later pushed those banks to focus more on wealthy clients and jumbo mortgages, which carry fewer restrictions than loans sold to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or backed by the Federal Housing Administration. The shift opened the market to non-banks funded by hedge funds and private equity, Cecala said. Both banks and non-banks have been sued since the financial crisis, with many cases hinging on allegations that the institutions didn't screen borrowers closely enough to make sure they could repay loans. Citadel Servicing Corp. of California is another non-bank lender that works with borrowers who don't fit the traditional mold. The company arranges mortgages of up to $3 million and even serves customers with credit scores below 500, whom mainstream lenders generally will shy away from. One option it provides allows the borrower to use bank statements as proof of income rather than a W-2 form, which is often key for the self-employed.  The lender originates about 500 loans a month across almost 40 states, said Will Fisher, senior vice president for loan production, sales and marketing at Citadel Servicing.  The company's niche is something Fisher calls ""aspirational"" non-prime loans for people who might not yet qualify for a traditional mortgage but may in a few years. Interest rates typically run half a percentage point to 1 point higher than the prevailing market rate. Down payments of 20 percent to 40 percent may be required.  Citadel Servicing's largest pool of customers is the self-employed, who usually wind up with either a 30-year, fixed-rate amortizing mortgage or an adjustable-rate loan with a fixed payment for seven years and a payment that fluctuates annually after that.  ""We try to be very careful,"" Fisher said. ",Self-employed turn to non-bank lenders to crack the housing market

Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut wrote on Friday that he suspects Amazon is growing its professional medical device business, while Wells Fargo pointed out Thursday that Amazon now owns the AmazonRX.com domain. It's all part of the tea-leaf reading as investors try to understand how Amazon could disrupt a huge and historically difficult-to-break-into industry. CNBC reported in May that each year, Amazon holds an annual meeting to discuss whether it should break into the pharmacy market, and this year, it's been more serious than ever. Now, sources have said that CVS Health is in talks to buy Aetna — a deal that would be an unprecedented mega-merger between a top drugstore chain and insurer. RBC Capital Markets analyst George Hill told CNBC that the companies ""needed to defend the business from encroachment by Amazon."" The news roiled pharmaceutical stocks, while Amazon shares are at all-time highs. According to Tanquilut, Amazon's business-to-business medical device web page was posted during the same period the company was granted wholesale distribution licenses in several states. The licensure was first reported by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. An Amazon spokesperson previously told CNBC by email that the company doesn't ""comment on rumors or speculation."" While many have speculated these licenses could be used for drugs, Tanquilut said the timing could indicate Amazon is more interested in medical devices. ""[T]he out-of-state wholesaler license that AMZN filed with the state of Nevada revealed that AMZN did not select 'Controlled Substances' as a type of product that they would be handling,""  Tanquilut wrote in a Friday research note.""While we acknowledge that there are prescription drugs that don't fall under the definition of 'controlled substances', the active decision to choose not to distribute those types of drugs leads us to believe that AMZN will not be using these licenses to distribute any prescription drugs[.]"" On the other hand, Wells Fargo analyst David Maris pointed out that AmazonRX.com redirects to the Amazon home page. ""We find it easy to envision that, if it entered pharmacy, Amazon could offer unique value to some customers, such as the easier ability to manage prescriptions and perhaps discounts, such as free generics to Prime users,"" Maris wrote. Overall, we think that even though Amazon has not stated a goal to be in pharmacy, history has shown it is better to consider Amazon's disruptive potential beforehand rather than afterward.""

Among other changes, the summary details of the proposal outline large increases of the standard deduction for individuals and families, as well as raising the child tax credit and doubling the estate tax while scheduling its repeal in six years. The bill would also permanently lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, sources told CNBC. In a time of stark polarization in Congress, Democrats didn't bother waiting for the full text of the bill before taking their criticisms public. Sen.

It has been a tough year for Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), as the bank seeks to repair its tarnished image in the wake of a sales scandal disclosed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year. But in the stock market, one company's challenges can be an investor's opportunity. Given the lagging performance of Wells Fargo stock over the past year, this raises the question: Is Wells Fargo stock a buy in November? Image source: Getty Images. At least initially, it seems that the answer to this is yes. I say that because shares of Wells Fargo have underperformed most other big bank stocks over the recent past. Since the beginning of the year, shares of the nation's third-biggest bank by assets have climbed 1.8%. That isn't horrible, but it's far from good when you consider that the KBW Bank Index, which tracks shares of two dozen large-cap banks, is up 11% over the same stretch. The comparison looks even worse if you look at the performance of Wells Fargo's stock over the past 12 months. Since this time last year, its shares are up 22% compared to a gain of 37% for the average bank on the KBW Bank Index. The cost of Wells Fargo's scandal, in other words, isn't that its stock has fallen, but rather that it hasn't kept pace with the rest of the industry. WFC data by YCharts. All of this has weighed on Wells Fargo's stock valuation. The bank currently trades for 14.6 times its expected earnings per share over the next 12 months. That's comfortably below the average big bank, which trades for closer to 17 times forward earnings. Given this, one would be excused for concluding that Wells Fargo stock is indeed a good buy right now. While there are reasons to think that Wells Fargo's shares are attractively priced right now, there are also factors that go against an investment in the California-based bank. In the first place, one could argue that the bank's response to the crisis has fundamentally altered the traditional investment thesis in its stock. Wells Fargo was known for years as having one of the highest cross-sale ratios in the industry, with an average retail customer using 6.1 of the bank's products and services as of last year, which has long been much higher than the typical bank. Wells Fargo accomplished this by putting immense pressure on employees in its branches to open new accounts for customers. But as the bank itself has acknowledged, it was this pressure that led thousands of its employees to open millions of accounts for customers without customers' authorization. Consequently, the bank has abandoned its former focus on sales, which will impair the bank's growth and profitability. On top of this, Wells Fargo has seen multiple large customers blacklist the bank. In the middle of last month, the bank's home state of California extended a ban on using Wells Fargo to underwrite municipal bonds. All told, moves like these have cost the bank ""tens of millions of dollars"" in revenue, according to its chief financial officer. Finally, most of Wells Fargo's fundamental performance metrics have been heading in the wrong direction and continue to do so. In the latest quarter, the notoriously efficient bank spent 65.5% of its revenue on operating expenses compared to only 59.4% in the same quarter last year. The net result is that Wells Fargo's profitability has dropped considerably, with its earnings per share in the third quarter falling by 20%. In sum, while there are reasons to be optimistic about Wells Fargo's stock at its current valuation, before concluding that it's a buy in November, investors should think long and hard about whether the onetime industry darling will be able to reclaim its former glory.

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",11022017,Fool,10262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The largest U.S. banks have now reported their third-quarter earnings, and the results were generally positive. Investment banks Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) reported strong asset growth and merger-and-acquisition activity, and of the five largest consumer banks -- JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) -- four reported strong performance. With that in mind, here are seven takeaways from bank earnings that investors who are interested in the financial sector should know. Image source: Getty Images. Loans and deposits are growing across the banking industry, investment assets have grown because of strong market performance, and rising interest rates have resulted in higher margins for banks. The combination has resulted in higher revenue for banks. With the exception of Wells Fargo, which we'll discuss in more depth later on, the big U.S. banks saw strong revenue growth during the third quarter. Bank Q3 2017 Revenue Growth (Year Over Year) Morgan Stanley 3% Goldman Sachs 2% Bank of America 1% JPMorgan Chase 3% Citigroup 2% U.S. Bank 4% Wells Fargo (2%) Data source: company earnings reports. One major focus within the banking industry is efficiency. Banks are investing heavily in their mobile and online platforms and as a whole are reducing their physical footprints. Just to name one example, Bank of America has closed more than 100 branches in the past year and has seen a big increase in its mobile user base. Thanks to improving efficiency, while bank revenue is rising, expenses haven't increased proportionally, which translates into profit growth that's far more impressive than the revenue growth indicated in the chart in the previous section. Continuing with the Bank of America example, its 1% revenue growth isn't too exciting, but 17% growth in earnings per share (EPS) is. Bank Q3 2017 EPS Growth (Year Over Year) Morgan Stanley 15% Goldman Sachs 3% Bank of America 17% JPMorgan Chase 11% Citigroup 11% U.S. Bank 5% Wells Fargo (18%) Data source: company earnings reports. As I mentioned, the banking industry had a generally strong quarter, with the exception of Wells Fargo. The fallout from the bank's infamous fake-accounts scandal has resulted in significant legal expenses and a general reduction in business. For example, Wells Fargo was the only big U.S. bank whose loan portfolio shrank over the past year. In addition, the bank's net interest margin was flat year over year, despite rising interest rates, and its r returns on equity and assets (ROE and ROA) of 9.1% and 0.94%, respectively, failed to meet the industry's 10% and 1% benchmarks. While there's no way to know for sure how long and how much Wells Fargo's business will be feeling the effects of the scandal, it's certainly apparent in the bank's recent results. Instead of valuing banks with the commonly used price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E, a better metric to use is the price-to-tangible book value (P/TB or P/TBV) ratio. This is a measure of how expensive a bank's stock price is, relative to the value of its tangible assets. Over the past year or so, bank stock prices have risen considerably, and their valuations have soared as a result. However, there is significant variation in the big banks' valuations, as well as in how much they've improved. Bank Q3 2017 P/TB Year-Over-Year Change U.S. Bank 2.94 17.5% JPMorgan Chase 1.85 39.1% Wells Fargo 1.77 19.4% Bank of America 1.58 63.2% Morgan Stanley 1.49 43.7% Goldman Sachs 1.35 35.6% Citigroup 1.08 39.7% Data source: company financials. Year-over-year change from YCharts. In the P/TB chart, you can see that while bank stock valuations have risen across the board, no company's valuation has grown as much as Bank of America's. And there's good reason for this. Specifically, in the years following the financial crisis, Bank of America was one of the least profitable and most inefficient of the big banks, and for this reason, the stock traded for a discount to tangible book value for much of that time -- even thoughout most of 2016. Its ROA and ROE were simply awful compared with what bank investors typically look for. BAC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts Recently, Bank of America has done an excellent job of improving its asset quality and the efficiency of its operation, and the company is now on the verge of achieving profitability that meets the 10% ROE and 1% ROA benchmarks that investors generally like to see. Share buybacks have been a major focus of the big banks this quarter, after their capital plans were approved earlier this year. Now, there are several potential reasons companies could choose to buy back stock. For example, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently said one reason the bank is prioritizing buybacks is that it's easier to reduce a buyback than a dividend. However, the major reason companies focus on buybacks is that they feel their stock is attractively priced. During the third quarter, Goldman Sachs spent more than $2 billion on buybacks and reduced its share count to less than 400 million for the first time. JPMorgan Chase spent $4.5 billion on buybacks during the quarter, while Wells Fargo spent $2 billion, and Bank of America has spent nearly $8 billion on its stock so far in 2017. At this point, there's no way to know for sure if a tax reform or tax-cut package will be passed, nor do we know what the exact corporate rate would be. Having said that, it's fair to say that tax reform could be a big catalyst for bank profits, whether the corporate rate turns out to be 20% as the GOP tax plan suggests, or even if it's as high as 25% like some experts think it will be. Banks are highly taxed -- here are the big U.S. banks' effective tax rates for the third quarter. Bank Q3 2017 Effective Tax Rate Morgan Stanley 28.1% Goldman Sachs 22.6% Bank of America 32.6% JPMorgan Chase 29.6% Citigroup 31.1% U.S. Bank 27.3% Wells Fargo 31.2% Data source: company earnings reports. Bank stocks have performed tremendously well over the past year or so, but there's a good reason for the upward movement. Revenue is up, profits are rising, and there are potential catalysts such as tax reform that could cause the banks' bottom lines to improve even further. ","

We've talked about big banks, we've talked about their news, we've talked about what's going on, we've talked about how to analyze them. Well, are there any that are actually worth investing in today? Matt Frankel: As a general statement, I think the potential catalysts we discussed are priced in at this point. Bank stocks, a lot of them have doubled in the past year or two, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) being one. That's my personal biggest stock holding, Bank of America. But I don't know I would buy more today at the current price. I personally like Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), if you have a long time frame to let the drama play out. They're still a pretty expensive bank relative to the industry, but not compared to what their business was valued at before the scandal started. So if they're successful in recovering from the scandal over time, this current price could look pretty cheap. And U.S. Bank is always a good long-term investment. You really can't go wrong with that one at any point. Douglass: It's expensive, and for a reason. When I think about Wells Fargo, my general thing is, I think the key question that you need to ask before you choose to invest in Wells Fargo is, this bank really did well on a lot of metrics for a very long time, in part because they did an aggressive cross-selling culture. Can they retain that aggressive culture? Can they in some way effectively cross-sell their products and grow their revenue and their underlying earnings without these negative externalities that often come with that, which is, people trying to cheat the system, creating fake accounts, things like that? If the answer to that is yes, then Wells Fargo is undoubtedly cheap compared to where it used to be. It's still reasonably priced by most bank stock standards. But if you're concerned about that possibility, I think Wells Fargo is a stay-away. Personally, I don't have enough data points, so I'm staying on the sidelines. I actually don't own any of the big banks. I'm only invested in a small bank right now. But I'm going to be keeping an eye particularly on the turnaround at Bank of America, because I think that's a very interesting story. ","
      
    Which Bank Stocks Are Good Buys Now? -- The Motley Fool

Citigroup (NYSE:C) has one of the lowest dividend yields among big-bank stocks right now, at 1.1%, but that doesn't necessarily mean that income-seeking investors should avoid the nation's fourth biggest bank by assets. That's because Citigroup's quarterly payout has a lot of room to grow. Image source: Getty Images. Since the financial crisis, Citigroup has increased its quarterly payout only three times. It started at $0.01 per share in the wake of the crisis, raising that to $0.05 per share in 2015, to $0.16 per share the next year, and to $0.32 per share earlier this year. That's rapid growth. Any time a company increases its dividend by a factor of 32 in less than five years, it's worth taking note, as the company could very well be signaling that more increases are in the cards. On top of this, Citigroup is playing catch-up to other large banks. Since 2010, both JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) have boosted their quarterly payouts annually. The catch is that these banks have gotten approval to do so from the Federal Reserve, which exercises veto power over big-bank capital plans as a part of the annual stress tests, or more precisely, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review. C Dividend data by YCharts. The net result is that JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo's stocks now yield more than the average on the KBW Bank Index and KBW Regional Bank Index, which track a combined 74 publicly traded banks. JPMorgan Chase's stock currently yields 2.03%, while shares of Wells Fargo yield 2.73%. You can get a sense for the upward potential of Citigroup's dividend by looking at the payout ratio. This communicates how much of a company's earnings are distributed via dividends. It's calculated by dividing a company's dividend per share by its earnings per share. As a general rule, most banks strive to pay out approximately a third of their earnings via dividends, with the remaining two-thirds split roughly evenly between retained earnings and share repurchases. To this end, while JPMorgan Chase is slightly below this, with a payout ratio of 25%, according to YCharts.com, Wells Fargo is nearly right on the mark, with a 32% payout ratio over the trailing 12 months. Citigroup, by contrast, pays out less than 15% of its earnings. That's half the average on the combined KBW bank indexes. Not coincidentally, it's also well below a third of its earnings, which, again, is what most banks strive to hit. The net result is that, even though Citigroup has a dismal dividend yield right now, this won't always be the case, as the bank seems intent on catching up with its peers in this regard. ","
      
    Don’t Be Discouraged by This Bank Stock's Low Dividend Yield -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,11022017,Fool,10262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Thanks to the immense amount of leverage inherent in a bank's business model, the biggest banks in the country also tend to be the biggest companies. You can see this by looking at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the largest bank in America. Image source: Getty Images. A bank's size is generally denoted by the combined value of assets on its balance sheet. In JPMorgan Chase's case, that would be $2.6 trillion. To put this into context, aside from banks and insurance companies, the next biggest company on the S&P 500 is AT&T, at $444 billion in assets. That's big, no doubt, but it pales in comparison to JPMorgan Chase. Even among banks, JPMorgan Chase distinguishes itself in this regard. The second biggest bank in the country is Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). It has $2.3 trillion worth of assets. Then come Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C), at $1.94 trillion and $1.89 trillion, respectively. After these four banks, the next largest drops off significantly in size. That would be Goldman Sachs, the storied investment bank. Goldman Sachs' balance sheet weighs in at $906 billion, according to YCharts.com. JPMorgan Chase hasn't always been the biggest bank in America. Going into the financial crisis, it was the third largest, behind Bank of America and Citigroup. JPM Total Assets (Annual) data by YCharts. The fortunes of these three banks changed considerably during the crisis. Citigroup and Bank of America both incurred large losses stemming from toxic credit card loans, as well as the securitization of subprime mortgages. JPMorgan Chase, on the other hand, largely sidestepped these issues. The net result is that while Bank of America and Citigroup have had to spend much of the past decade retreating and retrenching, JPMorgan Chase was free to grow and acquire market share. The two most potent ways it did so was to acquire Bear Stearns, the fifth largest investment bank at the time, and Washington Mutual -- a massive thrift based in Seattle -- in 2008. Bank of America also made a major acquisition during the crisis by purchasing Merrill Lynch at right around the same time that JPMorgan Chase bought Washington Mutual. However, after Bank of America's balance sheets peaked in size around 2010, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank saw its asset portfolio contract in size, as toxic assets and non-core operations were offloaded to focus the bank's business model around a more narrowly tailored assortment of businesses. Meanwhile, Citigroup attempted to acquire a bank during the crisis as well, but it was outbid for Wachovia by Wells Fargo, which, in turn, enabled Wells Fargo to overtake Citigroup in terms of the respective sizes of their balance sheets. The net result is that JPMorgan Chase was able to step into the void and become the biggest bank in America, replacing Citigroup and Bank of America at the apex of the industry. ","
      
    What Is the Biggest Bank in America? -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,11022017,Fool,10262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There's been a lot of talk in the bank industry over the last few years about the future of bank branches -- or, rather, about whether or not they have a future. Like the retail industry, customers have started shifting how they access financial products and services, such as checking, savings, and brokerage accounts. Instead of walking into a branch to make a deposit, they're instead using their smartphones to do so. Image source: Bank of America. The appeal of mobile banking is obvious: Why should someone drive 10 minutes to a branch to deposit a check when you can do so from the comfort of your couch in less than a minute? That's a rhetorical question, of course, because you wouldn't. Mobile banking is also appealing from the bank's perspective. According to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan, it costs one-tenth as much to process a mobile deposit as it does for one that's made in a branch. It's for these reasons that banks and their customers have eagerly adopted online and mobile banking. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has 29.3 million active mobile customers, the most in the bank industry. Bank of America is runner-up at 23.6 million, followed by Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) at 20.9 million active mobile users. The impact on these banks' business models has been considerable. Take Bank of America as an example. More than one in five deposits at the nation's second-biggest bank by assets are made on a mobile device. As the bank's chief financial officer, Paul Donofrio, explained on the bank's third-quarter conference call: Also note the growth in mobile channel usage, this quarter we saw nearly 1.2 billion logins, which is up 19% versus Q3 2016 and more than 21% of all check deposit transactions are now done on mobile devices. This represents the volume of 1,100 financial centers and while important in terms of how we transact with customers, mobile has also become important in terms of how we connect with our customers. The growing popularity of mobile banking has thus enabled banks to diversify away from branches as a delivery channel for financial products and services, freeing them to consolidate their expansive (and expensive) branch networks. If you're wondering why bank branches are disappearing, then, the reason is that they're more expensive for banks to operate and less convenient for customers to access than online and mobile banking.

Image source: The Motley Fool. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there'll be an opportunity to ask questions and instructions will be given at that time. If you should require assistance from an operator, please press star then zero. And this reminder this conference is being recorded. And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Toby Willard. Please go ahead, sir. Thanks, Kathy. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's presentation slides and in the company's reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to the comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the third quarter 2017 earnings release and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Today's discussion will begin with Ken Chenault, Chairman and CEO; and Steve Squeri, Vice Chairman, who are joining us for the beginning of the call to make some remarks about the company's leadership transition. And then Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will review some key points related to the quarter's results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we'll move to a Q&A session on the quarter's results. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Ken. Thanks, Toby, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. Steve and I wanted to start the call with a few words about our announcement from earlier this afternoon. As you'll see from the results, we're completing a 2-year turnaround ahead of plan and getting ready to start a new chapter. Given the progress we're making, I thought this was the right time to begin the leadership transition, and I'm very pleased to report that the board has elected Steve to be Chairman and CEO effective February 1 of next year, which will coincide with my retirement. It's been a great honor to lead American Express, and I've treasured every day of my 37-year career here. It's been a journey that spanned profound changes in the world of business, the payments industry and the global economy. Against that background, we continue the long tradition of reinvention that has characterized American Express since its founding more than 1.5 centuries ago. We shifted our business from a narrow travel and entertainment focus to one that accommodates the everyday spending of our Card Members. We created one of the world's largest loyalty programs in Membership Rewards. We built a global network of bank partners. We transformed our marketing, card acquisition, servicing and risk management capabilities for the digital age. We formed groundbreaking partnerships with a new generation of technology platforms. We launched countless new and innovative products and services, built long-term relationships with millions of customers and merchants around the world and elevated our reputation as the gold standard for customer service. We've navigated through the tragedy of 9/11, the disruption of natural disasters, the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and attacks on our business model. And we've come out stronger every time. It's been an absolutely amazing time, and I'm delighted that I will be handing over the reins to someone who has played an important role in shaping the company that we are today. Steve knows the business and the brand. He knows the marketplace. He is an excellent strategist, a strong leader, and a great partner. We've been moving the company forward in a very competitive environment, and Steve has been there every step of the way. I feel very good about how we are positioned for the next several years. Now Jeff is going to speak to our current results in a few minutes, but I thought it would be helpful to offer a little bit of context on the business and on the succession process. Those of you who have been following us for a while know that we decided a few years ago to renew some co-brand relationships and in others. We knew that those decisions would involve short-term pressure on earnings and raise questions with a number of you. But given how marketplace economics were evolving, we didn't want to simply stick with the status quo and tie up resources in relationships that wouldn't make economic sense over the long term. We believe the breadth of our business model offers better opportunities. Many of you wanted to see the proof, and rightly so. We focused on refashioning the business for a new competitive, regulatory and digital environment. We did that by innovating and drawing on our traditional strengths, not by abandoning them. We reorganized the company along global lines of business, and we built a leaner, faster, smarter culture. We accelerated our reengineering work and are on track to take $1 billion out of our expense base. We used our investment dollars to transform many of our capabilities and fund the initiatives that are driving much of the growth you see today. The products and benefits we've added over the past few years, the relationships we've strengthened and the new customers we've acquired have been showing strong returns. Cards-in-force, billed business and earnings per share are back above where they were before we began to reposition the business. For the last few quarters, we've been generating strong growth across our consumer and commercial payments business here in the U.S. and in a range of international markets. You'll be hearing more about that from Jeff. But let me also offer some context on succession, which is something the board and I have been focused on since the day I became CEO. The critical phase of the process has been underway for 5-plus years. We considered potential candidates from both inside and outside of the company. It has been a very thorough process and involved every member of our board. They all agreed that Steve's the best person to build on the progress that's now underway. I know many of you have spent time with Steve over the last few years, and there will be many opportunities to meet with him in his new role. Before you hear from him, I thought I'd offer a little personal background. Steve caught my attention early in his career back in the 1990s, and we worked closely since the start of my tenure as CEO. He'd been responsible for two of our core businesses, Merchant Services, and commercial payments. He had a background in dealing with technology, including managing our Y2K transition. Technology has always been important to American Express, and I believe digital innovation was going to be even more important in the years ahead. I also believe Steve was going to be more important in the years ahead. So I asked him to head up our technologies group. I told him this was all about focusing on the future and that it was a big opportunity for him and for the company. Under Steve's leadership, the tech organization became the engine that drives almost everything we do today. So it worked out well for us, it worked out pretty well for Steve, too. As he accomplished more and more, we asked him to do more and more. That included overseeing the global service network. It included reorganizing commercial payments into one of the fastest-growing businesses at American Express. It included leading the companywide effort to improve our operating efficiencies. He has been a great partner. And I am delighted, as someone with a large ongoing financial interest in the success of this company, to turn the rein over to him. Thanks, Ken. I'm honored and humbled that Ken and the Board of Directors have asked me to be the next Chairman and CEO of the American Express Company. I've been privileged to work here for over 32 years. And through it all, I have been constantly reminded how great and truly special this company is. Ken Chenault is one of the most respected business leaders in the world. Working for him for the past 13 years has been an incredible learning experience for me, and I plan to draw on that experience as I move forward. When I look ahead, I'm very excited about where we are and what our future holds. We're coming out of a period of transition and moving into a period of growth with tremendous momentum across our businesses. We have a strong leadership team that has instilled a sense of purpose and collaboration across the company. We have talented and engaged people in every business all around the world who are resilient, creative and focused on delivering for our customers and our shareholders. Of course, there are challenges to face, including fierce competition, rapid changes brought about by technological advances and regulatory pressures. However, I've never felt better about our ability to take on those challenges. Our underlying fundamentals, our brand, and our business model is strong, and we have no shortage of growth opportunities. Our next chapter will be about building on the momentum we have generated, with a special focus on innovation, expanding our core product offerings, enhancing our brand and our customer relationships and partnering with others to stay ahead of the curve in the evolving payments industry. We'll continue pursuing many of our current strategies that show great growth potential, and we'll look for new avenues of growth that can help us extend our leadership position for the long term. I want to build on what Ken has accomplished, without forgetting that the status quo, as he often says, doesn't cut it in a fast-changing and competitive environment. I'm looking forward to spending time with many of you in my new role. For now, I want to give you a sense of the items that are front and center on my agenda and where I believe sustainable growth will come from. First, we aim to strengthen our leadership in the premium consumer space by continuing to deliver personalized benefits to customers through the expansion of our closed-loop data advantage, expanding our roster of business partners around the globe and building our premium lending portfolio through broader relationships with existing customers and industry-leading risk management expertise. Second, we'll look to extend our leadership in the commercial payments space globally by leveraging and investing in our unmatched global footprint and commercial capabilities and continuing our emphasis on small and midsized businesses globally by expanding our existing products and services to help them fund and grow their businesses. Third, we want to continue to make American Express an important part of our customers' digital lives by expanding our digital partnerships and through targeted acquisitions. Finally, we'll focus on becoming the most innovative network by leveraging the fact that we are one integrated business model. We'll help merchants navigate the convergence of online and offline commerce with cutting-edge fraud protection, marketing insights and digital connections to higher-spending Card Members, and we will offer expanded products and services to our GNS partners. Developing long-term sustainable relationships is key to our business. In every interaction, we'll continuously strive to provide the world's best customer experience through our best-in-class global service network. This is a great business model, a world-class brand and an extraordinarily talented group of people. I feel very good about our capabilities, what we've accomplished and where we are today. However, the worlds of commerce and payments are not standing still. As I've learned from Ken, if great businesses don't keep moving forward, they fall behind. If great brands don't evolve, they lose their luster. If talented people don't innovate, they lose their edge. Or said in my own words, you can't seize the future if you're stuck in or welded to the past. I will continue to challenge our people to think what if, to rethink the possible and to innovate. Now let me turn it back to Ken. Let me close with a few short comments. First, we're completing one chapter with results that show the upside of managing this business for the moderate to long term. Second, we're starting the next chapter from a position of strength. And third, as I said earlier, it's been a great honor and privilege to lead this company. I've worked alongside some of the best and brightest talent anywhere. I've had the opportunity to partner with some of the world's most innovative and respected companies. I've been inspired by the thousands of employees around the world who deliver for our customers every day. I owe all of them my sincere thanks. There's always going to be more work to do, but I believe our best days are ahead of us. I will likely see many of you over the next few months. But for now, let me say thank you for joining us and turn the call over to Jeff, who is going to discuss the results in more detail and take your questions. Well, thank you, Ken and Steve, and thank you for getting the company to where we are today. Now as some of you might imagine, Ken and Steve have a lot of people to talk to about this news: employees, customers, partners, the media and many more. So we're going to let them go off to attend to all these discussions, and Toby and I will stay here to talk to you about our latest financial results and outlook. I would start by building on what both Ken and Steve said in their remarks, and you can see in our performance that our simple financial model is working. We are driving revenue growth across our diverse businesses, leveraging our fixed cost base to drive expense efficiencies and steadily returning capital to shareholders, all of which are combining to drive the type of steady EPS performance for which American Express has long been known. With this as context, let's turn our attention to Slide three of our investor presentation, where we'll jump into our third quarter results. Revenue of $8.4 billion was up 9% versus the third quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of FX, where the dollar weakened a bit versus the prior year for the first -- adjusted revenue growth was 8%, consistent with the adjusted revenue growth rate from Q2 '17. I'll come back to the drivers of revenue growth in a few minutes, but we are pleased with our steady performance across the different customer segments we serve and the different geographies in which we operate. Net income grew 19% in the quarter while earnings per share was $1.50, up 25% from the third quarter of 2016 as we continue to steadily buy back shares. Looking at the income statement. Many of you will have noted that we had an unusually low tax rate of roughly 26% this quarter. The lower tax rate results primarily from the realization of certain foreign tax credits in the current quarter as well as an ongoing shift in the geographic mix of our earnings. In the quarter, we also incurred discrete charges related to our U.S. Loyalty Coalition business, our U.S. Prepaid business and the recent hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. I'll provide a bit more detail on these later in my remarks, but the aggregate impact of these discrete charges equates to approximately $0.12 of earnings per share. So looking at both the lower tax rate and these discrete charges together, the net impact to EPS is minimal, and we believe the third quarter EPS of $1.50 is a good indicator of the underlying core performance of the business. These results brought our return on equity for the 12 months ending in September to 23%. This ROE performance is below our historical performance, primarily due to the uneven quarterly earnings we experienced last year in 2016. If you simply look at our expected earnings range for the full year 2017 and our equity position, our ROE should trend back toward our historical level as we end the year. Moving now to our metrics, starting with billed business performance trends, which you see several of views of Slide 4 through 6. Worldwide, FX-adjusted billings grew 8% in the quarter versus the prior year, consistent with the adjusted growth rate over the last few quarters. And when we look at the segment view on Slide 5, you see consistent performance across the segments this quarter. Moving to Slide 6. We have added a view of billings growth, bringing together several ways we have talked about our broad-ranging growth opportunities in recent years. Before we get into the details, let me remind you that our Global Commercial and Global Consumer segments are roughly the same size, representing 40% and 43% of billings, respectively. Global Network Services makes up the remaining 17% of billings. Within the Global Commercial segment, the first two bars represent customers who are small and midsized enterprises, or SMEs, defined as clients with less than $300 million in annual revenues. We have consistently seen strong growth from SMEs, and this continued in the third quarter. U.S. SME billings grew 10% in the third quarter while international SME, which has been one of our highest growth areas recently, was even more robust with FX-adjusted growth of 15% The large and global customer segment grew at 5% on an FX-adjusted basis this quarter, up modestly from prior quarters. This customer group represents just 10% of our overall billings but is critical from a scale and relevance perspective, although we expect this segment to show more modest growth rates. Within Global Consumer, the U.S. represents around 31% of the company's billings and is growing at 7% Although the U.S. consumer premium space remains competitive, we are seeing strong results in our U.S. consumer platinum franchise. U.S. consumer platinum volumes and Card Member numbers continue to be at record levels since we rolled out new features and benefits starting in Q4 last year. International Consumer is up 13% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven by our operations in countries such as Japan, the U.K., and Australia, all of which are up 18% to 19%, adjusted for FX. Keep in mind that these volumes represent our proprietary cards where the closed loop model enables us to offer strong value propositions that are driving billings momentum. Finally, FX-adjusted billings growth for our network business was 4%, a modest slowdown from last quarter and in line with our expectations. As we've said before, with evolving regulations in Europe and Australia, we expect network volumes in those geographies to decline over time. As we adapt to these new regulations, we would expect our proprietary international billings to grow faster than network partner billings. Overall, we feel good about all the diverse sources of growth across our business segments and geographies. Although we have some headwinds from regulation in markets around the world and intense competition in the U.S., we are particularly excited about the opportunities we have in high-growth areas like SME and International Consumer, which reflect the diversity of our business model. Turning next to loan performance on Slide 7. Our loan growth accelerated to 14% on a reported basis and to 13% on an FX-adjusted basis. Once again, more than 50% of the new loans added to our portfolio are coming from existing customers this quarter, in line with the strategy we first laid out in early 2016. Before we get into our lending metrics, I thought it would be helpful to take a step back and review our overall lending strategy which, as a reminder, drives just a modest portion of our overall revenues, with net interest income coming in at 20% of our total Q3 revenues. Over the last several years and, in particular, with the portfolio sales last year, the mix of our loan book has changed, with co-brand card loans representing a smaller portion of the portfolio and Amex-branded card loans making up a greater portion of the portfolio. This shift in our portfolio leads to higher yields and, as we have said before, also higher loss rates. Taken together, this generates attractive lending economics. And you see the individual dynamics playing out across both our yield and lending credit metrics. For example, on the right side of Slide 7, you can see net interest yield increased again sequentially to 10.7%. The shift in the portfolio I just described is one of the drivers of this steady sequential increase, along with a few other factors we mentioned last quarter, including a shift in the mix of revolving loans toward higher APRs, including having a smaller portion at introductory rates, pricing actions taken in recent quarters and benchmark interest rates increasing more than our overall funding cost. We are pleased with our progress here. So at some point, we expect net interest margin to stabilize and, as a result, we expect the year-over-year growth in net interest income to slow from current levels. Turning next to credit metrics on Slide 8. You see the upward trend, as expected, consistent with the same shift in the portfolio I just described. The worldwide lending write-off rate was 1.8% for the quarter. Let me remind you that if you compare to last year, the write-off rate in Q3 2016 was slightly elevated due to Costco loans that were not sold as part of the portfolio sale. In the third quarter, the delinquency rate was 1.3%, in line with our expectations and, again, higher than the prior year due primarily to the mix shift in the loan portfolio. Moving to Slide 9. Provision expense for the quarter is $769 million, and you can clearly see that we continue to build reserves to account for the growth in loans, which has exceeded our expectation, as well as the related seasoning in our loan portfolio and the mix shift toward Amex-branded products that I just discussed. A small part of the reserve billed also relates to the hurricanes, which we estimated to around $20 million in the quarter. This does include an estimate for Puerto Rico where we have a more limited amount of information available. We are, of course, doing many things to support our Card Members and merchants and will closely monitor the situation in the coming months. Looking forward, we continue to expect provision to grow at a higher rate than loans if we progress on our lending strategy, though I would expect the year-over-year growth rate in Q4 to move down toward the average for the full year. We feel good about the trade-off between risk in the portfolio, profitability and growth and believe we have a long runway to grow our share of our customers' borrowing behaviors. Turning to our revenue performance on Slide 10. FX-adjusted revenue was up 8%. We are pleased with another quarter of strong revenue growth coming from a broad range of diverse business opportunities. Looking now at the components of revenue on Slide 11. First, discount revenue was up 6%, driven by the strong growth in billed business. Net card fees growth was 5%. If you look back to the third quarter last year, we had a small non-recurring benefit that we are growing over this quarter. Considering this, our growth this quarter remains consistent with our recent trends. This quarter also had a very small impact from the Platinum fee increase for existing U.S. consumer Card Members since the results would only show a 1-month impact for Card Members whose anniversary date is in September. While it is still early, we are pleased to see strong Card Member engagement, acquisition and renewal trends with a refreshed U.S. consumer platinum value proposition. Other fees and commissions grew 11% in the second quarter while other revenues declined by 10%. The decline in other revenues was primarily driven by prior year revenue from a small business we sold in Q4 of last year. Net interest income grew by 26%, driven by the higher net interest yield we discussed earlier and higher adjusted loan balances. Turning to discount rate on Slide 12. The reported discount rate was 2.42%, down 5 basis points from the prior year. And the ratio of discount revenue to billed business was 1.76%, down 4 basis points from last year. You'll remember the right side of Slide 12 from our Investor Day this March where we talked about the factors driving erosion in our discount rate. The biggest drivers of erosion in the third quarter were merchant-specific negotiations across the globe and our OptBlue efforts in the U.S., consistent with what we described at the Investor Day in March. In addition to the drivers we described in March, we did see a slightly larger-than-expected impact from mix in part due to strong growth outside the U.S. Turning now to expenses on Slide 13. Performance varied across the lines, and I'll discuss changes to the marketing and promotion rewards and Card Member services expenses when I come back to spending on Card Member engagement in just a minute. But first, let me cover operating expenses. Total operating expenses were flat to the prior year. However, as I mentioned earlier, there were discrete charges impacting operating expense both this year and last year. In Q3 '16, we incurred a restructuring charge related to our initiatives to remove $1 billion from our cost base. In Q3 '17, we took discrete charges related to our U.S. Loyalty Coalition business and our U.S. Prepaid business. In the U.S. Loyalty business, you may have recently seen announcement from certain founding partners of Plenti regarding their future loyalty plans. Giving -- given these changes, we are in confidential discussions with a few remaining Plenti sponsors regarding the future of the program. As a result of this partner announcements and the evolving state of the U.S. program, we have taken an impairment charge and a related restructuring charge for the U.S. Loyalty Coalition business this quarter. Before moving on, I would remind you that we run a similar program, Payback, in 5 other countries, with a particularly well-established long-running program in Germany. In the U.S. Prepaid business, the charges were related to the recently announced distribution agreement with [ income ] Total operating expenses adjusted for these discrete charges in both years declined by 4%, consistent with the year-over-year change on an adjusted basis that we saw in Q2. We are making solid progress on our cost-reduction initiatives, and we remain confident that we will remove $1 billion from the company's cost base on a run rate basis by the end of 2017. As we have previously mentioned, given our revenue performance and accelerated progress on our cost savings initiatives, we have taken the opportunity to selectively reinvest into areas of the business that we believe will help drive continued revenue growth going forward. Finally, on Slide 13. As I previously discussed, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, down from 34% a year ago, due primarily to the realization of certain foreign tax credits in the current year and an ongoing shift in the geographic mix of earnings. Going forward, we estimate our ongoing tax rate will be approximately 32%, given the changes to our geographic mix of earnings. Of course, the rate in any given period can be further impacted by discrete tax items as we saw in Q3. Moving to the summary of our Card Member engagement spending on Slide 14. Total engagement spending in Q3 was $3.1 billion, flat sequentially and up 11% versus the prior year. Looking at the components of that spending, M&P was down 12% versus Q3 '16. As a reminder, we expect marketing and promotion to be down significantly for the full year relative to 2016 as we realize efficiencies in our marketing spend and move beyond the unique investment opportunities we had in the second half of 2016. I would point out that given our overall strong financial performance year-to-date, we have chosen to selectively reinvest into growth opportunities for the medium to long-term. As we look at the effectiveness of our marketing spend, we continue to see good progress in attracting new customers. In the quarter, we added 2.6 million new proprietary customers globally. In our global consumer business, over 2/3 of new customer acquisition came through digital channels, and over 35% of new customers were millennials. Rewards expense increased 21% in Q3, while proprietary billings grew by 9% versus last year. This growth in rewards resulted in a ratio of rewards cost proprietary billings of 84 basis points, which is up from the prior year but down two basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in rewards expense during the quarter reflects the impact of the enhancements to our U.S. Platinum products that we implemented in Q4 '16 as well as strong growth in our Delta co-brand portfolio. Cost of Card Member services in the quarter increased 31%, reflecting higher engagement levels across our premium travel services, including airport lounge access and co-brand benefits, such as First Bag Free on Delta as well as usage of the new Uber benefit on Platinum. This remains an area where we offer differentiated benefits, and we plan to continue to invest in Card Member services. Turning now to capital on Slide 15. We continue to be pleased with our ability to return excess capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. We returned 97% of the capital we've generated thus far in 2017 to shareholders, which has driven a 5% reduction in our average shares outstanding versus the prior year. The third quarter common equity Tier 1 capital ratio moved down sequentially to 11.9%, in line with our expectations and driven by growth in the balance sheet and the fact that we've returned 115% of the capital generated this quarter. We are confident that the strength of our business model provides us with the ability to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios in accordance with the annual CCAR review. So to summarize. Over the past few years, we've embarked on a series of initiatives to reposition the company and drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth. These efforts have been targeted at providing a mix of returns over the short, medium and longer term. We are seeing the payoff in our 2017 results with strong and consistent performance over the first three quarters. Given these strong results and where we are in the year, we are increasing our full-year earnings per share guidance to a range of $5.80 to $5.90. We are pleased to be able to both raise our earnings expectations while also funding some incremental investments aimed at driving moderate to long-term results. It has long been our practice to balance the financial commitments we have in the short term, which we take very seriously, with the opportunities we see to invest and build for the longer term. As we go forward, we are focused on delivering steady and consistent earnings growth, building upon the range of growth opportunities that we see across our diverse customer segments and geographies. With that, let me turn it back over to Toby as we move to Q&A. Thank you, Jeff. Before we open the lines for Q&A, I'll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open the line for questions for Jeff on the quarter's result. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. If you would like to ask a question, please press star then one on your telephone keypad. You'll hear a tone indicating you've been placed in queue, and you may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing the pound key. Our first question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead, please. Thank you. Good results and congratulations to Steve and Ken. Jeff, I wanted to make sure I understood your comments on the provision. It sounds like this quarter's elevated levels were related to a little bit of an expectation of higher charge-offs in the future as you expect the provisions to come down next quarter in terms of the growth rate. Can you just help us think about where you see the net charge-off rate going over the next 12 months? Yes. So thank you, Sanjay, for the question. A couple of comments. First, I'd remind everyone that I've often said there's a little bit of volatility quarter-to-quarter in the provisions, so I encourage people to think a little bit about the longer-term trends. If you look year-to-date, the provision is up 37%, loans are up 14%. And as I said, I would expect the year-over-year increase in provision to look more like that year-to-date number in Q4. Next thing I'd say is, remember, there's a real tie here if you think about the shift that has occurred in our loan portfolio between yields and the write-off rates. And so one of the inflection points in our growth rates, was around 18 to 24 months ago when we were very focused on all the changes occurring as we went through the transitions around our co-brand portfolios. A lot of the newer accounts that we acquired in that time are just hitting sort of a key point in the seasoning timeline, 18 to 24 months. And frankly, that's part of what's driving yield up as they come off introductory rates and start paying off. And frankly, that's also what's giving us a little visibility into what the right future expected write-offs are, and that's a little bit of what drove the provision up this quarter. So I think it's very important to keep those two things in mind. We're getting attractive economics overall. As I think about net write-offs going forward, I think, Sanjay, if you think back, we in early '16, seeing all the changes we were making, began to say that we'd expect to see a modest, steady upward drift as we grow a little bit above the industry and as that drives the inevitable seasoning of the portfolio and a bigger portion of the portfolio being of lower tenure. That actually didn't happen much in 2016. It's now begun to happen in 2017, and I really expect similar trends to continue as we get into 2018. So hopefully that helps on the provision. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Go ahead, please. Great, thanks. Hey, how are you, Jeff? I'll add my congratulations if they're listening, but I doubt it. yes. They will read every word of the transcript, Craig. So there you have it, OK. You're talking about reinvestment, where appropriate. I was hoping you could be more specific because the read we seem to be getting on the U.S. consumer market is that there's certainly been a plateauing effect in rewards. In fact, it seems like some of the most aggressive players over the last few years have been rationalizing their investment because the returns might not have been what they thought they were going to be or that consumers outsmarted them to a degree just at a time when Platinum has accelerated. So are you pushing the gas pedal down further in that part of the business? Or are there other parts of the business that you're finding more attractive right now? Yes. That's an excellent question, Craig. And I think this really goes to the unusually broad range of both customer segments and geographies that our business encompasses. And so yes, as we have had stronger financial performance than we have expected this year, we are putting a little bit to the bottom line, and that's the increase in guidance, and we're also putting a little bit into the M&P line and a little bit into some things that are in OpEx. And if you think about that, what are the particularly high-growth areas that we've seen lately. Well, in particular, I called out in my remarks the small and medium-sized enterprise based both in the U.S. and internationally as well as the proprietary international consumer space. And so those are -- we see those as particularly good growth opportunities for us. And as we have thought about where might there be a really good return over the medium to long-term spending a little bit of incremental resource is those kind of areas. And some of that goes into M&P. Some of it also goes into OpEx, right? When you start talking about the commercial space, you're often talking about sales people who run through OpEx. You're talking about how we use our call centers to help drive more volumes, the timing of that runs through OpEx. So it's a mixture. But we are, as you would expect, being very thoughtful about putting incremental dollars only in those places where we think there are particularly good returns for us right now, and where we have a unique position or a unique advantage. Thanks, Jeff. Operator Thank you. We'll go next to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please. Hey are good evening, Jeff, I'm done. Congrats to Ken and Steve. I guess just in terms of the guidance, you noted that you're raising the guidance. It seems like the business momentum is strong. Revenue growth has remained over 8%. I guess you made some remarks about NII, over time, the growth will slow. But can you just talk about your ability to sustain these levels of growth, both top line and bottom line, as we move into '18, given that you're making some incremental investments which, in theory, should drive revenue growth over the short and intermediate time? Or would you expect this over the time to move more back to the interim goals of 6% top line and 10% bottom line? Yes. So boy, there's a lot there in that question, Ryan, thank you. Let me start with revenues and then work my way to the bottom line. We're really pleased by the 8% revenue growth that we've seen the last two quarters, and we have tremendous momentum across all of our businesses. Just like it is last quarter, I have pointed out that at some point the tremendous sequential growth you've seen in our net interest yield will start to plateau and slow down a little bit, and that will have an effect of slowing the revenue growth rate a little bit. I'm not calling out exactly when that turn happens. It certainly didn't happen this quarter. But at some point, it will slow us down a little bit. Similarly in 2017 thus far, you've seen a particularly nice uplift in the U.S. from both the consumer and the Business Platinum value proposition changes we made late last year and early this year. At some point again, you will begin to lap those. Although I would remind you, on the consumer platinum product, that is a long lapping process because the fee increase for existing customers only went into effect beginning with customers who had their renewal dates in September, so it will actually play out over the next -- the way the accounting works, the next 24 months. So those two things over time will put a little bit of downward pressure on the current momentum you have at 8%. Now you also have some things next to it that will go the other way. So we are really pleased with the announcement we made along with Hilton a few months ago that point out we will have an expanded partnership with Hilton in 2018, and we will become the sole co-brand provider, and that will certainly provide some incremental revenue opportunities for us in 2018. I would be remiss if I didn't point out that as you would expect for co-brand renewals in recent years, it also comes with some margin compression. We're very pleased with that opportunity. So exactly where all that comes out in 2018 in terms of revenue growth, we'll give you an update on, on the January call, but we feel good about the momentum. And those are probably the three things that, at the margins, will move it a little up and a little down as you get into next year. And I guess I should also point out, I'm making all my comments ignoring any changes that new rev rec rules might cause, which would just be geography anyway. Bottom line, look, I think we have a long track record that we are showing renewed vigor on this year in that our model lets us get tremendous expense leverage, and the kind of spend-centric model we have does not require a lot of capital support balance growth each year, which lets us do lots of share repurchase and payment of dividends. So that's the model, and we should consistently be able to turn good revenue growth into even better EPS growth. Exactly what that looks like for 2018, we'll let you know as we get into the January earnings call. Thanks, Jeff. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please. Hi, good evening. Can we talk a little bit about the funding side? I just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about deposit growth build. It's been very strong this quarter. Just wondering if you're looking to first continue that kind of growth rate? Or do you feel good about where your loan-to-deposit ratios are today? And what kind of pricing you feel you need to attract deposits and where deposit base are going over the course of the next year if there's another 1 or two rate hikes? Yes. So just to level set for everyone, for us, if you think about the 100 basis points that the Fed has raised rates over the last almost two years, we've -- as they've gone up -- or as the Fed has gone up 100 basis points, we've raised rates on our personal savings programs about 35 basis points. So that certainly has been a big positive for our results. Now I would not expect the beta, if you will, to remain at 0.35 forever going forward. On many occasions in these calls, I've talked about a 0.7 beta over the longer term that we use in a lot of our modeling. Obviously, we'll have to see exactly where the industry grows, our goal will be to remain competitive. In terms of balances, for the last couple of years, Betsy, we've said we're kind of comfortable where we were because we want to remain very active in both the asset-backed securities market as well as the unsecured market, and being active in all three markets is an important part of our funding strategy. I would say as we get into the latter part of 2018 and beyond, I would expect to see us growing personal savings again at levels that we have in a number of years. And so that's not something you'll see next quarter or early 2018. But I would say, over the course of the next 12 to 18 months, you will see some significant growth there. Exactly how much will be a little bit of a function of where the rate environment goes, both in terms of the base level of what the Fed does as well as what the competitive market does for these kinds of online accounts. But you're-you're trying to get up to a loan-to-deposit ratio up perhaps? Is that the reason for that? Well, the way we really think about it, Betsy, is -- I come back to -- given our mix of business, we probably think of it less as a loan-to-deposit ratio, and we think we want a funding strategy that creates a balance of being diversified across different sources in different markets so that from a security and soundness perspective, no matter what happens in the capital market, we have good access to capital. And we want to do that while also being efficient about funding our diverse business model. I think what people forget sometimes is because we have a big international business because we have a Corporate Card business, our funding structure requires that we access different sources of funding in different places as our funding is not all fungible. So that's really how we approach it. And what I'd say is the personal savings rate or number, which has been in the $30 billion number for a while range, that is a number that I would expect to go up over the next 12 to 24 months. Thank you. Operator Thank you and all the question ten Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Thank you. Congratulations to both Ken and Steve. So Jeff, on that note, how do you make sure that a big management change like this doesn't have any impact on negotiations around looks like Starwood deal? Well, there's probably two questions there. First, gosh, I'm going to go back to the thing Ken and Steve said. Steve Squeri has worked hand-in-hand with Ken Chenault for 32 years and has been intimately involved in every change that we've made, in particular over the last couple of years. So I don't think we missed a beat on any aspect of running the business. As I say that, I also think it's important to remind you of Steve's words that we fully understand though that it doesn't mean you don't constantly have to change, you can't stand still, so I feel really good about all that. In terms of Marriott and SPG, look, we said for a long time that there's three possible outcomes here, right? Marriott chooses to keep two co-brand partners, they go with the other co-brand partner or they go with us. I will acknowledge we are the smaller of the two partners. On the other hand, Marriott has made a lot of public statements here about the fact that they want to bring the two programs together next year, that our contract doesn't expire until 2020. The other co-brand bank, their contract expires next year. So we have been working really hard to demonstrate the tremendous value that the range of travel assets we have, consumer travel agencies, Business Travel agency, a huge Membership Rewards program, a premium-oriented customer base, we think those are really tremendous assets when you're talking about a travel co-brand. We think they've been a really important part of what has made SPG a really powerful program. And I think Marriott is very focused on making sure they keep the loyalty and the engagement of all those SPG card members, and we would love to be a part of it. So we'll have to see where it goes, but I don't think we'll miss a beat here. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead. Yes, thanks. Jeff, when I saw you at our conference last month, it sounded like you saw the NIM was already kind of at a level where it might have plateaued, yet you had another big step-up this quarter. And it also sounds like you're not necessarily closing the door to the notion that it could have a little bit more upside there. First, just want to get your reaction, am I recalling that correctly? And if so, what, if anything, has kind of changed the outlook? And kind of what specifically really was the driver of the strength this quarter? Well, you are completely accurately recalling my comments, the public comments from your conference a little bit ago. I think the important words here, which I tried to replicate in my remarks earlier this afternoon, is that at some point -- obviously, you can't raise your net interest yield forever so, at some point, it has to plateau. Now we're working hard to try to continue to do smart things that are consistent with building long-term customer engagement and loyalty that will continue to drive our net interest yield up. But at some point, it will plateau. I'm not calling exactly when that happens, and it certainly did not happen this quarter. And we're really pleased with the momentum we have. Okay, thanks. Operator Thank you. We'll go next to Chris Brendler with Buckingham. Go ahead, please. Hi, thanks. Good evening and thanks for taking my question. Jeff, I want to talk to you or ask about discount revenue and the trajectory there. If I look at discount revenue, net of rewards, it's actually still shrinking about 3% and 5%, including the services line. And I know we faced some challenges at Costco, but we're kind of beyond that, and you got some renegotiations in Europe and other things that are weighing on discount rate. But is it a lot, and it should start to grow again as we go forward? And I would think that some of that will be a focus of yours, so growing discount revenue net of rewards is kind of my area of question. Well, believe me, it is a focus. And yes, you're -- I don't know the exact amount, yes, directionally, you're correct. The thing you need to remember, we made a very conscious decision late last year, early this year, to make some significant value proposition enhancements in the U.S. in both the Business Platinum card and the Consumer Platinum card. And those are both very substantial and material franchises for us. So it worked tremendously well. We've really exceeded our own expectations even in terms of Card Member engagement, new Card Member acquisition as well as continued, really, de minimis attrition rates. Until you're done lapping that increase in rewards cost, you get the effect you just described on discount revenue overall. So look, there -- it is a competitive environment in all the markets we serve but particularly competitive in the U.S. consumer space. But once you're done lapping these, you should begin to see a little different trend when you do the calculation that you just described. And certainly, our goal across the globe is to get that discount revenue net of rewards number growing consistently. And I would think that would -- does that suggest that there are some onetime cost associated with this? So I would think those rewards cost would be perpetual if you're increasing the value of the products and the value of the spending that you wouldn't necessarily have an anniversary. Maybe there are some one time costs that you can you can anniversary there? Yes. But when you're looking at year-over-year growth, remember you have a big step-up in the rewards cost this year and a kind of what I'm going to call standard step-up in discount revenue. And what we would expect to see once you're done lapping that is you're still on the same or somewhat similar traditionally in terms of your gross discount revenues. But growing -- but your rewards cost don't have the huge spike in growth that they had this year. If you think about it, that's the -- in my remarks, I think the numbers I called out were rewards costs were up 19% while the... 21%. 21%, while the associated billings were up much less. So that will -- that relationship, as we go into the next quarter or 2, will get much more aligned again. And that will change the phenomenon you described. Thanks so much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, please. Thank you and good evening and congratulations to Ken and Steve. Congratulations to both Ken and Steve. My question really relates to reserving. Obviously, the loss rates for American Express are quite low relative to the industry, and you kind of talked about the increase that you're looking for. I guess I'm trying to understand kind of the reserving that you're anticipating. Sometimes companies use 12 months, sometimes a little longer. Can you give us any kind of sense as to how you're thinking about that reserve because it looked like a very large build no matter how you want to look at it this quarter? Yes. Gosh, the reserving process, Ken, we could probably bore everyone for the next hour if we went through it in great detail. And as you know, it is both a heavily regulated process, not just by the usual accounting standards you would expect but also heavily by our regulators, and some of what we do is very much driven by them. Look, there's no question, this was a big reserve build this quarter. What I keep coming back to is the -- when you put aside there's a little quarter-to-quarter volatility, and you look at this over any given couple of quarters, we're trending as we would have expected. We are pleased with the loan growth we're seeing overall. The shift in portfolio mix is an important part of what is driving tremendous growth in net interest yield, and that comes with some growth in the write-offs. And we are getting, as I explained earlier, to this point where a significant number of the newer accounts we brought on 18 to 24 months ago are getting to the kind of key part of the timeline as they season. And so we're building some reserves for that, and that's part of what's driving the yield up as well. So there's really not a lot more to the story. Yes, we certainly look at what kind of coverage we have going forward, although we may differ judgments in charge versus lend in different parts of the world. But we feel good about the reserves, we think they're conservative, and we feel good about the overall economics that we're getting from our lending. Thank you. Operator Thank you. We will now go to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. I wanted to come back to Chris' question about the rewards costs. And you had mentioned that it was down a couple of basis points from the second quarter in terms of the rewards costs. And maybe -- I saw in the notes here that the ultimate redemption rate was stable. Could you discuss whether that was an impact from a cost per point or something else that's going on and how that might kind of move around going forward? Yes, so I -- yes, you're right, Moshe, the -- there was a small sequential decline. I think what you're calling out is the ratio of the rewards cost to the billings. There's a little quarter-to-quarter volatility. It's a very complex calculation that, of course, is not just the U.S. calculation, but involves lots of other international markets, and we're doing the calculation by market. So you get a little bit of volatility quarter-to-quarter. So I would not want anyone to leave the call thinking that 84 basis points is exactly what you should expect forever going forward. It'll bounce up and down a few basis points each quarter. In general, though, that's the range I would expect to be in given all the value propositions that we have in the marketplace today. And I wouldn't point to any particular business change or anything that drove that two basis points sequential decline, Moshe. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please. Obviously, congratulations to Ken and Steve, both well deserved. I want to talk a little bit about incentives. And one of the things we've seen over the last several years is there's been a distortion between, I would describe, rewards and loyalty. And as the rewards sort of [ wore a bit ] a little bit, are you starting to see brand loyalty become more important again? And are you seeing any shift in terms of wallet share among your existing customers based upon that? Well, I guess -- Rick, let me make a few comments that may or may not be responses to exactly where you're going. Certainly, we believe -- both Ken and Steve in their remarks talked about the fact that we think we have a particularly strong brand. And our customers, given our long-standing reputation for service, attach to our brand. And we take that loyalty really seriously and really value it and we work very hard at it. And one of the things that we've talked about on many of these calls is that sometimes people will do a pure mathematical calculation of different products that are out there in the marketplace and say, ""Gee, American Express, you can't possibly compete because -- let's use the simplest category, ""Because your Cashback card doesn't seem to be as rich as somebody else's."" And yet our response to that is often, ""Well, our Cashback cards are doing really good in terms of new customer acquisitions. They're growing nicely, and they're producing really good economics for us."" And one of the things I like to point out internally is we do believe there's value in the brand, we do believe there's value in the range of services we provide. And so by gosh, we shouldn't be able to get those things valued by customers and we shouldn't have to necessarily mathematically match every other aspect of the value proposition that some of our competitors put in the marketplace. So I think, frankly, Rick, we see that long-standing view we have, our long-standing experience, there's proof that brand does matter and loyalty does matter. We work really hard at doing things that build upon that. If you think about the Platinum refreshes that we've done there, very much focused on some of the aspects, the experiential aspects of the product that we think are more difficult for others to replicate and build upon some of our reputation. So that's what we're trying to do every day. We think it's what we've historically done, and we think it gives us some unique advantages that are not easy for others to replicate. No, Jeff, look, I agree with that. But -- and I'm specifically curious if you're seeing, as that sort of distortion normalizes, specifically any pickup in wallet share because I know that's been a big focus for you guys. Yes. Gosh, in a company with over 100 million Card Members, major trends evolve slowly. Yes, we're very focused on attracting more wallet share. We're also, in our consumer business, very focused on attracting more borrowing share. And so we have clearly been making huge strides for the last several years on driving more borrowing share in terms of our Card Members' wallets. And spending share, you kind of have to look at it by market, by commercial versus consumer. I often say, Rick, our goal is to ultimately maximize our financial returns and to maximize our revenue share. And we pay attention to our wallet share, we pay attention to our share of billings, we pay attention to our share of lending. And certainly, in the U.S. consumer space, we're growing share like crazy in our share of lending. But we're not always trying to maximize every one of those if we don't think it's economic. So we feel good about our revenue performance, and we think it's building on good economics for us so... Thank you. Operator Thank you and next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Go ahead, please. Thank you and congratulations to Ken and Steve. Not a big surprise, I guess, after my last conversation with you guys. But I guess on Page 6, very helpful just on going through that. I just like a little more color on the growth of your -- in your presentation there, looking at the SME -- U.S. SME, International SME, international consumer where you have some pretty high growth rates and then the deceleration in Global Network Services. Is that -- are we -- is there a multi-year opportunity in each of these that are much larger? I mean I think the opportunities seem to be very large, but do we have a long way to go, long runway in the growth of these higher growth segments? And should we expect GNS to continue to become less important? Yes. So a couple of comments. Yes, we see tremendous growth opportunities that will last a very, very long time in the SME space because the point we try to make over and over and over to people, Bob, as you know, is that in that space we're often competing against just trying to get small and midsized enterprises to put more of their payment needs on to the card. And it's frankly less about the competition, less about some of the highly competitive rewards competition we face elsewhere. And the growth rates you've seen in both the U.S. and international SME segments have been very high for some number of years. They're driven by our continual ability to work with some small and midsized enterprises to drive more spend on to the card. And we think despite that, we've only captured a small fraction of their spend, and we can keep at this for years. Similarly, when you go outside the U.S., because of evolving regulation in Europe and Australia, for some time, we'll have to see exactly how long it takes, but there's a little bit of a wind-down of the network business in those two parts of the world. It's still growing really nicely everywhere else, and it's still globally an important part of the American Express network, right? So I don't want anyone to walk away from this call thinking it's a less important part of our company. It's really important to the Global Network. You're just going to see modest overall growth rates because of the stepdown in Europe and Australia. That very step-down though in the evolving regulatory climate is part of what's helping fuel some tremendous growth rates in places like the U.K. and Australia and our proprietary card business where, of course, we also get a much greater share of the overall economics. So that's a pretty good trade for us. That international consumer segment as well, Jeff, longer-term? Does that have the same growth opportunities as SME? Absolutely, absolutely. Because remember, outside the U.S., our consumer businesses are still in what I often call, Bob, in earlier stage of growth, and we're growing faster than the market in every one of the major countries that we do business in, with the exception of Canada. And we still have pretty small market shares, we have value propositions that are very difficult for others to match. We're very bullish about that business. Great, I appreciate your comments. Cathy, we have time for just one more question. Operator Thank you. That will come from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Go ahead, please. Thanks. Congrats to Steve and Ken. I'm curious for your thoughts about any additional cost takeout you might have in 2018 in addition to the $1 billion run rate you expect to hit at the end of this year. So look, we feel really good about the hard work that it's been over the last two years to take yet another $1 billion out of the run rate of the company, and we're on track we'll get it. When you go beyond that, David, what I always say is you can always take cost out of a company. It's not always prudent though. And I think when you go beyond 2017, the way to think about it is, in a world where we're seeing the kind of revenue growth now, we can support that, and we will support that, with very little growth in operating expenses. And so that's a tremendous ongoing source of operating leverage. For now, I think saying that we're going to take out another $1 billion would probably not be prudent and we would lose more revenue than we would gain. But steady operating leverage, you should absolutely expect from us. Understood. Thanks very much. Thank you, everybody for joining tonight's call and thanks for your continued interest in American Express. Cathy, back to you. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference. You may now disconnect.

Image source: The Motley Fool. Operator Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Third-Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's Third-Quarter 2017 performance. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolston, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, Group President of Pfizer Innovative Health; John Young, Group President of Pfizer Essential Health; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our website, Pfizer.com/investors. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the Disclosure Notice section in the Earnings Release we issued this morning, as well as in Pfizer's 2016 annual report on Form 10K, including in Part I, Item 1(a) and that is filed with the SEC, and available at SEC.gov, and at our website at Pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements during this conference call speak only as of the original date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of those statements. Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8K dated today, October 31st, 2017. You may obtain a copy of the Form 8K on our website at Pfizer.com/investors. Any non-GAAP measures presented are not, and should not be viewed as substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP. They have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies. We will now make prepared remarks and then we will move to a question and answer session. With that, I now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian? Thank you, Chuck, and good morning everyone. During my remarks today, I will briefly talk about the progress and opportunities within each of our businesses. Our recent announcement regarding our consumer healthcare business and some of the promising assets in our pipeline which, we believe, have the potential to become a foundation for our future growth prospects. Starting with the quarter, we again reported solid operational revenue growth. If you exclude the impact of the Hospira Infusion Systems divestiture and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, revenues for the quarter increased 4% operationally, compared to the prior-year quarter. We also raised the mid-point of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the year. I'll begin with a few words regarding the performance of each of our businesses starting with Pfizer's Innovative Health. This business had another strong quarter, growing its top line 11% operationally. This increase was driven by continued growth of key brands including IBRANCE and Eliquis globally, and XANDI, Lyrica, XELJANZ, and Chantix in the U.S. IBRANCE had another strong quarter with revenues up 59% on an operational basis compared with the same quarter last year. We remain confident in its continued growth potential, and leadership despite there now being two other approved CDK 4/6 Inhibitors. IBRANCE share is now nearly 50% for first-time new patient starts in advanced breast cancer. Prescription volume continues to grow. As of the end of September, IBRANCE has been prescribed by more than 11,000 physicians to 70,000 patients in the U.S., and more than 18,000 patients in the E.U., and received regulatory approval in more than 70 countries including Japan. With XTANDI, we continue to see growth in prescription volume. Although XTANDIs revenue growth is not yet tracking in line with prescription growth due to patient assistance free-drug program utilization as a portion of total demand, we are pleased to report that we have now recorded sequential revenue growth for two consecutive quarters. I would also note, that the patient assistance program proportion of total demand was comparable with that seen in the first and second quarters. We continue to expect that the program utilization will normalize as we move into next year. Of note, the number of urologists actively prescribing XTANDI, again, reached an all-time high this quarter. These increases remain one of the key factors supporting XTANDIs continued growth. In June, we announced the readout of the XTANDI Phase III Prosper Trial in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer has been accelerated by two years. We are pleased the trial met its primary endpoint of improved metastatic pre-survival. We have said previously we see these positive results as key value drivers that support our acquisition thesis for motivation. We are working with our partner, Istelist on worldwide submission plans based on the Prosper Data to seek expansion of the label to non-metastatic CRPC. We continue to hit all-time highs in terms of new rheumatology prescriptions for XELJANZ. We received a record 9.8% sample weekly new prescription share for the month of September for our current indications of rheumatoid arthritis. With the weekly high reaching 10% so far in October, XELJANZ continues to be the fastest growing, advanced RA therapy. We see the potential for two additional and meaningful growth opportunities for XELJANZ with our two pending regulatory submissions for other conditions. The psoriatic arthritis XELJANZ received an overwhelmingly positive vote in favor of approval at the FDA Advisory Committee Meeting in August. We anticipate a final decision by the FDA before the end of the year. XELJANZ has also been accepted for review by the FDA for ulcerative colitis, with a due for a date in March. We've completed filings for both pending indications in multiple other countries. For Eucrisa, we see steady progress. Approximately 83,000 patients started treatment with Eucrisa by the end of the third quarter. More than 23,000 prescribers have provided Eucrisa to patients across a dermatological, pediatric and primary care communities. More than 60% of those prescribers are repeat prescribers. Prescription volume and share velocity continue to strengthen through the third quarter, supported by the successful launch of our DTC Campaign. Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health, while revenues for the quarter declined, we, once again, saw strong operational growth both in emerging markets and our bio-similars portfolio. We also continue to see the value of bio-similars in expanding patient access to important, high quality, low-cost treatment options. Our bio-similars business continues to grow with global revenue increasing 67% operationally in the quarter. In September, we presented two positive Phase III Readouts for our first oncology bio-similar Trastuzumab, which is a proposed bio-similar to Herceptin. The Readouts were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2017 Congress. Both the FDA And the EMA have accepted our filings for this potential therapy. As of the end of September, Inflectra in the U.S. has grown, albeit slowly, to a 4.9% share of the overall U.S. Infliximab market by volume. We continue to have 100% Medicare coverage, as well as strong coverage in Medicaid. In situations where the insurer and provider are the same, such as the V.A., we have seen rapid uptake of Inflectra, with a share in these situations reaching 54%, up from 20% in quarter two. That said, Inflectra penetration in the U.S. continues to be slower than expected due to the exclusionary contracting of Remicaid by J&J, contracting that we believe violates the Anti-Trust laws. As you know, we recently filed suit in the U.S. District Court against J&J. We did this to help ensure the true value bio-similars can be unlocked for the benefit of patients, providers in our nation's healthcare system. We're actually working on a range of strategies to help Inflecta accessibility to more patients and to also lay the groundwork for a smoother, more rapid uptake of all future bio-similars in the U.S. marketplace. Additionally, just yesterday, along with our partner, Celtrion, we presented new data switching patients with Crohns Disease to Inflectra from Remicaid leads to a comparable efficacy safety and tolerability to treatment with Remicade. That's adding to the totality of evidence supporting the switch to Inflectra. In our Essential Health portfolio, we have been experiencing supply shortages with some products. The shortages are primarily for products from Legacy Hospira Portfolio and are largely driven by capacity constraints and technical issues. When we acquired Hospira, we originally thought it would take one to two years to integrate the manufacturing plants and resolve the majority of the supply chain issues. We have a robust action plan in place, and we believe will make substantial progress in 2018 toward reducing the sterile injectable shortages. As we look ahead, in addition to continuing to expect revenue growth from our patient Patsur from our Patent Protected Portfolio; we are very encouraged by the convergence of two positive trends. First, the decline in the number and the revenue impact of L.O.E.s stating our business, and further strengthening of our R&D pipeline and it's potential to drive incremental revenue. We expect the full year, year-over-year impact of L.O.E.s to continue to be significantly lower than our recent past. We are forecasting the impact to be approximately 2 billion in each of the next three years. About 1 billion in 2021 and then 500 million or less from 2022 through 2025. At the same time, we expect a steady flow of new products to begin to emerge from our pipeline. Here are a few of our most recent advances. The development plan for Tergaflosen for Type II Diabetes remains on track, and we expect a decision from the FDA in December. In oncology, our POP Inhibitor Talazoparib, topline results from the Phase III BRCA trail will readout at the end of the year. The end BRCA trial is exploring Talazoparib versus standard of care, chemotherapy, in germline BRCA positive metastatic breast cancer. In partnership with Merck, KGA, we expect data on Vivencio, our PDL I inhibitor, in combination with our 411BB Agent later this year. The study is looking at patients who had not been previously treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. These data could be ready for potential presentation during 2018. We also anticipate data from our triplet combination with Vivencia, our 41BB agent and our Ox40 monoclonal antibody in late 2018. This study is recruiting on track. Also by the end of the year, we plan to submit an application with the FDA for Lolathanib, our next generation ALC inhibitor for the treatment of ALC positive metastatic, non-small cell lung cancer. On October 16th we presented full results of the Lolathanib Phase II data that will form the basis of our discussions with the agency. In information immunology, we recently presented positive Phase II data for our once-daily oral JAK I inhibitor in atopic dermatitis. We are planning to move this compound into Phase III studies shortly. The vaccines, we've started Phase II trials for our next-gen 20 val in pneumococcal vaccine, and have received fast track designation for it from the FDA. These pipeline advances represent just a few of the assets that we expect to form the foundation for offsetting our remaining L.O.E.s. We believe the combination of our strengthening pipeline and the anticipated continuing easing of L.O.E. impact has a potential to support a nice inflection for our future revenue growth rates. I'll close my remarks with a few comments regarding our consumer health business. Earlier this month we announced that we were reviewing strategic options for this business. This could include everything from a full or partial separation of the business to ultimately deciding to retain the business. We are taking this action as part of our regular ongoing reviews of our portfolio, pipeline, and business strategy. Although there was a strong connection between our consumer healthcare business and elements of our core by our pharmaceutical portfolio, it is also distinct enough from our core business that there is a potential for its value to be fully realized outside the company. We anticipate there will be broad interest from potential inquirers and we expect to make a decision in 2018. In summary, we continue to execute on our strategy. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and we have several key brands that we believe are positioned for continued growth. The unfavorable of L.O.E.s remains lower than in previous years, and we expect it to drop off even further in the coming years. And our innovative core is as strong and vibrant as it's ever been, which is positioning well in the areas of greatest patient need and where science is evolving. Now I'll turn it over to Frank who will go into greater detail in the results for the quarter. Thanks, Ian. Good day everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. Moving on to the financials; third-quarter 2017 revenues were approximately 13.2 billion, and reflect the year-over-year operational growth of 178 million. Third-quarter in 2017 revenues were also slightly offset by the unfavorable impact the foreign exchange of 54 million. If you exclude both the revenues of our Hospira Infusion Systems, or HIS, in both periods, as well as the negative impact of the foreign exchange, third-quarter 2017 revenues will increase $458 million or 4%. Our Innovative Health Business recorded 11% operational revenue growth in the third-quarter 2017, driven by IBRANCE and Eloquis globally. The addition, Extandia revenues in the U.S. from the Medivation acquisition in September of 2016, and Lyrica, and XELJANZ both primarily in the U.S. All of this was partially offset by lower revenues for Embrel in most developed Europe markets due to continued bio-similar competition and Viagra in the U.S. because of wholesale or destocking prior to anticipated generic competition beginning in December of 2017. Revenues for our Essential Health Business decreased 11% operationally, of which 5% was attributable to the divestiture of the HIS business in February of this year. The remainder of the decline was due to a 22% operational decline from Peri-L.O.E. products including Pristiq in the U.S. which lost marketing exclusivity in March of 2017, and Lyrica and Vivend in developed Europe markets. As well as a 12% operational decline in the Sterile Injectibles Portfolio primarily due to Legacy Hospira Product shortages in the U.S., all of which were partially offset by operational growth of 67% from biosimilars. In emerging markets, however, Pfizer's overall Essential Health Revenues grew 7% operationally, primarily due to 6% growth from the Legacy Established Products Portfolio, and 14% growth from the Sterile Injectibles Portfolio. Third-quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.47 compared with $0.22 in the year-ago quarter primarily due to the non-recurrence of a remeasurement loss on HIS in the year-ago quarter, higher gross margins, and lower restructuring implementation costs, all of which were partially offset by higher purchase accounting adjustments. Adjusted diluted EPS for the third-quarter was $0.67 versus $0.61 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues, adjusted gross margin, and adjusted other income as well as fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by product losses of exclusivity, product supply, and a higher effective income tax rate. I want to point out that diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by 109 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program reflecting the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February and completed in May of 2017. As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange negatively impacted third-quarter 2017 revenues by approximately 54 million and positively impacted adjusted the cost of sales, adjusted S&A expenses, and the adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $16 million. As a result, foreign exchange unfavorably impacted third quarter 2017 adjusted diluted EPS by $0.01 versus the year-ago quarter. As you can see on the chart, we narrowed the ranges for certain components of 2017 financial guidance. We narrowed our revenue guidance range, and we now expect 2017 revenues to be in the range of 52.4 billion to 53.1 billion. This range continues to absorb an anticipated 2.3 billion negative impact due to continuing product losses of exclusivity, 1.2 billion due to the divestiture of HIS and an anticipated $100 million negative impact due to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates versus 2016 rates. Also, supply challenges primarily related to Legacy Hospira Products have had a negative impact on projected 2017 revenues of several hundred million dollars. Consequently, we lowered the mid-point of our 2017 revenue guidance range. That said, we expect these challenges to moderate in full year 2018. I want to point out that if we exclude the impact of foreign exchange and the sale of HIS, the mid-point of our updated revenue guidance would represent a 2% increase from fiscal years 2016 revenue levels. Concerning adjusted diluted EPS, we increased the mid-point of our guidance range by $0.03, and we now expect 2017 adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of 2.58 to 2.62. The mid-point of our updated 2017 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range, which is 2.60 versus our 2016 actual adjusted diluted EPS of 2.40 implies a growth rate of approximately 8% year-over-year. It's important to note that this guidance range includes the anticipated negative impacts of approximately $0.03 due to the sale of Hospira Infusion Systems; $0.01 for the foreign exchange compared to 2016; and $0.01 resulting from our May 2017 agreement with Sangamo to develop and commercialize gene therapy programs for Hemophilia A. Excluding these, the mid-point of our diluted EPS would have been 2.65 which represents a 10% increase versus 2016 actual results; which is significant given the 2.3 billion of topline headwinds we are facing due to the product losses of exclusivity that I just mentioned. I wanna take a moment to comment on the impact of the hurricanes that took place toward the end of the third quarter. First and foremost, we have nearly 2,000 Pfizer colleagues who live and work in Puerto Rico, their safety and well-being is our priority. I'm pleased to say that we have confirmed the safety of all colleagues in Puerto Rico and we are now providing direct assistance to them. Pfizer also has three manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico. While these sites sustained some damage, we have made significant progress in repairing our facilities in anticipation of ramping up to full operations over the coming months. As a result of dual-source supply options and sufficient pre-hurricane inventory levels, our assessment at this point is that any revenue impact is expected to be insignificant. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and make any updates to our outlook if warranted. Moving on to key takeaways. We continued to deliver strong financial performance in the third quarter of 2017 excluding HIS revenues and the impact of foreign exchange from both periods; revenues increased 4% operationally year-over-year driven by the strong growth from IBRANCE, Eloquis, XELJANZ, Chantix and the contribution of newly acquired products including Xtandi. We narrowed certain 2017 financial guidance ranges including raising the mid-point of our 2017 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.03 to 2.60 from 2.57. We accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones, and we returned 10.8 billion to shareholders year-to-date 2017 through dividends and share repurchases which includes a 5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2017 and beyond. Now it'll turn it back to Chuck. Thank you, Frank and Ian. Operator, can we please poll for questions? ... Operator Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star then the number one on your telephone keypads. Your first question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Hi guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Perhaps, first, Ian one for you, if there were to be no tax reform, is your bias at that point to look for an ex-U.S. company or not? And I wanna tie my second question back to the first one as well which is when we get these updates on Evalumab, plus 41BB, and OX40 combinations from your ongoing medley trial, how does that inform whether or not you'll look externally for a large IO acquisition? Thank you so much. Thank you for the questions. On the tax reform issue, if there's no tax reform, we will continue to look at acquisitions based on the value creation for shareholders as we've always done. I don't really wanna speculate on that. On the IO development, obviously the IO is an interesting category, it has a lot of arability right now in the performance of different products. We remain focused on improving our business in IO, and we'll have to wait to see what the readout of those trails as to what it tells and what direction we wanna take. Thanks, Ian. Next question, please. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JP Morgan. Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions here, maybe the first was just elaborating a little bit on IBRANCE trends in the U.S. I think you talked about 50% penetration right now. My question is where do you see penetration peaking over time and what do you think it's gonna take to get that additional penetration in the market? My second question was on repatriation, and tax reform. I think you've talked in the past of about 160 billion of foreign earnings at Pfizer and that repatriation of these earnings still allowed the company to bring back significant future earning to the U.S. at a very low tax rate. To the extent that we get repatriation, should we think of that as just fundamentally altering your approach to either leverage or capital deployment? I guess the other way of looking at it, should we think about a step up in Pfizer's annual capital deployment, if this were to occur, whether that's large deals, small deals, or repo? Or is this just gonna be business as usual as it relates to business installment? Thank you. Albert, you wanna deal with IBRANCE? Yes. Thank you. First of all, let me say that we are very pleased with the results of IBRANCE, we had 59% growth globally versus the same quarter of last year. IBRANCE last year was already a $2 billion product, so this is significant growth. Moving forward, the growth for IBRANCE will come, in the U.S., from expanded usage with already prescribing physicians, but also from expanding the CDK market, as you well alluded. The penetration of CDK right now is 50%, but if you see the new patients, it is 57%, the historical was always 50%. I think the introduction of new CDK competitors in the market, and more importantly, the publication of more data is enhancing the confidence of physicians in the class and will benefit overall the class. I don't see any reason why this will not go very high because it is the standard of care anyway. Thank you. Frank, do you wanna discuss the repatriation alternatives? So, Chris, all the numbers you cited, the 160 billion is a number I've cited previously. Remember, that's accumulated profit and earnings, that's not cash. You basically said that in your question. You really had two questions; one was, does it alter our approach in capital allocation? From my perspective, the answer is, no. Our priorities for capital allocation don't change they are dividends, share buy-backs, investing in the business, and M&A, those will continue to be our capital allocation priorities going forward. Then your second question was, would that alter our approach to business development? My answer is no. From my perspective our approach doesn't change, it's we're agnostic to size, and hopefully, our actions over the past, or in the past have demonstrated that. Our compass on deals has been, is, and will remain shareholder value. Thanks, Frank and Albert. Next question, please, operator. Operator Your next question comes from Andrew Baum, from Citi. Thank you. A couple of questions. Firstly, the on Talazoparib, given the recent Astra deal and we anticipate that heavy investments in the program, can you just outline where you intend to go and how quickly with your DNA damage reparation both therapy selected patient was in combination with events and your quarter portfolio? Second, while I know shareholder value, will guide your direction, should I think Pfizer has no interest in asset swaps with enthusiastic potential buyers to your business such as GSK, and the events of a trade sale most likely use will be cash to fund business values? Albert. Sorry. Mike, would you like to take the Talo question? Yeah. Thank you for your interest in Talazoparib. We regard it as a very potent PARP inhibitor. It's dosed at 1mg. and it has tumor activity that has been very efficacious in pre-clinical models and our clinical studies. We look forward to the near readout of our Phase III and BRCA trial that's Talazoparib versus standard of care in BRCA post-hemostatic breast cancer. We also are looking at Avelumab, plus Talazoparib, plus some tumor indications which may allow us to take benefit of the increased impact of Talazoparib to make tumors immunogenic, which Avelumab will benefit the patient. We are starting those studies, and look forward to expanding them rapidly. We see, also, opportunity with Talazoparib in other combinations such as XTANDI in prostate cancer. Indeed, it's an important growing asset for us. Thank you, Mikael. On the question of the consumer business, we have some time in looking and seeking strategic deals for our consumer business whereby we would have perhaps [inaudible] [00:30:00] involving asset swaps. I think this process we've undertaken, the strategic review, may shake loose more alternatives in that aspect. Regarding the proceeds, it's really premature to speculate given the fact it may not be; we may spin the division as a separate company depending on how we create maximum value. We have to wait to see exactly how we recover the full value of this business. Thanks, Ian and Mikael. Next question, please, operator. Operator Thank you, and we'll go next to Greg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Thanks. Sticking with the theme of big deals. Since you're asked about your willingness and interested in doing big deals so often, I was hoping you would offer your historical view on whether very large deals in the industry and for Pfizer, in particular, have value enhancing? Secondly, John, can you go into some more detail about what's causing the shortages? Is this a systemwide issue, is it tied to FDA issues, or just demand outstripping supply? When do you expect a close-out letter from McPherson? Thanks. Okay, Frank. Retrospective on big deals, please. Yes. I guess the big deal would be Wyeth, in terms of what we've done. I think the retrospective on that is it's been very value enhancing. If you look at our portfolio today, much of it has come from the Wyeth acquisition. When we announced that deal, we announced 4 billion in synergies; we clearly exceeded that. If you look at the value we got for the nutrition business that came from Wyeth if you look at the value, we got in Zoetis much of which came from the Wyeth acquisition. If you look at the consumer business that we currently have. Quite frankly, if you look at the Wyeth business retrospectively significant value creation from that acquisition. I think, in general, I would say, that the big deals prior to that have also been value creation deals. As we've always said we're agnostic to size, we have a core competency in business development and integrating companies, and we'll continue to use that competence. John, you wanna comment on...? Yeah. Thanks for the question, Greg. In the Essential Health Portfolio, as Frank mentioned in his comments, we have been experiencing some supply shortages for some of our products. The shortages are primarily for products from the Legacy Hospira Portfolio, and they're driven by, I guess, a blend of what we term capacity constraints and technical issues. I think as Frank also mentioned, when we acquired Hospira, we originally thought that it would take one to two years to integrate their manufacturing plants and resolve the majority of the supply chain issues that we were aware of. What I would say is we have a robust action plan in place, and we believe that we'll make substantial progress in 2018 toward reducing the sterile injectable shortages. In regard to McPherson, I think all I would say is that we've submitted a corrective and preventative action plan to the FDA, and we've been diligently working to address the items outlined in the warning letter. We provide regular updates to the FDA on the status of that action plan and will continue to do so. Thank you. Next question, please, operator. Operator Your next question comes from David Marris from Wells Fargo. Good morning. On bio-similars in the J&J suit, maybe if you could just address on, how pervasive do you think these types of anti-competitive contracts are? What do you think the timeline on resolution and potential outcomes could be? Do you think this largely explains the major difference in the uptake in Europe and other outside the U.S. markets on bio-similars versus the U.S., or do you think there's another dynamic going on? Thank you. Doug, would you like to answer that? Sure. Taking the last part of the question first, we do think so. We think in, what we're calling, the closed market area we're seeing uptake that we think supports our claim that J&Js anti-competitive practices concerning Remicade have denied U.S. patients and the broader healthcare system the benefits of robust price competition and therapeutic options in the biologics marketplace. Our concern that J&J has threatened to withhold significant rebates to insurers for both current and future patients, and also engaged in, what we think are inappropriate and inaccurate marketing claims. For example, suggesting that patients need to fail first on Remicade before using Inflectra seem to be unique to J&J, but obviously, we believe it's a violation of the Anti-Trust Laws. John, do you wanna add something? Yeah. I would just add, David, as Ian mentioned in his comments, Inflectra is actually performed well in closed-systems in the United States. Those are the systems which prioritize healthcare cost savings over short-term rebating. As of quarter three, we've reached a 54% share in those closed systems. I think, in our perspective is, that the performance in those closed systems demonstrates that where payors, providers, and patients have access to Inflectra, Inflectra can offer significant value. The closed systems, obviously, only represent a relatively small portion of the market around about 5% in total Infliximab volume. As Doug has commented, due to J&Js exclusionary contracting, lower pricing Inflectra has largely not received commercial access, a parity to Remicade and remains disadvantaged. Overall, I think that performance in the closed systems really represent the value that Inflectra can deliver to healthcare providers and to patients. Thanks, John and Doug. Can we move to our question, please? Operator Your next question comes from Jamie Reuben from Goldman Sachs. Thank you. I just have a couple. First for you, Ian. Has Pfizer had discussions with other companies regarding alternative drug distribution models or potential new entrants into the drug distribution business. Obviously, I'm referring to the havoc is wreaked upon that industry because of the threat from Amazon. Just would love your thoughts on that. Just taking a five-year view, do you see new entrants entering the drug distribution industry, PDM, or drug retail pharmacy industry? Just wondering what your thoughts are on that? Then, just if I can move to the essential health business, that business continues to be a real drag on your overall performance, you cited specific reasons this quarter. At the time of the Hospira deal, I think you had projected that business would eventually flatten out because of growth in emerging markets, opportunities from the sterile injectable business, as well as biosimilars. But that doesn't seem to be panning out, is this business salvageable? Can it ever stop declining and then back start growing or is this just an anchor you're gonna have to deal with? Thanks very much. Thank you, Jamie. On the potential changes in distribution, all I would say is that any system of distribution that can cut costs and get a wide availability of products to patients is something that the whole industry would be interested in. Vis a vis, a distribution system going back into PDMS and adjudication, I think that's somewhat more of a difficult strategic proposal as it then enters in the whole issue of the world of insurers and PDMs, and siding on differential access, that's a whole different skill set. Regarding the Essential Health Business, I'll ask John to make his comments on that. Yes. Thanks for your question Jamie. Let me just reiterate what we've said in the past, which is we've always said that in the medium-term, we believe we can return the essential health business to low to mid-single growth. We didn't specifically put a timeline on that, but we framed that as being a three to four-year period. The reason that we believe that it was gonna take time was because of the headwind of L.O.E.s. Frank commented on that during his comments. Whilst for the corporation, the impact is moderating in 2017. We still have some headwinds, predominantly in the essential health business. In quarter three, just to quantify that, the total L.O.E. impact on the business in the quarter was around about $339 million due to just a range of products that have gone off patent or are experiencing generic competition. Pristiq, Lyrica, Relpax, Nitrostat, so on. The thing about those time-line events, however, is that by definition they will moderate. So that basic aspiration to return this business to be low to mid-single digit grower is something that we still retain. Just to break out the performance in the quarter for you Jamie while Pfizer Essential Health declined by 11% if you actually exclude the impact of the infusion systems business divestiture, and the impact of L.O.E.s, the business was actually flat in the quarter. I think while we are still on that path to recovery, I think we remain committed to, and actually very positive by the aspirations return this business to the growth profile that we've outlined in previous quarters. Thanks, John. Next question, please? Operator Your next question comes from Seamus Mendes from Lyric. Thanks for the questions. First question, Ian, and Frank. Can you guys comment on the structure that you think would really optimize the value for the consumer business? You guys have sold businesses in the past, but also, I think the Zoetis split was a great example of success. You've also done some creative combinations. I'm just trying to get a better sense of where you think the most value has really been added for shareholders in the context of those different decision points with Consumer. The second question really is, when we think about the opportunity in the IO space, would you guys please comment on clinical trials that could read out next year that you're most excited to see the results of? Thanks Okay, I'll ask Frank to answer, give you our thoughts on the structure that would most likely optimize value, and then I'll ask Albert to talk about IO studies. Sorry, I'll ask Mikael how the IO studies are reading out. So, Seamus, on structure, let me just start with obviously, we have a baseline view in terms of what we think that consumer business is worth based on. Obviously, our projections on future cash flows discounted back to their present value. In terms of structure, it's really what maximizes value. If you look at what we've done in the past, in terms of some of our larger divestments, we sold the Capsigel business, we sold the nutrition business, and then we split, to your point, the Zoetis business. When we were doing the Zoetis transaction, we were receiving incoming calls, had offers, but quite frankly, but didn't think those offers exceeded the value that we could get from a split. We went ahead, and we proceeded with a split. My short answer is, we will pursue the structure that best maximizes the value to our shareholders. Hopefully, our actions in the past have demonstrated that that's what we've done. Mikael? Thank you for your interest in our IO Portfolio. We actually have, together with our partner Merck AJ, a well-running IO Portfolio. We have 30 studies including nine in new pivotal indications and more than 6,300 patients enrolled. In the near-term readout from now toward '19, we have actually eight pivotal readouts starting quite soon with Gastrique Third Line, followed by, in '18, Lyme Second Line, Ovarian Second Line. As you come toward the end of '18 and into '19, real interesting studies in earlier lines such as kidney cancer, Pumba Bivencio and Leighton, Bivencio and Gastrique first line maintenance, in lung first line, bladder first line, ovarian first, chemo, Meyer, all in '19. In addition to those eight pivotal studies that can be registration enabling for us, we have a number of non-pivotal that can guide us to accelerate the programs. That includes late this year, and early next year IO combos with 41BB, followed by Bivencio with Oxford, which have here to date on Bivencio with Roletany and with also late next year, our triple combo will be part of this. I would also like to say that we have beyond the checkpoint inhibitor, a very interesting vaccine opportunity where we have our prostate vaccines that will be followed by another vaccine going to human studies in the quite near future; that contains multiple vaccine components, plus PD1 lockade, plus CITALOR lockade, really interesting concept. Finally, beyond the IO you probably are aware that we have a very rich and vibrant oncology portfolio where we recently announced in our targeted portfolio positive data for extending Prosper. We have, in preparation for registration, plans around Dacomitinib, Loriatanib. We have soon readout of Telesepariab, and we have positive data on Glestigib which may make us engage in, also, ulcerative study. It's a very rich and quality pipeline where obviously, IO and Bivencios is an important piece. Thank you. Thanks, Mikael. We'll move to our next question, please? Operator Thank you, and we'll go next to Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. First, I just wanted to see if you could get a little more color on the impact of price in the U.S. on the quarter for the Innovative Health business as a whole, or at least some of the key products like IBRANCE, Lyrica, Eliquis, XELJANZ? And then my second question is also touching on Eliquis. Just curious there what your thoughts are? Have you seen positive data from Xarelto from the Compass study? They have some additional data coming from their lifecycle management program over the next few years. Do you see that data, in any way, impacting Eliquis' growth? Just curious, just looking back now, there's a very limited lifecycle management program around Eliquis, and I think it deserves some priding for such a large product? Is there anything that you and Bristol are doing in terms of trying to come up with new indications or somehow extend out that product beyond what it is right now? Thanks so much. Thank you. Frank, impact, price, and then Albert can discuss Eliquis. Globally, all in. Total company price for the quarter was zero. In the U.S. it was +3%, that's for the quarter. If you go to year-to-date, so the nine-months cumulatively, same numbers. All in, enterprisewide, the total company globally, zero. In the U.S. +3%. Thank you. Eliquis, Albert. First of all, let me say that Eliquis had a phenomenal performance again this quarter, 43% professional growth for the quarter. The U.S. significant growth of 39% professional growth. It is the number one drug prescribed by specialists and primary care physicians. To your question on data resemble, based on the direction that I'm going to say we'll see the potential impact of [inaudible] upon Eliquis business will be limited. First of call in the protocol exclusion of net and VAF base. The Rivaroxaban only arm did not meet efficacy imparts. The bleeding rates for both Rivaroxaban in the trial and the different dose on the Rivaroxaban, NBIF post. That being said, I want to emphasize that we cannot make comparisons to other studies, but we feel very confident on the growth projections that we have right now with Eliquis. Thank you. Next question, please, operator? Operator Thank you, and we'll go next to David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Thanks very much. I have two questions, first, could you please update us on the recent IPR developments on your pneumococcal vaccine patents through 2026, and the potential implications for Merck's 15 Valent vaccine or other potential pneumococcal vaccine competitors? And then second, could you just frame for us where IBRANCE X.U.S. rollout stands and whether you ultimately expect X.U.S. IBRANCE sales to eclipse the dollar revenue opportunity in the U.S. Thank you. Doug, please. The IPO in the party review process. Sure. Thanks for the question, David. We were very pleased to see the October 20th denial of Merck's inter parties review filings on two of our U.S. patents covering compositions of pneumococcal vaccines. These patents stand as valid and will not expire until 2026. We believe these patents, and others in our portfolio may present freedom to operate issues for Merck or anybody else trying to develop a pneumococcal vaccine. As Ian mentioned at the outset of the call, we have started Phase II trials for our next generation 20 Valent Pneumococcal Vaccine and have received fast track designation from the FDA. Albert on IBRANCE. Yes, X.U.S. IBRANCE is performing very well, and we are very pleased. Let me focus on Europe right now. It is the best performing area because we also have the upcoming launch of Zapat, but it's not started yet. The early E.U. launch indicators show rapid IBRANCE adoption in the first line. This also strong adoption of IBRANCE in patients who were already treated with [inaudible] therapy. Also, in patients in later lines of therapy. We are having positive discussions with reimbursement bodies right now. Pricing and reimbursement process are ongoing across Europe in accordance with national procedures and timelines. We have already secured investment in several countries. We are in the middle of multiple negotiations, so I wouldn't like to speak more about that. Our international sales were this quarter, $165 million. This is up 30% versus the previous quarter sequential of the second quarter. In Europe, particularly, the growth was even greater, 35% up versus the previous quarter. We see this trend continue as we are launching in other jurisdictions and as we are getting price reimbursement in Europe. As we are going, of course, to places like Japan. Thank you, Albert. Next question, please, operator? Operator Thank you, and we'll go next to Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Thank you. A couple of questions. On the lawsuit with J&J on Inflectra. If you don't win, do you think that would have broad negative ramifications to other future U.S. filed similar launches? And it would foretell a different future uptake profile in the U.S. My guess is that you'll answer that, yes, otherwise you wouldn't be suing unless you're suing for some other reason. The second question is going back to a question I've frequently asked in the past, your commitment to Evalimab, the reason for my question is pretty obvious, in the past, you've said you're committed. Some investors I've talked to claim that over the last couple of months management has said you'd be willing to upgrade your Anti-PD under the right circumstances. I'm wondering if you'd like to either confirm or deny that or maybe at a minimum just add some current color to the question. Under the lawsuit, Tim, I think the lawsuit was taken because we strongly believe that the actions of J&J are not acceptable under the Anti-Trust litigation. More importantly, I think, the solution to this will come from a societal view on that bio-similars are there to provide access to patients once the patent has expired, and that enough is enough. You shouldn't be using contracting mechanisms to extend your exclusivity when society expects to get access to products once the patent is expired. We believe there will be quite rigorous debates within society, within CMS, how does the governmental systems accrue the benefits of biosimilars? So, we see it as both a legal strategy and a strategy of altering the policymakers that Europe is, obviously, benefiting from bio-similars, so why isn't the U.S.? Given that the law was passed to bio-similars readily available. On Evalimab, we remain committed to our programs with our partner. Regarding any rumors you may or may not have heard, I really can't speculate on them. I've actually, I think, addressed a couple of questions from you on calls about our partnership with Merck, and I don't really think it would be helpful to add any more comments. Thanks, Ian. Next question, please? Operator Your next question comes from John Boris from Sun Trust. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on the quarter. The first question for Frank, I know you haven't outlined 2018 guidance, but can you maybe walk us through qualitatively some of the headwinds and tailwinds are that you're expecting for 18 that might impact or shape our models? Second question, on the Established Health Business, on some of the smaller companies we've seen multi-source competition being accelerated by A&DA approvals on injectables. Are you seeing an increased number of ANDAs being approved across injectable and is that having an impact on pricing? The third question on IBRANCE, in Europe, in particular, in markets where you have to negotiate pricing, are you recording any deferred revenues for revenue recognition purposes that might show up in 4Q or 2018? That should do it for the questions. Thanks. Thank you, John, On IBRANCE the answer is no. We continue to sell IBRANCE under our traditional model of selling and booking sales when you make them. On the Essential Business, perhaps John could make some comments? Yeah. So, John, I think the FDA has been very clear about the perspective that they have that they believe that competition is the most important factor in being able to reduce healthcare costs. That's actually a position that Pfizer has long supported, we believe in a competitive marketplace, and we also believe that the availability of timely approval of generic alternatives is as critical to patient access in the long-term sustainability of the healthcare system. We manufacture and commercialize a number of products, and the FDA published an off-patent pharmaceutical product with limited or no competition to date. We do anticipate that certain products on that list that we currently commercialize could face competition from additional manufacturers over the next several years. All that said, we also are currently exploring opportunities to bring to market certain other products on the list, which Pfizer could have the manufacturing capability and capacity to produce reliably. The FDA has been very clear about their perspective in this space; it's a competitive market space and one that we expect to remain so. I would add that the requirements from the FDA and the European Union on manufacturing sterile injectables continue to increase and ensures that any competitor that needs to have robust, good manufacturing practices, which is also positive for patients. Frank on with models. So, John, we'll give detailed guidance for 2018 on our next earnings call as we always do when we close out the fiscal year. We'll close out '17, and then we'll provide guidance on '18. In terms of, you mentioned headwinds and tailwinds, the way I'll do this, I think, is maybe the rhythm of the revenue. We'll have L.O.E.s next year, our current estimate on L.O.E.s is about $2 billion, that'll be a headwind. In terms of tailwinds, we continue to expect new products like IBRANCE, Eliquis, and XELJANZ to perform very nicely. Our recently acquired products like XTANDI and Eucrisa, we expect to perform very nicely in emerging markets. If you look at emerging markets for the quarter up 11%, year-to-date up 9%. We continue to expect those areas of the business to perform well. Bio-similars, this quarter up 67% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Lots of areas where we expect to see continued growth going forward, we'll give details on guidance on the next call. Thank you, Frank. We'll take your next question, please? Operator Thank you, and we'll go next to Richard Perkins from Piper Jaffray. Thanks. I have two quick questions. Firstly, on XELJANZ, how much interest are you getting from rheumatologists and gastroenterologists on the prospects of its approval in psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis? Also, I noticed you JAK I, you presented data in atopic dermatitis, can you just give us some color on how it compares to other JAK inhibitors in that space? Thanks very much. Thank you, Richard. Of course, on XELJANZ, we don't do any remarketing activities on indications that have been approved. But, in discussions with experts who advise us, we think it is a competitive profile in both of those conditions. On the JAK I will ask Mikael to add some commentary. Thank you for your interest in JAK I. We shared data recently at the EADB Conference in Europe. Obviously, there has been another JAK I, that together define the JAK I class performance in atopic dermatitis. On the efficacy side, we shared that it was a very impressive number of patients reached cleared, or almost cleared skin lesions, about 45% in that range. What is very interesting with this class, is that it has a rapid onset of action. Within a few weeks you see improvement, and between week four and six, you have reached a very significant part of the maximal effect. Atopic dermatitis patients suffer, particularly, from pruritis itch. I think this is really unique in the JAK I clause and was evident in our study that already, two days, I repeat two days, of the initiation of therapy you could see itch relief, and then within two weeks, it has reached real impactful effect and plateaued at 64%. Got very substantial itch relief. To the best of my knowledge, there hasn't been any reported drug or recently approved drug that has had such favorable rapid onset which is critical for these patients. Thank you for your interest. Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please? Operator Your next question comes from Steve Scala from COWEN. Thank you. I have a few questions. I think the sale of Pfizer Consumer to J&J a decade ago was viewed as at a great price but in retrospect a strategic mistake for Pfizer. Would you agree with that characterization? And why is it different now? Second, regarding XTANDI in the Prosper trial, the release says Pfizer will discuss the results with health authorities. Given the positive study, what is there to discuss as opposed to just filing outright? Lastly, I appreciate that it is completely in line with background rate, but there are about 40 DVTs, or PEs reported in XELJANZ studies. Has Pfizer looked at whether these patients were also on Celebrex or other COX-II inhibitors? If you have, what did it show? Thank you very much. Steve, thank you. I'm not sure that your general characterization of the J&J deal is accurate, but that's something that's in the past. We make decisions on the future dispositions based on the facts we see today and the opportunities we see today. We believe it is well worth exploring the strategic alternatives for that business. Vis a vis, Prosper..., Yeah, would you please? Steve, I want to be clear, we were delighted with the Prosper because of the Brine Reports but came two years earlier than anticipated. We are looking forward to disclosing detailed results at an upcoming major medical congress. Given the nature of the daypack and the importance of the claim, we have resourced very well the teams preparing the dossier, and we expect to file soon. Concerning XELJANZ, first of all, as you know, it's been performing excellently. It's been prescribed to more than 100,000 patients worldwide, and we had an advisory committee recently for expansion into psoriatic arthritis and got an overwhelmingly positive vote the efficacy and safety profile. Concerning specifically thromboembolic events we have, of course, carefully looked at XELJANZ both in clinical studies comparing XELJANZ to control group, as well as in registers and how it's performed in the market. We do not see any difference between XELJANZ treated, or other treatment of rheumatoid arthritis patients. We are aware that there have been some competitors reports of some of their compounds in this phase, but we do not see any issues with XELJANZ at all in all our different analysis where the clinical registers on the use of the drug in the market. We are very pleased with the profile of XELJANZ as it stands. Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please? Operator Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO. Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking the questions. I have three, if I may. First, following up on XELJANZ X.U.S., could you please comment on how we should think about the uptake there relative to the strong growth that we're seeing in the U.S. Second, on Eucrisa, I think it's fair to say that the launch is slower than expected. Is the outlook for that product still peak sales of 2 billion even with the JAK I's emerging as competition? Third, on Hospira Sterile Injectables, I think Frank you said supply challenges lead to sales being several hundred million lower. If that reflects demand is it fair to say that most of that should come back in 2018 as you addressed those shortages? Thank you. Albert, could you address the XELJANZ X.U.S. and the Eucrisa performance. Let me start X.U.S. with Europe. We are very pleased with the performance in Europe. The XELJANZ can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate, or when treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. So far, we have launched in nine markets, and those include U.K., Netherlands, Sweden, but we do not have pricing negotiations completed with the rest. We think that the uptake in XELJANZ is based on our initial interactions with physicians will be very strong in Europe. Now, let me go back to Eucrisa. First of all, let me start, yes, we think that will be a 2 billion plus product. We are very excited with the progress. In the third-quarter, we almost doubled the number of patients versus the previous quarter, the second-quarter. As Ian said, we have 83,000, and the product has been prescribed by more than 20,000 physicians. The majority of them, 60% of them are repeaters. We have 90% of commercial lives that have removed the NDC block which is very, very good. They're now covering Eucrisa. However, at this moment, only approximately 50% of the commercial lives have unrestricted access or require one electronic stamp, some require more. They're working very hard to revisit those. Also, I need to emphasize that the net sales, they saw significant sampling and couponing which was introduced to launch and drive success. The free-trial voucher has now expired; however, we have a standard co-pay that continues to be supporting patient's affordability. I think the JAK I marketplace is different from the topical Eucrisa marketplace, and they're, appropriately, medically segmented giving opportunities for both products. Very different, and very different profile. With Eucrisa having a benign profile in terms of safety and can be given to kids as young as two-years-old. Thank you. Frank, please. Alex, John mentioned that the Hospira remediation efforts in the Legacy Hospira Manufacturing Facilities are taking a little bit longer to remediate than we thought. However, we believe that the end of 2018 will substantially complete those. As a result, we expect that several hundred million in 2017 to moderate in 2018, which means we'll be lower in 2018 than 2017. Thanks, Frank. Next question, please? Operator Your next question comes from Mark Goodman from UBS. Yes, Mikael, I was hoping you could give us some highlights on some of the key products in the pipeline that have moved into clinical studies, maybe into Phase II and stuff. I saw there was a Nash drug that moved in there. Maybe you can talk about that a little bit and then also provide us an update on Tenusinab, when are we gonna see the first pivotal study? Good questions, Mark. Mikael? Yeah. Thank you. Starting with Tenusinab, we are very excited about that product, and of course, given the national crisis with opiates, it's the really main opportunity for novel pain relief mechanics that have no addictive abuse related profile. You should expect during, somewhere first to second half transition next year that we will start to communicate the studies. Mostly arthritis, followed by chronic lower back pain. It's overall; six Phase III studies in approximately 7,000 patients. A very comprehensive package. We are very optimistic that this could be a very important option for patients going forward. That's why we look forward to seeing the data in the study. In the portfolio that you asked me about, I will just mention that due to recent positive readout of our JAK I atopic dermatitis that I earlier commented on, is a really intriguing example of how this next generation JAK can contribute very meaningful, clinical efficacy. Within that JAK portfolio, we have a lot of momentum, and we expect next year to read out of two different JAKs on alopecia. I remain encouraged that these two novel JAKs would represent new treatment options for a patient group in alopecia that haven't really had any new treatment in decades. We also have a readout for our JAK I in psoriasis Phase II, and you may remember from an earlier small trial readout, that that drug performed in a very impressive, excellent manner. These are examples in the JAK Portfolio. We recently also shared a positive update from our in-therapy effect to nine studies, and we are now advancing that together with Spark Therapeutics to planning for pivotal studies where dates ongoing with [inaudible] on our Factor 18 Therapy. Finally, on the ACC Nash study, we are very encouraged about the ACC drug that we have. We think there is opportunity due to its liver selective profile to give it that really optimal level to get a very meaningful lowering of lipids in the liver. We are just, right now, on the cusp of starting those studies, and hope to have readout late next year or early the following. Stay close to us. Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please? Operator Thank you, and we'll go next to Tony Butler from Guggenheim Parkers. Hi. Good morning. This is Olivia Brayer on for Tony. I have a two-part question regarding the [inaudible] 100 Study for Prevencia. What was the reasoning behind the dosing amendment to the trial? And can you provide some sort of color on how you were thinking about those amendments and PDL cutoffs that you are using? Then my follow-up question is, do you see crossover as a potential problem for your overall survival data? For which hazard ratios did you power the study? Thank you. Mikael? Yeah. I will only comment since this was a while ago that we introduced a hierarchy of PD L I cutoffs that were basically aligned with what other current studies are using that allow us to study high, medium, or low. We have sized the study appropriately. Of course, there is always, in the first line studies an issue that patients may cross over, but the unique characteristics of IO will allow you to really look at the benefit given that you have this tail of patients that will stay responders if you've got a good mix of patient selection, and study planning. We remain optimistic about this study. I should say, that we also have included a high dose, Bivencia that could offer a unique differentiation versus other PD I, or PDL I, lung cancer studies. Thank you, for the background Mikael. Next question, please? Operator Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jeffries. Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. First, you're one of the most shareholder-friendly, and proactive CEOs across the whole industry. In light of some of the frustrations you've had around M&A, Inversion Splits, etc., I'm wondering if you can discuss a little bit the succession plan for the CEO and the potential timing of that? What, if any, structural changes you would still like to look at implementing at Pfizer during your tenure? Then second, sorry to go back to the J&J litigation again, but maybe you can help me a bit on this, maybe for Doug, is it not fairly standard for companies to remove or adjust rebates on the loss of formulary positioning? For example, is Pfizer not engaged in that practice in the past? Or is Leo Pertencie suggesting that there should be some kind of double standard too with respect to that, just because they don't have an equivalent to an AB rating just as yet? Thank you. While Doug is thinking about that question. Succession, Pfizer, like all major companies, the board has responsibly owned succession planning. We have a robust succession process within Pfizer and dew points, that succession plan will become active. My focus in Pfizer has always been a focus on creating shareholder value. For all the moves we make, and all of the actions we take, of course, I'm extremely pleased with the maturing and the maturing nature of our pipeline and the very promising that I see sitting in that pipeline which will come to market '19 through '25, or more. Thank you for the question. Doug? Thanks, Geoff. Rebate programs in and of themselves are accepted industry practice so long as they are legally structured. We think J&Js practices and the character of the biologics marketplace in particular. Where among other things there's no mandatory substitution at the pharmacy unless originator firms have substantial leverage over existing patients make this a violation of the Federal Anti-Trust laws. Thank you, Doug. Can we take our last question, please, operator? Operator Your final question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I just have a couple. Albert, on XTANDI, do you feel like commercial trends in prostate have stabilized in the U.S., or is there a risk that co-pay and reimbursement, etc. could be a headwind looking to next year? Then, as you move upstream in the paradigm, what's been the progress with new urologists as first-time prescribers? And then Ian, real quick on the deal front? Where does geography fall on the priority list? I know previously it was more of a lever for inversion, but I wasn't sure if there was an objective, for example, to grow specifically outside the U.S. Thank you. On the geography, once again, it comes back to value for shareholders and opportunity. A dollar made in China is worth the same as a dollar made in Europe. We're more focused on what does it do to our strategy, how does it strengthen the enterprises we're in? We've already got a very big international footprint. How do we leverage that footprint? All those things come into consideration of how we produce value. Albert? One second. Let me take the opportunity to speak about the investment thesis of motivation. And I will answer all your questions for XTANDI as I do. When we bought acquisition, when we bought motivation we said that the value drivers are one, continue growth in the metastatic setting primarily by growing prescriptions from urologists, as you said. The second was to obtain a product indication in a static in prostate cancer. The third was to develop and commercialize [inaudible]. In the metastatic prostate cancer, XTANDI total demand continues to demonstrate strong growth. This quarter 50% growth compared to the same quarter previous year. Urologists were growing 37% as we had predicted but we would be able to grow. The best EM set reached an all-time high with approximately 1.700 urologists prescribing the product. This compared to Zytiga prescribed almost 407, so a very big difference. In the non-metastatic prostate cancer, we were delighted with the positive results of Prosper two years earlier than expected. As I said before, we are working very hard to file. And for [inaudible] we had extensive discussions before, and Mikael alluded to the very robust development program. The fundamentals of this acquisition are very, very healthy. We know that the next sales are lacking behind because of the patient assistance program. Let me tell you where we stand with that. The program as a proportion of total demand was generally stable compared to the previous one, as Ian said. As we stated previously, any change this year will be very gradual. The reason is because all patients already enrolled in the program, remain in this program for the entire calendar year. There is not a possibility that we could drive that same, but we believe as we move to the next calendar year, that the patient assistance as a percentage of total demand will start normalizing. Thank you. Thanks, Albert. Thanks, for everyone on the call for your attention this morning. ... Operator Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude Pfizer's Third-Quarter, 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.

     Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call Transcript -- The Motley Fool

  "
Daisy Maxey,11022017,MarketWatch,10262017,"Published: Oct 30, 2017 10:48 a.m. ET Despite the temptation, the market and regulatory risks are too great By Is now the time for individual investors to put some money in bitcoin? It’s a question that financial advisers increasingly hear these days. With bitcoin up more than fourfold this year and a series of high-profile “initial coin offerings” raising more than $2 billion in total, according to CoinDesk’s ICO Tracker, the number of investors interested in digital currencies has been picking up, wealth-management professionals say. Earlier this week, bitcoin was trading at more than $4,880.40 after ending 2016 at around $968, according to CoinDesk. Yet advisers for the most part don’t recommend investing in digital currency or in the few investments vehicles that have cropped up. There are a number of market and regulatory risks inherent in trading cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and similar digital currencies may offer investment opportunity in the future, advisers say, but for now they remain speculative bets that investors should be wary of or avoid altogether. “While the potential upside is alluring, the significant risk of loss is incompatible with prudent investing for long-term goals like college savings, buying a home or retirement,” says Julie Ford, founder of Ford Financial Solutions in New York. Ford says she had a 45-year-old client recently come to her with a plan to liquidate a majority of her retirement savings and invest the proceeds, after taxes and penalties, in bitcoin. Risking anything above a trivial amount in cryptocurrencies isn’t advisable, she says. Anyone contemplating such a move should be debt-free; have an appropriate amount of emergency savings; be on track with financial goals such as retirement or college savings; and have a healthy cash flow. Bitcoin, which goes back to a 2008 blueprint, has a history of price swings related to security breaches, hacking and regulatory scrutiny and action. Trading for about $13.50 at the beginning of 2013, it soared to more than $1,200 before falling about 50% that December after China’s central bank barred financial institutions and payment companies from handling bitcoin transactions. In early 2014, it plunged again when Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, one of the biggest bitcoin-trading platforms at that time, filed for bankruptcy protection after being beset by security breaches, theft and shutdowns. Bitcoin declined nearly 40% from Feb. 1 through the end of March 2014. “It’s very difficult to use something as a currency when its value is fluctuating as much as bitcoin is,” says Tracie McMillion, head of global asset allocation at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, a registered investment adviser subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Co.

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                            
                                    WFC, +0.74% Advisers point to regulatory uncertainty as another risk factor. Government authorities could restrict or control the use and sale of bitcoin or other digital currencies. No U.S. mutual funds or exchange-traded funds currently track bitcoin, but several firms are trying to bring such investments to market. Regulatory approval of cryptocurrency investment funds could bring legitimacy to the asset, or rejections could shake investor confidence. When an application to bring a bitcoin ETF to market from venture capitalists Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss was initially denied by the Securities and Exchange Commission, bitcoin, which at that time had been trading as high as $1,326 in anticipation of an approval, fell to as low as $1,022. The SEC decision on that ETF is under review. Similarly, the price of bitcoin and another popular cryptocurrency, ether, tumbled in late July after the SEC indicated in a report on a specific coin offering, called DAO, that U.S. federal securities law may apply to some cryptocurrency activities, which could bring heightened scrutiny. In September, bitcoin’s price plummeted for days after China said it would shut down the country’s bitcoin exchanges. The virtual currency recovered, then faltered again when South Korea said it would ban raising money through all forms of virtual currencies. But some regulators appear to be embracing cryptocurrencies. Japan’s Financial Services Agency in late September officially recognized some companies as registered cryptocurrency-exchange operators. As for the few investments that attempt to track the price of cryptocurrencies, they carry two risks: failure to track the currency closely, and illiquidity, says McMillion. The Bitcoin Investment Trust from Grayscale Investments, for example, trades at a substantial premium to the price of its bitcoin investments. Advisers say darker threats lurk as well. Among bitcoin’s benefits are its low-cost, anonymous payments, which are conducted via a peer-to-peer structure with no intermediary, says McMillion. Those characteristics make the currency efficient and transferable, she says, but they also mean it could be used on the black market or for money laundering and other illegal activities, which could expose investors to losses. There’s also the threat of hackers engineering a theft, operational glitches and stolen security keys, she says. There have already been several costly thefts of the currency. “It’s almost like cash, and if you lose your cash, you can’t really trace it,” she says.

                                   rose nearly 8% in premarket trading, after the e-commerce retailer’s revenue hit a record, with sales of $43.7 billion that topped last year’s holiday quarter by roughly $3 million. Read: Amazon revenue hits a record and calms investors’ fears Of the analysts reacting to Amazon results thus far, Shyam Patil at SIG Susquehanna appeared the most excited, lifting his price target to $1,300 a share from $1,250. That rating is not the highest on Wall Street, with Wells Fargo Research holding that honor with a target of $1,430 a share (as of Oct. 27), according to FactSet. Read: How high can Amazon go? Legendary trader sees 10% pop on top of today’s surge “We continue to remain positive on Amazon as we see the company as a long-term secular grower with leadership positions in two large growth markets — e-commerce and cloud (with a third — advertising — ramping quickly) … and expect numbers to move higher over time,” said Patil and the team, in a note to clients. The analyst said catalysts to that upward momentum is intra-quarter e-commerce data, company-specific events, such as Amazon Web Services summits and product announcements, pricing decisions, and of course, quarterly results. SIG Susquehanna has a positive rating on Amazon. dward Yruma and the team at KeyBanc Capital Markets noted “impressive sequential sales growth acceleration” for Amazon in the third quarter period. “For AWS, the stabilization in growth at +42% y/y after eight prior consecutive quarters of declines, as well as AWS operating profits exceeding $1 billion for the first time, were notable surprises this quarter,” said the team. Read also: How Google generated a few extra billion dollars However, for KeyBanc analysts, that’s largely already reflected in share prices, which closed at $972 on Thursday. “Amazon’s revenue growth opportunities continues to grow; near term this feels appropriately reflected in the stock,” said the team led by Yruma, which rates Amazon sector weight. Something also niggled at the analysts, that is disproportionate growth in e-commerce sales, with North American retail earnings before interest and taxes fell despite the inclusion of Whole Foods. ”This now marks the third consecutive quarter of y/y declines in North American retail EBIT,” said the analysts. Keeping their Amazon price target at $1,200 per share, Piper Jaffray analysts highlighted several positives from the quarter, such as revenue that showed a shift toward first-party sales, and a lack of any year-over-year deceleration for AWS. Mark May and Caleb Siegel and Citi kept their overweight rating on Amazon post-earnings, but lifted their price target to $1,250 per share from $1,200, saying third-quarter results were “supportive of our bullish long-term thesis for Amazon. Whole Foods, for one, got them excited, as they said that acquisition will “drive a new wave of innovation as it becomes more integrated with Prime.” Amazon shares have gained about 30% in 2017, while the S&P 500

Ann Skeet,11022017,MarketWatch,10262017,"Published: Oct 29, 2017 8:41 a.m. ET Corporate leaders must provide incentives and model ethical behavior By Why don’t people always do the right thing? Behavioral ethics has been making inroads into this question. A favorite recent entry to this discussion is from the well-regarded ethicist Linda Trevino of Penn State University, whose research was recapped in a Penn State News article headlined, ""Middle managers may turn to unethical behavior to face unrealistic expectations.” Trevino acknowledges that as a researcher, the middle management role is one that “you just don’t get to very often.” But anyone who has done their time in the ranks of corporate America’s middle management has seen regular examples confirming the study’s finding that managers use tactics to fudge results and pressure subordinates to go along. ""It became clear to middle managers that there was no way their people could meet these goals,"" Trevino said. ""They got really creative because their bonuses are tied to what their people do, or because they didn't want to lose their jobs. Middle managers exploited vulnerabilities they identified in the organization to come up with ways to make it look like their workers were achieving goals when they weren't."" Such research dovetails with scholarly work examining investor behavior and ethics. University of Chicago professor Richard Thaler won this year’s Nobel Prize for Economics, largely for creating the field of behavioral economics, where psychology and economics meet. He debunked the notion that people behave rationally, as economists have contended, when it comes to personal financial decisions. His work is widely seen as akin to telling the emperor he has no clothes. Similarly, Trevino’s study confirms that people follow perverse incentives — motivations to behave badly. The driver for these flawed incentives is management expectations. In essence, senior management has no clothes. Now that we have some research from Trevino and others to confirm what many practitioners have long known, what can be done about it? It seems elementary to tell senior executives that the people working for them are, well, people. Or that rewards are powerful, systemic motivators for employees. Or that people with little to gain from long-term loyal, responsible behavior will behave in such ways. Both corporate boards and financial markets have responded negatively to the mismanagement that has plagued Wells Fargo & Co., Volkswagen, Uber, and the Weinstein Company. How did senior management at these companies allow perverse incentives to thrive? Like the first step in a recovery program, the perverse incentives must be acknowledged. What managers must do first is admit they need help identifying such incentives. Here are three all-too-familiar contributors to poor performance management that contribute to bad outcomes: 1. Senior managers who have never worked in middle management It seems obvious: people who come up through the ranks learn something along the way and the most effective ones use that knowledge when they land in the C-suite. At the first company I worked at, before I was permitted to supervise a team of people I followed the entire lifecycle of one customer order and observed all the people involved and all the end-runs that were done around internal systems in the name of customer service.  I was fresh out of college with no line experience. It may not have been a perfect solution to counter my inexperience, but it was effective indoctrination to the systemic problems that perverse incentives cause. Later, I was hired following business school into more senior, though still squarely middle-management, positions, and the company I worked for took a similar rotational approach to my work assignments during the first few years.  Both companies stand out in my professional experience for fostering ethical cultures and creating useful, rather than perverse, incentives. 2. Over-reliance on people who are not employees in the value-creation chain The New York Times ran a great story recently on the lives of two janitors — one who started as an employee of a company and another who worked for a company contracted to clean businesses. The first made it to the C-suite. The other is still a janitor. As corporate leaders work to resist the rise of activist shareholders and short-term thinking, they should look close to home for solutions.  The use of contract employment as a cost containment has risen, yet is a short-term solution itself. Hidden costs of contracting are easily identified by anyone who has managed contractors — high turnover; low loyalty; shaky intellectual property protection. Does lack of a career path and healthy incentives make up for reduced overtime and health-care costs? Doubtful. Moreover, ethics and compliance officers know that contractors contribute to a disproportionate amount of fraud. New systems to support members of the “gig economy”, should be pursued to balance these effects. Pay that moves with the cost of living, portable benefits, including healthcare and retirement savings, opportunities for vacation and renewal, and some means of having a voice about work are suggestions made to support a 21st Century social contract with workers, according to Libby Reder, a fellow at the Aspen Institute’s Future of Work Initiative. 3. Fraud that isn’t seen as fraud As Trevino’s study demonstrates, many middle-managers participate in deception to secure unfair (and often unlawful gain).  I suspect few of them see this as engaging in fraud, but rather view it as just the way business is done. Framing decisions as business decisions, in terms of dollars, instead of moral principles of right and wrong, is known as “ethical fading.”  This is what has happened to ethics in business. We do now have ethics and compliance officers and an entire industry of conferences and consultants that support them, but as the profession has grown, ethics have shrunk. The work in many such departments is largely compliance-related. People who strive to be ethical corporate leaders must emphasize ethics regularly in their work and corporate culture. That helps people faced with motivations to behave badly for personal gain or job security make ethical decisions. Leaders also must recognize that changing employees’ motivation is their responsibility. More people working in companies are middle managers than C-suite executives. To secure long-term value creation that markets will reward, middle managers need to be treated as valuable, long-term assets themselves.

Ryan Vlastelica,11022017,MarketWatch,10262017,"Published: Oct 26, 2017 2:39 p.m. ET ‘Let’s take the foot off the accelerator and ease it gently over to the brake,’ Bogle says By Has Vanguard, the asset-managing giant that has dominated its competition as investors trend toward the kind of low-fee and passive products it specializes in, become too big for its own good? A perhaps-unexpected expert says it is nearing that point: Jack Bogle, Vanguard’s founder, who is often considered the father of passive investing. “The economies of scale just can’t keep going on much longer,” Bogle said during an interview with Christine Benz, Morningstar’s director of personal finance. Bogle suggested that if Vanguard hit $4.7 trillion in assets, that might be too large. It currently manages $4.08 trillion. Bogle retired as Vanguard’s chief executive officer, and he noted he doesn’t advise the firm’s management team. “I don’t decide anything, I don’t have to take the consequences—but I do think that when you get down to these kinds of issues, one of the things I would say was, let’s take the foot off the accelerator and ease it gently over to the brake,” said the 88-year-old investment luminary, in the interview that was published last week. Bogle said any scaling back of the investment behemoth, if it were to even happen, wouldn’t happen soon and would be fraught with challenges. “That’s a hard thing to do. We all know it’s going to have to be done sometime. I mean, maybe 25 years from now,” he said (Check out the full interview below). Vanguard has been massively successful, with the assets it manages ballooning in recent years, as investors increasingly move into both passive funds and low-cost funds. Passive funds track the performance of an underlying index like the S&P 500

Dimensional Fund Advisors, the firm with the third-highest flows, had a comparably paltry $24.3 billion flow into its funds in 2017, or nearly 9% of Vanguard’s haul. Over the past month, nearly $28.1 billion have gone into Vanguard’s passive funds; only $2.8 billion have flowed into its passive offerings. Even that demonstrates Vanguard’s dominance, however, as actively managed funds as a category saw broad net outflows over the month. Only Pimco, which focuses on fixed income, an asset class where active management is seen as delivering more value than stocks, had higher active inflows, at $3.2 billion. Read more: Investors flock to Vanguard funds, dump Goldman, Wells Fargo, and others Data have repeatedly shown that passive funds outperform a vast majority of actively managed products over times. This is a cornerstone belief of Vanguard’s business model, which emphasizes passive investments. Another one has been rock-bottom fees. The average expense ratio, a measure of how much the fund charges customers to cover operating costs, for a Vanguard fund was 0.12% in 2016, according to the company’s own data, compared with an industry average of 0.62%. Opinion: Jack Bogle is right: Don’t be a passive investor, be a frugal investor Don’t miss: The reason Jack Bogle doesn’t fly first class says everything about his investing legacy However, Bogle suggested there wasn’t much room for fees to go any lower. “We’ve only got 12 basis points to go, and let me say it: There’s an irreducible minimum, no matter how big you are.” He said it costs “a lot of money to run this business,” and said that if the average fee was eight basis points (or 0.08%, amounting to $8 for every $10,000 invested), that might not be tenable. “I just don’t think it’s worthwhile, hyping and trying to bring in more and more money,” he said. Another factor Bogle said could be on the horizon, as pertaining to Vanguard’s size and popularity, involved the regulatory environment. He noted that the Investment Company Act of 1940 essentially prohibits a mutual fund from owning more than 10% of the voting shares of any security. “If you had an index fund that owned 10% of the company, they’d have to stop buying it,” he said. “They couldn’t own any more.” He suggested that if such a case were to occur now, the manager could simply create another index fund to bypass this issue. Such a workaround is “totally legal right now,” he said, though this could be changed, speculating that the limit could be raised above 10%, or that it could even apply to “all the holdings of a given management company or fund sponsor,” which he said would be “a limiting factor.” According to data from ETFGI, a research firm, Vanguard holds 18.7% of the ETF industry’s market share, with some $835.8 billion in ETF assets. That puts it behind iShares, which has $1.66 trillion in ETF assets, and 37.2% of the market share, but above State Street, which sponsors the SPDR suite of ETFs. SPDR funds have 13.6% of the market, and $607.7 billion in assets, nearly half of which are in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust

The popularity of both ETFs and passive instruments—each of the “big three” ETF providers focuses on index funds—has created a three-firm oligopoly, Bogle said. “Oligopolies are not attractive to U.S. governments or world governments,” he said, adding that “this phenomenon for exchange-traded funds, and index funds generally, is all over the world.” It is at its strongest in the U.S., “but it exists almost everywhere, and I don’t see how it’s going to back down.” ",Vanguard’s Bogle says asset-management giant he founded 42 years ago is almost too big and successful - MarketWatch
,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co is facing litigation over previously disclosed sales problems related to its auto lending and mortgage businesses, the bank disclosed in a regulatory filing on Friday. The lawsuits include two class action cases alleging violations of federal and state consumer fraud laws, as well as claims brought by former employees who said they were fired for raising concerns over problematic sales practices. Wells Fargo disclosed the litigation in its third-quarter financial filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “The disclosures included in our filing today reflect the company’s continued commitment to transparency. Our top priority is to rebuild trust, and we remain focused on making things right for our customers, team members, community partners and shareholders,” a company spokesman wrote via email. The third-largest U.S. lender has spent more than a year trying to rebuild its reputation following a sales scandal that led to the departure of its CEO and a companywide overhaul of its business practices. The company says it is continuing to review all its businesses to root out bad practices. Wells Fargo’s problems came to light several years ago, but did not receive widespread attention until Sept. 9, 2016, when it reached a settlement with three regulators over creating as many as 2.1 million fake accounts as branch employees scrambled to hit sales goals. The bank later said that number could be as high as 3.5 million, and it has also been turning up other problems, including selling unneeded auto insurance to customers and concerns over fees it charged mortgage customers for locking in interest rates. One lawsuit filed in August over the interest rate lock issue said Wells Fargo managers pressured employees to blame homeowners for delays that resulted in improper charges, sometimes by falsely stating that paperwork was missing. Wells Fargo shares were down 0.3 percent at $56.29 on Friday afternoon. Its shares are up just over 2 percent year to date, compared with a rise of more than 25 percent for Bank of America Corp shares and a gain of more than 17 percent for JPMorgan Chase & Co. ","

 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"DUBAI, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Kuwait’s Burgan Bank, the country’s third largest lender by assets, is in early discussions with banks for the refinancing of a $350 million loan due in December, sources familiar with the matter said on Sunday. The bank raised the original debt facility in 2015 with a group of seven banks, including regional and international lenders. The new loan would refinance the amount raised at that time, but the bank is considering extending the maturity of the facility by one year, meaning the new transaction could have a three-year tenor. A spokesman for Burgan Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The banks that participated in the 2015 loan were Commerzbank, Emirates NBD, HSBC, National Bank of Abu Dhabi, Societe Generale, Standard Chartered and Wells Fargo. The new loan will “most likely” be provided by the same group of banks, but no decision has been taken yet as the discussions are at an early stage, said one of the sources. Established in 1977, Burgan Bank is rated ‘A+’ with a stable outlook by Fitch. In a statement last month, the agency cited “an extremely high probability of support from the Kuwaiti authorities to all domestic banks if needed” as one of the reasons for its rating decision. The Kuwaiti lender said last month its nine-month profit attributable to shareholders amounted to 53.9 million dinars ($178 million), against 48.6 million dinars one year earlier.

 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"LONDON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Office supply retailer Office Depot Inc has been forced to sweeten terms on a US$750m term loan B as low US secondary loan prices continue to reflect the threat that the troubled sector is facing from online retail giants such as Amazon. The leads had to make a raft of changes including hiking pricing, shortening the tenor and securing the deal on Office Depot’s headquarters, to help the loan to clear the market after investors cited concerns over slumping sales. The loan backs Office Depot’s US$1bn acquisition of US IT services company CompuCom. Lead banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo increased Office Depot’s pricing to 700bp over Libor from 500bp-525bp, widened the original issue discount to 97 from 98.5 and shortened the tenor to five years from six years previously. The pricing changes reflect US retailers’ persistently low secondary loan prices, some of which fell further after J.C. Penney’s profit warning on October 27 sent its shares to an all-time low and pushed its secondary loan price lower. J.C. Penney’s term loan fell around four points on October 27 to 91.5-92.5% of face value from 95.5-96.5 after it cut its forecast. Neiman Marcus’ term loan was around 80 in October and was quoted lower at 78 on November 1. Retail companies have made up the bulk of defaults this year and Toys ‘R’ Us’ bankruptcy filing in September pushed the sector default rate to 7.3%, which could rise to 10% in 2018, according to Fitch Ratings. Teen retailer Styles For Less said last Wednesday that it is preparing to file for bankruptcy. The sector’s troubles, paired with online giants such as Amazon taking a bigger market share, means that investors need to be convinced that a retail credit is specialised enough to be able to compete with Amazon, a senior banker said. “If there’s a sector that ever needed a story told [in order to sell a credit], it’s retail,” the senior banker said. Low secondary prices could affect retailers’ ability to access the primary market going forward through the New Year, a banker said. Nordstrom had trouble securing financing to back a potential buyout, dropping its sale efforts, Reuters reported last month. “If you’re an underwriter and you’ve had a record year why would you take the chance on the sector? What are you trying to prove?” the senior banker said. “We wouldn’t touch the sector right now.” Investors may be prepared to make some distinctions as they cautiously distinguish between retailers. Off-price retailer Burlington held a lender call on October 30 for a term loan refinancing, which is expected to face fewer issues as discount retailers are considered stronger credits. Burlington’s strong financial track record is reflected in its low proposed pricing. The US$1.117bn seven-year loan is being guided in the 225bp-250bp range. Strong leadership at the company and its merchant background has inspired confidence among lenders and the company has a loyal fan base, a credit investor said. “Burlington is one of the few bright spots in retail that has differentiated itself,” the investor said. Office Depot’s loan saw several other changes. Amortisation has been increased to 10% annually, from 5% and the loan will have a 102/101 hard call schedule, compared to six months of soft call protection at 101 initially. The incremental starter basket, all grower baskets and the Most Favoured Nation sunset provision have been removed. More cashflow has been earmarked to repay debt and the company has less discretion over payments. The general restricted payments basket has been significantly reduced to US$10m from US$150m and the general investment basket has been reduced to US$50m from US$150m previously. The loan will also now be secured on Office Depot’s headquarters, which will be used as collateral. The CompuCom acquisition is expected to close by the end of 2017, pending regulatory approval. It will help position the company as a provider of broader business services and technology products. Office Depot is rated B1/B. The loan is rated B1/B+.

 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - New York state’s banking regulator will be interviewing senior Barclays executives from New York and London over a whistleblowing scandal in the coming weeks, a source familiar with the situation said. The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has been investigating Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley and the bank for months over his attempt to identify an anonymous whistleblower last year, said the source, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the inquiry. It was unclear which senior executives would be interviewed. Barclays said in April that regulators on both sides of the Atlantic were investigating Staley and the bank for alleged breaches of strict whistleblowing rules. He has already been questioned by British regulators. A spokeswoman for the NYDFS, which oversees certain foreign banks that operate in the state, and a spokesman for Barclays declined to comment. Barclays has said Staley asked the bank’s internal security team to contact U.S. enforcement officers to help identify the author of an anonymous letter that made allegations about a senior banker. The identity of the person was not discovered by the regulators, according to a legal investigation commissioned by the bank. Staley, a career investment banker who spent 34 years at JPMorgan, has apologized for his actions, telling Barclays staff in a memo this year that he had been attempting to protect a colleague from an unfair personal attack but became too “personally involved”. Barclays has reprimanded him but said he “honestly but mistakenly” believed it was permissible to identify the author of the letter. It said it would cut his bonus and also look into the position of other employees involved in the incident. The whistleblowing scandal at a bank that has promised to reform after a legacy of financial crisis-era misconduct could result in Barclays facing another fine and regulators could force Staley out, if he is deemed unfit by regulators. It is a test case for Britain’s fledgling Senior Managers Regime, introduced by the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority in March 2016 in part to protect those who risk their jobs bringing wrongdoing to light. The regime makes managers personally accountable for their actions to set what regulators have described as the right “tone at the top”. Among other things, bosses are required to respect rules to protect whistleblowing. The penalty can be a ban from the industry or a fine. Since the scandal erupted, Barclays’ global head of whistleblowing Jonathan Cox has departed, chief compliance officer Michael Roemer left to join rival Wells Fargo and Troels Oerting, the head of cyber and information security, has taken a leave of absence.      Oerting’s absence was not related to the whistleblowing investigation, a separate source has said. Oerting did not respond to requests for comment on LinkedIn, Cox has declined to comment and Roemer said last month his time at Barclays had been rewarding. ","

 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"(Reuters) - Bad weather hurt Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc in the third quarter, as insurance losses tied to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and an earthquake in Mexico contributed to a 43 percent drop in profit. Berkshire on Friday said it lost $3 billion before taxes, or $1.95 billion after-tax, from the disasters, leaving its Geico auto insurance, General Re reinsurance and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance units with underwriting losses for the year. Insurance typically accounts for about one-fourth of Berkshire’s overall profit. Berkshire has roughly 90 businesses in such sectors as chemicals, energy, food and retail and industrial products. It also owns the BNSF railroad. Jim Shanahan, a senior analyst at Edward Jones & Co, said the disaster losses were higher than he had expected, given how pricing pressures had caused Berkshire to retrench from some business, but said shareholders should remain comfortable with the company over the long term. Operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses and which Buffett says better reflects company performance, fell 29 percent to $3.44 billion, or $2,094 per Class A share, from $4.85 billion, or $2,951 per share a year earlier. That missed analysts’ average operating profit forecast of $2,402.47 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s diversification helped cushion the earnings decline, as profit rose at the Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, while “improving economic conditions” helped boost shipping and profit at BNSF. A better economy may also have persuaded more people to buy cars and trucks, as higher financing activity at the Berkshire Hathaway Automotive car dealership unit helped boost pre-tax retail profit by 22 percent. Book value per Class A share, measuring assets minus liabilities, rose 2.5 percent in the quarter to $187,435, and was up 8.9 percent from January to September. Berkshire also ended September with $109.3 billion of cash and equivalents, more than five times the $20 billion minimum Buffett has said he prefers, and investors are waiting to see what he does with it. Buffett, 87, has run Berkshire since 1965, and investors have remained confident in his leadership, as the company’s share price has risen 15 percent this year. FULL-YEAR UNDERWRITING LOSS LIKELY Berkshire lost $1.44 billion from insurance underwriting in the quarter and $1.73 billion from January to September, putting it on pace for its first full-year underwriting loss since 2002. It had even eked out a small underwriting profit in 2005, the year of Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Rita and Dennis. But investment income from insurance operations cushioned the blow, rising 23 percent in the quarter to $1.04 billion. Berkshire’s results also reflected an accounting charge tied to its January agreement to assume many of AIG’s policies in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront. But that and other premiums that Berkshire receives before paying claims have helped boost its insurance “float” to $113 billion, giving Buffett more money to invest. Shanahan, who rates Berkshire a “buy,” said he was encouraged at how Geico is adding market share, reflected in a 16.5 percent jump in premiums and 9.9 percent year-over-year growth in policies. Some of Berkshire’s cash hoard will eventually be used to buy 80 percent of Pilot Flying J, the largest U.S. truck stop operator. Buffett announced that investment on Oct. 3. ","

 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"By David Randall and Noel Randewich NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. Republican tax bill unveiled on Thursday offers big multinational companies more benefits than minuses, and could free up extra cash for investments, dividends or improving balance sheets. The measure, which faces a long road ahead with final approval by Congress uncertain, would slash the corporate tax rate, a change U.S. companies have been seeking for years. But it might hamper some highly leveraged companies’ ability to deduct debt interest. It could also strip some tax breaks from sectors such as energy and pharmaceuticals. The 429-page tax bill would be the largest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the 1980s. It would cut the corporate  rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, reduce tax rates on individuals and end certain popular tax breaks, including deductions for state and local taxes and half the interest deduction on new mortgages. It would also create a new 10 percent tax on U.S. companies’ foreign subsidiaries and impose a 20 percent tax on payments that foreign businesses operating in the United States make from their American operations. President Donald Trump told House Republicans he hoped to sign the bill into law by Nov. 23. Such a move would stand as the Trump administration’s first major legislative victory. The overall market reaction to the bill was mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.3 percent while the broader S&P 500 index was flat. Shares of General Electric fell nearly 1 percent on Thursday, continuing a nearly 20 percent decline over the last month spurred by analyst downgrades and fears that the company may cut its dividend. GE did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Renewable energy companies and pharmaceutical companies that receive tax credits for clinical testing expenses for certain drugs would also face increased costs if the Republican bill passes, said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. Yet the removal of those tax breaks makes it less likely the bill will pass, he added. “What makes this tax reform rather than just tax cuts is that they’re taking on a lot of provisions that target specific industries. That’s why, while taxes are hard, tax reform is harder,” he said. A 12 percent tax bill - versus 35 percent now - on repatriated profits is “higher than some companies hoped for but low enough that I think they’ll be happy,” he said. Investors expect the specifics of the bill to change as corporations lobby to keep or insert favorable tax breaks. ","

The Baltimore-based athletic apparel and footwear maker has seen its shares tank by 58.8% this year, compared to the S&P 500’s 15.9% rally over the same period, as it struggles to boost sales and revive its brand identity. (See also: Under Armour's Decline Is Warranted: Wells Fargo.) Analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group lowered their 12-month price target on UAA this week to $11 from $15, yet upgraded the stock to neutral. While a rebrand aimed at transforming Under Armour into more of an fashionable luxury sports apparel company could turn things around significantly, analysts Sam Poser, Renato Basanta and Will Gaertner expect weakness in North America to outweigh those gains. Downside is limited following UAA’s near 30% post-earnings crash, as the Street is already bracing itself for poor results in the foreseeable future after Chief Executive Officer Kevin Plank’s commentary on North America challenges, wrote the analysts, noting that UAA seems to be “somewhat cognizant of its recent mistakes.” “However there has been no clear-cut evidence that UAA is willing to pull back distribution,” wrote the Susquehanna analysts. The investment bank highlighted the importance of Under Armour’s North American business as it makes up 80% of the company’s revenues and fell 12% in the third quarter of 2017.

According to the online brokerage, its Investor Movement Index (IMX) increased to 7.4 in October after coming in at 7.14 for September. The index gauges what its customers are buying and selling via their TD Ameritrade accounts and their exposure to the stock market. TD Ameritrade said that, while customers were net buyers for nine months in a row, it was from September to October that the broker saw the IMX jump close to 4% to reach the second highest reading in the history of the index. The online trading firm said that October was characterized by strong U.S. markets, positive quarterly earnings on behalf of all sorts of companies and a global economy that is strengthening. Taken together, that appeared to influence retail investors' behavior on the positive side. ""TD Ameritrade clients have continued to be net buyers and seem to be putting their money where they see opportunity,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, in a press release this week announcing the monthly reading of the IMX. ""Retail investors have increased their exposure to Chinese stocks while taking profits in the energy sector as crude oil hits 52-week highs."" [Want to invest with a quality broker? Read Investopedia's broker reviews first.] TD Ameritrade customers had particular interest in technology stocks during the month of October, with clients buying semiconductor companies Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and Micron Technology, Inc.

The online brokerage firm's investors also liked General Electric Company (GE), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA), Square, Inc. (SQ) and Switch, Inc. (SWCH) during the month of October. In the oil industry, TD Ameritrade customers purchased shares of Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) and Chevron Corporation (CVX). Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) were among financial sector favorites during October. One stock that customers were selling more of than purchasing was Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOG). TD Ameritrade found that clients were net sellers of the stock despite the company beating earnings expectations and trading above $1,000 per share for the first time in its history.

Mark Kolakowski,11092017,Investopedia,11022017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A dozen or so companies are well-positioned to reap big profits from the burgeoning market for artificial intelligence (AI), Barron's reports. Among these companies are: semiconductor manufacturers Micron Technology Inc. (MU) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA); Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL); database management software developer Oracle Corp. (ORCL); online merchant and cloud-computing leader Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN); computer hardware manufacturer and business solutions provider International Business Machines Corp. (IBM); video streaming service Netflix Inc. (NFLX); and U.K.-based business process automation software developer Blue Prism Group PLC (PRISM.UK). In 1997, IBM scored a major milestone in AI history when its Deep Blue program beat reigning world chess champion Gary Kasparov, still considered by many experts to be the best player of all time. IBM's Watson question answering system passed a high-profile test in 2011, beating two top former champs on Jeopardy!, the long-running quiz show on TV. Since then, Watson has been rolled out for general commercial use, most notably to aid doctors in making diagnoses. Alphabet's DeepMind division has taken on the challenge of developing a program to play the ancient Chinese board game called Go, which is considered to be even more complex than chess. In 2016, the DeepMind program beat a human international champ. Last month, a refined version of this program defeated the 2016 release in each of 100 games, Barron's reports. Alphabet already is adapting the machine learning technology demonstrated by their Go-playing program to other tasks, such as the development of drugs, Barron's notes. AI applications require advanced hardware that facilitates speedy processing. Chips from Nvidia already are the preferred choice for running machine learning software, while Micron manufactures fast memory chips that are well-suited to these applications, Barron's indicates. Meanwhile, since many AI applications are likely to be run over the internet, cloud-computing providers such as IBM and Amazon are likely beneficiaries, Barron's adds. (For more, see also: Microsoft Cloud Sales Show It's Catching Up With Amazon.) Several of the aforementioned companies are using AI to enhance their own core businesses. Improving the quality of search results, including customizing them to match the perceived needs and preferences of the individual user, are applications of AI used by Google, Amazon and Netflix alike. In the cases of Amazon and Netflix, these companies use past buying and browsing behavior to anticipate what the customer may want next, and to customize suggestions accordingly. Amazon's chatbox Alexa is a particularly notable application of AI, according to Ken Sena, a Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) analyst who focuses on AI, per Barron's. One application of AI is to let computers apply well-defined rules to predictable inputs, as Barron's describes robotic process automation. IBM and Blue Prism already are big players in the automation of routine white collar functions. Oracle is both making a push into cloud services and developing ""the world's first fully autonomous database cloud service,"" replacing human database administrators with an AI-driven program. Outsourcing companies located in low-cost countries are most at risk from such developments, Barron's indicates, especially in areas such as IT support and transaction processing. (For more, see also: Oracle's Cloud Strategy to Beat Amazon, Microsoft.) Ken Sena expects total AI revenue over the next decade roughly to equal the current size of U.S. GDP. Other analysts are projecting that world GDP will increase by a similar amount by the year 2030, as the result of advances in AI. (For more, see also: How Google, Facebook, Amazon Will Ride The AI Wave.)

Stephanie Landsman,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"With just about seven weeks left until the end of the year, Wells Fargo Securities has just raised its year-end S&P 500 target to reflect what its top equity strategist calls a quantitative easing-type phenomenon gripping stocks. Christopher Harvey, the firm's head of equity strategy, is seeing the rising popularity of index funds and ETFs changing the dynamics of the bull market. He contends these passive investing instruments have been creating upward pressure on stock prices, and that's been a major reason why stocks have rallied so sharply in 2017. ""It's very similar to QE."" Harvey said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""With QE, you took a certain part of the Treasury market out of circulation. Now what you're doing is you're taking a good part of the equity market out of circulation, and you're upsetting the supply and demand dynamics. There are fewer natural sellers."" Wells Fargo's new 2017 forecast calls for the S&P 500 to reach 2,636, which reflects about a 1.9 percent gain from current levels. The firm started the year with a 2,475 year-end target, which would have come in about 4 percent short if the year was to end now. ""We don't see a lot of bad news in the short term, and so we feel it's fairly justified,"" said Harvey, who became in charge of the firm's S&P 500 price target and earnings forecast in April. He acknowledges Wells Fargo's initial forecast was ""too conservative"" and the year has been exceeding expectations. According to Harvey, there's still momentum in place for stocks to grind higher. ""No one wants to be the first one out of the pool. No one wants to de-risk at this point in time,"" Harvey added. ""You have this mindset of FOMO — fear of missing out."" But that's Harvey's short-term forecast, and it shouldn't be confused with 2018. He's making it clear that investors will see fewer milestones as the markets get more expensive and risks grow. ""Inertia is becoming the most powerful force in the capital markets. A body of motion tends to stay in motion. And, that for us is a big concern. We want to see people more paranoid,"" Harvey said. ""As the market goes higher, everyone is becoming more bullish. I think all the positives are starting to color people's beliefs and views. They're not looking at risk in the proper way.""

Tom DiChristopher,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"Bears are known for hibernating, but its the bulls in the oil market that might as well settle in for a long nap, according to Wells Fargo. The bank expects the current bear market for oil to last another five to 10 years, Wells Fargo Investment Institute analyst Austin Pickle wrote in a new research note. During that time, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude prices are likely to remain stuck between $30 and $60 a barrel. If that call is correct, it means there's little upside for WTI, which came just 2 cents shy of its 2017 high of $55.24 on Wednesday. U.S. crude 40-day performance Supercycle bear markets typically last 20 years, but this one may not run that long, according to Pickle. These prolonged slumps have been shortening over the course of the last century. The last commodity bear supercycle lasted about 16 years from 1983 to 1999. ""Why do bear markets last so long? After the excesses of the bull market, and the wake-up call of a spike in bust rate, the companies that remain cut costs anywhere they can, prioritize investments, and become more efficient,"" Pickle wrote.""Money is no longer being thrown at every imaginable oil play, and only the most cost-effective oil producers remain. As a result, the remaining companies survive low oil prices for longer,"" he said.The current cycle, sparked by a ""flash flood of production"" as U.S. drillers learned to extract oil and gas from shale rock formations, sent prices spiraling to $26 a barrel in February 2016 from more than $100 a barrel in the summer of 2014.""Bear markets in commodities are a consequence of human behavior in the preceding bull market. Higher prices invite investment in new technology (such as shale oil extraction) — and then production, production and more production — until, eventually, supply overwhelms demand,"" Pickle said.The bear market has already gone through the first step of the healing process: weeding out the weakest players. Roughly 22 percent of exploration and production companies went bust during this phase, compared with about 26 percent in the 1986 oil price crash, according to Wells Fargo.But the second step of the process — crude stuck within a certain range of prices — typically drags on for years, Pickle warned. It lasted more than 12 years from the '86 crash to the start of the new bull market in 1999 during the previous bear supercycle. So far, the current downturn is following the same price trend.The last step is exasperation, when companies and investors, exasperated by years of little to no profits, throw in the towel.

""I'm getting a little worried here,"" Matt Maley said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""We're starting to see some of the traditional signs of getting near a top being explained away for whatever reason."" Specifically, Maley pointed to the flattening yield curve — where short-term and long-term rates compress — as reason for concern. ""If you go back to 1999 and 2007, the yield curve was flattening for a year while the stock market was going straight to the moon, and that's exactly what we're having now,"" said Maley.

Kevin Breuninger,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"The most comprehensive version to date of the GOP's long-awaited tax plan came a little earlier than many expected Thursday morning — but not too soon for Democrats to immediately plant a flag of staunch opposition. Among other changes, the summary details of the proposal outline large increases of the standard deduction for individuals and families, as well as raising the child tax credit and doubling the estate tax while scheduling its repeal in six years. The bill would also permanently lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, sources told CNBC. In a time of stark polarization in Congress, Democrats didn't bother waiting for the full text of the bill before taking their criticisms public. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., an especially outspoken critic of both the opposition party and President Donald Trump's administration, said the plan is essentially designed to transfer money from poor to rich, from Democrat to Republican, and away from government programs generally. Chris Murphy tweet 2 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, branding the plan with the hashtag #BillionairesFirst, called the proposal ""disastrous"" in a tweet. At a press conference Thursday, Pelosi said the GOP plan would constitute a ""catastrophic transfer"" of wealth to the rich from the middle class. Pelosi tweet Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, using similar language as his colleague in the House, said the plan will raise taxes on the middle class and serve the wealthiest Americans most, according to reports.

Catherine Clifford,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"The future of ""Dreamers,"" children who arrived in the United States illegally, is pitting President Donald Trump against big tech. And this week, big tech upped its opposition to Trump's effort to repeal the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program by  filing an amicus brief, or a legal statement of support, in California on Wednesday. The amicus brief breaks down how damaging it would be to U.S. companies, workers and the economy for DACA to be repealed. The lawsuit says if DACA is rescinded, the U.S. economy would lose $460.3 billion over the next ten years. Contributions to Social Security and Medicare would be reduced by $24.6 billion in the same time frame, the lawsuit says. In September, Trump decided to rescind DACA, which President Obama had established in 2012. Trump said he would allow the program to expire in March. Trump claimed Obama overreached his legislative authority to set up DACA, but the lawsuit big tech is supporting refutes this claim. ""DACA closely resembles deferred action programs adopted in the past, and complies fully with the applicable statute. The agency's rescission of DACA, predicated entirely on that erroneous legal conclusion, therefore cannot stand,"" the lawsuit says. The amicus brief included signatories of 108 tech firms including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Tesla, SpaceX, Uber, Twitter, Verizon, Lyft, eBay, and the list goes on. DACA gives ""Dreamers"" the ability to work in the U.S. legally. The $460 billion hit to the U.S. economy if DACA is rescinded is because 700,000 ""dreamers,"" who are currently employed, would lose their jobs in the next two years. That's equivalent to 1,400 dreamers losing their job every day, the lawsuit says. ""Dreamers"" currently work at 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies including IBM, Walmart, Apple, General Motors, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, Home Depot and Wells Fargo, the lawsuit says. Replacing those ""Dreamers"" put out of work will cost U.S. companies $6.3 billion. The lawsuit disputes the claim that ""Dreamers"" are taking jobs that would otherwise go to Americans, instead positing ""Dreamers"" are often taking jobs that companies struggle to fill with qualified workers. ""The jobs being filled by Dreamers post-DACA are largely jobs for which there is a shortage of qualified workers—not the jobs that are or could be filled by U.S.-born workers,"" the lawsuit says. Indeed, since 2012, when Obama established DACA, the unemployment rate has fallen by almost half, the lawsuit says. In September, when Trump announced his decision to rescind DACA initially, there was an outpouring of support from tech CEOs and leaders.""This is a sad day for our country. The decision to end DACA is not just wrong. It is particularly cruel to offer young people the American Dream, encourage them to come out of the shadows and trust our government, and then punish them for it,"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a public Facebook post.

JPM Total Assets (Quarterly) data by YCharts. No other megabank comes close to matching Wells Fargo's growth rate since the beginning of 2008 -- i.e., the eve of the financial crisis. Wells Fargo's balance sheet has since grown by 236%, according to YCharts.com. At the end of 2007, Wells Fargo's balance sheet weighed in at $575 billion in assets. Fast forward to today and that has increased to $1.9 trillion. Much of Wells Fargo's growth since the onset of the crisis came in one fell swoop, by way of Wells Fargo's 2008 acquisition of Wachovia. The deal singlehandedly more than doubled the size of Wells Fargo's balance sheet. It also gave the bank a branch network that spanned the entire continent, as opposed to operating principally throughout the western United States before that. Image source: Getty Images. The most stark contrast to Wells Fargo's ascent is Citigroup (NYSE:C), which, not coincidentally, was also trying to buy Wachovia at the same time as Wells Fargo. As the preceding chart makes clear, Citigroup is the only multitrillion-dollar megabank to contract in size over the past decade. Going into the crisis, Citigroup was the biggest bank in the country. But its troubles through the downturn, combined with the fact that it was the only one of the four not to consummate a major acquisition in the crisis, caused it to drop to fourth place, surpassed most recently by none other than Wells Fargo. The other two banks in the chart are JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the first and second biggest banks in the country, respectively. JPMorgan Chase weighs in at $2.6 trillion in assets. Bank of America comes in at $2.3 trillion. JPMorgan Chase's growth over the past 10 years can be traced to organic growth, as well as its acquisitions of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual in 2008. Bank of America, meanwhile, bought Merrill Lynch the same year. The net result is that, while Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America have all seen their balance sheets expand since the crisis -- though, Citigroup's has gone in the other direction -- none comes close to Wells Fargo in terms of the magnitude of growth.

Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has been the focus of a lot of unpleasant attention this year after regulators announced in September 2016 that thousands of its employees spent years opening millions of unauthorized fake accounts for customers in order to drive up the bank's cross-sale ratio. This has been bad for current shareholders of the nation's third-biggest bank by assets, but it might present an opportunity for enterprising investors who don't already own its stock. There are three reasons to believe that Wells Fargo stock is cheap today. Though, given where the market is right now, as well as the fact that Wells Fargo could still face further regulatory and legal fallout from the frauds, this doesn't necessarily mean investors should immediately jump to buy shares. Image source: Getty Images. The first reason Wells Fargo's shares come across as cheap is that they are underperforming other bank stocks, as well as the broader market. Wells Fargo's stock is down 1.5% year to date. That's not horrible in and of itself, but it looks dismal when juxtaposed against its peer group. The average stock price of the 20 biggest banks in the country has climbed 10.2% this year. It's worth remembering that bank stocks in general have soared over the past 12 months. Since this time last year, the KBW Bank Index, which tracks shares of two dozen large-cap bank stocks, is up 31%. The outcome of last year's presidential election served as a key catalyst for that rise, as then-candidate Donald Trump had promised to ""dismantle"" the consumer protections of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, and reduce the corporate tax rate. The former change would enable banks to make more money, while the latter would allow them to keep more of the money they make. But even though Wells Fargo's stock has participated in this rally, it hasn't benefited as much as most of its peers. Since this time last year, shares of the California-based bank are up 19%. That ain't bad, but it's well below other large banks. One of the metrics that investors look at when deciding whether to buy a stock is its 52-week high. The implication is that stocks furthest from their top prices over the past year, holding all else equal, offer more upside potential. This would seem to bode well for Wells Fargo. Over the past year, the bank's share price topped out at $59.99. Today, they're around $54 a share -- 10% below that 52-week high. Now, to be clear, a 10% discount isn't huge when it comes to this measure, but it's nevertheless a bigger discount than the typical blue-chip bank stock. Among the 20 biggest banks in the country, the average stock is trading for 6% below its 52-week high. Just like the underperformance of Wells Fargo's stock this year, this suggests that its shares have more upward potential than other big bank stocks. The third reason that Wells Fargo's stock seems cheap is that it trades at a lower valuation than the typical big bank stock. You can see this by looking at the bank's price-to-earnings ratio, which is calculated by taking a bank's share price divided by its earnings per share. The average big bank trades for 14 times expected earnings over the next 12 months. In effect, this means that it costs an investor $14 to buy ever $1 worth of estimated annual earnings. Wells Fargo comes in below that. It's price-to-earnings multiple is 13.5. That's not a lot less than the average bank stock, but it is less. Now, as I said at the outset, none of this necessarily means that you should run out and buy Wells Fargo's stock right now. After all, with the broader market at record highs, all stocks could be due for a correction, including bank stocks. Additionally, there's reason to believe that Wells Fargo is almost certainly not done absorbing the costs associated with its fake-account scandal. That said, if you're a value investor on the hunt for bank stocks, Wells Fargo is worth adding to your watch list. ","
      
    Wells Fargo Stock Seems Cheap, But Is It? -- The Motley Fool

It has been a tough year for Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), as the bank seeks to repair its tarnished image in the wake of a sales scandal disclosed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year. But in the stock market, one company's challenges can be an investor's opportunity. Given the lagging performance of Wells Fargo stock over the past year, this raises the question: Is Wells Fargo stock a buy in November? Image source: Getty Images. At least initially, it seems that the answer to this is yes. I say that because shares of Wells Fargo have underperformed most other big bank stocks over the recent past. Since the beginning of the year, shares of the nation's third-biggest bank by assets have climbed 1.8%. That isn't horrible, but it's far from good when you consider that the KBW Bank Index, which tracks shares of two dozen large-cap banks, is up 11% over the same stretch. The comparison looks even worse if you look at the performance of Wells Fargo's stock over the past 12 months. Since this time last year, its shares are up 22% compared to a gain of 37% for the average bank on the KBW Bank Index. The cost of Wells Fargo's scandal, in other words, isn't that its stock has fallen, but rather that it hasn't kept pace with the rest of the industry. WFC data by YCharts. All of this has weighed on Wells Fargo's stock valuation. The bank currently trades for 14.6 times its expected earnings per share over the next 12 months. That's comfortably below the average big bank, which trades for closer to 17 times forward earnings. Given this, one would be excused for concluding that Wells Fargo stock is indeed a good buy right now. While there are reasons to think that Wells Fargo's shares are attractively priced right now, there are also factors that go against an investment in the California-based bank. In the first place, one could argue that the bank's response to the crisis has fundamentally altered the traditional investment thesis in its stock. Wells Fargo was known for years as having one of the highest cross-sale ratios in the industry, with an average retail customer using 6.1 of the bank's products and services as of last year, which has long been much higher than the typical bank. Wells Fargo accomplished this by putting immense pressure on employees in its branches to open new accounts for customers. But as the bank itself has acknowledged, it was this pressure that led thousands of its employees to open millions of accounts for customers without customers' authorization. Consequently, the bank has abandoned its former focus on sales, which will impair the bank's growth and profitability. On top of this, Wells Fargo has seen multiple large customers blacklist the bank. In the middle of last month, the bank's home state of California extended a ban on using Wells Fargo to underwrite municipal bonds. All told, moves like these have cost the bank ""tens of millions of dollars"" in revenue, according to its chief financial officer. Finally, most of Wells Fargo's fundamental performance metrics have been heading in the wrong direction and continue to do so. In the latest quarter, the notoriously efficient bank spent 65.5% of its revenue on operating expenses compared to only 59.4% in the same quarter last year. The net result is that Wells Fargo's profitability has dropped considerably, with its earnings per share in the third quarter falling by 20%. In sum, while there are reasons to be optimistic about Wells Fargo's stock at its current valuation, before concluding that it's a buy in November, investors should think long and hard about whether the onetime industry darling will be able to reclaim its former glory.

Matthew Cochrane,11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments are the act of one person electronically sending money to another person through a platform. While most people still use cash or write checks, there is no denying that the use of digital platforms for P2P payments has exploded in recent years. While tech companies such as PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) have thrived with P2P payments, traditional banks and smaller fintech companies have struggled to keep up. This might be finally beginning to change as several big banks, including Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC), called out Zelle's big launch this past quarter for serving as a catalyst for P2P growth. Zelle is probably best thought of as a shared P2P platform on which nearly all domestic big banks, and several smaller ones, are currently participating. For banks, one of the major problems in gaining traction with P2P payments has been a fragmented market. Until recently, if I want to electronically send my friend $15 to cover my share of pizza, I couldn't have done that using my bank's app unless my friend and I both used the same bank. With PayPal or its subsidiary Venmo, there is no need to share a bank, smartphone manufacturer, or operating system. For banks, Zelle looks like it might have largely solved that problem. PayPal has deepened customer engagement with P2P payments. Image source: PayPal Holdings Inc. For good reason, PayPal has become the envy of the financial world with its P2P payments success: In its most recent quarter, P2P payments grew to $24 billion across PayPal's platforms, good for a 47% increase year over year, and P2P payments now represent 21% of PayPal's $114 billion total payment volume. Venmo, PayPal's P2P app popular with millennials for featuring a social-media element, also continues to show explosive growth. In PayPal's third quarter, Venmo processed about $9 billion in payments, an incredible 93% year-over-year increase. Some might wonder why this is a big deal. After all, very little, if any, money is made on P2P payment transactions. Neither PayPal nor Venmo charges fees for these transactions if the funds originate from the account's balance or a bank account. When a credit card is used as the source of the funds being transferred, a nominal fee is charged, but that mostly goes to the credit card company. But P2P payments have never been about turning a profit. Rather, it's about getting customers to deepen their engagement level with a platform. This is something PayPal knows a thing or two about: In its recently reported quarter, PayPal reported 1.9 billion transactions across its platforms, a 26% increase year over year. Its transactions per active account increased to 32.8, a 9% annual increase. By getting its customers to use the platform more with free and convenient P2P transfers, it has also increased other types of transaction numbers as customer acquaint themselves more with the platform and form spending habits. As banks saw consumer habits changing, they knew they would have to adapt or risk losing the next generation of consumers. Zelle was their collective solution, and early results look promising. In the company's third-quarter conference call, Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said the bank had seen ""significant growth"" in both the number of P2P transactions and payment volume since launching Zelle in June. Sloan also said the company saw 46% growth year over year in P2P payments. While JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon didn't give specific numbers in his company's conference call, he did say that since Zelle launched, P2P was ""doing quite well."" But it was Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan who might have shed the most light on how well Zelle was performing with his bank's customers. He stated: In this quarter, Zelle came forward, the latest offering we have in mobile area. ... [O]ur volumes through Zelle this quarter were $4 billion in the third quarter. We processed nearly 14 million transactions, and the growth continues. We recently processed $0.5 billion in a single week. Our customers are using Zelle, and we look forward to further growth in that area. While these numbers are coming off a small base and still represent a fraction of these banks' overall payment volumes, the growth should encourage them that they are finally gaining traction in this particular payment subsector. Of course, shareholders in these banks should continue to watch their progress closely. It's important for these banks to demonstrate that they can consistently match the latest trends in fintech and consumer behavior. At the same time, PayPal's heady growth numbers show that there is plenty of room for two or more players in this space. Investors in this company should, of course, continue to monitor its growth numbers and customer engagement levels, but there doesn't appear to be any reason for concern for the time being.

Billy Duberstein,11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Ubiquiti Networks (NASDAQ:UBNT) investors had an interesting ride this fall. After strong earnings in August and robust guidance, the stock climbed to $67, but in September, the company became the target of short-seller Citron Research, which called the company a ""fraud,"" sending shares down to $50. Shares have since recovered to almost $65 as of this writing, so apparently Wall Street doesn't take Citron's claims very seriously. In addition, analysts Erik Suppiger of JMP Securities and Tavis McCourt of Raymond James both dismissed the fraud allegations. My colleagues recently dismissed Citron's even more recent attack on Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), and I don't believe there's much substance to Citron's attack on Ubiquiti, either. Image source: Getty Images. Ubiquiti's revenues are currently evenly split between its service-provider and enterprise segments. The service-provider segment is the company's older one, having started selling its groundbreaking Airmax Wi-Fi radios roughly a decade ago. That segment has been stable, but it somewhat stagnated recently, growing only about 11% over the past two years. That compares with 130% growth in Enterprise over that time. On the last call, CEO Robert Pera signaled that better times for the service-provider segment could be ahead. This year, the company unveiled its second generation of Airmax AC products, which have advanced features such as GPS sync and backward compatibility. That means service providers can replace older Airmax N radios one by one, instead of having to replace entire networks at once. The company believes these features will spur a bigger refresh cycle this year. In addition, the company released a new product called uFiber, a gigabit passive optical network product for service providers. Management explained that the company was initially focusing on proving the technology in North America, before releasing the product internationally, especially in places like Brazil, where service providers can hang cables along telephone lines. Last quarter, the company earned almost $115 million in the service-provider segment, so watch to see if that improves sequentially, and when uFiber will hit international markets. Earlier this year, the company seriously upgraded its Unifi enterprise products. While Unifi had typically made ""good enough"" Wi-Fi access points for small businesses at extremely low prices, new additions to the Unifi lineup scored better on performance metrics than more expensive products from traditional enterprise vendors, such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). The company also unveiled Unifi Elite, a subscription service that provides a high level of customer support, in an effort to penetrate higher-end enterprises. On the last call, Unifi Elite didn't come up, and it remains unclear if Unifi can break into this new segment. Ubiquiti doesn't employ a traditional sales force and relies instead on word of mouth, so getting enterprises to switch to Unifi could take a long time. Still, Elite has been out for about 10 months now, so it's possible management may provide an update. The enterprise segment almost doubled year over year last quarter but was flat compared with the prior quarter, so investors should look to see if the segment returns to sequential growth. Finally, I don't expect management to comment on the short attack. Pera held an investor-day presentation on Sept. 26, where he dismissed the claims.  Instead, the company is responding with its actions. The day after the accusations, Ubiquiti released updated guidance for the quarter of $240 million to $250 million, up from its previous range of $230 million to $250 million, and increased its buyback program by $100 million, on top of $50 million it had already authorized. The company's October proxy statement revealed there are only 77.8 million shares outstanding, down from 80.3 million as of Aug. 22. Clearly, management has confidence in its performance and integrity, and it's taking advantage of the beaten-down stock price to repurchase shares. Not only that, but the company also increased its credit facility with a bank consortium led by Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) from $300 million to $425 million on Nov. 1, which means the company could buy more shares in the near future. Since Ubiquiti's banks left the terms of the facility unchanged, the company's lenders don't seem worried about fraud, either. As of Oct. 13, almost 11 million shares are sold short, more than half of publicly available shares. If Ubiquiti says it plans to continue buying shares, it could be trying to force a massive short squeeze, so look for any commentary on further buyback plans. ","

Shares of the water utility Aqua America (NYSE:WTR) rose 7% in October. In addition to information about the company's dividend, investors took kindly to the stock after learning of two analyst upgrades. After raising the price target on Aqua America's shares from $35 to $40, analysts at Wells Fargo Securities upgraded their rating from market perform to outperform, according to benzinga.com. In part, analysts based their outlook on the belief that Aqua America's rate increase request in Pennsylvania will resolve favorably for the company. Aqua America intends to file an infrastructure charge in 2017 followed by a rate case filing in 2018. Image source: Getty Images. Although it provides water and wastewater services to approximately 3 million customers in eight states, Aqua America primarily relies on its operations in Pennsylvania. Favorable outcomes of rate increase requests in the Keystone State, therefore, are crucial to the company's success. In fiscal 2016, for example, Aqua Pennsylvania, the company's largest subsidiary, accounted for approximately 52% of Aqua America's operating revenue and 74% of its net income. But the dealings in Pennsylvania weren't the only source of optimism. Further inspiring investors, the analysts from Wells Fargo said that their current earnings estimates for Aqua America assume only $50 million in deals for 2018 and beyond. Meanwhile, the company has more than $120 million in deals pending, leading the analysts to assert that there's potential for their outlook to grow even more bullish if the company executes on its growth plan. Besides Wells Fargo, Ladenburg Thalmann also shared a bullish outlook on the stock in October. Maintaining a buy rating, the analysts set a $32 price target on Aqua America's shares. The October wave of positive sentiment for the stock, in and of itself, may have motivated investors to pick up shares, but it could also very well be the cumulative effect of optimism that has stretched throughout the year. In March, the stock was subject to two upgrades. Barclays raised it from equal weight to overweight and upwardly revised the stock's price target from $33 to $36. Boenning and Scattergood, likewise, upgraded the stock, rating it outperform instead of neutral. When analysts turn their attention to a stock, investors should certainly pay attention, but it should always be taken with a grain of salt. After all, these bearish or bullish ratings may be predicated on the company's predicted short-term performance -- whether several months or a couple of years. We, however, maintain long-term time horizons and are much more concerned with the fundamentals. In this regard, Aqua America represents an interesting opportunity. Operating as a regulated utility, the company has steady and predictable cash flow. Moreover, it has a clear growth-through-acquisition strategy. It's for reasons like these that it should attract investors' attention, not the opinions of those on Wall Street. ","

Motley Fool Staff,11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The Federal Reserve and other key central banks have begun a rate-hike cycle. Here's what it means for you as a consumer and as a borrower, as well as what higher interest rates mean for bank profits (hint: it's good) and for dividend investors (not so good). A full transcript follows the video. Michael Douglass: Let's take a step back and talk about, in general, a rising interest rate environment and what that means. Let's face it, U.S. interest rates are definitely increasing, and they'll actually be increasing, as you noted, probably a good bit faster than the U.K.'s. I think the first group we should talk about are consumers. If you are a consumer, a rising interest rate environment primarily affects you because, when you borrow money, you're going to be paying more interest. On the flip side, you're going to get a little more interest when you open a savings account or a CD. So, when you deposit money in the bank, maybe instead of, I'm making this up here, 0.01%, you might be getting 0.5%, or even one day 1% or 2%. That's not historically unreasonable to see, at some point in the relatively distant future. So, that should help some of those yields for consumers. Matt Frankel: Definitely. It's also worth pointing out that some things are directly related to rising benchmark interest rates while some aren't. You mentioned savings accounts. So far, savings accounts really haven't risen proportionally to the [benchmark] interest rates. Douglass: Not at all! [laughs] Frankel: Not at all. But some things have. Credit cards will rise immediately after the rates are increased. Any kind of loan that's tied to a benchmark, like an adjustable rate mortgage, for example, would rise immediately. Whereas things like non-adjustable mortgage rates, savings, CD rates, they tend to move with rate hikes, but it's not a perfect correlation. Douglass: I think that's a great point to make. The other thing to consider is, one of the other groups that's said to be affected by interest hikes are banks themselves. Banks make their money by taking in money, usually through checking accounts, savings accounts, money markets, things like that, and then loaning it out at a higher rate. So, as rates go up, they can theoretically put that money out at an even higher rate, and that will juice their returns. So, banks in general should benefit substantially from interest rate increases. Frankel: That's especially true that, when rates rise faster than rates on deposits are rising, like we just mentioned with the savings accounts, generally the effect is, when rates rise, borrowing rates tend to rise a little bit faster than deposit rates, which is what's called margin expansion for banks. So, banks tend to make a higher percentage as they're loaning money out for a higher rate, and not paying quite as much more on deposits. So, that's why in the past quarter, you've seen pretty much every bank other than Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) make higher interest margins by about 10 to 12 basis points. So, you'll see this as interest rates continue to rise, a little bit more margin expansion, which is very good for banks. Douglass: Absolutely. Then, for investors, one of the interesting things about rising interest rates is, usually it'll drive down bond prices, which will then improve bond yields. If you have -- I'm making this up -- a $10 bond that yields $1 per year, that would be a 10% yield. That would be insane, by the way, much higher than we get right now. But if the price of that bond drops to $5, then suddenly that $1 yield becomes a 20% yield, even though it hasn't changed any, it's just that with the price lower, that yield is then better. What's interesting about this to me is that if bond yields improve substantially -- right now, you see a lot of bonds paying 3% to 4%, if that starts getting up into 5%, 6%, maybe even 7%, I think a lot of your income investors, these are folks who are at or near retirement, who have been in dividend stocks because they're paying a similar yield to these bonds and you get some potential capital appreciation out of it, might head over to bonds instead of income stocks, which could have some really interesting effects on the dividend stock market. Most of them, let's say not terribly positive for those who are already invested there. Of course, we can't predict the future, but that's just one possible outcome here. Frankel: Right. A good example I always use, I invest a lot in real estate stocks, REITs, which pay, generally, 4% to 6%. Douglass: Yeah, they do pretty well. Frankel: Right, they're some of the highest dividend stocks on the market. And one of the examples I always use is, say, if a 10-year Treasury is paying 3%, and a pretty solid REIT is paying 5%, it's worth taking the extra risk to get that extra yield. However, if the Treasury is now paying 6%, but you can only get 5% from a riskier asset, you lose the incentive to take that extra risk. That can create selling pressure on the stock to jump the yield up, as you were just describing. Douglass: Of course, on the flip side, when great businesses go on sale, that's a great time to potentially buy in. We've talked a fair amount about dividend stocks and Dividend Aristocrats, and some of these other companies that have really shown their ability to raise their dividends and really reward investors long-term. So, this might create some really great buying opportunities. I know, me personally, I'm looking forward to and hoping for that outcome so that I can pick up some great companies on sale. Frankel: Me too. It can be painful in the short term to watch the dollar value of your portfolio go down, but in the long term, it's actually a really good thing for people who still have time. Douglass: Right. So long as it doesn't go down for forever, right? [laughs] Frankel: Right. Short term, it's OK. ","

CBL & Associates Properties (NYSE:CBL), a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns a portfolio of 119 properties, mostly retail-oriented, reported third-quarter earnings that disappointed investors. As of 10:30 a.m. EDT on Friday, November 3, the first trading day after the announcement, the stock had plunged by more than 25%. The results were pretty terrible all around. FFO and adjusted FFO (the REIT version of ""earnings"") dropped by 7.1% and 12.3% year over year, respectively, and portfolio occupancy declined by 40 bps from the same quarter in 2016. Image source: Getty Images. Not only did earnings disappoint, but the company made the decision to slash its dividend by 25% -- a major red flag for REIT investors. Analyst downgrades followed the gloomy report. Notably, Wells Fargo downgraded the company to market underperform with a $7 price target, which is undoubtedly adding to the downside pressure on the stock. Nobody should be surprised that the mall retail space is facing challenging times right now. There have been 22 major retail bankruptcies so far in 2017, and many of these are retailers you would ordinarily expect to see in malls and shopping centers. However, CBL's report just shows that the retail headwinds are affecting the company even more than expected. Obviously, the third quarter is a big disappointment for CBL & Associates' shareholders, and it should be. The question is how long it will take for mall operators to adapt to the changing retail environment, and how much the adaptation process will affect profitability. CBL's president & CEO Steven Lebovitz said the company is ""successfully replacing underperforming retailers with higher performing tenants and more diverse uses."" He went on to say that the company is transforming its properties into suburban town centers that offer dining, fitness, health and beauty, and more service-oriented businesses, which should certainly help the company adapt to e-commerce headwinds. If the company's strategy proves to be successful, the current low share price could be a bargain. However, there's definitely a major element of risk, which is even greater now after the poor results this past quarter. ","

We like that this card incentivizes keeping balances low by earning a total of 2% cash back, 1% when making purchases and another 1% when paying off balances. This is one of the few remaining balance-transfer cards that includes a $0 balance transfer fee (for transfers made within 60 days). Add in the premium rewards and welcome bonus, and it's hard to ignore. A credit card can be a great way to build credit, earn rewards on every purchase, and even finance your purchases at APRs as low as 0%. But with thousands of cards to choose from, many people fall into a state of “paralysis by analysis,” unable to make a decision because there are simply too many choices and too many variables on which to compare one credit card to another. Here at The Ascent, we’re working to make selecting a credit card as easy as buying a new pair of socks. Below, we’ll explain the ins and outs of the credit card market, and show you how to pick a card that works best for your spending needs. We at The Ascent want to help you climb to the top and conquer your money goals. That is why our top picks have a few features in common that can help your money work harder for you, cut out-of-pocket costs, or help you get out of debt faster. The most important factors in our rating methodology are as follows: As credit card enthusiasts, we don’t review or pick cards based on conjecture. We’ve used many of the top credit cards on the market to score 0% intro APRs, earn cash back rewards, and build up miles to go on the vacations of our dreams. Together, we’ve analyzed hundreds of card offers on more than 6,000 data points, reading through the fine print to find the very best credit cards the market has to offer. Though there are many different credit cards out there, virtually all card offers can be divided into five different categories based on their features and rewards programs. The first thing you should do when shopping for a credit card is to narrow the list of possible matches by picking a certain feature or functionality that is particularly important to you. The five types of credit cards are as follows: Credit cards are about more than just borrowing money. A credit card is a useful payment option that offers more convenience and fraud protection, while helping you build the credit necessary to qualify for other loans at the lowest possible interest rate. Here are a few reasons why it makes sense to use a credit card for your ordinary daily purchases: One thing we want to make very clear is that picking the best credit card is a personal decision that should be guided by your financial needs. Though there is a perfect credit card out there for you, there isn’t a single credit card that is perfect for every single person. With so many choices, doing a proper credit card comparison can be overwhelming. But the truth is that only a few things really matter when making the decision between one card and another card. Here are some things to think about as you compare one credit card to another. Rewards cards generally reward cardholders with points or miles that can be redeemed for cash or travel. If you don’t travel much, a cash-back card is likely a better choice, since it is more flexible. Frequent travelers, however, may be better off with a travel card, which can offer higher rewards rates than cash-back cards, as well as no foreign transaction fees on international spending. (Many cards charge a foreign transaction fee equal to 3% of amounts spent abroad, which can add up to $60 of unnecessary fees on $2,000 of international spend.) Consider Capital One® Venture® Rewards Credit Card, a card that offers 2x miles per $1 spent. Each mile is worth $0.01 each when redeemed for travel. However, if miles are redeemed for cash, miles are only worth half as much, or $0.005 each. So, while this card ranks consistently as a top travel credit card, it isn’t a good card if you will redeem your rewards for cash. A cash back credit card would be a better choice. We aren’t picking on Capital One here. Virtually all travel cards from all card issuers have some kind of “penalty” for redeeming your rewards for cash rather than travel. Unless you know with certainty you will use your rewards for travel, a cash-back credit card almost always offers more value than a travel card. Cards that carry annual fees typically earn rewards at a faster clip than cards that do not carry annual fees. For example, Bank of America® Travel Rewards credit card - 25,000 Bonus Points Offer does not have an annual fee. It offers a rewards yield of $0.015 in travel value for every $1 spent. Alternatively, Capital One® Venture® Rewards has a rewards yield of $0.02 of travel value per $1, but it carries an annual fee of $95. By dividing the difference in annual fees ($95) by the difference in rewards yields ($0.005 per $1), we can arrive at a breakeven point of $19,000. Cardholders who spend less than $19,000 per year would be better off with Bank of America® Travel Rewards credit card, while cardholders who spend more would be better off with Capital One® Venture® Rewards. We tend to think that cards with annual fees are only a good choice if you spend heavily, and will put the vast majority of your spending on just one card. It rarely makes sense to carry multiple cards with annual fees. We tend to think that the only thing that really matters with secured cards is finding one that doesn’t charge an annual or monthly maintenance fee just for having an account. This may seem like a simple test for picking a good secured card, but you’d be surprised at just how many secured cards are loaded with fees, some in excess of $200 per year. The best secured credit cards don’t have any annual fees, offer free access to your FICO® scores, and one even offers a rewards program! Given that these two cards exist, it doesn’t make sense to apply for a card with annual fees. We haven’t found many major differences between the top business cards, other than their credit score criteria. Some cards are designed for people who have merely “good” credit, which we’d generally categorize as a FICO score higher than 680. Others are only offered to people who have excellent credit, which for business cards can be a FICO score of 750 or better. Of course, other factors come into play for approval -- your income can be just as important as your credit score when you apply for a new card. Though more than 70% of American adults have a credit card, they aren’t for everyone. On one hand, they can offer excellent benefits that include rewards on every swipe, big sign-up bonuses, free access to a FICO® score, and 0% intro APRs for new cardholders. But if used to spend beyond your means, a credit card can put you into costly credit card debt that will take months, if not years, to pay off.

Image source: The Motley Fool. Operator Good morning, and welcome to Sysco's first quarter, fiscal 2018 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please, go ahead Thanks, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's first quarter, fiscal 2018 earnings call. Joining me in Houston today are Bill Delaney, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Bene, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reformat, and actual results could differ, in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on foreign 10-K, for the year ended July 1, 2017, subsequent SEC filings, and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the investor's section, at sysco.com, or via Sysco's IR app. Non-gap financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-gap measures, to the corresponding gap measures, are included at the end of the presentation slides, and can also be found in the investor's section of our website. Additionally, due to the Brakes Group acquisition, that closed in July of 2016, we previously referenced financial performance results, both including and excluding the acquisition for our fiscal 2017. Beginning this quarter, and going forward, as we now have a full year's worth of financial results, we will be referencing financial results for Sysco in total. The one exception will be for operating income, as we still plan to give visibility on our original, three-year plan target, which did not include Brakes. Additionally, we have scheduled our Investor Day, for December 7, in New York. We look forward to seeing you there. To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question, and one follow up. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill Delaney. Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our start to fiscal 2018, as reflected in the solid first quarter results Sysco reported, earlier this morning. For the quarter, sales increased 5%, to $14.7 billion. Adjusted operating income increased nearly 6%, to $662 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 10%, to 74 cents. These results were achieved in the midst of several devastating natural disasters, during the latter part of the quarter, which adversely impacted our business, and that of our customers, in several key markets. We estimate that our operating income for the quarter would have been approximately $10 million higher, if not for the lost sales and reduced productivity, caused by hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Tom and Joel will provide additional perspective on the financial impact of these unprecedented events, later on in the call. Additionally, I'd like to take a moment to express our gratitude to all the first responders, volunteers, and charitable organizations, who worked tirelessly to support those in need. I'd also like to thank our dedicated associates, who sacrificed personally, to ensure delivery of product to those customers with critical needs, such as hospitals and shelters. Further, it has been incredibly gratifying for me to witness the tremendous outpouring of support, among thousands of our associates, for one another, through Sysco's Disaster Relief Foundation. Moving now to the current economic and market environments in which we operate, we are hopeful that the recently reported and improved GDP trends in the United States could ultimately lead to demand lift for our domestic customer base. While it's difficult to totally isolate the impact of the extreme weather experienced in Texas and Florida in September, it appears that current market conditions in the United States for foodservice operators are modestly favorable. Larger check sizes at restaurants continue to offset somewhat lower traffic counts, while consumer sentiment remains at relatively high levels. Conversely, economic growth in the European markets we operate in is more muted. In addition, significant foreign-exchange-drive food cost inflation in our UK business continues to pressure our pricing, which has impacted our volume growth, and gross margins. We are highly focused, and actively engaged in addressing these challenges in a manner that is beneficial both to our customers and to Sysco. Turning to Sysco's current state, we continue to execute our customer-centric strategy, at a high level. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and we are well positioned to achieve disciplined, profitable, and sustainable growth, in the future. I'm confident that we will be able to continue to leverage quality sales growth in our domestic food service business, by continually improving the implementation of our commercial, supply chain, and cost reduction strategic initiatives. The prospects for our international businesses are also compelling, as we see significant potential, over the next few years, to penetrate the markets we currently serve, enhance operating best practices, and further expand our geographic footprint. To summarize, we are off to a good start in fiscal 2018, and remain confident in our ability to deliver another strong year, and achieve our current, three-year plan financial targets. In closing, I would like to express my appreciation to all of our associates, for their ongoing efforts and contributions, as we strive to fully realize our vision for Sysco, to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner. And, now, I'll turn the call over to Tom Bene, President, and Chief Operating Officer. Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Sysco's financial results, announced this morning, reflect solid operating performance, and continued progress against several of our key, multiyear initiatives. While we did experience some temporary headwinds, including the impact of the hurricanes on some of our customers, rising inflation, and a challenging inbound freight environment, we remain on track to achieve a successful year, and ultimately, deliver on our three-year operating income target. Looking at our first quarter results by business segment, beginning with US Food Service Operations, sales grew 3.9% for the quarter, gross profit grew 3.8%, and gross margins remained flat. Adjusting for the hurricanes, gross profit dollar growth would've been approximately 4.3%. The growth in gross profit dollars can be attributed to the continued focus on category management, including positive momentum from Sysco brand, and a balanced approach to pricing, with our ongoing revenue management efforts. For the quarter, local case growth in our US broadline business remains strong, at 2.8 percent, and has now grown for 14 consecutive quarters. Adjusting for hurricanes, we believe that local case growth would've been over 3%. Our multi-unit customer segment declined, driving overall case growth to a modest 0.3%. As we've discussed, we have proactively managed our business, in a more disciplined, profitable manner, with multiunit customers. We have recently begun to add some new customers and should see multiunit growth begin to build in the second quarter, and continue, throughout the remainder of the year. While we do see consumers' preferences in restaurants continue to include new, unique, and customizable options, that are fresh and healthy, we also see relative strength in concepts that offer convenience, low cost for consumers, and familiarity. These combined preferences benefit both our local and emerging multiunit customers, who provide value, in terms of quality, dining environment, and a reasonable price point. From a product perspective, we continue to invest in our Sysco brand, as part of a larger brand revitalization effort. Including a reinvigoration of our portfolio, that offers cleaner, fresher images, for our branded products. These changes, along with new innovation, have positively contributed to brand growth, up another 82 basis points, versus prior year. Regarding our supplier community, there were many examples during the recent storms, where our supplier partners were there to support us, and our customers, who were in need. And, I also want to share our thanks to all of those who supported us. Our digital ordering presence continues to grow and has now improved to approximately 40% of local cases ordered. This increased utilization is a result of our solid technology platform, including improved product images and content, enhanced system capabilities, and increased levels of training. Also, as we centralize our support model for multiunit accounts, with tools such as order guide management, both Sysco, and our customers, have begun to see the benefits of working together to drive efficiencies in the business. Turning our attention to costs, our adjusted operating expense growth for the quarter was 3,2%. While there was some definite headwinds that drove our supply chain costs, we continued to see positive momentum from productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements. We are now implementing the next evolution of tools, to help streamline hours, improve delivery, and drive warehouse efficiencies. From an administrative costs perspective, we continue to focus on managing these expenses, throughout the organization. Effectively managing overall cost structure remains a key priority for us, and we continue to focus on a variety of opportunities to deliver improvement. A key pillar of Sysco's strategy for growth and value creation is the continuous assessment of new market opportunities. As many of you know, we recently acquired HFM Food Service, a Hawaii-based, broadline distributor, with approximately $290 million in annual sales. HFM has been providing quality service to Hawaii and Guam for over 50 years. We are excited to welcome them to the Sysco family. Acquiring HFM provides Sysco with direct access to the growing Hawaiian market, and is in clear alignment with our strategy for disciplined, profitable growth of the business. We will report this business in our US Food Service segment, going forward. Moving to international food service operations, we had mixed results for the quarter, with sales growing 6%, gross profit growing 3%, and adjusted operating expenses increasing 5%, driven by investments in our European supply chain transformation, transition costs, associated with a new, large customer in Mexico, and currency translation in Canada. Overall adjusted operating income declined by 8% for the quarter. Our business in Canada is off to a great start this year. We are experiencing local case growth in most regions, especially in major markets. We are also thoughtfully sharing, and implementing strategic initiatives from our US business, such as revenue management, and other customer-centric solutions, including online ordering, to their business. These capabilities, along with a more focused approach to local customers, have translated into accelerated local case growth. Additionally, we are effectively managing our cost structure, and improving supply chain efficiencies, to help maintain a healthy gap between gross profit growth, and expense growth, to drive our overall performance. Our European business is facing some economic headwinds, as customers are experiencing slower restaurant traffic, and an overall slowdown in food away from home, in the UK. Additionally, the UK continues to experience acute inflation, due to weakness in the pound sterling, which resulted in high food cost inflation, of about 9%, during the first quarter. While we expect these headwinds in the UK to continue throughout our fiscal year, we are actively managing the business to mitigate these impacts. As for our business in Latin America, we are excited about the growth opportunities in this region, although there were some weaknesses, due to the recent earthquakes in Mexico City, and expenses related to the addition of a large customer in Mexico, that I mentioned earlier. In Costa Rica, we continue to see solid growth, as we continue expanding our cash and carry footprint. Additionally, subsequent to the close of our first quarter, we have completed the purchase of the remaining 50% of the mica business in Costa Rica. We will use cash to complete this transaction, and our debt levels will not be affected. We initially purchased 50% of the business in 2014, and we are very pleased with the performance thus far, as adjusted EBITDA has doubled in the past three years. We look forward to continued success with the mica team. Lastly, or Sigma segment continues to grow, and we are focused on implementing operational improvements, that will contribute to long-term operating income improvement. In summary, we feel good about the fundamentals of our business, and about the trajectory that we're on for fiscal 2018, to close out our three-year plan. Despite the severe, weather-related challenges we faced in Q1, we continue to make progress in our customer and operational strategies, to improve our customers' experience, and I remain confident in our ability to deliver the high end of our adjusted operating income growth target, or $600 to $650 million. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer. Thank you, Tom, good morning everyone. As Bill and Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter. Our earnings growth reflects continued momentum for our business, including strong local case growth, and good gross profit dollar growth, and cost management. This morning, I'll start with our quarterly results, on a comparable 13-week basis. For the quarter, sales grew 4.9%, gross profit grew 3.8%. While adjusted operating expense grew 3.2%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 5.6%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 10.4%, to 74 cents. During the quarter, our results were impacted by both the impact of multiple hurricanes, and a lower tax rate that, when factored together, would have resulted in operating income growth of more than 7%, and earnings per share of 72 cents, which is in line with our planned expectations. For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we saw inflation of 3.8 percent, in our US broadline business. The pace of inflation has been rapid, for a few categories, such as meat, poultry, and dairy. During the quarter, we had gross profit growth of 3.8%, driven by local case growth, and improved Sysco brand penetration. Adjusted operating expenses grew 3.2% for the quarter, driven by increased transportation expenses, and unusually lower bad debt expense, in the prior year. In addition, our expenses include the impact of labor, and related costs during the storms, that we continued to pay, despite lower volumes in those affected areas. We continue to maintain a gap, between gross profit dollar growth, and adjusted operating expense growth. While the gap was not as strong as in prior quarters, we still feel good about the performance, and the ultimate translation into adjusted operating income leverage, and continued progress toward achieving our three-year plan objectives. A lot of the compression of that gap can be explained by the impact of hurricanes and inbound freights, which negatively impacted cost of goods. In fact, adjusting for the impact of the hurricanes, the gap between gross profit dollars, and expenses, is approximately 1 point. As it relates to taxes. The expected tax rate in the first quarter was 32.7%, compared to 32.9%, in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations was $83 million, for the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2018. Net cap-x for the quarter was $135 million, or about 1% of sales, which was roughly flat to last year. Free cash flow for the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2018 was negative-$52 million. It's important to note that the first quarter often produces negative free cash flow, largely due to investments in working capital. However, we continue to expect strong cash flow for the full fiscal year of 2018. Now, we transition to three business updates. First, regarding second-quarter expectations, we expect to see further softness in the international segment, followed by a modestly stronger second half of the year, as we align the Brakes Group calendar year to our fiscal year. Second, as we previously discussed, we will realize a one-time, net benefit in depreciation expense, related to technology changes. This benefit will be approximately $50 million, recognized evenly over four quarters. Third, regarding share repurchases, we've been aggressive in the market, as we've seen opportunities to repurchase shares, this quarter. We've maintained our approach in purchasing shares opportunistically, but we do not expect that pace to continue for the balance of the fiscal year. Finally, a new accounting standard became applicable in fiscal 2018, that requires excess tax benefits, or detriments from stock compensation to be recognized with any income statement in the income tax line. For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized a benefit of $16 million, as a reduction of income tax expense, largely from stock option exercises that occurred in the first quarter. These tax benefits are difficult to predict and depend on factors such as our stock price, and option exercise activity. Absent these tax benefits, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 35 and 36%. In summary, we had a solid quarter, that reflected the continued momentum in our business. I remain confident that we are on track to achieve our three-year plan financial objectives, including the high end of the $600 to $650 million range of improved adjusted operating income, comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2015, excluding Brakes. The fundamentals of our business remain strong. As we continue to deliver strong local case growth, and good gross profit dollar growth, and cost management. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution, in all areas of our business. I'll now turn it back over to Bill before we go to Q&A. Thanks, Joel. As you know, I will be stepping down as Sysco's CEO at the end of the calendar year, so this is my final earnings call. I'm the sixth CEO in Sysco's 47-year history as a public company, and serving in that capacity over the past nine years has been an honor. In addition, I have been truly privileged to work alongside hundreds of committed and highly capable associates, throughout my nearly 30-year career. Today, I would like to especially thank all of our associates, who have supported me throughout my tenure as CEO. We faced many challenges together. Most importantly, we have, together, as one Sysco, driven significant and much-needed transformational change, expanded our international and domestic footprint, increased revenues by nearly $20 billion, and doubled Sysco's market capitalization. The great news is that there remains a lot of opportunity ahead, and really good work to do. Tom Bene is absolutely the right person, together with our leadership team, to take Sysco to the next level. And, I'm confident you will be well served by his leadership, going forward. In closing, I just would like to note that I have been actively involved in Sysco's Investor Relations program during much of my career, including my early years in various treasury functions, and of course, the past 11 years, as CFO and now CEO. To those of you whom I've crossed paths with over the years, thank you for your interest in Sysco, and for the respect, you provided me, both in good and challenging times. I wish you all the very best. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A. Operator At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star, followed by the number 1, on your telephone keypad. Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel, with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. John Heinbockel, your line is open. Can you hear me? Can you hear me, guys? Okay. So, I was gonna say, in light of the 4% inflation rate in the US, flat gross margin was actually a fairly decent outcome. So, maybe talk about where we sit, with the evolution of revenue management, and kinda what you're doing at the margin here, on price elasticity? So, John, good morning, it's Tom. What I would say is that we've talked a lot over the last couple years, about all of the tools that we've been building in the revenue management area. And, that we felt good, that they were gonna help us both in inflationary and deflationary times. And, I would just reiterate, is that a lot of those tools -- because, what we are seeing in some of these categories is fairly heavy inflation, in a couple of the ones that Joel highlighted -- meat, poultry, dairy. And so, what they really allow us to do is, effectively, pass on the pricing where we can, but do it in a balanced way, such that our customers aren't feeling significant impacts, over the short-term, as well. So, it's really a matter of, week by week, providing our salespeople the right information, insight, and guidance, on how to, basically, price to be competitive in the marketplace. Okay, and then, maybe, as a follow-up. When you look at what needs to be done at Breaks, right, and I know you've obviously made some management changes, there. If you think about the two or three things that Sysco can bring to Brakes, in terms of best practice sharing, what are they, and what is the margin opportunity at Brakes today, when you look at the delta, versus where you guys sit in the US? So, I assume, let's start with margin. When you talk about margin, you're probably talking about gross margin, and generally speaking, the gross margin in Europe tends to be higher than what it is in the US. But, their cost structures tend to be a little higher, as well, which ultimately affects the operating margin. A lot of the activity that we started to share, they have their own kind of category margin approach and program. But, we're starting to share more information between the European team and the US team, around how we might think about that process, going forward. So, there could be some benefits regarding the product costs. But, I'd say the bigger areas are, probably, around how we leverage some of the solutions we've built around the sales model, here. We've talked over the last couple of years, about the solutions that we've built out, whether it be things like business review, or the revenue management capability, or even how we think about building out the branded portfolio, our Sysco brand. And, those all remain, I think, opportunities for us to help leverage some of that learning we've had in the US, and share those best practices in Europe. And, we've started that process already, with that team. And, Tom, if I could just add one other thing to that -- this is Joel. I think the supply chain piece is probably the other part that I would just add to that. I think a lot of these -- just some of the investments that we've talked about that we continue to make, are around continuing to enhance their transformational work on the supply chain side, as well as, again, to kind of chiefly around putting some of those best practices in place. So, I think, just to add one other thing to Tom's point, I think I would -- the other part I would single out as an opportunity for us. Okay, thank you. And then, Bill, congratulations on your retirement. Thank you, John. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelley, with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Yeah, hi, good morning, guys. And, Bill, good luck in the future, as well. So, I just wanted to start on SG&A, particularly within the food service side of the business. It was certainly higher than what we were expecting, up 3.2%, on basically 30 basis points of case growth. Can you just provide more color on the impacts, here? How much did the hurricane actually hurt that line item? The bad debt expense, that you mentioned, on the comparison side, what did that mean? And then, can you talk about diesel costs and the impact that that had in the quarter, as well? Yeah, sure, this is Joel, I'm gonna start. I think a couple parts of that. Number one, there was some impact on our cost per case, as it relates to getting what I'll just call overall productivity, in other words. And, there certainly is, as part of that, there are admin costs, that we continue to pay, where we're not shipping case volumes in those areas, so that would have a negative impact on that leverage. From a bad debt perspective, a lot of that's related to some actually positive bad debt results we had in the prior year, that were, I would say, significant, relative to what would be normal for us. So, when that comparison hits, it actually elevates what would be a growth in our admin costs for this year on that side of it. I think there are a couple of other pieces of that, again, certainly from a segment perspective. What I've talked about mostly relates to the US side, we certainly did have some higher levels of expense growth, in our international business. So much we talked about -- there's some start-up costs, for a new customer in Mexico, and some investment costs that we've put into the UK, again. All of that now is actually factored into our cost structure. Which would not have been something we've been used to seeing as much last year, because we'd always talked about x-breaks, obviously, this includes all that. And so, I would say those are really some of the primary callouts, and again, the hurricane, again, did have some productivity impact, there. Without a doubt. But, I think there's still a collection of a few things, we still feel good about our ability to manage cost minimums going forward. The other thing you mentioned was fuel. And so, we're at about a penny detriment on fuel, versus prior year. And, to build out the cost comments that Joel made, from an operating perspective, when you think about the way we run our business, and the impacts of some of the storms, we still are, basically, paying all of our associates, drivers, warehouse, etc., without any case activity, during those times. And so, that's what drove some of that incremental expense, from an operating perspective, as well. Okay, great. And then, just one follow up. Profit per case on US food service has been really strong the last -- well, it's been strong for a while. But, the last couple of quarters seem notably strong. Can you just talk about that acceleration and the momentum? And then, how does that change, over the next few quarters, as you have some new business coming in? So, Ed, I think you're talking about gross profit per case, yeah. So, and it's a really good question, given the inflationary environment we're experiencing. So, we continue to see our gross profit per case improve, even though, obviously we're not seeing margin expansion, during this time of inflation. So, we continue to feel good about that. It's a combination of things. That's the category management effort we've had going. We talked earlier about the increase in Sysco brand, another 82 basis point improvement with our local customers. Which is, again, as you think about the challenges on inflation we're seeing, our ability to give customers options, including Sysco brand, and help them maintain their costs, while also delivering improved margins for us is kind of a win-win in there. And so, as we see our case volume increase, we would actually expect to see us continue to be able to manage that accordingly. And so, we do feel like you're going to see some improvements there, predominantly in this multiunit side, as we continue to go forward, throughout the year. Great, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania, with BMO Capital. Your line is open. Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to elaborate a little further on the international comments. I think you mentioned some further softness expected in 2Q, but an improvement in the second half, did I hear that correctly, and can you elaborate on that? Yeah, Kelly, I mean, I think, again, as I talked about, some of this is really related to what I'll call some timing elements, of the fact that the previous fiscal year with Breaks was on a calendar basis. And, just, essentially, moving that now, to where their fiscal year aligns with our fiscal year, does cause some changing of the way some things are recognized. And so, I think, from a timing perspective, again, that impact is gonna most notably, hit us in the second quarter, which again, used to be the final quarter of their calendar year. And, again, but certainly, we will expect some level of pickup in that, in the second half of our year. Okay, and the other question I wanted to ask was just on the corporate, multiunit trends, you continue to expect those to improve, I think starting next quarter. Can you quantify the magnitude of that there, and is this a positive or a negative for gross margin, within the US food service? So, I guess to look at it from a high level, Kelly, it's definitely -- the trend is gonna improve, OK? So, what's been going on, as we've talked, we've been very thoughtful about the way we approach the multi-unit segment of our business, and we have had, obviously, some situations over the last year, where we've not renewed some business or lost some business, there. So, what we now are getting ready to do is, lap some of that, as we go into Q2, and we have picked up a couple of new customers, as well. And so, the combination of those things will, in fact, improve the multiunit sales trends that we've been seeing for the last three to four quarters. As far as gross margin, obviously, overall, that business is a lower margin than our local customers. As far as us sharing a specific number with you, it'd be really difficult for us to do that. But, you certainly will expect, as we get overall customer growth volume going, that there'll be some benefits to the gross profit dollar line, and it could have some impact on margin. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi, with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hey, good morning guys. Thanks very much for taking my question, and Bill, of course, best of luck to you, in the next chapter, here. Thank you, Vince. Absolutely. Just wanted to, I guess first, just going back to inflation. Just to kinda get your sense, versus what you guys were expecting, heading into the quarter. Obviously, 3.8% was a bit above probably most of our estimates, on the line, here. Just wanted to see, versus your internal expectations, and if any changes have happened since. And, I know you mentioned there's been some kind of changes, where you can promote some of your private label. Has that been a kind of a meaningful change, with the higher inflation? Well, here, let me take the first part of your question, and I'll have Tom chime in on the other. I think -- it's Joel. I mean, I would say that the level that we've seen, here in Q1, I'd say it's fair to say it's higher than we anticipated. And, I guess I would say that the speed to which it actually happened in a few of the categories we called out was, I'd say, something that happened faster than we anticipated. But, I think, at the end of the day, certainly, as Tom pointed out, I think some of the things that we've done, in particular, Redman and Catman certainly provided us with the tools and resources, and certainly, provide our sales team with the opportunity to manage this fairly well. And, again, I certainly -- as somebody called our earlier, the fact that our US broadline, our US food service, excuse me, in second, was relatively flat from a margin perspective, I think is pretty strong, relative to where -- despite, again, as you pointed out, things that happened probably faster than we anticipated. You wanna add anything to that? Yeah, the only thing I wanna add, Vinnie is that, obviously, we continue to see some inflation, for at least the balance of the calendar year. There are some things, like produce, that we think might be impacted more, given the recent fires in California. So, there are gonna be some continued areas we're gonna have to deal with. And, again, as we talked in the first question, I think we feel good about the tools we've got in place to manage through this. But, as Joel said, these categories that move fairly quickly, and fairly aggressively, is where we run into the biggest challenge, and we'll just need a little time to maneuver around that and work through it. But, I think we're doing a pretty good job. Okay, great, very helpful. And then, just a fast question on the international side, and I'm sure we'll get more color in December. But, just around Breaks, it seems like the UK is more of the macro issues there Would you say, though, that kind of the basis of the business now, with just over a year into the integration here, has been going relatively according to plan, and maybe just if there's any changes, in any of the regions, more just on a competitive front, or pretty much in line with your expectations. So, I would say it's relatively as we had expected, and on plan. Now, having said that, we are making investments over there, as we've talked. The transformation efforts in the UK continue. We're looking to make some other investments in some of the other parts of Europe, including France. And so, I think we continue to believe that it's a great business and one we see lots of potential out of. But, there are some things we need to get in place, and operating the way we want, to get that type of growth in the future. The only other thing we already talked about, with the UK in particular, and some of the macroeconomic challenges they have. The inflation there, driven by the currency issues, are significant. So, 9% inflation is a massive number, and we are seeing impacts from that, and we see that, unfortunately, continuing for some period of time, here. So, I'd say that's the only other piece of this, that's different than what I would say we hoped or expected. Obviously, with Brexit happening, we knew there was going to be some impacts, but it's sustained at fairly high levels, for quite a while now. Okay, very helpful. Best of luck guys. Thanks Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short, with Barclays, your line is open. Hi, good morning. It's Ryan Gilligan, on for Karen, and thanks for taking the questions. Did you say what operating profit was, excluding Breaks? We're just trying to get to what the three-year incremental profit is now, and by rough math, it seems like you're up to $460 million. So, you would need to generate almost $200 million the rest of this year, to get to the high end. Does that sound right? Yeah, so, this is Joel. I mean, we actually, if you wanted to take it dollars x Breaks, we added $52 million operating income dollars -- again, x Breaks. And so, that takes us to a total of $469 million, for now, the nine quarters of the three-year plan. Got it, and would the $50 million VNA benefit contribute toward the plan, as well? Yes. Yes, and that's gonna be spread evenly across the four quarters of the year. Got it, and on tax reform. If it's passed, and corporate rates are lowered, what are your views on whether or not incremental profit dollars will drop to the bottom line, versus get competed away? Well, yeah. First of all, to speculate on anything coming out of Washington right now's a little bit interesting. But, I think that -- look, we're a company where, obviously, a large percentage of our profits are in the United States, and just based on that fact, it certainly seems like a positive opportunity for us. I think, in terms of passing some of that along, I -- to be honest with you, I get asked this question, but I don't know that a lot of customers spend a whole lot of time thinking about the correlation of prices and tax reform, necessarily. So, I don't personally anticipate that being a significant issue, either way, as relates to this. But, certainly, again, overall, from our company's perspective, again, were that to happen, I think there's some positive opportunities for us. That's helpful, thank you. And, congratulations, Bill. Thank you, Ryan. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hey, good morning. Just on the private label, or brand penetration itself. If you think about it, in the next three to five years, in both broadline and mobile, where do you think that ultimate penetration goal could go? And, maybe within that context, when you guys're having your conversations with your suppliers, how are those discussions going these days? Do you feel like maybe you're able to receive some greater concessions out of them if they're not necessarily providing innovative, or value-added products? Chris, from a Sysco brand perspective, as you know, we've continued to see this grow over the last couple of years, and our total business was up 62 basis points, and 82 basis points with our local customers. So, we continue to see opportunities there, and we get asked often, how high could it go? And, I don't think we really have a good view of that, and the reason I say that is, what we continue to focus on is, bringing very high-quality products to the market, at very competitive pricing. And, I think, as our customers continue to feel different impacts, whether that's the cost of labor, wage rate increases, or other challenges that might be on their business, product cost's always gonna be there, and we bring them alternative solutions with Sysco brand. So, the other thing we've done, we've talked about, is we've been focused on bringing innovative solutions and products with Sysco brand, to the market. And, I think the combination of those things continues to be well-received by our customers, and that's why we see these increases. So, I know that doesn't answer you directly, but what I say is, we continue to invest here, we feel good about it. I talked about this brand revitalization effort. We've been doing a lot of work around refreshing the look and the feel of those brands, and making sure that they're on trend, whether that's with fresh, local products, or that's with the right types of products. Whether that be organic, or wholesome type products. So, we're doing a lot of work in that area, and it appears to be resonating nicely with our customers. Alright, and the last one for me, very quickly. In terms of RIP, in the quarter, as you calculate it with and without Breaks, what were the numbers for those? Yeah, the number, I think, in aggregate, was 12.3%, as an overall enterprise. Actually, Chris, off the top of my head, I don't have that number, without Breaks. That's OK, we can follow up I'll get back to you on that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan, with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Morning, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on the US broadline's business. And, when you exclude inflation and case guards, it looks like there were some other negative pricing impacts to US broadline sales growth? So, can you just give us a little bit more detail on this, and was it related to an inability to pass through all the inflation, or was it a decision by Sysco to get sharper on pricing, or was it a more competitive environment, just, more color there would be great. Hey, Marisa, I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to. I think we feel really good about the US broadline business, and we talked about it in context here, of our US foodservice operations segment. And, given, we talked about some of the impacts of the storms, on both volume and on gross profit dollars, and, obviously, the impacts on cost, as well. So, I think, when you think about everything that that business went through in this first quarter, we continue to feel very good about how we're managing it, including some pretty significant inflation, in the quarter. So, the fact that we're basically flat on our gross margin, given all those circumstances, we feel, actually, very good about that business. Okay, and are you at the point where you're getting any pushback on your ability to pass inflation onto customers, now that it's close to 4%? Again, I'd say, as we always talked, that's an average. So, category by category, sure, we run into some challenges from time to time, and that's where we leverage things like Sysco brand. And, generally, we share a lot of information with our customers. So, this isn't about just us moving our pricing. We share a lot of industry information with them, what's going on in the various categories. And, why the costs are going up from suppliers, the way they are. So, we're pretty transparent in that area, and we try to spend a fair amount of time educating our own people, so they can, obviously, educate our customers. And, one other thing I'd say, Marisa, again, we had -- despite all those things, we still had a very strong local case stroke as well. So, when you combine some of that with, again, holding a flat margin during this time, I can overall, certainly, on a customer by customer basis, could there be some pushback? Sure. But, I think, overall, we've done a really good job, there. Got it, and just last thing, why don't you give us just a little bit more color on the sales performance in your non-restaurant customer, and how you're thinking about sales and margin opportunities within that segment? Now, when you say non-restaurant customers, are you talking about other segments within - Well, it'd be like, hospitals, schools. Kinda the institutional customers. We feel good about them. I think we continue -- we're fortunate that we've got this broad segment, that we operate in. Customer segments and our mix is such that while restaurants certainly represent a big chunk of it, there are lots of other customer segments. As we've talked in the past, we see growth in areas like the food service management. And also, in the retail food service. So, I think that the other segments continue to grow. Healthcare's always been a pretty good-sized segment for us, and we are performing well there, also. So, I think we feel great about the balance that exists across the segments, and I'd like to mention, other than making some decisions around certain multi-unit customers, we feel really good about where we are. Thanks so much, and best of luck, Bill. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse, with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Hi, one quick housekeeping one. Could you give us a quick idea of what the blended interest rate on your debt was, this quarter? Yeah, Karen, we'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, and then, looking at some of your commentary earlier about seeing strength in brands that are familiar, convenient, value. Is that really a comment on maybe some strength in fast food, relative to casual dining as a category, with what you're seeing in your customers? I think it's commentary, not necessarily on fast food, but on independent restaurants, and what we continue to believe is why they are positioned well to grow. And so, they're -- obviously, more flexible menus, more ease of creating the right environment for consumers. So, it has more to do with just acknowledging that there are lots of things still happening in that restaurant space, and these newer concepts, whether they're independent, or small, kinda multiunit chains, they are continuing to see growth, because they're bringing the kind of things that consumers are looking for to the market. And then, one other quick housekeeping. Are there any calendar shifts we should be thinking about, into the next quarter, with Christmas switching -- moving off of the weekend? And then, also, I think you lose New Year's Eve, compared to last year. Yeah, Karen, I would say we wouldn't anticipate anything significant, there. Alright, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Woolf, with Booth Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thanks, good morning. First, Bill congrats on your career, and best of luck with everything. Thank you, I appreciate it. So, I think, Tom, in your introductory comments, it sounded like x-hurricane, the US business accelerated a little on the case side and was a little better on the gross margin side. So, first, just to kind of check that, if you take the markets that were not impacted by the hurricanes, was the case growth, in fact -- the local case growth, over 3%? Yes, in many cases, it was. Okay, but in total? I mean, I'm just trying to get some real -- because, obviously, estimates are one thing, and then there's other ways to sort of guess. I guess, another way I wanna ask it is, it's sorta related. So, how are these hurricane markets doing, post-hurricane? There's a lot of different theories, some are, people are pent up, and they wanna go out to eat, others are, is that they're close. People are moving. Are those markets normalizing, and are they running decently? Yeah, I would say, actually, it's a couple of key geographies, right? So, whether it's here in the southeast, where there are restaurants that are still closed, or in parts of Florida, like the Keys, where many things are still closed, much of the market is starting to get back to a normalized state. So, I would say yes, in general. Okay, and related to that, the math, if you just took the math of what you said, it looked like the $10 million hurricane impact to the operating profits really came out of the case side, in the gross profits. But, it also sounded like, from what Joel, some of your commentary, it might've also been in the op-x side, which I also would've expected, you know. So, could you talk a little about that $10 million? Is it kind of a hard estimate, or how did you get to that? Well, so, look. I get it. It's high level, it's ballpark, it's directional. I think, again, reasonably accurate. We looked at it mostly along the lines of, as you said, from a volume and gross profit impact. Certainly, from a productivity impact. Again, as we described it earlier, it's interesting. Our costs, to some extent, didn't go up, if you wanna call it that, because we had -- we were paying people, again, whether it was drivers, whether it was administrative people, we're paying them, regardless of whether we were shipping cases or not. And so, I would say, in general, from a productivity standpoint, on a per-case basis, we actually had some impact there. So, again, Andy, it's not an exact science, but we certainly got what we thought was a pretty reasonable view of it. Where we quantified it mostly was on the gross profit piece of that. And, probably maybe a little conservative on our part, but we thought it was a reasonable deal, what happened. And, that was all based on case volume, right? We didn't project any impact on a rate basis, on gross profit per case, we just looked purely at cases. You asked about the 3%. We think that's a fairly conservative estimate, given what our run rates were in those markets. Got it, thank you. And, just wanted to follow up on Breaks, so my last question is, just as you look -- Joel, you mentioned you're recognizing and harmonizing the fiscal years, and that obviously has some tweaks to it. But, is most of the slowing from just what's going on there, with the cost inflation and consumer fundamentals side, with what's going on in the UK? Or, how would you apportion it, between accounting reconciliations, and a little fundamental slowing, or some fundamental slowing? I'll start, and Tom can chime in. I'd say, Andy, it's really sort of both. Again, I think what I would say to you is that some of the timing issue's going to become more accelerated in the second quarter, which is why we're calling that out, which, again, will then rebound to some extent, in the second half of the year. But, I would say, for this particular quarter, it was some of both. And, I don't have anything really incremental to add. I mentioned earlier some of the other impacts, as you mentioned, from inflation, and some of the macros in the UK. Okay, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Will Kirk, with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thank you, could you talk a little bit about the rationale for the recent deals off mainland US? You gave some details on HSM, but how do you think about this deal, and the completion of the Costa Rica stake, versus opportunities that would be kind of more in and around your core or existing infrastructure? Let me -- I'll talk about those two, and then I'll let Joel kind of embellish on kind of our broader strategy, there. Let's start with the mica, in Costa Rica. So, as I mentioned, that was a business that we went into a joint venture with, back in 2014, we feel great about the partnership that we've had with the folks at Mica, and, as I shared, the results have been very positive, over the last couple of years. So, we exercised our option to, basically, acquire that business completely, recently. And so, that's an example of where we started down a path with a partner and liked the way it progressed, them leveraging what they could from Sysco, and obviously, them doing a great job in their marketplace. Separate that from HFM, which is just an outright acquisition, in a market within the US, that's been white space for us. Other than some export business into Hawaii, we don't really have much of a footprint. We had no footprint there, and we didn't really do a lot of business there, so it's a whitespace opportunity for us that we're very excited about. They're a terrific distributor, with businesses on a lot of the islands, and we're really excited about what we can do together, in Hawaii. As far as other types of acquisition, I'll let Joel talk a little bit about how we think about it, and where you might see us focusing. Yeah, I think the way I would characterize it, I mean, it's a little bit coincidental, I would say, in terms of timing, that we had two acquisitions we announced that were both on islands, here. But, I think, in general, I would tell you that our overall strategy, around M&A, those are both very consistent with that. We're very -- continue to be very focused on opportunities within our own domestic and core markets, or areas that might supplement our existing businesses, as well as geographic expansion. And so, I would just say, again, the timing probably a little coincidental on those two things. But, our acquisition strategy has remained very consistent, and those two deals are very much a part of our overall strategy. Thank you, that's it for me. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Shane Higgins, with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Yeah, good morning. Just a question, and some clarification here, on how the local case volume trends were during the quarter, in the markets that weren't impacted by the hurricanes. Did those accelerate throughout the quarter? Shane, did they accelerate? Think about this, we break our USO into six markets. And so, as you guys know, different things drive the business in different markets. Not the least of which is overall population growth, economic impact. So, as we said earlier, we saw good growth outside of those other markets, generally speaking, in the US. And so, we feel pretty comfortable with the numbers we've shared, regarding the impact due to the hurricane, in primarily, what we call our south, and southeast markets. Okay, thanks for that, and how are case volumes trending, 2Q, to date? We continue to feel very good about the growth we've had in both local and, as I mentioned, change in multiunit. Okay, great, thanks. I just had a question on the -- you guys called out some challenging inbound freight environment. Could you just give a little bit of color on what changed there, during the quarter, and what you guys are doing to mitigate these headwinds? Yeah, I would just -- I'll take that, it's Joel. I would just say, in general, the way to think about it is that there's some level of shortage of drivers of inbound freight, and that's something that was happening somewhat prior to the hurricane, and that got accelerated by the bad weather. So, lots more sheetrock being moved, and I would say, carriers are taking the opportunity to move more expensive loads, that doesn't always necessarily -- that pitches supply on our side. And so, that was something, again, at the end of the day, our product costs -- basically, the cost of our products, plus the cost of inbound freight. There's some increases there, from an inbound freight perspective. And, certainly, that's something, as we move forward, continuing to find ways to mitigate -- it has continued somewhat here, and as we move into this quarter. Okay, great, and then, congratulations, Bill. That's it for me, thanks Thank you very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain, with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open. Yeah, hi, good morning. Bill, I also wanted to say congratulations, and wish you good luck in your retirement. Thank you. Now that you've anniversaried Breaks, would it be possible to break out the actual currency impact, both in terms of revenues and operating profit? Maybe you already mentioned that earlier, and I might've missed it, but it would be nice to get a sense of the actual operating performance in international, after stripping out the currency impact. Especially for the markets that Breaks operates in. So, if you can comment on case trends for international, and also, the overall currency impact, that would be great. I'm assuming that you can track those things a lot more easily, now that you've cycled Breaks. Yeah, so Ajay, sort of breaking it out specifically, again, we don't typically do that. Here's what color I would give you, though. And, actually, in general, the impact of foreign exchange, overall for us, has been relatively negligible for this quarter. So, there's -- some of the stuff we talked about, that Tom referred to, in terms of the weakness of the sterling, really has played itself out in the selling margins. Because there's a fairly sizable percentage of products in the UK, that are bought outside of the UK, which impacted the selling margins. But, if you actually look at the overall impact of foreign exchange, again, the US dollar's been somewhat weaker out there, the Canadian dollar, as well as the Euro. And, there has been some impact where the sterling has continued to weaken. But, overall, on the top line, and certainly, on our operating income line, there's been a relatively minimal impact, overall, in foreign exchange. More on the top, than overall. But, again, not much of an operating income line, in the aggregate of everything. Okay, so, going forward, should we infer that you're not going to be breaking out the currency impact, based on the year over year comparison? Well, I guess what I'd say, in this particular case, since it was not significant, we didn't do it. If it's something really significant, we'll probably break it out. Okay, and just one follow up. In terms of the US local case growth, you've had a pretty impressive run now, in terms of local case volume. So, over the past couple of years, since the start of your three-year growth plan, has there been any noticeable shift, in terms of where that volume is coming from? At this point, are you selling more cases to existing customers, or is the local case growth coming more from new business? I'm sure you'll probably say it's a little of both, but if you can comment, that would be great. Sure. And, it is, obviously, both. We track both penetration, which means more sales to existing customers, as well as new, lost business. And, I would say, in each of those areas, they've continued to grow. In food service, and generally, new business is very important, because there are a fair amount of customers each year, that cycle, for various reasons. And so, it's a pretty good balance, actually, of both, though. And, I'd say the thing for us, that we've really tried to focus on, is penetration, because we believe that the more products and services we can provide a customer, obviously, that also provides more what we'd call maybe stickiness, or loyalty, from those customers. You heard me talk in the past about loyalty, and we continue to have a positive trend in our loyalty metrics, including about a 3-point improvement, in the first quarter. So, we feel good about what we're hearing from our customers, as far as what we're providing them. Great, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe, with JP Morgan, your line is open. Hi. I think, at this point, my question is limited to some comments that Tom made, and I think his prepared remarks, around not just the move toward healthy, local, organic, in terms of consumer preferences, which is pretty easily understood. But, also, the comment around convenience, low cost, and familiarity. I interpreted that either in terms of traditional fast food, which is obviously done very well, over this cycle. But, it could also mean things that aren't necessarily restaurants, like maybe convenience stores, or maybe other types of foodservice operations, that are more hybrid, in terms of what they're approach is. So, could you elaborate on that subsegment, and how big of an opportunity that is, relative to the business that you're currently serving? Sure. First of all, I think you articulated it, actually, pretty well, and so I think it was good to hear, that what we said was translated by you in the right way. I think there's some of this is certainly the retail segment that we've talked about. We do see it continuing to grow. But, the other segment that we all know is growing is this, I've come to think about it as prepared meals. And, this ability to get your -- whatever your favorite restaurant is, delivered to you now, versus either having to go there to dine in, or even go pick it up. And, we continue to see that movement happening, and there are lots of different folks getting into that space now. And, these prepared foods, that are both retail, but also, in many cases, food service outlets, that are handling that. And so, I think the more those folks continue to grow, that just provides more opportunities for our customers to grow, and for consumers to get access to things that they like and enjoy. And so, that, really, is what we were trying to refer to, there. Yeah, so that really sounds more independent restaurants and chains, or maybe that'll also include some smaller chains, in that segment. And, are you alluding to meal kits, as well? Or, is that a different segment than what you wanna be doing? Yes, to the first part of your question and comments, and sort of, meal kits? It's part of it, it's a very small segment. And, while I think it's still got some growth in it, as we've all seen, there's a lot of movement going on in that space, right now. I think what we're seeing though is, think about instead of someone like Blue Apron, where you're having to get something shipped to you, there are local outlets, that are accomplishing that same type of solution for customers, or for consumers, on a local level.

It is far from certain another bidder would step forward for such a large and complicated deal.

,11162017,Reuters,11092017,"The third-largest U.S. bank has now repaid about $10.2 million to roughly 860 service members and their co-borrowers for improper repossessions, under a settlement announced in September 2016. Other violations covered by that settlement were discovered more recently, leading to the latest payout, the Justice Department said. Wells Fargo was also fined $20 million in September 2016 by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in a related case. The OCC had cited the San Francisco-based lender for violations of the federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act from 2006 to 2016. It said the violations included exceeding a 6-percent interest rate cap on loans, failing to accurately disclose service members’ active duty status to courts, and failing to obtain court orders before conducting repossessions. In a statement, Wells Fargo spokeswoman Natalie Brown said the $5.4 million payout came “as part of our commitment to a comprehensive, ongoing account review process and as part of our consent order work.” Wells Fargo has for more than a year been addressing fallout from a variety of practices, including its creation of potentially millions of unauthorized customer accounts. In August, it agreed to pay the U.S. government $108 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuit accusing it of charging military veterans hidden fees to refinance mortgages, and concealing those fees when seeking federal loan guarantees.

 ,11162017,Reuters,11092017,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s chief financial officer said on Wednesday he is not worried that consumers are struggling to pay their debts. CFO John Shrewsberry, speaking at an industry conference, said banks have been very competitive in trying to get consumers to use their credit cards, but the easy availability of credit has not yet led to a meaningful rise in defaults. “That’s probably at the margin where excess leverage will show up. I don’t think it’s happened yet,” he said. Consumer defaults hit a multiyear high in May 2009 partly leading to the financial crisis, and have been roughly flat since May 2015, according to data from S&P/Experian. Since consumer credit moves in cycles and some lenders have become more aggressive, analysts are worried defaults could move higher. Wells Fargo has sharply cut back auto loans, and Shrewsberry said while the market “heats and cools on a daily cycle,” used car prices are “reasonable” so lenders’ losses will not be serious if consumers default. “I don’t think banks, incidentally, are going to get the worst if auto credit goes sideways. I think that will be finance companies more likely,” he said. Regarding mortgages, Wells Fargo is focused mainly on prime jumbo loans which are unlikely to default, while home equity loan activity is “very slow,” he said. Wells’ loan balances declined in the third quarter, but Shrewsberry said a sales scandal at the lender that erupted slightly more than a year ago has not changed its appetite for credit risk. Wells is still working to convince investors it has gotten past the scandal, which involved the creation of as many as 3.5 million fake accounts. Wells shares dipped 0.1 percent to $54. ","

 ,11162017,Reuters,11092017,"Increasing innovation in financial services has led to more partnerships and more risk events, which are increasingly sophisticated, according to Abel Clark CEO of TruSight and a former Thomson Reuters executive. “There really is a challenge here that is best responded to by a joined-up industry effort,” Clark said.    Financial institutions currently vet potential suppliers by sending them questionnaires with hundreds of questions. They then have to work with the supplier to be sure it understood the questions and provided accurate and detailed answers, according to Clark. The banks then have to verify the accuracy of the suppliers’ claims through various means, including onsite visits. It is an expensive and time-consuming process with immense potential for banks and suppliers to benefit by sharing best practices and avoiding duplication, Clark said. While TruSight currently has just four backers, Clark said “a small number” of other financial companies may be invited to invest in it in the future. Clark TruSight will begin working on behalf of clients early next year. Clark declined to disclose how much its backers have invested in the company. ","

 ,11162017,Reuters,11092017,"CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Republican tax bill helped soothe nerves in the municipal bond market on Friday, just over a week after the House of Representatives proposed changes that would decrease its future supply of tax-free debt. While House Republicans sought to remove federal tax exemption for private activity bonds (PABs), an outline of the Senate’s proposal released late on Thursday does not include that provision among its list of revenue raisers. “When the Senate’s plan came out with no change to the tax exemption for private activity bonds, I think it gave the market a chance to take a sigh of relief,” said Alan Schankel, a managing director at Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott. The termination of tax-exempt PABs in the House bill sent shock waves through the $3.8 trillion market after the Ways and Means Committee introduced it on Nov. 2. Almost $102 billion of the bonds, which are issued through states and local governments for economic development projects, airports, and nonprofits like hospitals, were sold in 2015, according to a recent report from Wells Fargo Securities. That accounted for 27 percent of overall long-term municipal debt sold that year. The House plan contends that eliminating the bonds will raise $38.9 billion for the federal government between 2018 and  2027. Analysts have questioned that figure, arguing that it was wrong for lawmakers to assume that PAB issuers would sell a similar amount of taxable bonds for their purposes under the House plan. “We feel more comfortable about (PABs’) future long term with the Senate bill,” said Tim Fisher, legislative and federal affairs coordinator for the Council of Development Finance Agencies, adding that his group plans to keep to keep up pressure on the House. But Emily Swenson Brock, director of the Government Finance Officers Association’s (GFOA) Federal Liaison Center, cautioned that amendments to the Senate bill were expected over the weekend and that the status of PABs will not be absolutely clear until the final legislation is released. The outline of the Senate bill is silent on other issuances the House measure would end, including tax-free debt for  professional sports stadiums and tax-credit bonds. Like the House bill, the Senate’s measure eliminates the alternative minimum tax. That tax is applied to earnings from a small percentage of muni bonds sold by issuers such as airports and housing authorities that have substantial private-activity components in their deals. Both proposals end tax-exempt status for advance refunding bonds, which issuers in the U.S. municipal bond market use to take advantage of lower interest rates before outstanding bonds can be called back from investors. The GFOA’s Brock said various groups are trying to explain to Congress that the practice is a big cost saver for state and local governments, schools and other issuers. In the meantime, issuers of the bonds are rushing to get deals done before year end, said Emilie Ninan, a bond lawyer and partner at Ballard Spahr LLP in Wilmington, Delaware. “I don’t think anybody should be taking comfort that this is a done deal,” Ninan said of the Senate plan that appears to be kinder to the muni market than the House proposal.

 ,11162017,Reuters,11092017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Underlying U.S. consumer prices increased in October on the back of a pickup in rents and healthcare costs, bolstering the view that a recent disinflationary trend worrying the Federal Reserve probably had ended. The rise in the consumer price index, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, reported by the Labor Department on Wednesday likely clears the way for the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates next month. October’s gain in the so-called core CPI, which measures underlying inflation pressures, could comfort Fed officials concerned that stubbornly low inflation may reflect not only temporary factors but also more persistent developments. “The Fed has struggled this year in determining if the slowdown in core inflation has been due to a confluence of one-offs or more persistent disinflationary forces,” said Sarah House, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. “The pickup clears the way for a December rate hike and supports the case for continued tightening in the year ahead.” The core CPI rose 0.2 percent in October, also lifted by increases in the cost of used cars and trucks, tobacco, wireless phone services, airline fares, education and motor vehicle insurance. It edged up 0.1 percent in September. October’s gain lifted the year-on-year increase in the core CPI to 1.8 percent. The year-on-year core CPI had increased by 1.7 percent for five straight months. Last month, owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence climbed 0.3 percent, quickening after September’s 0.2 percent increase. The cost of hospital services were up 0.5 percent and prices for doctor visits rose 0.2 percent. Economists said the increase in healthcare costs suggested the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, probably rose 0.2 percent in October, which would snap five straight monthly 0.1 percent gains. That would raise the year-on-year increase in the core PCE price index to 1.4 percent from 1.3 percent in September. “It appears the inflation rut that took hold in the spring may finally be behind us,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. The core PCE price index has consistently undershot the Fed’s 2 percent target for more than five years. The central bank has lifted borrowing costs twice this year and has projected three rate increases in 2018. The government will publish core PCE price index data later this month. The dollar .DXY was little changed against a basket of currencies after an earlier slide, while prices for Treasuries were trading mostly higher. Stocks on Wall Street fell amid declining oil prices and concerns over the fate of a proposed U.S. tax overhaul in Congress. Overall consumer prices, however, rose marginally in October as the boost to gasoline prices from hurricane-related disruptions to Gulf Coast oil refineries was unwound. The CPI nudged up 0.1 percent last month after jumping 0.5 percent in September. That lowered the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 2.0 percent from 2.2 percent in September. Low inflation is, however, helping to underpin consumer spending. In a separate report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said retail sales increased 0.2 percent last month as heavy price discounting by automobile manufacturers buoyed purchases of motor vehicles. Data for September was revised to show sales jumping 1.9 percent, which was the largest gain since March 2015, rather than the previously reported 1.6 percent advance. Retail sales increased 4.6 percent on an annual basis. The slowdown in retail sales from September’s robust pace largely reflected an unwinding of the boost to building materials and gasoline prices after recent hurricanes.    Receipts at auto dealerships increased 0.7 percent after soaring 4.6 percent in September, supported by the deep price discounting by manufacturers. Sales at gardening and building material stores fell 1.2 percent last month after surging 3.0 percent in September. Receipts at service stations decreased 1.2 percent in October. That followed a 6.4 percent gain in September. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.3 percent last month after climbing 0.5 percent in September. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Last month’s increase in core retail sales indicated a healthy pace of consumer spending at the start of the fourth quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2.4 percent annualized rate in the third quarter. “We expect strong fundamentals for consumer spending, including continued job gains, firming real wage growth, and the recent strength in household net worth, to support solid gains in retail sales over the coming months,” said Kathleen Navin, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers.

 ,11162017,Reuters,11092017,"If confirmed to head the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Joseph Otting would be one of the last major regulatory appointments by President Donald Trump. | Nick Ut/AP Joseph Otting's background has sparked a fierce backlash against the nomination from Senate Democrats. By VICTORIA GUIDA 11/16/2017 01:18 PM EST The Senate voted to confirm Joseph Otting as comptroller of the currency on Thursday, putting the former banker in charge of a regulator he once battled with over his firm's foreclosure practices. The vote was 54-43, with two Democrats voting in favor of President Donald Trump's nominee. Story Continued Below Otting was CEO of OneWest Bank, a lender co-founded by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that drew criticism over its handling of foreclosures after the financial crisis. The bank was scolded by its federal regulator in 2011 for not properly overseeing the loans of thousands of people at risk of losing their homes and was bound by a consent order for four years. Now, it will be Otting's job to punish such violations by national banks. His background has sparked a fierce backlash against the nomination from Senate Democrats. ""This Administration is putting the banking industry back in charge of policing itself,"" Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) tweeted during Otting's confirmation vote. ""Joseph Otting is yet another bank exec who profited off the financial crisis who is being rewarded by the Trump Administration with a powerful job overseeing our nation’s banking system.""

Still, Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) voted with Republicans on Thursday to confirm Otting. As head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Otting would be one of the last major regulatory appointments by Trump, a lineup that's likely to go much lighter on overseeing the nation's financial institutions and to peel back some post-crisis rules. Otting has not previously served in government. Like some of Trump's other appointees, his industry background is cause for celebration among congressional Republicans, who argue that bureaucrats and academics who have dominated the regulatory ranks have led to less practical policymaking. ""I actually find that refreshing, versus bureaucrats that just ride this escalator learning how to regulate, regulate, regulate more, so I think that’s a good thing, not a bad thing,"" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said of industry experience during Otting's confirmation hearing. By taking the reins of an agency deeply involved in supervising national banks, Otting — an alumnus of U.S. Bancorp, Union Bank of California and Bank of America — will be in a strong position to implement the regulatory rollback that Trump has promised will spur lending. But some of that work has already started this year under acting Comptroller Keith Noreika, who was brought in from a law firm to run the agency — an unusual setup since acting heads are usually drawn from the ranks of existing agency officials. Noreika used his temporary position to speak boldly about controversial topics, including suggesting that banks should be allowed to own non-financial companies, and vice versa, which would be a radical change to U.S. law. The chief of staff and chief counsel under former Comptroller Thomas Curry, an appointee of President Barack Obama, departed from the agency under Noreika, giving Otting the chance to fill those two top staff positions with his own people. Noreika also secured some concrete policy changes, such as making it easier for national banks to make small, short-term loans to customers who regularly receive direct deposits. That move is likely supported by Otting, who in his July confirmation hearing lamented that banks had been pushed out of the small-dollar lending sector. Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street — weekday mornings, in your inbox. By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. Otting also said during the hearing that the various layers of capital requirements imposed on banks are “highly complex” and need to be examined. But he had some praise for the regulatory work done after the crisis. “The regulatory system we have in place today has resulted in banks understanding their risks much better than they ever have, and we have better capital levels,” he said. “I am a believer in a well-capitalized banking system.” He mentioned his desire to ease regulations on community banks and emphasized the importance of improving financial access for lower-income and minority people, including to affordable housing. “A big concern is that a lot of people at the lower echelon ... are not qualifying for banking products and services. You have branches going away,” he said. “There needs to be a real focus of, how do we make banking available for the lower economic and ethnic people across America?” While Otting will probably continue in the same direction as Noreika on deregulation, with a five-year term ahead of him he will perhaps be more diplomatic, both with people outside the agency and within it. Noreika sparred openly with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray, another Obama appointee regarded by many Republicans as an overly aggressive regulator. That included issuing a report backing the ultimately successful Republican push in Congress to kill a CFPB rule that restricted financial companies from imposing mandatory arbitration on their customers to resolve disputes without class-action lawsuits. Cordray announced Wednesday he plans to step down from the CFPB by the end of the month. Noreika also took a top-down approach in dictating policy to staff, leading to a drop in morale at the OCC, according to sources close to the agency. “I believe the OCC’s greatest resource is its staff of highly trained, professional bank supervisors and support personnel,” Otting wrote to Brown after his hearing. Otting will once again work under Mnuchin, but only in the loosest sense. The OCC is an independent agency housed within Treasury, meaning that Otting has complete discretion over supervisory and enforcement matters but defers to the department on management-related issues. The new comptroller will now be required to divest a range of investments in financial companies. He will divest call options and unvested restricted stock units from CIT Group within 90 days of his confirmation, which will yield an accelerated $10.5 million payout, according to his June 23 ethics agreement. The former OneWest CEO kept those assets after his bank was bought in 2015 by CIT Group, which then terminated his employment. Missing out on the latest scoops?

 ,11162017,Reuters,11092017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices rose more than expected in October, driven by a surge in the cost of services, leading to the biggest annual increase in wholesale inflation in more than 5-1/2 years. Tuesday’s report from the Labor Department also showed steady gains in underlying producer prices, which supported expectations of a gradual increase in inflation and keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in December. “Reports that inflation is dead or too low are not true in every corner of the economy,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “It won’t be long before producers will be faced with having to raise the prices of consumer goods if inflation continues to percolate here.” The producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month after a similar gain in September. That lifted the year-on-year increase in the PPI to 2.8 percent, the largest rise since February 2012, from 2.6 percent in September. Economists had forecast the PPI edging up 0.1 percent last month and increasing 2.4 percent from a year ago. Last month’s rise in prices received by the nation’s farms, factories and refineries reflected a 0.5 percent surge in the cost of services, mostly margins received by wholesalers and retailers. Margins for fuels and lubricants retailing soared 24.9 percent, accounting for almost half of the increase in the cost of services last month. Services rose 0.4 percent in September. The rise in services helped to offset a 4.6 percent drop in the cost of gasoline. Wholesale gasoline prices spiked 10.9 percent in September in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas in late August and reduced refining capacity in the Gulf Coast area. Gasoline prices are falling amid ample crude oil supplies. The strong producer price readings probably did not translate into higher consumer prices in October as the correlation between the PPI and consumer price index has weakened. Still, firming inflation at the factory gate is likely to be welcomed by Fed officials who have long argued that price pressures were being held back by transitory factors. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy inflation measure tracked by the Fed has remained below the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target since mid-2012. Despite moderate price pressures, the Fed is expected to raise interest rates next month amid cautious optimism that tightening labor market conditions will spur faster wage growth next year. The Fed has hiked rates twice this year. “While not the primary measure of inflation, the consistent gradual improvement in producer prices over the past two years will be welcomed by Fed officials who, on balance, continue to express confidence in a gradually rising inflation outlook,” said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose, with traders awaiting October’s consumer inflation data on Wednesday, which is expected to show a marginal increase in consumer prices. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks slipped as declining oil prices hit energy stocks. Outside services, producer price increases were fairly broad last month. There were increases in the cost of pharmaceutical preparations, fresh and dry vegetables, meat and tobacco. Prices for passenger cars were, however, unchanged in October following the introduction of the 2018 models into the survey. A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent in October month, advancing by the same margin for three straight months. The so-called core PPI increased 2.3 percent in the 12 months through October after advancing 2.1 percent in September. Core goods prices increased 0.3 percent in October after a similar gain in the prior month.

Nathan Reiff,11162017,Investopedia,11092017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. increased its stock portfolio value by $16 billion this quarter, from $162 billion to $178 billion, according to a recent 13F filing. Buffett increased his holdings in Apple, Monsanto, and Synchrony Financial, and reduced his holdings in International Business Machines (IBM) and Charter Communications, according to a report by Seeking Alpha. When it comes to contemporary investors, few draw the same respect and admiration as Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway has been a giant of the business world for decades, and a recent 13F report suggests the company remains a major player, even as its CEO approaches 90 years of age. Warren Buffett has bought big into Apple (AAPL) over the past several quarters. In early 2017, he doubled his holdings. In the third quarter, he added a more modest amount to his holdings, increasing them by 3%. Buffett also augmented his position in food company Monsanto (MON). He added about 10% to his holdings over the previous quarter, although Monsanto maintains only 0.6% of Berkshire's total portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway added about 20% to its holdings in Synchrony Financial (SYF) during Q3, buying the stock at $28.50 to $31.25 a share. Synchrony occupies about 0.36% of Buffett's total portfolio as of the end of Q3. Buffett bought into IBM (IBM) in 2011, and has since increased his holdings by 40% by making periodic quarterly purchases. Then, beginning in Q1 of 2017, he began to sell off portions of the stock. This quarter saw a one-third reduction of the remaining shares, which were sold at prices ranging between $140 and $156 per share. In 2014, Berkshire bought into Charter Communications (CHTR), and the position is about 1.74% of the company's total portfolio of stocks. Buffett has moved up and down since then, alternately buying additional shares and trimming his holdings. This past quarter, he sold off about 10% of his shares. (See also: Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett Richer Than Poorest Half of U.S. Combined.) Warren Buffett is famous for his long-term investments and they apparently have not changed significantly over the latest third quarter. The top five positions in Berkshire's portfolio account for an astounding 60% of the assets invested. These include Wells Fargo (WFC), Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC), Apple, Coca-Cola (KO), and Bank of America (BAC). All together, Buffett held 43 individual stock positions at the end of the third quarter. Keep in mind, though, that 13F reports look backward, and some of these holdings are likely to have changed as of this writing. (See also: The Everyday Lives Of Frugal Billionaires.)

Michael J. Kramer,11162017,Investopedia,11092017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs (Note: The author of this fundamental analysis is a financial writer and portfolio manager. He and his clients own shares of GOOGL.) Investors have an infatuation with stocks that are out of shape in 2017. For example, take Coca-Cola Co. (KO), whose shares have rallied by nearly 14.5 percent in 2017, primarily in line with the S&P 500 Index's return of about 15 percent. But a recent Barron's article notes that Wells Fargo sees shares of the soft drink maker rising to $51, a level that would make Coca-Cola stock too expensive. In fact, even at current levels of $47, Coke shares are too expensive. There are plenty of ways to build an argument for why owning Coke is likely to return nothing but frustration. The core business operates in a segment that is out of favor and is unlikely to return to favor anytime soon. Wall Street consensus estimates show that Coke's revenue is expected to fall by 12.6 percent in 2018, to about $30.68 billion. Coke has seen revenue declining on a trailing 12-month basis since the fourth quarter of 2014. You have to ask yourself if you really want to own a company with falling revenue that's trading at 24 times one-year forward earnings at its current price of about $47.50. KO Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Would it not be better to own Facebook Inc. (FB), which is trading at 27 times one-year forward earnings and growing revenue at an expected rate of 32 percent? How about Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)? That's trading at 24 times earnings and has an expected revenue growth rate of 19 percent. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) trades at just 22 times forward earnings while growing revenue at 8 percent. Why even bother with Coke is the real question. KO PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts Some will argue that Coke comes with a dividend yield of 3.08 percent, which a good return in a low-interest rate environment. Meanwhile, a 10-year Treasury yields a rate of 2.35 percent. (See also: Why Dividend Stocks Are Killing Growth Stocks in 2017.) Then again, Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) generates a yield of 3.33 percent while its dividend has grow at a faster pace than Coke during the past five years. Cisco currently has a quarterly dividend of $0.29 versus Coke's $0.37. KO Dividend data by YCharts The one advantage to Coke is that its shares carry a lower beta, meaning they should less have volatility than the S&P 500 Index. But is that worth paying a growth-like multiple for a utility-like beta? National Grid PLC (NGG) carries a much lower beta than Coke while offering a much higher dividend yield. And it comes at a much cheaper earnings multiple. KO Beta (3Y) data by YCharts The market has a thing this year for out-of-shape of stocks like Coca-Cola. Just take a look at McDonald's Corp.

Mark Kolakowski,11162017,Investopedia,11092017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Investors should remain invested in equities and not get scared into selling by pullbacks in the market, according to strategists at Morgan Stanley (MS), as quoted by Bloomberg. In a detailed report of more than 40 pages, Morgan Stanley acknowledges that ""most major asset classes look rich versus history,"" but they add that ""equities can still get richer into end-of-cycle,"" per Bloomberg. Three factors typically send economies into recession and stock markets tumbling, Morgan Stanley says: excessive tightening of credit by central banks, large increases in debt, and extreme optimism among investors that former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once dubbed ""irrational exuberance."" Morgan Stanley does not see any of these three factors in place right now, Bloomberg says. Joseph Zidle of Bernstein Portfolio Advisors LLC, recently among the most bullish strategists, now expects excessive tightening by the Fed to be an inevitable recessionary trigger, though he adds that the bull market may have many more months left to run. Meanwhile, another prominent strategist, Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse Group (CS), expects the S&P 500 Index (SPX) to reach 2,875 in 2018, an advance of nearly 12% from its opening on November 15. (For more, see also: Get Ready For The Coming Bear Market and Recession.) Strategists at Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) remain bullish on equities, for a variety of reasons. Among these: December historically sees gains, including the so-called Santa Claus rally; all major world economies continue to grow; corporate profits are still rising; and the markets are habitually shrugging off political risks. (For more, see also: Charles Schwab Upbeat as Impact Conference Kicks Off.) Investors should be on the lookout for three leading indicators of a downturn in the economy and in equities, Morgan Stanley says. First, when the currencies of emerging market countries and key commodities peak in value versus the U.S. dollar, the S&P 500 tends to reach its own peak about seven to 10 months later. Second, credit spreads, or the difference in yield on U.S. Treasury debt and lower-quality bonds with similar maturities issued by corporate borrowers, tend to bottom out about four months before the U.S. stock market peaks. Third, declining measures of economic activity, such as manufacturing surveys, orders for durable goods, and average weekly hours worked, tend to precede an equity market peak by four to six months. Morgan Stanley suggests keeping some cash at the ready as a prudent measure right now. They also recommend that cautious investors shift their equity holdings into call options on the S&P 500 as a way to participate in further upside while capping the downside. They also recommend using a bear put spread options strategy on high yield debt as a hedge, Bloomberg indicates. (For more, see also: Stock Investors' Handbook for a Bear Market.) Meanwhile, publicly-traded stocks are becoming an increasingly scarce commodity, driving equity prices upward for this reason alone, the Financial Times reports. Share repurchases by U.S. corporations since the financial crisis have added up to a staggering figure of nearly $5 trillion, per the FT. According to research by S&P Global, the number of shares outstanding from S&P 500 companies is about the same as it was a decade ago, even as the index has almost doubled in value. Another factor driving scarcity is the growth of passive investing in index funds and ETFs​, the FT adds, citing analysis by Christopher Harvey at Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC). As these funds grow in size, they need to buy more of the equities in the market indexes that they track, removing yet more shares from general circulation. This only adds to the scarcity of equity shares in the open market, propping up their prices. Harvey sees a parallel with quantitative easing by central banks, which took government bonds out of the open market, thereby boosting their prices.

(ALLY) paid $275 million last April to acquire TradeKing, betting that it can make a splash in self-directed online trading, particularly with millennials. And while the robo-advisory market is becoming crowded, Alley Invest thinks that – with its acquisition completed and TradeKing integrated into the business, along with its parent's online banking capabilities – it will resonate with younger investors who haven't signed up with a robo-advisor just yet. ""We've spent pretty much the last 12 months integrating TradeKing into Ally and rebranding TradeKing,"" said Rich Hagen, the former president of TradeKing who now heads up Ally Invest, in an interview earlier this fall. ""If you happen to have a bank account with Ally, we'll show you side-by-side your bank account alongside your investment account and you can drill down or you can move money between the two. We've done a nice job at kind of integrating the client experience from an entity perspective."" [Ready to start investing? Use Investopedia's broker reviews to find brokers that fit your needs.] To say that the robo-advisor market is getting crowded is an understatement. In addition to the discount brokers including Charles Schwab, E*Trade and TD Ameritrade, traditional financial firms such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo have entered the space. They are all courting millennials, who are becoming the next millionaires as Baby Boomers age. These younger workers are also saving more and are preparing for retirement even if it's decades away. According to a recent LendEDU survey of 502 millennials who are saving for retirement on an ongoing basis, 53.59% said they aren't using a financial advisor to help them invest. That compares with 46.41% that are working with a financial advisor. While only 24.30% of survey respondents said that they are using robo-advisors, it's not for a lack of willingness. A majority – 61.58% – said they haven't used one because they didn't know that this type of investing advice existed. That presents an opportunity, particularly for those that are embracing the things millennials want such as technology, which is a strong suit of Ally. For example, Ally Bank announced this week that it created an Amazon Alexa skill for its mobile banking clients. With it, customers can check their bank accounts via voice. While Alley Invest has not yet announced anything on that front, it is not a stretch to assume that the Alexa skill will make its way to Ally's online investing platform as well. ""What's interesting is on the banking side, 55% of new customers are millennials. Our Ally Invest portfolio is over 25% millennial,"" Hagen said in that fall interview.

Under the new plan, brokers can earn extra cash if certain criteria are met, including referring at least two customers to other Bank of America Merrill Lynch products such as Merrill Edge, its online self-directed investing platform.

Take a look at Investopedia's online broker reviews first.] The move on the part of Bank of America Merrill Lynch to include customer referrals in its bonus incentive comes at a time when all of the major investment firms are eyeing the robo-advisor market as the next bastion of growth. With low-cost, self-directed investing resonating among all types of investors, particularly millennials, Wall Street is responding by launching online services. Merrill Edge has been around for a decade now, but last February, the company launched its Merrill Edge Guided Investing online advisory platform, which provides expert advice along with the ability to invest online. In a recent interview, Aron Levine, head of Merrill Edge, said that the DIY online trading business has $166 billion in assets and more than 2.3 million accounts. What's more, he said a survey conducted by the financial firm found that one in eight Americans, or 13%, are using a robo-advisor or would consider using one. That increased to 22% when millennials were polled. Those that use an online platform to invest said that it makes them feel more empowered, investment savvy and knowledgeable. With millennials becoming an important revenue generator for Wall Street, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) has also entered the robo-advisor space. Earlier this week, the embattled San Francisco-based bank announced the nationwide launch of Intuitive Investor, an online investment platform that blends technology with human advice to give customers access to low-cost investing.

The Baltimore-based athletic apparel and footwear maker has seen its shares tank by 58.8% this year, compared to the S&P 500’s 15.9% rally over the same period, as it struggles to boost sales and revive its brand identity. (See also: Under Armour's Decline Is Warranted: Wells Fargo.) Analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group lowered their 12-month price target on UAA this week to $11 from $15, yet upgraded the stock to neutral. While a rebrand aimed at transforming Under Armour into more of an fashionable luxury sports apparel company could turn things around significantly, analysts Sam Poser, Renato Basanta and Will Gaertner expect weakness in North America to outweigh those gains. Downside is limited following UAA’s near 30% post-earnings crash, as the Street is already bracing itself for poor results in the foreseeable future after Chief Executive Officer Kevin Plank’s commentary on North America challenges, wrote the analysts, noting that UAA seems to be “somewhat cognizant of its recent mistakes.” “However there has been no clear-cut evidence that UAA is willing to pull back distribution,” wrote the Susquehanna analysts. The investment bank highlighted the importance of Under Armour’s North American business as it makes up 80% of the company’s revenues and fell 12% in the third quarter of 2017. Despite progress, the analysts believe that “the root of UAA’s problems in North America come from the company’s inability to elevate and/or protect the Under Armour brand,” and that the athleisure​ player needs “to do an extraordinary amount of work to restore the band to its former affordable luxury status.” (See also: Under Armour Is in ‘Growth Purgatory’: Bernstein.)

Stephanie Landsman,11162017,CNBC,11092017,"With just about seven weeks left until the end of the year, Wells Fargo Securities has just raised its year-end S&P 500 target to reflect what its top equity strategist calls a quantitative easing-type phenomenon gripping stocks. Christopher Harvey, the firm's head of equity strategy, is seeing the rising popularity of index funds and ETFs changing the dynamics of the bull market. He contends these passive investing instruments have been creating upward pressure on stock prices, and that's been a major reason why stocks have rallied so sharply in 2017. ""It's very similar to QE."" Harvey said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""With QE, you took a certain part of the Treasury market out of circulation. Now what you're doing is you're taking a good part of the equity market out of circulation, and you're upsetting the supply and demand dynamics. There are fewer natural sellers.""

He acknowledges Wells Fargo's initial forecast was ""too conservative"" and the year has been exceeding expectations. According to Harvey, there's still momentum in place for stocks to grind higher. ""No one wants to be the first one out of the pool. No one wants to de-risk at this point in time,"" Harvey added. ""You have this mindset of FOMO — fear of missing out."" But that's Harvey's short-term forecast, and it shouldn't be confused with 2018. He's making it clear that investors will see fewer milestones as the markets get more expensive and risks grow. ""Inertia is becoming the most powerful force in the capital markets. A body of motion tends to stay in motion. And, that for us is a big concern. We want to see people more paranoid,"" Harvey said.

The media giant reported weaker-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Thursday. It generated earnings per share of $1.07 versus the $1.12 Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. But analysts got excited after the company said it would price its upcoming streaming service ""substantially below"" Netflix during the earnings conference call. The stock rose 3 percent Friday morning. ""We finally got some glimpse into pricing ... to convert Disney's 'gigantic' customer base into subs – with pricing likely to move higher as more and more content is added,"" Wells Fargo analyst Marci Ryvicker wrote in a note to clients Friday. ""Given how just about all of our stocks tend to trade on sub numbers, we view this strategic comment as an incremental positive."" Disney announced plans in August to launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 and an ESPN streaming service in 2018. Ryvicker reiterated her outperform rating and $116 price target for Disney shares. In similar fashion, Goldman Sachs is bullish on Disney's upcoming ESPN streaming offering. Disney's ""EPS growth is poised to accelerate reflecting a bigger and better film slate (2 Star Wars, 4 Marvel, 2 PIXAR) with ample consumer products opportunities, tailwinds from new attractions (Avatar in Orlando, Toy Story Land in Orlando and Shanghai), and an improving outlook for ESPN driven by benefits from virtual MVPDs and ESPN Plus – the new OTT launching this spring,"" analyst Drew Borst wrote in a note to clients Friday.

John Maxfield,11162017,Fool,11092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has been the focus of a lot of unpleasant attention this year after regulators announced in September 2016 that thousands of its employees spent years opening millions of unauthorized fake accounts for customers in order to drive up the bank's cross-sale ratio. This has been bad for current shareholders of the nation's third-biggest bank by assets, but it might present an opportunity for enterprising investors who don't already own its stock. There are three reasons to believe that Wells Fargo stock is cheap today. Though, given where the market is right now, as well as the fact that Wells Fargo could still face further regulatory and legal fallout from the frauds, this doesn't necessarily mean investors should immediately jump to buy shares. Image source: Getty Images. The first reason Wells Fargo's shares come across as cheap is that they are underperforming other bank stocks, as well as the broader market. Wells Fargo's stock is down 1.5% year to date. That's not horrible in and of itself, but it looks dismal when juxtaposed against its peer group. The average stock price of the 20 biggest banks in the country has climbed 10.2% this year. It's worth remembering that bank stocks in general have soared over the past 12 months. Since this time last year, the KBW Bank Index, which tracks shares of two dozen large-cap bank stocks, is up 31%. The outcome of last year's presidential election served as a key catalyst for that rise, as then-candidate Donald Trump had promised to ""dismantle"" the consumer protections of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, and reduce the corporate tax rate. The former change would enable banks to make more money, while the latter would allow them to keep more of the money they make. But even though Wells Fargo's stock has participated in this rally, it hasn't benefited as much as most of its peers. Since this time last year, shares of the California-based bank are up 19%. That ain't bad, but it's well below other large banks. One of the metrics that investors look at when deciding whether to buy a stock is its 52-week high. The implication is that stocks furthest from their top prices over the past year, holding all else equal, offer more upside potential. This would seem to bode well for Wells Fargo. Over the past year, the bank's share price topped out at $59.99. Today, they're around $54 a share -- 10% below that 52-week high. Now, to be clear, a 10% discount isn't huge when it comes to this measure, but it's nevertheless a bigger discount than the typical blue-chip bank stock. Among the 20 biggest banks in the country, the average stock is trading for 6% below its 52-week high. Just like the underperformance of Wells Fargo's stock this year, this suggests that its shares have more upward potential than other big bank stocks. The third reason that Wells Fargo's stock seems cheap is that it trades at a lower valuation than the typical big bank stock. You can see this by looking at the bank's price-to-earnings ratio, which is calculated by taking a bank's share price divided by its earnings per share. The average big bank trades for 14 times expected earnings over the next 12 months. In effect, this means that it costs an investor $14 to buy ever $1 worth of estimated annual earnings. Wells Fargo comes in below that. It's price-to-earnings multiple is 13.5. That's not a lot less than the average bank stock, but it is less. Now, as I said at the outset, none of this necessarily means that you should run out and buy Wells Fargo's stock right now. After all, with the broader market at record highs, all stocks could be due for a correction, including bank stocks. Additionally, there's reason to believe that Wells Fargo is almost certainly not done absorbing the costs associated with its fake-account scandal. That said, if you're a value investor on the hunt for bank stocks, Wells Fargo is worth adding to your watch list. ","
      
    Wells Fargo Stock Seems Cheap, But Is It? -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,11162017,Fool,11092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) climbed 1.6% on Thursday, roughly double the gain in the broader market, as a changeover at the top of the bank industry's newest regulatory body could help the nation's third biggest bank by assets put last year's fake-account scandal in the rearview mirror. Image source: Getty Images. Earlier this week, the current head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Richard Cordray, said that he plans to leave his post by the end of the month. Cordray has led the agency for six years, cracking down hard on banks that run afoul of consumer rules and regulations. ""It has been a joy of my life to have the opportunity to serve our country as the first director of the Consumer Bureau by working alongside all of you here,"" Cordray told employees. ""I trust that new leadership will see that value also and work to preserve it -- perhaps in different ways than before, but desiring, as I have done, to serve in ways that benefit and strengthen our economy and our country."" The CFPB's aggressive posture under Cordray is almost certainly bound to change. On Thursday, it was reported that President Donald Trump will appoint Mick Mulvaney to run the CFPB. Mulvaney is currently in charge of the Office of Management and Budget, a position he will keep while serving as the interim director of the CFPB. Mulvaney is a known critic not only of the heightened regulatory environment in the financial services industry since the financial crisis, but of the CFPB, in particular. The net result is that banks could soon see the CFPB ease its oversight of banks. One could argue whether this is good for consumers or not, but there's no question that it's a positive development for banks. Unlike the other prudential regulators in the bank industry -- the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency -- the CFPB isn't tasked with maintaining the safety and soundness of the bank industry. Its sole concern is on reducing harm to consumers from illicit financial practices. By design, it's innately antagonistic to banks. And few banks have been impacted more heavily by this than Wells Fargo. In September of last year, the CFPB revealed that thousands of Wells Fargo's branch-based employees had spent years opening millions of accounts for customers without the customers' approval to do so. At the time, it may not have seemed like a material issue for Wells Fargo, as the $185 million fine announced by the CFPB in conjunction with other governmental bodies amounted to a small fraction of the $5.6 billion earned by Wells Fargo that same quarter. But it soon became clear that the $185 million fine was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of consequences. Since then, the bank has replaced its CEO, missed out on much of the post-presidential election rally in bank stocks, uncovered similar practices in other areas of its business, and had its reputation severely maligned. The net result is that Wells Fargo has not only seen its revenue take a hit, falling in the latest quarter on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, but its expenses are on the rise, as well. Most recently, the California-based bank earned $4.6 billion in the third quarter. That was down 21% from the second quarter, and it was off 19% relative to the year-ago period. Consequently, when you trace all of this back to the CFPB's revelation last year, it seems logical that shares of Wells Fargo would outperform other bank stocks given the impending changeover at the top of the industry watchdog.

    Why Wells Fargo Stock Outperformed on Thursday -- The Motley Fool

Motley Fool Staff,11162017,Fool,11092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In this clip, Michael Douglass and Matt Frankel discuss Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) entry into the robo-advisory business, and why robo-advisories have become so popular in recent years. They also discuss the evolution of the robo-advisory concept over the years, as well as the new ""hybrid"" robo-advisory structure. A full transcript follows the video. Michael Douglass: We thought we would talk about robo-advisors a little bit today because there's news. Wells Fargo is planning to use a robo-advisor. To be more precise, they're planning to create a robo-advisor. It's called the Intuitive Investor product. Clients are going to need to have a minimum of $10,000 to open an account. They'll be charged a 0.5% advisory fee. A little bit less in certain circumstances, and we'll talk about that a little bit further down the road. But what's interesting here is, Wells Fargo is following in the footsteps of a lot of small competitors, like Betterment, that you've probably heard of, and also some very large institutional competitors like Vanguard, Charles Schwab, Fidelity, which has that product called Fidelity Go, and Merrill Edge Guided Investing by Bank of America. What's interesting about robo-advisors is, they're a big market. In fact, it's one that's growing pretty quickly. One estimate puts it at $385 billion in assets under management by 2021. Before anything else, let's talk a little bit about what a robo-advisor is. Matt? Matt Frankel: Before 2008, all you had were human wealth managers, I guess you would call them, where they would charge you a certain percentage of your assets under management in exchange for giving you financial advice and managing your investments for you. Generally, this was between 1%-2% per year, on top of all the fees charged by whatever mutual funds or ETFs they invested in for you. So, to solve that problem, I believe Michael actually told me he used one that charged him a lot. Douglass: Yeah, it was something like 1.5% annually, again, in addition to the fees of the underlying mutual funds. So, I ended up paying something like 3-3.5% annually. Which, when you think about it, can be a lot of money long-term and can really damage your investing returns. When you think about the fact that the stock market historically returns about 6-6.5% after inflation, theoretically, that's eating about half of those returns. Frankel: Right. I actually just published an article this morning that shows how you can lose hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of a lifetime based on advisory fees alone. So, to solve this problem, this whole robo advisor concept was born. It started out in the form of what's called a target date fund that essentially invests in a combination of other mutual funds, and adjusts over time as you get older, lower your risk tolerance and make the prudent investing moves that a financial advisor would do. Douglass: Yeah. And then, what's interesting is, the next step was, these formal robo-advisors. Betterment launched in 2008. The idea was essentially this automated solution that automatically rebalances your portfolio among different funds, at the time usually target date funds. Of course, since then, things have changed. So, you can kind of say, ""Here's my risk tolerance, here's what I'm thinking about,"" and they'll recommend this allocation and work with it. Nowadays, of course, robo-advisors come in a variety of different shapes and flavors because it's been so popular. So, you actually see a move by some institutions toward hybrids, so, robo-advisors that charge low fees, but also provide some access to a human financial planner so that you can talk through some of the thornier tax issues that pop up from time to time when you're investing, and when you have a lot of complicated stuff, basically, in your financial life. Frankel: Right. This would be a situation where, you still need some access to a person, you pretty much want your investments on autopilot for the most part, but there are some situations where, say, you inherit some money and you want to know the best thing to do with it, or you're faced with a big tax bill this year because you've sold some of your other investments and need to know what to do. It provides you access to an actual person where you can ask questions like that. Douglass: Yeah. And as you can imagine, in most cases, that results in a slightly higher assets under management fee than for your typical robo-advisors. Now, just to be clear, to give you a sense of what robo-advisors are usually charging, it's usually pretty close to that 0.5%. Now, some of them are a little bit lower, some of them are a little bit higher, but to give you a sense, you're moving from a 1-2% assets under management fee for a traditional wealth manager down to around 0.5%. So that's really a substantial savings for most investors. And I think that's one of the key upshots that everyone should be aware of. ","

Over the past decade or so, robo-advisors – automated platforms that create and maintain diversified investment portfolios – have taken the financial advisory world by storm. With lower fees than traditional financial advisors, robo-advisors have surged in popularity and are expected to continue to grow over the next few years. With that in mind, here's a rundown of the major players in the robo-advisory market, as well as a discussion of the features, perks, and costs that come with each. Image Source: Getty Images. As I mentioned, the general idea of a robo-advisor is a service that automatically creates a diversified portfolio for you, and then maintains (rebalances) the portfolio over time. So, it's safe to assume that all of the robo-advisory services discussed here do at least that much. In addition, there are some other things to look for when selecting a robo-advisory service that may be important to you. Just to name some of the most common: There are many robo-advisory services on the market, and the industry is evolving rapidly. For that reason, this isn't necessarily an exhaustive list. Rather, this is just intended to be a list of some of the largest and most well-known robo-advisors, and a brief discussion of the features of each (see the list of features in the previous section for descriptions). After the list is a table comparing fees and account minimums for each service. Wealthfront – Wealthfront and Betterment are the two pioneers in the robo-advisory world. Wealthfront manages the first $10,000 of clients' assets for free and charges a 0.25% fee after that. The service offers daily tax-loss harvesting for all taxable accounts and has a direct indexing servicing for balances of $100,000 or more. Betterment – Betterment offers up to 1 year of free management, and a 0.25% standard fee on an ongoing basis. For customers who want a hybrid model and have at least $100,000 to invest, Betterment Premium is available with a 0.40% management fee that includes phone advisor access. Wealthsimple – The thing that makes Wealthsimple unique is that it offers socially responsible investment portfolios. The platform offers free tax-loss harvesting, and has a two-tiered fee stricture: 0.5% fee on balances $100k or less and 0.4% on balances above $100k. WiseBanyan – Calls itself the ""world's first free financial advisor,"" and the basic robo-advisory service doesn't have a fee, although there are still underlying fund expense ratios. WiseBanyan charges 0.25% if customers want tax-loss harvesting, with a cap of a $20 monthly fee. Schwab Intelligent Portfolios – Schwab offers two variations of its robo-advisory service, and this is the free one. Schwab can afford to do this, as it makes money by investing client assets in its own funds. Tax-loss harvesting is offered on taxable account balances of $50,000 or more. Vanguard Personal Advisor Services – This is the largest robo-advisory service in the market by far. It is a hybrid model that includes unlimited access to financial advisors (CFPs). Investing over $500,000 gets you a dedicated financial advisor. Vanguard's appeal is the low-cost structure of its funds, and because of this, its all-in cost is among the lowest of hybrid robo-advisors. Schwab Intelligent Advisory – Schwab's hybrid robo-advisory product offers lower management fees and lower account minimums than Vanguard. Tax-loss harvesting is free with $50k minimum balance. As a hybrid robo-advisory, clients get unlimited appointments with CFPs. Personal Capital – Uses individual securities in accounts with $200k, which maximizes tax-loss harvesting. Standard fee is 0.89%, but accounts over $1 million get discounted pricing. Average expense ratio is 0.09%. All accounts have access to a team of financial advisors, and get tax-loss harvesting services, and clients with $200k or more get two dedicated advisors to call, email, or video chat. Wells Fargo Intuitive Investor– Discounted 0.40% fee with $25k in deposits or $50k in combined balances. Investment options include BlackRock iShares ETFs and some smart-beta products by Goldman Sachs. There are still several unknown factors about Wells Fargo's robo-advisory, since it was just recently announced. Fidelity Go – The most unique aspect of Fidelity's robo-advisory is its all-in investment fee that includes fund expenses – 0.35% for retirement portfolios and 0.40% for taxable accounts. The service uses Fidelity index funds, but taxable portfolios add BlackRock iShares ETFs. Tax-loss harvesting is not offered. TDAmeritrade Essential Portfolios – TD Ameritrade's robo-advisory service offers free tax-loss harvesting, and its fund expense ratios of 0.06%-0.08% are among the lowest in the business. E*Trade Adaptive Portfolio – E*Trade's robo-advisory offers clients a choice between a portfolio of mutual funds and ETFs, or a portfolio made up entirely of ETFs. The hybrid mutual fund and ETF portfolio option has underlying fund fees 0.20%-0.45%, while the all-ETF portfolio's fees are 0.20%, in addition to the management fee. Unlike many of the others, E*Trade does not offer tax-loss harvesting strategies.

Different services have different benefits and drawbacks that should be taken into account when trying to find the best robo-advisor for you. ","

Rising interest rates are good news for bank net interest margin, and that could make banking stocks smart buys ahead of a rumored increase of the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate in December. So we asked some of our top Motley Fool investors for their favorite bank stocks to buy right now. Read on to see if Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Capital One (NYSE:COF), and Bofl Holding (NYSE:AX) should be added to your portfolio. Sean Williams (Wells Fargo): Call me a glutton for punishment, but the top bank stock I believe investors should consider this November is embattled banking giant Wells Fargo. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. To start with, I'm not going to condone any of the actions of its management team or employees that resulted in the opening of around 3.5 million accounts without consumers' knowledge to fuel high cross-selling expectations at the branch level. Wells Fargo has taken its lumps in recent quarters from this major flub, parted ways with former CEO John Stumpf, and has been dealt weaker quarterly results in lieu of that lost consumer trust. But if I've learned anything as an investor in the banking sector, it's that investors have a short-term memory when it comes to screw-ups. As a longtime shareholder in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), I've been privy to a company known for financial ""boo-boos."" It wound up taking heat for its decision to charge debit-card holders a monthly fee to use their cards in 2011, and it paid a hefty price for its acquisition of mortgage company Countrywide Financial, with legal settlement after legal settlement well into 2014. Still, Bank of America's stock has quintupled over six years. People forget these issues pretty quickly, which leads me to believe Wells Fargo will find itself in consumers' good graces soon enough. Before its recent PR issues, Wells Fargo was widely considered to be the healthiest of the big banks. It avoided derivatives trading before the Great Recession and has stuck to the bread and butter of banking -- deposits and loans. This simple formula is a big reason it's consistently delivering a greater than 1% return on assets. Wells Fargo also has the expectation of higher interest income working in its favor. The Federal Reserve's monetary tightening is great news for a bank that's generated 56% of its sales from interest income through the first nine months of 2017. An additional 100-basis-point increase to short- and long-term rates over the next year would probably add between $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion in added net interest income, according to its third-quarter Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Long story short, expect a rebound and steady growth in due time. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Todd Campbell (Capital One): I have no idea if a Capital One credit card happens to be in your wallet, but even if it isn't, it's in the wallets of millions of other American consumers. The company is one of the country's biggest credit card issuers, and that's good news for investors, especially with interest rates heading higher and the holiday shopping season fast approaching. Capital One operates a traditional bank, but its credit card business generates the bulk of its sales and profit. For example, its $4.3 billion in credit card revenue in the third quarter accounted for 62% of its $6.98 billion in total revenue, and its $572 million in net income from its credit card business represented about half of its $1.1 billion in companywide quarterly net income last quarter. Clearly, this company's success is heavily reliant on a good market for consumer credit demand. Fortunately, a strong economy and low unemployment rate make this a very good time to be in this business. Last quarter, Capital One collected interest and fees on $109 billion in credit card debt, up 5% year over year, and on average, that debt's yielding 15.58%, up from 14.68% last year. Credit card use doesn't seem to be slowing down, either. Capital One's credit card customers bought $84.5 billion of goods and services last quarter, up 8% year over year. I doubt that trend will lose momentum this holiday season, and if I'm right, then this could be a good time to buy shares. While the past is no guarantee for the future, Capital One's stock has historically rewarded investors in the final quarter of the year, gaining ground in eight of the past 10 years. It's anyone's guess what happens this year, but assuming people use their credit cards this holiday season, I think Capital One's in a good position to keep on delivering profit-friendly growth. Brian Feroldi (BofI Holding): Banks had relied on branches for centuries to help them attract, retain, and service customers. However, branches are expensive to build, staff, and maintain. Those high costs are a major reason some banks fail to produce an attractive efficiency ratio. This winning formula has turned BofI Holding into a home-run stock for its long-term investors: BOFI Total Return Price data by YCharts Yet despite boasting a winning formula and having a history of market success, BofI's stock has been cast aside recently because the company is making investments in itself to power its next phase of growth. As a result, shares are currently trading hands for less than 2 times book value and around 9 times forward earnings. I'd argue that's a bargain price for a differentiated bank that's built for growth. ","
      
    3 Top Bank Stocks to Buy in November -- The Motley Fool

Eric Volkman,11162017,Fool,11092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) chairman and CEO Warren Buffett is an unabashed fan of finance industry stocks. Exactly half of Berkshire's top 10 holdings by market value are financial-service concerns or other companies that somehow fit into the sector. For many years, the company has owned especially massive stakes in both Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and American Express. However, neither of these stalwarts is Buffett's current favorite in the sector, despite how much money they've made for him over the years. Instead, that honor goes to a different bank. These days, Buffett's banking baby is Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). We shouldn't be surprised; this summer, Berkshire cashed out of a big stack of warrants it owned in the company, netting it 700 million common shares of stock, which made it the largest single shareholder. That move also produced an instant on-paper profit of $12 billion. In a recent interview on CNBC, Buffett could barely contain his pride of ownership. ""What's your favorite bank?"" interviewer Becky Quick asked him, point-blank. Image source: The Motley Fool. ""What's my favorite bank? Well, I'm not so s-- who's your favorite child?"" he stalled, before blurting out: ""Bank of America has done a sensational job under [CEO] Brian Moynihan."" Although ""sensational"" might be a bit strong, Buffett is generally on point about Bank of America's performance. The company has made commendable improvements in many facets of its operations during Moynihan's tenure, which began in the aftershock of last decade's Financial Crisis. For example, in its most recently reported quarter, Bank of America proved that it was well on track to meet its goal of reducing annual expenses to $53 billion. Even though big chunks of its spending in years past consisted of Crisis-related legal expenses, this kind of slim-down isn't easy for a giant that spent over $70 billion a year just five years ago. Bank of America has posted solid fundamentals of late, with Q3 being the latest in a string of good quarterly performances. Although total revenue didn't leap in the quarter, it did advance 1% year over year to $21.8 billion. More encouragingly, those efficiencies helped lift the bottom line by 15% to $5.1 billion and lift the all-important return-on-assets metric to 0.98% -- a hair's breadth from the bank's 1% goal. Buffett intends to keep his banking baby at home until it grows up -- and perhaps even longer. He said in the CNBC interview that Berkshire ""will be holders of B of A stock for a long, long, long time."" Ever cagey, the veteran investor rarely makes that kind of commitment publicly, so this pronouncement is meaningful. Bank of America still has plenty of potential as the economy continues to improve and the company skillfully trims costs. On average, analysts estimate that the bank will improve its fiscal 2017 per-share profit by 21% (to $1.82), with revenue coming in 6% higher at $89.5 billion. Those growth rates compare favorably to Wells Fargo's anticipated marginal decline in profit and incremental rise in revenue. They also top AmEx's anticipated 4% improvement in both net profit and revenue. Meanwhile, Bank of America's price-to-book value (a key ratio in an asset-heavy sector such as banking) stands at a relatively low 1.1; Wells Fargo's is currently 1.5, while AmEx's figure is 3.9. Yes, we can anticipate that Bank of America will remain firmly anchored in Berkshire's portfolio well into the future. I imagine it'll also remain the sector stock most favored by proud Papa Warren.

    This Is Now Warren Buffett's Favorite Banking Stock -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",11162017,Fool,11092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The third quarter was relatively quiet for Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) in terms of the company's stock portfolio. Other than the well-publicized Bank of America investment, which wasn't really a ""new investment"" at all, Berkshire didn't report any new stock positions during the third quarter. However, there was still some buying and selling that took place. During the quarter, Buffett and his team added to three of its investments and reduced three others. Here's a rundown of Buffett's latest moves. Image source: The Motley Fool. During the quarter, Berkshire added to three of the stock positions in the company's portfolio: It's worth mentioning that the latter two positions are relatively small portions of Berkshire's portfolio. Even after the increase, the Monsanto and Synchrony stakes are worth $1.1 billion and $646 million, respectively. For comparison, the company's Apple investment is worth nearly $21 billion. During the third quarter, Berkshire also reduced the sizes of some of its investments. As of the end of the third quarter, Berkshire Hathaway was sitting on more than $109 billion in cash, which was $9.5 billion more than it had just three months prior. The company's recent stock market activity helps to explain why. While it's unclear the price at which Berkshire bought and sold all of these stocks, it undoubtedly sold more stock on a dollar-value basis than it purchases, by about $2 billion based on the stocks' average prices during the third quarter, mainly because of the massive IBM sale. This cash, combined with the cash generated from Berkshire's other businesses and the company's lack of any completed acquisitions during the quarter, explains why Berkshire is now sitting on the first $100 billion-plus cash stockpile in the company's history.

Adam Levy,11162017,Fool,11092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Business credit cards are a great way for small business owners to keep their business expenses separate from their personal expenses. They can also provide an easy way to give employees the ability to make business expenses without requiring you to reimburse them later through the use of authorized user cards. But if you apply for a business credit card, you might be wondering if it will impact your personal credit report. Even if you have complete control of your personal finances, your business might hit a point where it needs to rely on carrying a balance on a credit card and you don't want that to affect your personal credit score. The answer to the question is ""it depends."" This article, however, can give you the information you need in order to make the best decision about which business credit card to apply for. Image source: Getty Images There are several factors that go into determining your credit score: payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, credit mix, and new credit. The factors that could be impacted by a new credit card account showing up on your personal credit report are credit utilization, length of credit history, and new credit. If you plan to spend a lot more money on your business every month compared to your personal expenses, you could see a negative impact on credit utilization if a business account appears on your personal report. That said, it will increase your overall available credit, so it could potentially have a positive impact. Either way, it's going to be a major factor to consider, as credit utilization accounts for 30% of your credit score. Additionally, a new account on your report will negatively impact your average age of accounts, a part of the length of credit history factor. Regardless of whether the account appears on your personal credit report, the credit card issuer will still have to make a hard inquiry with one of the credit bureaus. That will have a small negative impact on the new credit factor. The following is an incomplete list of which issuers report business cards to personal credit bureaus and which don't. Credit Card Issuer Report to Personal Credit Bureau? American Express No Bank of America No Barclaycard Sometimes Capital One Yes Chase No Citi No Discover Yes U.S. Bank No Wells Fargo No Data source: Doctor of Credit. As long as you stay away from Barclaycard, Capital One, and Discover business credit cards, you'll see very minimal impact on your personal credit score. That said, Capital One issues some of the best small-business credit cards, so it might be worthwhile if you don't plan on spending too much and hurting your credit utilization. After all, a large credit line with just a little spending could actually boost your credit score. Just because a credit card is in your businesses name doesn't mean you're off the hook if you stop paying on time, start racking up interest, and eventually end up with a delinquent account. Remember, most business credit card issuers will make a hard inquiry on your credit report. That's because you're still personally liable for all the credit your business uses. While most issuers usually don't report a business credit card to your personal credit report, you might start to see the accounts on your report if you don't use them responsibly. American Express says it will report negative information about business accounts to personal credit reports. Chase and U.S. Bank are a bit more lenient, but will still report seriously delinquent accounts to personal credit reports. You won't be able to hide behind your business when using a business credit card, so be sure you use it just as responsibly as you would a personal credit card. Make sure you're paying on time and staying below your credit limit. That will ensure your credit report stays clean, and it will help you qualify for a bigger line of credit for your business if you ever need it. If you're using credit responsibly, you shouldn't be afraid of a new business credit card impacting your personal credit report. Focus on the card that offers the rewards and benefits you're most interested in. As long as you're paying on time and keeping your credit card usage in check (things you should be doing with personal cards, too), it won't hurt your personal credit score if the business credit card account gets reported to the personal credit bureaus.

    Do Business Credit Cards Affect My Credit Score? -- The Motley Fool

Scott Levine,11162017,Fool,11092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of the water utility Aqua America (NYSE:WTR) rose 7% in October. In addition to information about the company's dividend, investors took kindly to the stock after learning of two analyst upgrades. After raising the price target on Aqua America's shares from $35 to $40, analysts at Wells Fargo Securities upgraded their rating from market perform to outperform, according to benzinga.com. In part, analysts based their outlook on the belief that Aqua America's rate increase request in Pennsylvania will resolve favorably for the company. Aqua America intends to file an infrastructure charge in 2017 followed by a rate case filing in 2018. Image source: Getty Images. Although it provides water and wastewater services to approximately 3 million customers in eight states, Aqua America primarily relies on its operations in Pennsylvania. Favorable outcomes of rate increase requests in the Keystone State, therefore, are crucial to the company's success. In fiscal 2016, for example, Aqua Pennsylvania, the company's largest subsidiary, accounted for approximately 52% of Aqua America's operating revenue and 74% of its net income. But the dealings in Pennsylvania weren't the only source of optimism. Further inspiring investors, the analysts from Wells Fargo said that their current earnings estimates for Aqua America assume only $50 million in deals for 2018 and beyond. Meanwhile, the company has more than $120 million in deals pending, leading the analysts to assert that there's potential for their outlook to grow even more bullish if the company executes on its growth plan. Besides Wells Fargo, Ladenburg Thalmann also shared a bullish outlook on the stock in October. Maintaining a buy rating, the analysts set a $32 price target on Aqua America's shares. The October wave of positive sentiment for the stock, in and of itself, may have motivated investors to pick up shares, but it could also very well be the cumulative effect of optimism that has stretched throughout the year. In March, the stock was subject to two upgrades. Barclays raised it from equal weight to overweight and upwardly revised the stock's price target from $33 to $36. Boenning and Scattergood, likewise, upgraded the stock, rating it outperform instead of neutral. When analysts turn their attention to a stock, investors should certainly pay attention, but it should always be taken with a grain of salt. After all, these bearish or bullish ratings may be predicated on the company's predicted short-term performance -- whether several months or a couple of years. We, however, maintain long-term time horizons and are much more concerned with the fundamentals. In this regard, Aqua America represents an interesting opportunity. Operating as a regulated utility, the company has steady and predictable cash flow. Moreover, it has a clear growth-through-acquisition strategy. It's for reasons like these that it should attract investors' attention, not the opinions of those on Wall Street. ","

"Jamal Carnette, CFA",11162017,Fool,11092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. What do Warren Buffett, Ben Graham, Seth Klarman, and Peter Lynch all have in common? Besides being wildly successful investors, they're all are adherents to value investing, a method where one attempts to buy securities that have a higher intrinsic value than their current price. One of the most basic forms of value investing is to find stocks with low price-to-earnings (PE) ratios. The PE ratio is a simple ratio that divides the current price per share of a company by the earnings per share over the trailing-12-month period. The logic behind buying low PE stocks is simple: As an investor, you are ultimately entitled to a pro-rata portion of company earnings, so paying the lowest cost, or multiple, for those earnings is preferable than paying a higher multiple. Essentially, your dollar is buying a larger portion of company earnings than it would with a high-multiple stock. Image Source: Getty Images Success by investing in low PE stocks far from guaranteed. In fact, there are a few prevalent risks with using low PE ratios as your sole source of investment decision-making. First, multiple factors can determine earnings, and not all are directly related to the company's operations. Non-operational company actions like gains from sales of equipment or subsidiaries, tax benefits, or winning a lawsuit are required to be reported as earnings, which skews the earnings upward. Likewise, losses from equipment sales, restructuring, or losing a lawsuit can temporarily depress earnings. Many financial outlets report normalized earnings to account for extraordinary items and discontinued operations, but it's not guaranteed. The second risk of investing in low PE stocks is related to operations. Investing is a forward-looking endeavor while the PE ratio is a backward-looking metric. When investors feel a company's prospects have noticeably declined due to industry changes, economic conditions, or poor operations, they will proactively sell the company, depressing the price and leading to a low PE ratio. Often, this is referred to as a value trap if the company underperforms. Conversely, low PE stocks that can turn things around often overperform as both increased earnings per share and multiples propel the stock higher. Year to date returns data from Ycharts. P/E from Morningstar. Data as of 11/13/2017 Gilead Sciences is an example of investors dimming on the company's future prospects. In October the company's stock fell 7.5%. Year to date the stock has only gained almost 3% while the market, as defined by the S&P 500, is up more than 15%. Shares of the company only trade at a PE ratio of 8 times earnings. In Gilead's case, this is due to investor concerns about its profitability going forward. Colleague Cory Renauer provides more detail, but a major reason is a poor sales forecast for its hepatitis C virus franchise. Often pharmaceutical manufacturers have only one or two drugs that provide the majority of their revenue and earnings. If they are underperforming or about to go off-patent, investors can sell the stock and depress PE multiples. Altria Group's PE ratio suffers from two major factors. The first issue is that the company is operating in a business with declining users. From 1965 to 2014, the last time the CDC conducted its survey, the U.S. smoking rate for adults has decreased from 42.4% to 12%. As the parent company of Philip Morris USA, a cigarette producer, and cigarmakers John Middleton and Nat Sherman, it's logical investors are nervous about its long-term success. The second is the increase in socially responsible investing. Investors are increasingly unwilling to investing in stocks they consider traffic in harmful products or behaviors such as tobacco, alcohol, guns, and gambling establishments. Interestingly enough, even though smoking rates have declined substantially. Altria, formerly Philip Morris is the best performing stock since 1968. This year hasn't nearly been as kind with a 3% year-to-date loss. General Motors an example of a company that suffers from extraordinary items and discontinued operations. In the recently reported third-quarter, the company reported a generally accepted accounting principles loss of $2.03/share, mostly due to selling a German subsidiary. However, the chart above uses adjusted/normalized earnings instead of GAAP-compliant earnings, as the former is more reflective of the company's operations. General Motors operates in the highly cyclical and volatile auto industry. For the last few years, this has been a benefit because auto sales have been robust. However, in the event sales slow, it's possible for auto manufacturers to quickly swing to losses. GM, under the leadership of CEO Mary Barra, is taking measures to ensure this doesn't happen. However, for many investors memories of the company's U.S. government bailout in 2009, where shareholders were essentially wiped out, has discouraged investment and kept PE ratios low. Verizon operates in a particularly challenging environment. Its wireless communications division now is under price pressure from competitors AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint. The company has a high debt load, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 4.3 times. While the company does produce significant cash from operations, it requires a lot of cash to upgrade and maintain its networks: both its wireless network and its FiOS television service. As my colleague Evan Niu noted, Verizon did a good job in the recent quarter, continuing to add wireless subscribers in the face of strong competition, although at a lower average revenue per account. At almost 12 times earnings, investors seem unsure the company can continue to grow its bottom line. Image Source: Getty Images It's often said value investors are attempting to buy a stock on sale. As a shopper, it's important to understand what you are buying. Using a PE ratio is a good starting point, but it should not be the only metric one uses to evaluate stocks. If anything, be skeptical when a stock has a low PE ratio because often it's due to non-operational items or the rest of the investing community is strongly bearish on the company. However, bearish sentiment can sometimes over discount a stock and if you have a knack for finding low PE companies that are improperly discounted, you may be able to join the ranks of the great investors mentioned at the top of this article.

,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co announced on Friday it fired its head of consumer lending, a move that people familiar with the matter said was because he disparaged a bank regulator to a fired employee. The abrupt departure of Franklin Codel, Wells Fargo’s head of consumer lending, came as the bank grapples with the fallout from a sales scandal in which thousands of employees enrolled perhaps millions of customers in products they did not want or need. The fired employee, Greg Gwizdz, reported Codel’s comments to Wells Fargo, which then fired Codel, one of the people said. Gwizdz, a former mortgage sales executive, was fired by Wells Fargo several months ago for a number of issues, according to Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda. A call to Gwizdz was answered by a woman who said she was his wife and who declined to take a message. A call to Codel’s home was not returned. Wells Fargo is now subject to tighter regulatory oversight and faces ongoing probes and lawsuits due to the scandal. As a result, once top Wells Fargo executives became aware of Codel’s comments, they felt they needed to take action, one of the sources said After being promoted as part of a broader management shakeup last year, Codel had become a key executive in the bank’s effort to make things right with customers and fix operational flaws that led to a hard-charging sales culture. In announcing the dismissal earlier on Friday, Wells Fargo said it expects to name a replacement by year-end. Codel forfeited more than 61,000 stock options and nearly 16,000 restricted shares, according to securities filings Friday. Goyda said the forfeitures were in connection with his firing. The conversation between Gwizdz and Codel was about  compensation Wells Fargo withheld from Gwizdz, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. As part of a $190 million settlement Wells Fargo reached with regulators in September 2016, payouts to departing employees must be cleared by the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC). They have approved payouts for hundreds of former Wells Fargo employees since that time but have disagreed on a handful of executives. The decision process can sometimes take months, frustrating former employees waiting for deferred stock or severance. It was not clear, however, whether Gwizdz would have been entitled to a payout since he was fired by the bank. Goyda declined to comment on the bank’s policies regarding employees fired for cause. Bryan Hubbard, spokesman for the OCC, said the regulator does not comment on banks’ personnel matters. A call to FDIC spokesman David Barr was not immediately returned. In Friday’s announcement, Wells Fargo said it dismissed Codel because his behavior “was contrary to the company’s policies and expectations of its senior leaders during a communication he had with a former team member regarding that team member’s earlier termination.” Goyda declined to elaborate on the communication. “We hold our executives to high standards regardless of the regulatory environment, and if something was done that was improper, that would have applied regardless of the scrutiny that we’re under,” he told Reuters in a statement. Wells Fargo, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, has been mired in scandal since the settlement, which involved thousands of employees enrolling customers into credit card and deposit accounts without their knowledge to meet sales targets. Since then, it has faced more lawsuits and probes and detailed more sales practice issues in other businesses. The number of phony accounts has grown to as many as 3.5 million. Codel had been overseeing efforts to fix problems related to auto lending and mortgages that Wells Fargo unveiled in August. The mortgage issue, related to inconsistent application of policies regarding interest rate lock extensions, was one of the reasons Gwizdz was fired, Goyda said. People who know Codel described him as an ethical person who had a careless interaction with a former employee. Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan described it as a “difficult” situation in the company statement. Sloan will be the boss of Codel’s direct reports until a replacement is found. Those reports include Michael DeVito, interim head of Wells Fargo Home Lending; Laura Schupbach, head of Wells Fargo Dealer Services; John Rasmussen, head of personal lending; and Laurie Nordquist, head of personal and small business insurance.

,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans are not expected to push major tax cuts through Congress this year, according to a majority of economists in a Reuters poll, who in any case were skeptical that the legislation would provide a significant boost to the economy. While optimism about a tax overhaul has helped push the U.S. stock market up for most of this year, the administration of President Donald Trump, a Republican, is still seeking its first major legislative win after almost a year in office. Skepticism about major tax cuts has been growing over the past two weeks, causing share prices to wobble. The House of Representatives on Thursday approved a package of tax reductions estimated to raise the federal deficit by nearly $1.5 trillion over a decade. The Senate, where the Republican majority is slimmer, will be the focus for debate. Nearly two-thirds of the more than 60 economists who answered an extra question in the Nov. 13-17 poll, which mostly took place before the tax cuts passed the House, said they were not confident the administration would get the legislation passed this year. “We feel that if it does pass next year, it is likely to be less ambitious and more focused on temporary cuts than reform,” Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of macro research at Barclays, wrote in a note. The effect of tax cuts would probably be muted because of a lack of wage growth and a high level of employment, he added. In a Reuters poll last month, a strong majority of economists said the U.S. economy did not need a big fiscal stimulus at this late stage of the business cycle. This month’s poll of more than 100 economists showed most respondents had upgraded their near-term forecasts for the U.S. economy, which they expect to grow just above the roughly 2 percent trend rate over the next two years but with muted inflation. When asked what the economy needs most, the top pick was increased infrastructure spending. Nearly as many said the United States ought to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement - Trump pulled the nation out of negotiations just days after becoming president - as those choosing tax cuts. “It is hard to say with any level of confidence until we see a final plan (for tax cuts) what really are the benefits to the (economic) outlook,” said Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina. “If we don’t get one, clearly there would be a response (from the financial markets) to a failure to not pass some kind of tax legislation. But if we get it, it would support the ‘glass half full’ levels of sentiment we have seen.” In the meantime, most respondents did not expect the core PCE price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, to reach the central bank’s target until the second quarter of 2019. At last measure, it was no higher than it was just before the Fed first started raising interest rates from zero nearly two years ago. The poll still showed the Fed raising rates by 25 basis points more to 1.25-1.50 percent in December, with two increases next year - less than the three the central bank is projecting. While there are few signs of any economic slowdown in broad economic data, the current cycle is mature. Movements in the U.S. government bond market have grabbed attention in recent weeks as well, suggesting some kind of slowdown may be at hand. Two-year U.S. Treasury yields have hit a nine-year high on expectations for higher interest rates, but a weak inflation outlook has pushed the yield curve to its flattest in a decade. The gap between two-year US2YT=RR and 10-year US10YT=RR yields contracted to just above 63 basis points US2US10=TWEB on Thursday. That was the tightest since November 2007, not long before the last recession took hold. While the current yield curve is not inverted, which is often viewed as a recessionary warning sign, it has flattened by more than 60 basis points in less than a year. Economists polled by Reuters gave only a median 10 percent chance of a U.S. recession over the coming year. The highest probability provided was 40 percent. Wells Fargo’s Bullard said economic data had been strengthening over the past couple of quarters. “That is certainly supportive to sustained moderate U.S. economic expansion,” Bullard said. “But yet financial markets, at least the yield curve, are reflecting something that suggests that maybe there are some signals out there that need to be paid attention to, and clearly not everything is right.” (For other stories from the Reuters global long-term economic outlook polls package) ","

,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"TORONTO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Strong inflows of foreign money into Canadian stocks and bonds this year are adding to investor confidence that the rally since May in the country’s currency is sustainable because it is not just supported by speculative flows. Equity and bond market investors, so-called “real money,” tend to have longer horizons than often-leveraged speculators betting on the direction of a currency. Increased buying of Canadian securities by foreign portfolio managers could leave the loonie more resilient should market sentiment turn bearish on the currency. “Real money flows tend to be much less volatile,” said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. “You become more confident (about the outlook for the currency), because it is less likely for these guys to pull their money out on short-term headlines.” Foreign investment in Canadian securities rose to C$52 billion ($40.8 billion) in the third quarter from the second quarter on the back of two interest rate increases by the Bank of Canada that boosted the appeal of Canada’s triple A-rated government bonds and its corporate debt. That has pushed the year-to-date foreign inflows to C$152 billion, on track to match or beat last year’s record of C$172 billion. Net inflows easily exceed the amount needed to cover Canada’s annual current account deficit of about C$60 billion. Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York, said the sustained inflows indicate there is more to the Canadian dollar rally than speculators “getting excited and getting long” the currency. The loonie surged as much as 14 percent between May and September as speculators swung from being heavily bearish on the currency to raising bullish bets in October to the highest in five years. Some of that hot money left the Canadian dollar, the world’s sixth most actively traded currency, after the central bank dampened prospects for further rate increases this year, Still, market players say that fundamentals point to further portfolio inflows, as a pick-up in global growth boosts commodity prices. “For international investors, when you want to buy commodity producers, you end up buying Canada,” Anderson said. Canada’s resource-heavy TSX has rallied as much as 8 percent since August to reach a record high, underpinned by strong domestic economic growth. “I think Canada is doing better than what the Bank of Canada is saying,” said Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank Financial. “I think foreigners are responding to the economy and that is why we are seeing such huge inflows into Canada.” ($1 = 1.2755 Canadian dollars) ","

 ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"If confirmed to head the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Joseph Otting would be one of the last major regulatory appointments by President Donald Trump. | Nick Ut/AP Joseph Otting's background has sparked a fierce backlash against the nomination from Senate Democrats. By VICTORIA GUIDA 11/16/2017 01:18 PM EST The Senate voted to confirm Joseph Otting as comptroller of the currency on Thursday, putting the former banker in charge of a regulator he once battled with over his firm's foreclosure practices. The vote was 54-43, with two Democrats voting in favor of President Donald Trump's nominee. Story Continued Below Otting was CEO of OneWest Bank, a lender co-founded by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that drew criticism over its handling of foreclosures after the financial crisis. The bank was scolded by its federal regulator in 2011 for not properly overseeing the loans of thousands of people at risk of losing their homes and was bound by a consent order for four years. Now, it will be Otting's job to punish such violations by national banks. His background has sparked a fierce backlash against the nomination from Senate Democrats. ""This Administration is putting the banking industry back in charge of policing itself,"" Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) tweeted during Otting's confirmation vote. ""Joseph Otting is yet another bank exec who profited off the financial crisis who is being rewarded by the Trump Administration with a powerful job overseeing our nation’s banking system.""

Still, Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) voted with Republicans on Thursday to confirm Otting. As head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Otting would be one of the last major regulatory appointments by Trump, a lineup that's likely to go much lighter on overseeing the nation's financial institutions and to peel back some post-crisis rules. Otting has not previously served in government. Like some of Trump's other appointees, his industry background is cause for celebration among congressional Republicans, who argue that bureaucrats and academics who have dominated the regulatory ranks have led to less practical policymaking. ""I actually find that refreshing, versus bureaucrats that just ride this escalator learning how to regulate, regulate, regulate more, so I think that’s a good thing, not a bad thing,"" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said of industry experience during Otting's confirmation hearing. By taking the reins of an agency deeply involved in supervising national banks, Otting — an alumnus of U.S. Bancorp, Union Bank of California and Bank of America — will be in a strong position to implement the regulatory rollback that Trump has promised will spur lending. But some of that work has already started this year under acting Comptroller Keith Noreika, who was brought in from a law firm to run the agency — an unusual setup since acting heads are usually drawn from the ranks of existing agency officials. Noreika used his temporary position to speak boldly about controversial topics, including suggesting that banks should be allowed to own non-financial companies, and vice versa, which would be a radical change to U.S. law. The chief of staff and chief counsel under former Comptroller Thomas Curry, an appointee of President Barack Obama, departed from the agency under Noreika, giving Otting the chance to fill those two top staff positions with his own people. Noreika also secured some concrete policy changes, such as making it easier for national banks to make small, short-term loans to customers who regularly receive direct deposits. That move is likely supported by Otting, who in his July confirmation hearing lamented that banks had been pushed out of the small-dollar lending sector. Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street — weekday mornings, in your inbox. By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. Otting also said during the hearing that the various layers of capital requirements imposed on banks are “highly complex” and need to be examined. But he had some praise for the regulatory work done after the crisis. “The regulatory system we have in place today has resulted in banks understanding their risks much better than they ever have, and we have better capital levels,” he said. “I am a believer in a well-capitalized banking system.” He mentioned his desire to ease regulations on community banks and emphasized the importance of improving financial access for lower-income and minority people, including to affordable housing. “A big concern is that a lot of people at the lower echelon ... are not qualifying for banking products and services. You have branches going away,” he said. “There needs to be a real focus of, how do we make banking available for the lower economic and ethnic people across America?” While Otting will probably continue in the same direction as Noreika on deregulation, with a five-year term ahead of him he will perhaps be more diplomatic, both with people outside the agency and within it. Noreika sparred openly with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray, another Obama appointee regarded by many Republicans as an overly aggressive regulator. That included issuing a report backing the ultimately successful Republican push in Congress to kill a CFPB rule that restricted financial companies from imposing mandatory arbitration on their customers to resolve disputes without class-action lawsuits. Cordray announced Wednesday he plans to step down from the CFPB by the end of the month. Noreika also took a top-down approach in dictating policy to staff, leading to a drop in morale at the OCC, according to sources close to the agency. “I believe the OCC’s greatest resource is its staff of highly trained, professional bank supervisors and support personnel,” Otting wrote to Brown after his hearing. Otting will once again work under Mnuchin, but only in the loosest sense. The OCC is an independent agency housed within Treasury, meaning that Otting has complete discretion over supervisory and enforcement matters but defers to the department on management-related issues. The new comptroller will now be required to divest a range of investments in financial companies. He will divest call options and unvested restricted stock units from CIT Group within 90 days of his confirmation, which will yield an accelerated $10.5 million payout, according to his June 23 ethics agreement. The former OneWest CEO kept those assets after his bank was bought in 2015 by CIT Group, which then terminated his employment. Missing out on the latest scoops?

 ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"Rockwell has resisted Emerson’s overtures not just because of disagreements over price, but also because it has argued that the combined company’s industrial customers would be worse off because its products would no longer be available on a single platform and in one software environment. A combination with Emerson would “dampen, not enhance, the ability to grow in the evolving industrial automation and information market,” Rockwell Chief Executive Blake Moret wrote in a letter to Emerson CEO David Farr published on Wednesday. Investors reacted by largely dismissing the likelihood of a tie up between the companies in the short term. Rockwell shares traded down 1.3 percent to $190.57, far below Emerson’s $225 cash-and-share bid and close to the level they were trading before Emerson’s acquisition interest became public last month. Emerson shares rose 2.5 percent to $61.87, as investor concerns that the company would proceed with an expensive deal that would overstretch its finances eased. “We believe it is unlikely there will be follow-up offer from Emerson,” Wells Fargo Securities LLC analysts wrote in a note. Rockwell is a leader in so-called discrete automation, helping assemble component parts to make automobiles, household appliances and computer systems. Emerson’s strength is in process automation, which helps power plants and factories in sectors including mining and cement operate more efficiently. Rockwell caters to its discrete automation customers using a programmable logic controller platform it calls Logix. It has been seeking to expand this control platform to process automation and cater to so-called hybrid customers using a combination of process and discrete automation. Emerson uses a distributed control system platform for its process and hybrid automation customers called DeltaV. Should it acquire Rockwell, it plans to offer its Logix platform to customers alongside DeltaV. Rockwell has argued that this approach could disrupt the business of some of its customers who want a single platform, and even cost it revenue. This is despite it previously having tried to challenge Emerson’s DeltaV by developing a similar distributed control system platform called PlantPAx, which never captured significant market share. Rockwell has been gradually making progress in increasing its footprint in process automation, thanks partly to acquisitions, including of MAVERICK Technologies last year. In his letter to Farr, Moret challenged Emerson’s assumption of $400 million of run-rate synergies in a deal. A full one-third of these synergies are assumed to be revenue synergies, which are notoriously difficult to achieve, while the cost and revenue synergies are uncertain at best, Moret wrote. Earlier this month, Emerson outlined a plan for a combined “Emerson Rockwell” that will maintain a significant presence in Milwaukee and become an “automation centre of excellence.” Under Emerson’s latest proposal, Rockwell shareholders would own 40 percent of the combined company. Emerson could try to alleviate concerns about Rockwell shareholders’ exposure to the combined company by adding more cash to its offer and reducing its stock element. However, Moody’s Investors Service said last week that Emerson’s current proposal would saddle the combined company with $25 billion in debt, giving it little leeway to raise its offer much further. Moody’s has also estimated Emerson’s latest offer values Rockwell at a hefty 23 times multiple of Rockwell’s earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortisation reported for the last 12 months ending Sept. 30, almost double where many of its peers are trading.

 ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding jumped to a one-year high in October as disruptions caused by recent hurricanes in the South faded and communities in the region started replacing houses damaged by flooding. The sharp rebound in home construction reported by the Commerce Department on Friday was also driven by robust gains in the Northeast and Midwest regions. The broad recovery could ease concerns about the housing market, which has been a drag on economic growth since the second quarter. The report added to labor market, manufacturing and retail sales data that have pointed to strong economic momentum as the year winds down. “Homebuilders are building and that signals greater confidence in the economy ahead,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “Housing construction has been the missing link in the puzzle over why investment spending has lagged in this recovery.” Housing starts surged 13.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29 million units. That was the highest level since October 2016 and also the second-best reading in 10 years. September’s sales pace was revised up to 1.135 million units from the previously reported 1.127 million units. Groundbreaking activity in the South, which accounts for almost half of U.S. residential construction, plummeted in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The storms slammed Texas and Florida in late August and early September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts rising to a pace of 1.185 million units last month. The PHLX housing index was 0.5 percent higher, bucking a broadly weaker U.S. stock market. Shares in the nation’s largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton, rose 0.6 percent and Lennar Corp gained 0.5 percent. Pultegroup shares increased 0.4 percent. Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries were trading higher, while the dollar was weaker against a basket of currencies. Housing starts in the South soared 17.2 percent in October to 621,000 units, with single-family construction vaulting 16.6 percent to its highest level since 2007. There were also increases in homebuilding in the Midwest and Northeast. “The pace of building came back stronger than before the storms hit, which suggests the increase from recovery may have already started in fourth quarter,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. October’s increase in starts ended three straight months of declines, leading economists to expect that housing would contribute to gross domestic product in the fourth quarter. Homebuilding has struggled this year, hamstrung by shortages of land and labor as well as expensive lumber. Investment in homebuilding has contracted for two consecutive quarters. That has contributed to a worsening housing shortage, which has held back home sales. A survey on Thursday showed confidence among homebuilders in November at the second-highest level since July 2005 amid optimism about current sales conditions and buyer traffic. Builders, however, continued to complain about the lack of buildable lots, land and pricey materials. Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 5.3 percent to a rate of 877,000 units in October, the highest level in eight months. Single-family starts fell 22.4 percent in the Northeast and slipped 7.7 percent in the West. They rose 7.8 percent in the Midwest. Groundbreaking on single-family housing projects has slowed since racing to near a 9-1/2-year high in February. Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment surged 36.8 percent to a rate of 413,000 units. Permits for future homebuilding increased 5.9 percent to a rate of 1.297 million units in October, the highest level since January. Single-family home permits rose 1.9 percent to their highest level since September 2007, while permits for the construction of multi-family homes jumped 13.9 percent. Housing completions increased 12.6 percent to a rate of 1.232 million units last month, the highest level since February 2008. The rise in completions was, however, driven by the multi-family housing segment, which will probably do little to eliminate the acute shortage of properties available for sale. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completions need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units to plug the inventory gap. Home completions for buildings with five units or more surged 37.9 percent last month to their highest level since April 1988. Single-family home completions increased only 2.6 percent last month. “For a significant increase in new homes, municipalities are going to have to work harder to make more land available for building,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.

 ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production recorded its biggest increase in six months in October as the drag from hurricane-related disruptions unwound, but the underlying growth trend in output at the nation’s factories, mines and utility plants remained moderate. Other data on Thursday showed an unexpected rise in new filings for unemployment benefits last week in part because of the processing of a backlog of applications from Puerto Rico. The reports are consistent with an economy growing at a steady clip and tightening labor market conditions, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates next month. “With encouraging fundamentals in place, we expect the slow but steady improvement in the U.S. factory sector to continue in the coming months,” said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Fed said industrial production accelerated 0.9 percent last month with output at factories surging 1.3 percent as operations returned to normalcy after being disrupted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which made landfall in late August and early September. The increase in industrial production was the largest since April and followed a 0.4 percent gain in September. Production was also buoyed by a 2.0 percent jump in output at utility plants. But Hurricane Nate, which struck the Gulf Coast in early October, resulted in a decline in oil and gas drilling and extraction. That led to a 1.3 percent drop in mining output last month. The Fed said excluding the impact of the hurricanes, industrial production rose 0.3 percent in October, with manufacturing output advancing 0.2 percent. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of U.S. economic activity, is being supported by a weakening dollar, firming global economy and inventory accumulation by businesses. With the surge in output last month, manufacturing capacity use rose 0.9 percentage point to 76.4 percent, the highest level since May 2008. “The Fed estimates that manufacturing capacity is only growing by 0.7 percent per year, which points to the need to expand capacity at a faster rate should manufacturing output continue to grow at a solid pace,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.The outlook for manufacturing is upbeat, with a measure of factory activity hovering near a 13-1/2-year high. Although a separate report by the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday showed its index of factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region fell to a reading of 22.7 this month from 27.9 in October, manufacturers reported robust demand for their products, rising backlogs and declining inventories. Factories, however, reported a slowdown in hiring as well as a shorter average workweek this month. A survey on Wednesday from the New York Fed mirrored the findings of the Philadelphia Fed survey. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, boosted by strong results from Wal-Mart. The world’s largest retailer said sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 2.7 percent in the third quarter, excluding fuel price fluctuations. In a third report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 249,000 for the week ended Nov. 11. It was the second straight weekly increase and partly reflected the clearing of a backlog of claims in Puerto Rico as the infrastructure damaged by hurricanes Irma and Maria is restored. Last week marked the 141st straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. “The data continue to signal enough strength in employment growth to keep the unemployment rate trending down,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 44,000 to 1.86 million in the week ended Nov. 4, the lowest level since December 1973. Tightening labor market conditions and signs that inflation is steadily creeping up make it most likely that the Fed will increase interest rates next month. The U.S. central bank has raised borrowing costs twice this year and has forecast three rate hikes in 2018. Another report from the Labor Department showed import prices gained 0.2 percent last month amid increases in the cost of imported petroleum and capital goods. Import prices rose 0.8 percent in September. ","

 ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A top U.S. bank regulator has been working to ensure that examiners on the ground have a lighter touch with institutions they scrutinize, but change will take more time, acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika said in an interview on Friday. Bankers at institutions regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have said they have not experienced much change from examiners, who inspect loan-level data on balance sheets as well as firm-wide risk taking and cultural issues. “I’ve spent a lot of time in the field and we are starting to get a sense that examiners are listening,” said Noreika, who last week said he plans to resign from his role after Congress confirms President Donald Trump’s choice for a permanent comptroller. The OCC is “at the front end of this,” he added. “I think we’ll see the fruits of that later.” Bank examiners can wield great power to crack down on lenders. During the Obama administration they toughened up on big banks regarding issues like leveraged lending and exposure to energy- and auto-loan defaults. Trump has promised to cut regulatory red tape across corporate America, including at big banks. Noreika has been aggressive in pursuing that agenda, particularly as a temporary appointee. For instance, he opened up the Volcker rule – a controversial post-crisis reform that was widely disliked on Wall Street – for public comment, the first step before changing the regulation. Noreika told Reuters he expects a proposal for Volcker revisions to be ready by spring. Though based in Japan, MUFG has a U.S. retail banking operation and significant stake in Morgan Stanley. Its decision to change regulators was widely seen as a move from a tough state regulator in New York to an easier-going OCC. In Noreika’s view, examiners must be empowered to use their own judgment rather than simply enforcing rules handed down by lawmakers and bureaucrats in Washington. “It has the effect of undermining bank regulators’ ability to do their job,” he said.

 ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales increased more than expected in October as hurricane-related disruptions eased, but a chronic shortage of houses which is pushing prices beyond the reach of some first-time buyers remains an obstacle. The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday that existing home sales rose 2.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48 million units last month. The NAR said sales in Houston and Jacksonville, regions which bore the brunt of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, had rebounded. Sales in South Florida, however, remained weak last month. The Realtors group said it expected activity in the areas affected by the storms to fully recover by the end of the year. “While this summer’s storms undoubtedly took some steam out of the housing market, the greater problem remains the general lack of inventory,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. “People simply are not moving as much as they used to.” Existing home sales make up about 90 percent of U.S. home sales. They fell 0.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in October and remained well below a 10-year-high 5.70 million-unit pace touched in March. Economists had forecast home sales rising 0.7 percent from September to a 5.42 million-unit rate last month. October marked two straight months of increases. There are concerns that an effort by Republicans in the U.S. Congress to overhaul the tax code could undermine the housing market. Republicans in the House of Representatives have proposed allowing interest payment deductions on mortgage debt only up to $500,000, and only on a primary residence. Their colleagues in the Senate want to keep the existing limit at $1 million but eliminate the deduction of interest on home-equity loans. “We just hope the tax cut plans are not too radical and end up scaring the consumer and make the purchase of a new home even less affordable after taxes,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. The PHLX housing index .HGX was trading higher in line with a broadly firmer stock market. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. The South, which accounts for almost half of the existing homes sales market, recorded a 1.9 percent increase in sales last month. There were also gains in sales in the Northeast, Midwest and West regions. Home sales remain constrained by an acute shortage of properties, which is exerting upward pressure on house prices, and sidelining some first-time buyers, who accounted for 32 percent of transactions last month. Economists and realtors say a 40 percent share of first-time buyers is needed for a robust housing market. The number of previously owned homes on the market fell 3.2 percent to 1.80 million units in October, a seven-month low. Supply was down 10.4 percent from a year ago. Housing inventory has dropped for 29 straight months on a year-on-year basis. At October’s sales pace, it would take 3.9 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 4.2 months in September. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. As a result, the median house price increased 5.5 percent from a year ago to $247,000 in October. That was the 68th consecutive month of year-on-year price gains. In contrast, annual wage growth has struggled to break above 2.9 percent since the 2007/09 recession ended. “Roughly half of what’s available to buy is priced in the upper one-third of home values, leaving scant options for those aging millennials and young families trying to get their foot in the door,” said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow. Builders have failed to plug the inventory gap, citing land and labor shortages, as well as expensive raw materials. A report last week showed housing starts surged 13.7 percent to a 1.290 million-unit pace in October. Housing completions increased 12.6 percent to a rate of 1.232 million units last month, the highest level since February 2008. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completions need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units to bridge the inventory shortfall. Homes sold in October typically stayed on the market for 34 days, down from 41 days a year ago. ","

Shoshanna Delventhal,11232017,Investopedia,11162017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs It’s been a rough year for Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) investors, with shares down 13.5% year-to-date (YTD) versus the S&P 500’s 16.1% gain over the same period. Despite a period of setbacks, one team of analysts on the Street expects America’s largest carrier to outperform the market as it returns to annual service growth by the third quarter of 2018. On Sunday, analysts at Wells Fargo lifted their rating on VZ to outperform from market perform, applauding the New York City-based company’s significant investment in fiber as it prepares for the 5G era. Wells Fargo’s Jennifer Fritzsche increased her price target to $50 from $48, suggesting that “much of the bad news is behind the stock in terms of wireless service revenue declines.” (See also: Sprint Now Offering Free Hulu Service.) Last month, Verizon posted fiscal Q3 results in which profit came in flat at $0.89 per share and revenue grew 2.5% year-over-year (YOY) at $31.7 billion. Wireless, the company’s largest business segment, slumped 2.4% while its wireless service business fell 5.1%. Moving forward, Wells expects a “more rational” pricing environment in wireless as benefiting Verizon the most out of its competitors. She noted that wireless accounts for 68% of the telecommunications conglomerate’s total revenue. Further, Fritzsche sees opportunity in Verizon’s continued investments in fiber technology, which should “generate material cost savings” and reduce the cost of constant customer acquisition as the company is forced to replace old customers lost to churn. “We think Verizon is an attractive yield play, with its 5.3% dividend yield nearly 100 basis points above its long-term average,” wrote the Wells analyst. “We expect Verizon to grow free cash flow nearly 6% in 2018 as working capital headwinds from device purchases moderate, service revenue stabilizes and pension funding requirements drop.” (See also: Verizon Needs Growth To Drive Stock Price Higher.)

In an interview with CNBC on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Quincey responded to Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog indicating that philosophically, he believes in a never-say-never approach. The investment bank lifted its rating on shares of the 125-year global beverage giant to outperform, highlighting upside from an expansion of its beverage lineup and its continued growth overseas. Herzog increased her price target on KO to $51 from $45, remaining upbeat on Coca-Cola’s stake in energy drink leader Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST), along with the company’s research into alcoholic beverages and coffee products. (See also: The New Plan from Coca-Cola's New CEO.)

Buffett increased his holdings in Apple, Monsanto, and Synchrony Financial, and reduced his holdings in International Business Machines (IBM) and Charter Communications, according to a report by Seeking Alpha. When it comes to contemporary investors, few draw the same respect and admiration as Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway has been a giant of the business world for decades, and a recent 13F report suggests the company remains a major player, even as its CEO approaches 90 years of age. Warren Buffett has bought big into Apple (AAPL) over the past several quarters. In early 2017, he doubled his holdings. In the third quarter, he added a more modest amount to his holdings, increasing them by 3%. Buffett also augmented his position in food company Monsanto (MON). He added about 10% to his holdings over the previous quarter, although Monsanto maintains only 0.6% of Berkshire's total portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway added about 20% to its holdings in Synchrony Financial (SYF) during Q3, buying the stock at $28.50 to $31.25 a share. Synchrony occupies about 0.36% of Buffett's total portfolio as of the end of Q3. Buffett bought into IBM (IBM) in 2011, and has since increased his holdings by 40% by making periodic quarterly purchases. Then, beginning in Q1 of 2017, he began to sell off portions of the stock. This quarter saw a one-third reduction of the remaining shares, which were sold at prices ranging between $140 and $156 per share. In 2014, Berkshire bought into Charter Communications (CHTR), and the position is about 1.74% of the company's total portfolio of stocks. Buffett has moved up and down since then, alternately buying additional shares and trimming his holdings. This past quarter, he sold off about 10% of his shares. (See also: Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett Richer Than Poorest Half of U.S. Combined.) Warren Buffett is famous for his long-term investments and they apparently have not changed significantly over the latest third quarter. The top five positions in Berkshire's portfolio account for an astounding 60% of the assets invested. These include Wells Fargo (WFC), Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC), Apple, Coca-Cola (KO), and Bank of America (BAC). All together, Buffett held 43 individual stock positions at the end of the third quarter.

Mark Kolakowski,11232017,Investopedia,11162017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Investors should remain invested in equities and not get scared into selling by pullbacks in the market, according to strategists at Morgan Stanley (MS), as quoted by Bloomberg. In a detailed report of more than 40 pages, Morgan Stanley acknowledges that ""most major asset classes look rich versus history,"" but they add that ""equities can still get richer into end-of-cycle,"" per Bloomberg. Three factors typically send economies into recession and stock markets tumbling, Morgan Stanley says: excessive tightening of credit by central banks, large increases in debt, and extreme optimism among investors that former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once dubbed ""irrational exuberance."" Morgan Stanley does not see any of these three factors in place right now, Bloomberg says. Joseph Zidle of Bernstein Portfolio Advisors LLC, recently among the most bullish strategists, now expects excessive tightening by the Fed to be an inevitable recessionary trigger, though he adds that the bull market may have many more months left to run. Meanwhile, another prominent strategist, Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse Group (CS), expects the S&P 500 Index (SPX) to reach 2,875 in 2018, an advance of nearly 12% from its opening on November 15. (For more, see also: Get Ready For The Coming Bear Market and Recession.) Strategists at Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) remain bullish on equities, for a variety of reasons. Among these: December historically sees gains, including the so-called Santa Claus rally; all major world economies continue to grow; corporate profits are still rising; and the markets are habitually shrugging off political risks. (For more, see also: Charles Schwab Upbeat as Impact Conference Kicks Off.) Investors should be on the lookout for three leading indicators of a downturn in the economy and in equities, Morgan Stanley says. First, when the currencies of emerging market countries and key commodities peak in value versus the U.S. dollar, the S&P 500 tends to reach its own peak about seven to 10 months later. Second, credit spreads, or the difference in yield on U.S. Treasury debt and lower-quality bonds with similar maturities issued by corporate borrowers, tend to bottom out about four months before the U.S. stock market peaks. Third, declining measures of economic activity, such as manufacturing surveys, orders for durable goods, and average weekly hours worked, tend to precede an equity market peak by four to six months. Morgan Stanley suggests keeping some cash at the ready as a prudent measure right now. They also recommend that cautious investors shift their equity holdings into call options on the S&P 500 as a way to participate in further upside while capping the downside. They also recommend using a bear put spread options strategy on high yield debt as a hedge, Bloomberg indicates. (For more, see also: Stock Investors' Handbook for a Bear Market.) Meanwhile, publicly-traded stocks are becoming an increasingly scarce commodity, driving equity prices upward for this reason alone, the Financial Times reports. Share repurchases by U.S. corporations since the financial crisis have added up to a staggering figure of nearly $5 trillion, per the FT. According to research by S&P Global, the number of shares outstanding from S&P 500 companies is about the same as it was a decade ago, even as the index has almost doubled in value. Another factor driving scarcity is the growth of passive investing in index funds and ETFs​, the FT adds, citing analysis by Christopher Harvey at Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC). As these funds grow in size, they need to buy more of the equities in the market indexes that they track, removing yet more shares from general circulation. This only adds to the scarcity of equity shares in the open market, propping up their prices. Harvey sees a parallel with quantitative easing by central banks, which took government bonds out of the open market, thereby boosting their prices.

Matthew Johnston,11232017,Investopedia,11162017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Financial reform is not just about the giants of Wall Street. A bipartisan agreement announced this past Monday would give midsize U.S. regional banks some relief from regulatory scrutiny, serving to free up excess capital that could be distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends or share buybacks, according to the Wall Street Journal. Seven of the most overcapitalized of these midsize lenders include Comerica Inc. (CMA), Zions Bancorp (ZION), Citizens Financial Group Inc. (CFG), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), CIT Group Inc. (CIT), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) and KeyCorp (KEY). As of the close of trading on Thursday, Comerica was up 15.14% year to date (YTD), Zions was up 7.13%, Citizens Financial was up 6.43%, M&T was up 2.20%, CIT was up 10.24%, Fifth Third was up 5.56% and KeyCorp was down 0.77%. (To read more, see: Midsize Banks Poised to Win in the Trump Era.) Currently, banks with more than $50 billion in assets are subject to more stringent regulatory oversight, including having to undergo annual stress testing. The new rules would push that minimum threshold up to $250 billion. Such a move would put less pressure on banks to hold excess capital on their books, freeing up equity that could be returned to shareholders through increased dividend payouts and buybacks. Reducing the total number of shares outstanding through share buybacks over the next couple of years could boost earnings per share by between 13% and 17% for banks like Comerica, Citizens Financial, Zions and CIT, according to the Journal. (To read more, see: Top 4 Bank ETFs as of August 2017.) But it’s not just the midsize banks that would benefit. Smaller banks with total assets less than $50 billion would have more freedom to increase lending activity before reaching the new $250 billion threshold. Many banks remained small in order to avoid complying with the tougher rules that came with having more than $50 billion in assets. That increased room to expand assets would also likely lead to a wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the banking industry, especially for those banks in the $10–50 billion range. There are currently over 50 banks in this range, according to the Journal. While things are looking up for small and midsize banks, don’t forget about the Wall Street giants. Warren Buffet hasn’t. According to a note published earlier this week by Barron’s, Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway still owns a $17.2 billion stake in Bank of America, and with a 9.4% $464.2 billion stake in Wells Fargo, is also that bank’s largest institutional investor.

Liz Moyer,11232017,CNBC,11162017,"Wells Fargo's head of consumer lending was fired this week over a communication he had with another former executive about that person's firing. The San Francisco-based bank said Friday that Franklin Codel, a senior executive vice president who had been promoted to the position as head of Consumer Lending only last year, was dismissed, effective immediately. The dismissal, the bank said, was because Codel acted ""in a manner that was contrary to the company's policies and expectations of its senior leaders."" The bank wouldn't get more specific about the nature of the communication. Reached by phone Codel would only say, ""I'm proud of my career at Wells Fargo."" Codel oversaw 45,000 workers in home lending, auto dealer services, personal lending and personal insurance. Wells Fargo is the nation's biggest mortgage lender and servicer. The executive, based in Iowa, joined Wells in 1993 and was head of home lending from 2015 to 2016, when he was promoted to head consumer lending in a big management shuffle. Wells is still reeling from the fallout of a fake account scandal that cost its former CEO and other executives their jobs after it was discovered workers had created millions of accounts without customer approval or knowledge in order to achieve internal sales goals. Wells said Friday the dismissal didn't involve the business or operations of the consumer lending operations and was not related to sales practices. It said a permanent successor will be named by the end of the year. ""Difficult as this situation is, the decision reflects our commitment to our values and culture and to executive accountability,"" said Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo's president and CEO.

Jake Novak,11232017,CNBC,11162017,"Now that the Justice Department has sued to block the $85 billion AT&T-Time Warner merger and AT&T has vowed to fight it in court, we've learned two things for sure: AT&T doesn't know a real gift when it sees one. And AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson should probably stop talking so much if he doesn't want to bring more scrutiny to the industry and its constantly rising cable bills. The official reasons the DOJ gave for its decision were that the deal will harm consumers with higher prices and potentially stifle innovation. But the growing suspicion is that President Donald Trump's continuing feud with Time Warner asset CNN is behind the effort to block the deal until AT&T agrees to sell off CNN first. That suspicion gained some traction today with the news that the Justice Department's new antitrust chief, Mark Delrahim, didn't voice any real objections to this same merger deal a year ago. Despite that, the administration is denying any singling out of this deal for political reasons connected to CNN. Of course, President Trump himself has done little lately to avoid the appearance of personal anger at the news channel: Trump cnn tweet This is where AT&T continues to be missing a major opportunity. If AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson really believes what he said Monday about how the government's move ""defies logic,"" then this move really is about CNN. And selling CNN for a decent price, when the network is riding a relative ratings high, might be easier now than it has been in many years. Potential buyers include  Comcast (parent company of CNBC), Verizon, Disney, Bloomberg, Sinclair, CBS,  and Hearst. According to Wells Fargo analyst Marci Rykvicker and Reuters Breaking Views, CNN could be worth as much as $10 billion. CNN's recent rise is very much connected to the Trump presidency and the unique viewer interest in all things connected to this White House. But even if he's re-elected, Donald Trump won't be in office forever. This very well might be a temporary high for CNN and AT&T would be foolish not to consider that, antitrust issues or not. Of course, those who believe that AT&T caving to real or imagined Trump administration pressure to sell a news channel is a chilling development for the First Amendment have a point. But selling off CNN and having the network silenced are two different things and should be viewed in that less dire context. AT&T shareholders probably have a different set of priorities. If the merger will otherwise drive prices and profits up for combined AT&T and Time Warner assets, why not call the government's bluff and sell off CNN now and reap those benefits instead? Many experts believe that feud or no feud, there is something to the official DOJ objection to the AT&T-Time Warner combination. Craig Moffett, founder and analyst with MoffettNathanson, told CNBC Monday that the deal could easily lead to higher prices, especially for customers of Time Warner's HBO networks and programming. And that's where Stephenson and his public comments come in. The AT&T CEO is treading on thin ice by claiming there's no logic in blocking the deal. He might be right that the DOJ under both parties hasn't blocked similar cable content and service provider mergers in the past. But many consumer groups consider that a problem that needs to be rectified by nixing this deal, not a justification for it. Cable TV subscription prices are going up and have been for a long time in what Consumer Reports calls an ""annual tradition."" The Consumers Union first noted the correlation of mergers to higher prices back in a 2003 report, and others have followed suit right up to this year with complaints about the repercussions of the Charter-Time Warner Cable deal. CEOs are usually smart enough to steer clear of playing politics. Perhaps Stephenson believes he'll get some kind of political public relations boost by standing up to an administration that remains under serious fire. But on that level, he has less to gain than he has to lose. He can still backtrack and avoid a costly legal battle that might end up in more problems for him and the entire industry than just the nixing of one big deal. The last thing AT&T and its peers need is extra scrutiny on costs even as lower cost streaming networks are encouraging more Americans every month to cut the cable cord. It's been about two weeks since reports first surfaced that the DOJ was pushing back on this merger. So far, neither side is backing down. But only AT&T has the luxury of reversing course and still getting what it really wants. That's a luxury that may not last long as soon as the public gets a better idea of what this deal could cost them. It's time for AT&T and Stephenson to grab that lifeline and stay silent all the way to the bank. ",AT&T should not fight the DOJ on TW merger. It should sell CNN instead—commentary
Bill George,11232017,CNBC,11162017,"Throughout the twentieth century, business schools heralded General Electric (GE) as America's most iconic company. It set the standards in leadership, organization, and effective management processes. The company delivered remarkable results over its storied history, evidenced by its stature as the only original component of the Dow Jones industrial average still on the list. Today GE is becoming a shadow of its former self. On November 13, new CEO John Flannery announced the shrinking of GE's holdings to three businesses – aviation, health care and energy and power – while shedding such legacy businesses as lighting and locomotives. Flannery also declared a 50 percent dividend cut, only the third in GE's history – this one coming when the economy is strong. Even by spinning off $20 billion in assets, GE apparently can't move fast enough to preserve the dividends that millions of retired Americans depend upon to maintain their standard of living. In describing these dramatic cutbacks, Flannery failed to shed any light on the end of GE's tunnel. Disappointed investors drove GE stock down an additional 13 percent in the two succeeding days, bringing the cumulative decline to 40 percent since Flannery was announced on June 12, 2017 as successor to former CEO Jeff Immelt. Credit activist investor Nelson Peltz and his partner Ed Garden (now a GE board member) for blowing the whistle earlier this year, accelerating the CEO transition from Immelt to Flannery. Welch followed a long line of fabled CEOs that includes Charles Coffin (1892-1922), Ralph Cordiner (1950-1963), and Reginald Jones (1972-1981). He moved aggressively as soon as he took over in 1981 to remake GE with his own imprint – even though it meant undoing predecessor Jones's legacy. Recognizing GE needed to be much leaner and faster-moving to compete globally in the 21st Century, Welch slashed its bloated corporate staff, cut several layers of management, and radically changed GE's cumbersome processes to accelerate decision making – enabling GE to move in front of major global competitors like Siemens, Phillips and Mitsubishi. Welch is not without his critics, especially after the recent declines. Numerous observers correctly criticize the dependence he created on GE Capital, which accounted for nearly half of GE's business by the end of his reign. But Welch left GE with a strong balance sheet and abundant cash flow to adapt to any difficulties encountered. The task to correct GE's overreliance on GE Capital fell to Immelt. He understood the issues, but failed to act in his first seven years – violating Welch's maxim that new CEOs are judged by their decisions in their first ninety days. When financial markets crashed in 2008, GE's balance sheet and cash flow were so drained that Immelt had to phone President George W. Bush and ask for a line of credit to keep the company afloat. Yet Immelt still hesitated, not completing the final sale of GE Capital to Wells Fargo until 2016, fifteen years after Welch retired. What other CEO gets fifteen years to make desperately needed changes? How did GE invest the proceeds? By buying back $50 billion in stock at high prices, thus diminishing its balance sheet just as its competitors were bulging with cash. Where was the GE board during these long years of value destruction? Was it asleep, or did management fail to shed light on its difficulties? Now Flannery is remaking the GE board, cutting it from 18 to 12 members, and adding three new board members with industry expertise. The sighs of ""finally,"" are drowned out by the cries of, ""what took so long?"" GE's deep problem today is that it doesn't know what business it is in. There is no central purpose that unites its disparate businesses, or enables them to be greater than the sum of its parts. Even GE's three remaining businesses – aviation, health care, and energy and power – bear little relationship to each other. As CNBC's Steve Liesmann noted after Flannery's announcements, why not go all the way and split GE into three separate companies, thereby eliminating the corporate staff and associated corporate costs? Barring a strategy for revitalization and dominance of its global markets, GE is destined to become an industrial holding company that buys and sells businesses during market cycles and whose only mission is making money. Surely that will not inspire its customers, employees or shareholders. Meanwhile, GE may fall further behind competitors with clarity of mission and strategy like Boeing, Honeywell, United Technologies, and Johnson & Johnson. If anyone ever needed convincing that leadership matters, GE's example provides the proof. Welch was an exceptional leader whose track record is not diminished by the company's steady decline after he retired. Immelt was a talented manager who erred by overly-emulating his predecessor's style when he more appropriately needed to emulate his urgency. In Immelt's early years he lacked the courage to make bold moves, and the discipline to achieve consistent execution. In fairness to Flannery, the jury is still out as he gets started. Thus far, he has given every indication that he is a pure financial manager who lacks vision, strategy, and passion to rebuild GE as a mission-driven, values-centered company.

Ruth Umoh,11232017,CNBC,11162017,"From Mark Cuban to Bill Gates, top thought leaders have confirmed that the future of work revolves around artificial intelligence. Tech hubs, both in and out of Silicon Valley, are now in a race to perfect AI and these companies are seeking top talent to do so. As competition stiffens among HR teams, leading tech companies are now willing to shell out lucrative salaries to fill these roles with the brightest and the best. According to job site Glassdoor, the average AI job commands $111,118 annually — more than twice the U.S. median base pay for full-time workers of $51,220 per year. Though AI has received a bad rap for stealing jobs, the artificial intelligence sector has continued to make a splash in the hiring world. At a recent Adweek Panel, execs at IBM and Microsoft discussed the proliferation of AI and its impact on the job market. ""[AI] is going to create all sorts of new jobs,"" said Jordan Bitterman, CMO of IBM Watson Content and Internet of Things Platform. ""I think it's nothing but upside and exciting for those who know what to do with it."" Aaron Levie, CEO of Box, agrees that AI development will lead to unfounded innovation in a variety of sectors, which will ultimately increase job opportunities. ""If you look at human history, any time there has been some major technological innovation, you ultimately have some significant increase in productivity that then creates the need for a new set of industries, a new set of jobs,"" says Levie. Chuck Edward, Microsoft's head of global talent acquisition, confirmed that artificial intelligence is one of the most in-demand industries in an interview with CNBC Make It and a quick google search shows hundreds of open positions within the company. IBM has also revamped its hiring practices in order to find fresh talent to fill these new AI roles. Joanna Daly, IBM's vice president of talent, tells CNBC Make It that the company will now now be focusing on skill-based hiring rather than education level. So when it comes to AI, which companies are hiring the most new talent? According to Glassdoor research, Amazon, NVIDIA and Microsoft lead the pack. However, an increasing number of financial service firms, consultancies and government agencies are also emerging as major employers of AI talent. The job site also noted that most open AI roles are still located in a few central locations, namely San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles and New York City.

Trading volumes usually drop during shortened trading weeks, opening up the door for more volatile moves.

After the news of the now-infamous ""fake accounts"" scandal broke a little over a year ago, Warren Buffett spoke favorably of the bank's long-term prospects, and it appeared that Berkshire's Wells Fargo stake would remain just under the key 10% regulatory threshold. Well, fast-forward a year, and Berkshire's third-quarter SEC filings show that the Wells Fargo stake has decreased in size by nearly 3.8 million shares. This raises the question -- is Warren Buffett starting to lose faith in Wells Fargo? Image source: The Motley Fool. As Buffett often does after such major news about one of his stock holdings, he remained quiet in the weeks following the news of the scandal. When he finally broke his silence about two months later, many investors were surprised to learn that Buffett hadn't sold a single share in reaction to the news. Buffett told CNN in an interview that the bank's incentive system for its employees was a ""terrible mistake,"" as the bank's sales goals led to a culture of corruption and bad behavior, and that management should have stepped in and made changes long before they did. However, Buffett went on to say that the bank is an ""incredible institution"" with a fantastic record of smart risk management, efficient operations, and profitability that consistently ranked among the highest in the banking industry. Buffett has used the line ""There's never just one cockroach in the kitchen"" many times throughout his investing career to describe what typically happens when a major scandal or other problem with a company is revealed. In other words, when you start looking closer, it's hardly ever just the one thing that's wrong. That has certainly been the case with Wells Fargo. For starters, just a few months ago, a third-party review of the bank's sales practices found that 3.5 million accounts may have been improperly opened, which was 67% higher than the original estimate. The bank has also been accused of wrongdoing in several other smaller-scale scandals recently. It isn't much of a surprise that the scandals would have somewhat of a negative effect on Wells Fargo's business, at least in the short term. The bank's third-quarter earnings showed that this is indeed the case. For starters, Wells Fargo's revenue fell by 2% year over year, while all of the other big U.S. banks' revenue grew. More alarming is that Wells Fargo's profitability and efficiency have taken a hit. The bank's return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) have dropped to 0.94% and 9.06% over the past year, below the industry benchmarks of 1% and 10%, respectively. This is the first time in years that Wells was not the best out of the ""big four"" U.S. banks in both categories. Plus, the bank's efficiency ratio has eroded from 59.4% to 65.5% since the third quarter of last year, another troubling sign. As a final thought, it's important to point out that the reduction of Berkshire's Wells Fargo stake is actually pretty small. It's certainly more than Buffett would need to sell to keep his position from growing, which has been the reason for some previous Wells Fargo sales. In fact, Berkshire said in April 2017 that the company planned to sell about 9 million shares of the bank during the second quarter in order to manage the size of the position. Well, Berkshire ended up selling 11.7 million during the second quarter, in addition to the 3.8 million Berkshire sold during the third quarter. To be perfectly clear, it's entirely possible that the sales are in anticipation of Wells Fargo buying back more shares, which would make Berkshire's stake represent a higher percentage of the company. And since Wells Fargo was given the green light for an increased $11.5 billion buyback plan in June 2017, this could certainly be the reason for some, if not all, of the sales. However, if Berkshire's recent reduction of its Wells Fargo stake was simply for regulatory compliance, it seems odd that the company wouldn't announce this, as it did for the earlier sales. Another possible reason is that Wells Fargo added a massive investment in Bank of America to its portfolio as a result of the company exercising warrants, so it's possible that Berkshire simply wanted to reduce its financial sector exposure a bit. Whatever the reason, the recent sale represents less than 1% of Berkshire's Wells Fargo stake, so there's no reason to get too excited just yet. However, Berkshire's Wells Fargo stake is certainly worth monitoring to see if the Oracle of Omaha may be running short of patience with the bank, especially with the rest of the financial sector firing on all cylinders.

    Is Warren Buffett Losing His Patience With Wells Fargo? -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) climbed 1.6% on Thursday, roughly double the gain in the broader market, as a changeover at the top of the bank industry's newest regulatory body could help the nation's third biggest bank by assets put last year's fake-account scandal in the rearview mirror. Image source: Getty Images. Earlier this week, the current head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Richard Cordray, said that he plans to leave his post by the end of the month. Cordray has led the agency for six years, cracking down hard on banks that run afoul of consumer rules and regulations. ""It has been a joy of my life to have the opportunity to serve our country as the first director of the Consumer Bureau by working alongside all of you here,"" Cordray told employees. ""I trust that new leadership will see that value also and work to preserve it -- perhaps in different ways than before, but desiring, as I have done, to serve in ways that benefit and strengthen our economy and our country."" The CFPB's aggressive posture under Cordray is almost certainly bound to change. On Thursday, it was reported that President Donald Trump will appoint Mick Mulvaney to run the CFPB. Mulvaney is currently in charge of the Office of Management and Budget, a position he will keep while serving as the interim director of the CFPB. Mulvaney is a known critic not only of the heightened regulatory environment in the financial services industry since the financial crisis, but of the CFPB, in particular. The net result is that banks could soon see the CFPB ease its oversight of banks. One could argue whether this is good for consumers or not, but there's no question that it's a positive development for banks. Unlike the other prudential regulators in the bank industry -- the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency -- the CFPB isn't tasked with maintaining the safety and soundness of the bank industry. Its sole concern is on reducing harm to consumers from illicit financial practices. By design, it's innately antagonistic to banks. And few banks have been impacted more heavily by this than Wells Fargo. In September of last year, the CFPB revealed that thousands of Wells Fargo's branch-based employees had spent years opening millions of accounts for customers without the customers' approval to do so. At the time, it may not have seemed like a material issue for Wells Fargo, as the $185 million fine announced by the CFPB in conjunction with other governmental bodies amounted to a small fraction of the $5.6 billion earned by Wells Fargo that same quarter. But it soon became clear that the $185 million fine was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of consequences. Since then, the bank has replaced its CEO, missed out on much of the post-presidential election rally in bank stocks, uncovered similar practices in other areas of its business, and had its reputation severely maligned. The net result is that Wells Fargo has not only seen its revenue take a hit, falling in the latest quarter on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, but its expenses are on the rise, as well. Most recently, the California-based bank earned $4.6 billion in the third quarter. That was down 21% from the second quarter, and it was off 19% relative to the year-ago period. Consequently, when you trace all of this back to the CFPB's revelation last year, it seems logical that shares of Wells Fargo would outperform other bank stocks given the impending changeover at the top of the industry watchdog.

Todd Campbell,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It shouldn't be too big of a surprise that Warren Buffett has soured on IBM (NYSE:IBM). The Oracle of Omaha has been unloading his position in Big Blue all year. But IBM isn't the only stock Buffett's been reducing in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. He's also been selling Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) and, a bit more surprisingly, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Are the best days behind these stocks? Big ships can't turn on a dime, and IBM is a freighter. Plans to reshape IBM back into a growth company are taking forever, and apparently, Warren Buffett's done waiting. He's been steadily selling Berkshire Hathaway's massive stake in IBM all year. IMAGE SOURCE: MOTLEY FOOL. IBM was once one of his biggest positions -- he owned over 80 million shares -- but he sold 17 million shares in Q1, nearly 10 million shares in Q2, and another 17 million shares in Q3. As of September 30, he only has 37 million shares left. I suspect that number is even lower now. IBM was formerly a technology powerhouse, but declining demand for its legacy technology solutions hasn't been fully offset by growing demand for its strategic-imperatives businesses. As a result, its year-over-year revenue has declined in 22 straight quarters. During the past three years, trailing 12-month sales have fallen from more than $100 billion to less than $80 billion, despite its investments in the fastest-growing parts of its business, such as cloud computing. IBM's sales only fell 0.4% from one year ago in Q3, but flat isn't very inspiring. Until strategic-imperatives revenue represents a large enough share of sales to return this company to growth, IBM's shares are likely to remain under pressure. Those businesses produced $34.9 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months, representing 45% of IBM's total revenue, and sales grew 11% year over year in Q3. IBM's heading in the right direction, but there's still work to be done. Could IBM become a bargain-basement buy at some point? Maybe. It's typically been smart to buy IBM when its trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is about 9.5. It's about 12.4 right now, so share prices will need to fall further, or we'll have to see some significant earnings expansion to get to that level again. Until then, it's hard to argue that there aren't better investment ideas out there. It seems Buffett agrees. IBM PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. Warren Buffett added Charter Communications to his portfolio in 2014, and over the past three years, he's more than doubled his money. Apparently, that gain is a bit too much for Buffett to pass up because he sold 10% of his Charter Communications stake in the third quarter. Charter Communications has been on a roll since 2016 when it completed its acquisitions of Time Warner Cable and Bright House. Share prices got an additional boost earlier this year when rumors emerged that Verizon (NYSE:VZ) had approached it about an acquisition, too. However, Charter Communications has given back some of its gains since CEO Tom Ruttledge dashed takeover speculation in September, saying the company's fine going it alone. Perhaps Charter Communications' decision to stay single is enough of an incentive for Buffett to want to book his profit. He still owns 8.5 million shares, so we'll need to see what happens in the fourth quarter before we know for certain that he's moving on to other stocks. In the meantime, I don't see much reason to buy Charter Communications following the past year's rumor-fueled run-up. IMAGE SOURCE: WELLS FARGO. Let's face it... Wells Fargo has lost some of its allure since admitting that workers opened millions of fake accounts to meet heavy-handed sales goals. But that doesn't mean that Buffett's bailing on his second-largest holding. Yes, he did finish last quarter with 3.8 million fewer shares than he began the quarter, but his selling was only to keep Berkshire Hathaway's ownership below 10% so that he could avoid Berkshire Hathaway being classified as a bank holding company. Since Wells Fargo has a big buyback program that's continuously reducing its share count, Warren Buffett has to trim his position every quarter just to maintain it at his target 9.8% ownership level. Although Buffett hasn't soured on Wells Fargo, you might want to. Despite industry tailwinds, including a strong economy and rising interest rates, Wells Fargo's adjusted earnings fell year over year, to $1.04 per share. Its net interest income was flat and its net interest margin, or the spread between how much it pays to fund loans and how much it collects in interest, declined to 2.87% quarter over quarter. Noninterest income, mortgage banking income, and total loans also dipped sequentially. Overall, there's no denying that Wells Fargo will remain a banking giant, but I expect its growth from here will be more tepid than it's been in the past. If so, investors might do better buying a different bank stock. Warren Buffett's famous for his disciplined investment approach. His ability to turn over stones and thoroughly understand opportunities and risks allows him to ride out a stock's inevitable downturns more easily than others. Given his penchant for patience, his selling of shares in IBM and Charter Communications should give investors in those two stocks pause. At a minimum, it suggests going back to your investment diary to make sure the reason why you bought shares still is valid. As for Wells Fargo, it's a different story. Buffett seems committed to keeping his ownership in the bank just underneath the crucial 10% mark. As long as this is true, he won't be propping up Wells Fargo's price by buying more shares. Instead, Wells Fargo is going to trade higher or lower based on its ability to move beyond its account scandal, boost its loan growth, and increase its profit. There's an opportunity for it to do that, but that doesn't mean that it's the best bank stock for new investors to be buying. ","
      
    Why Warren Buffett Is Selling These Stocks -- The Motley Fool

Rich Smith,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. 2017 has not been a great year for Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) shareholders. Verizon stock has lost 15% of its value since the year began, and with barely a month remaining in the year, there's not much time left for Verizon to make up for lost ground. Next year, however, could be another matter. Earlier this morning, investment banker Wells Fargo announced it is upgrading Verizon stock to outperform and assigning the stock a $50 price target over the next 12 months. If the analyst is right, 2018 could see Verizon make up much of its losses from 2017, and deliver a 10% profit -- and Verizon's generous 5.2% dividend yield on top of that. Here are three things you need to know. Operator? Wells Fargo would like to place a call -- to buy Verizon stock. Image source: Getty Images. Verizon reported its fiscal Q3 earnings numbers last month. Revenue inched up only 2.5% year over year to $31.7 billion, and profits were flat at $0.89 per diluted share. Within the company's two main business segments, however, results differed wildly. Things were both better, and worse, in Verizon smaller wireline business (landlines and Fios). Here, Verizon boasted a 1.1% revenue growth rate, but profits declined 11% year over year, and wireline still remains mired at a minuscule 0.8% operating profit margin. In short, the news was not great at Verizon last quarter. And yet, according to Wells Fargo, now that Q3 is in the rearview mirror, ""much of the bad news is behind the stock."" In Wells' opinion, the wireless business is in a trough right now. But going forward, Wells Fargo believes that more ""rational pricing"" among competing wireless providers will boost revenue in Verizon's wireless division. If Wells is right about that, the strong profit margins that Verizon earns in wireless should yield substantial profit growth as revenue resumes growing. As TheFly.com explains today in a note on Wells Fargo's upgrade, however, the analyst sees the greater opportunity for improvement in Verizon's wireline division. According to the analyst, Verizon's continued investments in fiber technology should ""generate material cost savings"" for the company. Fiber may even reduce Verizon's costs of constantly acquiring new customers to replace old customers lost due to customer churn. Earlier this month, J.D. Power and Associates surveyed more than 26,000 cable and internet users and concluded that Verizon's television and internet services are ""Highest Ranked by Customers for Residential Internet and Television Service Satisfaction in the East."" Polling customers on such subjects as network performance and reliability, cost of service, billing, communication, customer service, and programming choices, J.D. Power found that even in an industry as disliked as cable television, customers at least seem to prefer Verizon over alternatives such as Comcast, Cox, and Charter. (For the record, and to be fair, both Charter and Cox topped J.D. Power's rankings in the American South and West regions, respectively. In the North, AT&T trumped all comers. But in the one region where Verizon was allowed to compete head to head with these rivals, it came out on top.) On top of all this, Wells Fargo also argues that with its 15% decline in share price since the year's beginning, Verizon's valuation is looking more attractive today -- but it's here that I fear Wells Fargo's reasoning breaks down. Wells Fargo starts off by describing Verizon as an ""attractive yield play"" based on the company's 5.2% dividend yield -- well and good. The problem is that Wells Fargo then goes on to praise Verizon for its improved free cash flow, and arguing that this, too, is a mark in Verizon stock's favor. But it isn't. Over the past four reported quarters, Verizon has earned just over $15.9 billion in reported net income under GAAP, resulting in an enticingly low (-seeming) P/E ratio of just 11.7. Problem is, Verizon's free cash flow number entirely fails to back up that reported profit. Cash from operations at Verizon over the past year has amounted to $22.2 billion. Unfortunately, minus $16.9 billion in capital expenditure, that leaves free cash flow of only $5.3 billion for the period. Divided into Verizon's $185.3 billion market capitalization, this results in a price-to-free cash flow ratio of 35 -- much more expensive than the stock's low P/E ratio makes it appear. Whatever the prospects for a revival of revenue growth at Verizon's wireless division, and whatever Verizon's chances of pulling its wireline operating profit margin back above 1%, I simply don't believe these prospects are great enough to justify paying 35 times free cash flow for Verizon stock today. If you ask me, Verizon Communications stock simply costs too much. Wells Fargo is wrong to recommend it. ","
      
    Verizon Stock Upgraded: What You Need to Know -- The Motley Fool

John Ballard,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been a huge winner in the growth of mobile commerce. Since 2012, PayPal's revenue has more than doubled, and total payment volume (TPV) has consistently grown more than 20% per year. One of PayPal's most valuable assets is Venmo -- a peer-to-peer (P2P) payment app that is very popular with millennials. Venmo's TPV grew more than 100% to about $30 billion over the trailing-12-month period as of the third quarter of 2017. These numbers understandably make banks feel uneasy. After all, PayPal's mission as a business is to democratize the flow of money, which implies that traditional banking hasn't been very customer-friendly. At the same time, every major bank and credit card company has been forced to partner with PayPal because of its growing 200 million-plus customer base. While major financial institutions appear to be friendly with PayPal, behind the scenes big banks and credit card companies have linked arms to create their own version of Venmo called Zelle, and it's already surpassed Venmo in TPV. Despite what you might think this doesn't spell trouble for Venmo. Below I will explain the distinguishing features of each service which will allow Zelle and Venmo to each settle into its own space within the wide open market of P2P payment services. IMAGE SOURCE: PAYPAL HOLDINGS More than 35 banks, payment processing firms, in addition to Mastercard and Visa, are backing Zelle, which launched about a year ago. In the first half of 2017, Zelle processed $33.6 billion of payments, covering more than 100 million transactions in just six months. It's rapidly being adopted by banking customers. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) are two banks that are backing Zelle, and both have reported strong growth from the new service. Here's what Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan had to say about Zelle on the company's third-quarter conference call: Since launching the Zelle person-to-person experience in June, we've seen significant growth in both the number of transactions and the dollar sent. In the third quarter, peer-to-peer payment sent by our customers increased 46% from a year ago. Here's Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan on Zelle's impact: [O]ur volumes through Zelle this quarter were $4 billion in the third quarter. We processed nearly 14 million transactions and the growth continues. We recently processed $0.5 billion in a single week. Our customers are using Zelle and we look forward to further growth in that area. The rapid growth of a new payment app backed by the largest financial institutions in the world makes the situation look shaky for Venmo, but this shouldn't concern PayPal investors. Two reasons why: Venmo's social features, and a market opportunity that is too big for one service to capture. First, let me tell you how Zelle works. Basically, anyone with a major U.S. bank account can use it. Zelle can either be accessed within the mobile banking app of accepted banks, or you can download the Zelle app on your phone. All you need to send money is an email address or phone number, and there are no fees for sending money. Money sent with Zelle is directly deposited within minutes to the recipient's bank account. This is the key differentiator over Venmo, which serves more like a middleman between your bank and your money. When you send money with Venmo, the money sits in the recipient's Venmo account which has to be withdrawn to their bank, which typically takes one business day. The convenience of Zelle's direct depositing is very appealing, but Venmo has a stickier service because of its social feed. With Venmo, friends can send messages, emojis, or split the bill by sending requests for money. The social features of Venmo is very powerful for attracting merchants to PayPal's payment platform. For example, when Venmo users buy something, they can type a message recommending what they just paid for. It serves as free marketing for the merchant, and merchants love it. PayPal already has more than 17 million merchants signed up on its payment platform, and PayPal's relationships with these merchants should grow even stronger as the new Pay with Venmo feature can connect merchants with a coveted millennial demographic. Venmo has gotten to where it is through millennial adoption, and given its ubiquity among that demographic, I don't see Venmo losing steam with that base. Zelle's lack of social features means it will probably appeal mainly to others who haven't tried mobile payment apps before. Banks could always update Zelle with additional features, but for now, the service is purely about sending money. The opportunity for Zelle and Venmo is too big for any single service to capture all of it. In the U.S. alone, eMarketer forecasts mobile P2P payments to reach $244 billion by 2021, dwarfing the current size of either Zelle or Venmo, so expect to see both of these services, as well as additional entrants, continue to grow very fast.

He was on his way to Seattle to interview for a position with Microsoft, after already interviewing at a number of other big-name technology companies. We got to talking about the technological upheaval that's going on in the bank industry. What I found most interesting was that his perception of the future of banking corresponds closely to something that Hugh McColl, the legendary former CEO of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), once told me -- namely, that the banks that are best positioned to dominate in the future are those that give current and future generations of consumers more control over their money. Image source: Bank of America. To younger generations, using cash and checks is akin to crossing the country on a train powered by a steam locomotive as opposed to the Boeing 737 we were on. There is nothing wrong with steam locomotives per se, but they are slow, cumbersome, and inefficient. As are cash and checks. Why in the world would anybody use either to pay rent, reimburse a friend, or settle up with a plumber? (I ask that somewhat rhetorically because dinosaurs like me still do.) And it isn't just inefficient and cumbersome for the consumer. Banks look at cash and checks the same way. ""We still spend about $5 billion moving cash, currency, and checks around our company,"" said Bank of America's current chairman and CEO, Brian Moynihan, in an interview with CNBC earlier this year. ""Our ATMs distribute about $200 million a day in cash. Do you know how much work it is to get that cash in those machines?"" Talk to any exceptional banker today, and they will tell you the same thing: that the future of banking is less about the storage of money and more about its secure and unencumbered movement. It's accordingly Bank of America's lead in this regard that seems to position the nation's second-biggest bank by assets to succeed in the future. Bank of America chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source: Bank of America. On Monday, Bank of America announced that its new person-to-person payments network, Zelle, processed $1.5 billion worth of payments in October. That was up 90% from the same month last year. And this trend should continue to gain momentum. There are now 2.5 million active users of Zelle, with thousands more signing on every day. ""Zelle makes it easy for consumers to send, receive and request money, allowing them to use the existing contacts on their mobile device,"" explains the bank. ""Funds are sent from one bank account to another typically within minutes, when both parties are enrolled, using only a recipient's email address or mobile number."" Bank of America's success in this regard builds on its customers' rapid adoption of its mobile banking application. At the end of the third quarter, there were 23.6 million active users of its mobile app. The volume of mobile check deposits made on the app corresponds to the work of 1,100 branches -- the steam locomotive of the financial services industry. Image source: Bank of America. For investors, these moves are important for two reasons. First, because they keep Bank of America at the forefront of the technological transformation of financial products and services. There could come a day when all banking is done digitally and remotely, so any bank that isn't positioned for that is facing an uncertain future. Additionally, because digital banking products are much more efficient for Bank of America to provide, they are almost certainly helping it continue to cut expenses. Since Moynihan took the reins at the beginning of 2010, the bank has cut its annual expenses from $70 billion down to $55 billion in 2016. And it isn't done. Last year, the bank vowed to drop its yearly operating costs to $53 billion by 2018, a goal that it is has already achieved on an annualized basis. An efficient cost base is essential to banking. There is the direct benefit of allowing more revenue to fall to the bottom line, fattening shareholders' wallets. But there's also an important indirect benefit to running a lean operation: Efficient banks don't have to cut corners on underwriting in order to earn the type of return investors expect. It's no coincidence that the most efficient banks also tend to have fewer nonperforming loans when the credit cycle takes a turn for the worse. And lest there by any doubt about Bank of America's progress on the efficiency front, its results last quarter speak for themselves. It was the second quarter in a row that the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank turned in a lower efficiency ratio than the notoriously efficient Wells Fargo. This goes a long way toward explaining why Bank of America appears to have supplanted Wells Fargo as Warren Buffett's favorite bank. ","
      
    Bank of America's P2P Payments Business Almost Doubled in October -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. I spend most of my days studying banks and their stocks, but the thing I'm focused on right now has little to do with the fundamentals at the banks I follow most closely -- namely, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). What I'm watching instead is the likelihood that corporate tax reform will make it through Congress. If it does, it seems fair to think that bank stocks will respond positively to the news, as it will mean that more of these banks' earnings will be passed on to shareholders as opposed to the government. Image source: Getty Images. If you rank the companies on the S&P 500 based on net income over the last four quarters, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo make up three out of the six most profitable companies on the large-cap index. In other words, if the corporate tax rate were in fact to drop from 35% to 20%, few companies would benefit more than banks. So what's the chance of tax reform passing Congress? It depends on whom you ask. We need real, fiscally responsible #TaxReform that doesn't explode the nat'l debt. https://t.co/h0iBN2wcoD  Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative organization that lobbies for lower taxes, says that the odds of passing are high. ""I believe the Senate will pass a tax reform close enough to House bill to get it conferenced and signed into law by December 15,"" Norquist wrote on Twitter. ""Odds: 90%....never know how many [Republican] Senators will be in hospital or funk on a given day."" I believe the Senate will pass a tax reform close enough to House bill to get it conferenced and signed into law by December 15.Odds: 90%....never know how many R Senators will be in hospital or funk on a given day.No R votes against on policy https://t.co/n5lirF6Ql0  Analysts at KBW agree that the odds of a tax bill passing are high, but not as high as Norquist thinks. One of the investment bank's lead analysts, Brian Gardner, ""sees no unresolvable differences between the two bills and increases his view on the likelihood of a tax bill passing to around 70-75% from 60-65%,"" KBW wrote in a recent note to clients. Whether these predictions prove accurate will come down to six Republican senators: Ron Johnson, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, Bob Corker, and John McCain. I applaud @senorrinhatch & @GOPSenFinance on completing markup of #TaxReform & moving it through the regular order w/ hearings, debate & amendments. https://t.co/Jsjz5CjGzg  For anyone trying to get a handle on the future direction of bank stocks -- especially big banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, which earn more money than all but a few other companies -- you'll want to watch pronouncements from these senators closely over the next couple weeks.

Image source: The Motley Fool. Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Splunk Inc. 3rd quarter 2018 financial results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should require assistance during the conference, please press *, then 0 on your touch-tone telephone. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ken Tinsley, Corporate Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Great. Thank you, Glenda. Appreciate that. Good afternoon. With me on the call today are Splunk CEO Doug Merritt and CFO Dave Conte. Our press release was issued after the close of market today, and it is posted on our website. This conference call is being broadcast live via webcast, and following the call, an audio replay will be available on our website. On today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including financial guidance and expectations for our fourth quarter and fiscal years 2018 and 2019, our long-term targets for fiscal 2020, the expected effects of new revenue recognition standards; our market opportunity, our strategies, and our competitive position; and our planned investments, including product services, market groups, and sales. These statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us, and actual events or results may differ materially. Please refer to documents we filed with the SEC, including the Form 8-K filed with today's press release. Those documents contain risks and uncertainties, and other factors which may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are being made as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these statements. If this call is reviewed after today, the information presented during this call may not contain current or accurate information. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the press release and on our website. With that, here's Doug. Thank you, Ken. Hello, everyone, and welcome to the call. I am happy to report a strong Q3, delivering revenue of $329 million, up 34% over last year. Our growth continues to come from a combination of new customers and our existing customers expanding their deployments on prem and in the cloud. We saw strength across all of our regions as strong demand for Splunk Solutions continues to grow. With the U.S. federal year-end in September, I'm happy to call out the public sector team and report that they had a great finish to their year with multiple large orders. I also want to congratulate the leadership covering the EMEA theaters for delivering another fantastic quarter. As I've said many times, our market opportunity is massive, and we're still early on the Splunk adoption journey, even within our largest accounts. Q3 also allows me to thank the 7,000 customers, partners, and Splunk fans who joined us at .conf, our eighth annual user conference. Hundreds of innovative use cases were presented. Two of my favorites were Dubai Airports, where Michael Ibbitson joined me onstage to share how they are using Splunk as their data and analytics platform at one of the world's busiest international airports. The team uses Splunk to analyze sensor data in every corner of the airport to drive efficiencies and improve the passenger experience. For example, they're monitoring security stations to ensure passengers get through in less than five minutes; analyzing data from the baggage system to deliver bags on team; Splunking the Wi-Fi network to remove rogue hotspots and guarantee high-speed access; and even keeping bathrooms clean with alerts on bathroom centers. Next up, Dubai Airports is working to save $25 million per year by monitoring its energy consumption. What an amazing showcase for the creativity of our consumers and the power of the Splunk platform. Another great use case came from the Global Emancipation Network, one of our Splunk Pledge recipients, who's using Splunk to identify and work toward eliminating human trafficking activity around the world. In partnership with our Splunk4Good team, the Global Emancipation Network analyzes seemingly disparate datasets from across the Internet, public and private organizations, and other sources to identify trafficking activity, and then teams up with law enforcement to take action. This organization is a fantastic example of applying the power of big data analytics and machine learning to solve one of the world's most complex problems. At .conf, we also showcased our latest product releases, including new versions of Splunk Enterprise 7.0, Splunk Cloud, IT Service Intelligence 3.0, Enterprise Security Content Updates, and User Behavior Analytics 4.0. We are widening our lead in the market with the 7.0 release of the Splunk platform. With our new native support for metrics, which are numerical data points captured over time, Splunk Enterprise is doing to metrics what we did to event data. Our customers can now seamlessly unify, correlate, and visualize logs and metrics in the same platform, enhancing their ability to analyze, monitor, and investigate their environments. With 7.0, our customers can leverage their metrics data with better TCO and at massive increase in speed -- at least 20 times faster. This capability is particularly relevant to the monitoring portions of IT ops and apps delivery, and also for IOT use cases, where telemetry generated by the increasing number of connected devices is metrics based. Finally, this capability creates a launching point for new products and solutions, such as Project Waitomo, which we previewed at .conf. This solution will combine metrics and logs to make infrastructure monitoring easy, specifically built to help systems administrators and site reliability engineers who may have never tried Splunk and need to get it up and running in minutes. Following .conf, we announced two acquisitions this quarter. SignalSense, which offered cloud-based, advanced data collection and breach text and solutions powered by machine learning, and selected assets of Rocana, which provided analytics solutions for the IT market. These additions will further advance our data platform and our machine learning capabilities across Splunk's portfolio. Technologies like these and the teams behind them fit into our broader strategy of leveraging the ecosystem around us as an extension of our internal R&D efforts. We also introduced new advancements of our premium solutions Splunk IT Service Intelligence 3.0, which is revolutionizing event monitoring by combining service context with machine learning. ITSI's new event analytics capabilities broaden the use cases that we can address within IT operations. Our Enterprise Security Content Update is a new subscription service that regularly delivers dynamic, prepackaged security content for Splunk ES customers. User Behavior Analytics, or UBA, 4.0, enables customers to create and use their own machine learning models to identify custom anomalies and threats via a new software developers kit. And we debuted Splunk Essentials for Fraud Detection, a free app that guides customers in how to use Splunk to identify and investigate different types of fraud. This is another example of our ability to leverage the flexibility of our platform to quickly introduce a new solution that helps our customers deal with a critical pain point. I'm proud of our product teams, who delivered an awesome set of releases. We also showcased new solutions developed with our partner ecosystem. Let me begin with AWS, where we continue to deliver on our commitment to provide a comprehensive range of AWS integrations that meet our customer's needs. As just one example, we delivered a new release of the Splunk app Creative US with major enhancements around ingestion speed and usability. We also announced the general availability of Booz Allen Hamilton's Cyber4Sight for Splunk, a solution empowering security analysts and threat hunters with actionable threat intelligence. We released new integrations between Splunk and Puppet, including the Splunk app for Puppet Enterprise, and Splunk ITSI module for Puppet Enterprise to help customers address issues in real time through machine learning. And we showcased multiple Accenture offers powered by Splunk, including Accenture's cyber defense platform and Accenture's POS Zoom, which is a Splunk-based analytics solution for retail customers. Using POS Zoom, retailers can leverage analytics to unlock growth and future customer value. In addition to the rich customer and partner content, we unveiled our next set of activities related to our Splunk4Good initiative, including three training programs to help military veterans and youth train for careers in technology. I'm thrilled that more than 2,200 people have already signed up for this training. Stepping back, with the move to digital, e-commerce, mobile, and social, organizations are now increasingly using machine data to provide critical context to transactions they typically stored in their databases and data warehouses. Splunk's platform is the best solution to enable customers to harness this largely unstructured data and use it to make real-time decisions. Our goal remains the same: to become the standard for machine data in every account -- the ubiquitous machine data platform solving our customer's big data challenges, and IT operations, and application delivery; and security, compliance, and fraud; as well as in business analytics and the Internet of Things. These markets are going through a shift to an analytics and machine learning-based approach, where Splunk is uniquely positioned to lead this change and deliver for our customers. During the quarter, we saw continued momentum in both our Splunk platform and in our premium apps. Starting with IT ops and app delivery, wins in this quarter include SunTrust Bank, who expanded its use of Splunk Enterprise and ITSI to gain real-time visibility into potentially fraudulent digital activity; monitor mission-critical KPIs, like customer response times; and ensure compliance. Thanks for our partner Trace3 for our help with this win. Longtime customer Vodafone Egypt expanded its use of Splunk Enterprise to gain 360-degree visibility across all customer touch points, from their websites, mobile app, and customer call centers. Deakin University, a leading university in Australia with our 53,000 students, expanded with Splunk Enterprise to manage its IT operations and networking environment. Other notable customer wins include Defense Health Agency, BCD Travel, Hong Kong's Li & Fung Limited, and Johns Hopkins University. Moving to security, where the market opportunity is being driven by an ongoing SIEM replacement cycle, as well as a multitude of security events in the past several months. Security departments are increasingly realizing the need to shift to an analytics-based security strategy, an approach that Splunk has been defining and driving for years. We are leading and helping our customers with this migration from structured legacy SIEM to an analytics-based approach. Notable wins in the quarter include the Smithsonian Institution, who upgraded its use of Splunk to improve threat detection and mitigation across its world-famous museums and research centers; a large federal agency who expanded their use of Splunk Enterprise and ES to meet their strict compliance requirements. Thanks to our partners at Spear and Cumulus for their work on this opportunity. Daimler, the German automotive group, signed a multi-terabyte deal to replace its legacy SIEM with Enterprise ES. The group will use Splunk as its nerve center for security, providing insights across the entire organization. The University of Leeds, one of the largest higher education institutions in the UK, expanded its use of Enterprise and ES as their SIEM. The university is already using Splunk and IT ops to monitor their networks. Thanks for our partners at Softcat for their contribution to this expansion. Splunk is the strategic technology at the Department of Homeland Security, which made a major expansion to replace its legacy SIEM with ES and DHS datacenter. Other notable customer wins include the CallidusCloud, Domo, U.S. Army, Arizona State University, the UK's Derbyshire Fire & Rescue Service, and Banner Health. And we continue to see our champions expanding their use of Splunk to monitor critical business services to understand the increasing amount of data coming from centers and connected devices. The Dubai Airports use case I mentioned earlier is a great example of that. Another example in Q3 was our customer Norsk Helsenett, a service provider for Norway's healthcare sector. They made a large expansion of enterprise to move beyond IT and security to monitor the usage of their healthcare services to drive care improvements to their customers. I was lucky enough to be in the Nordics to sign the contract with Norsk in person this quarter, and we look forward to seeing them again at our upcoming Splunk Live in Stockholm. And as we do each quarter, we highlight a handful of customers who standardize on Splunk as their data platform. A few of this quarter's customers include 21st Century Fox, a Splunk customer for nearly five years, who signed an EAA to standardize on Splunk, and will now use the platform on AWS across all IT and business operation centers to gain visibility across the company in IT, security, and in the business. Our longtime customer Atlassian expanded its EAA in Q3 as well. Atlassian uses Enterprise and ES for security globally. This expansion moves Splunk further into IT to help ensure that Atlassian products, such as JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket, and their recent acquisition, Stride, are always available to the customers and their staff. Nutanix is another great example of a new technology alliance partner who is also leveraging Splunk to improve IT and security within their own organization. Nutanix quadrupled its use of Enterprise for visibility across IT and security. As you'd guess, the team is running Splunk on Nutanix software and driving great scale on TCO. Thanks to our partners at Avant Garde, who were instrumental in the deal. And leading software development platform Github expanded their use of our solutions to ensure their platform stays online and is secure. In engineering, Github will increase use of Splunk throughout their development and operations life cycle. And in security, the instant response team will use Splunk to identify and respond to attacks. Our cloud business continues to grow, with Q3 being our largest quarter ever. Our customers are leveraging the Splunk platform to analyze their data, regardless of its location, on prem or in the cloud. A few of our cloud wins this quarter include PIMCO, the investment management firm, who's adding Splunk Cloud to provide visibility and insights into its business critical applications; and ATB Financial, a new Cloud customer who signed a multiyear agreement to use Splunk to improve customer experience by ensuring availability of its online banking systems. A few other cloud wins include Blackbaud and the Texas Department of Transportation. In addition to the joint partner solutions we unveiled at .conf and the customer wins with our partners that I mentioned above, I want to call out a few go to market wins in Q3, starting with AWS, for a large European pharmaceutical company purchased Splunk Enterprise and ES through the AWS marketplace to replace the legacy SIEM. AWS was also instrumental in closing a large rental car company as a new Splunk Cloud customer, again through the AWS marketplace. On the security side, we had several joint wins with our managed security partner, the Herjavec Group, including two new Splunk Cloud Security customers. We've seen an increase in demand for skilled managed security service providers that support hybrid offerings, and we're continuing to invest in our managed service security providers like the Herjavec Group. We were humbled with new recognitions and awards in Q3. One in particular to call out is Fortune Magazine naming Splunk to its inaugural Fortune Future 50 List, which highlights the most forward-looking, innovative companies in the world. In summary, it was a strong quarter, and as always, I'm very proud of our Splunk team. We have a tremendous opportunity in front of us. We are delivering high value to our customers, who are expanding their adoption of Splunk as their platform for machine data analytics and for machine learning, both on prem and in the cloud. Splunk is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity, and we are pursuing it aggressively. Thanks again to all of our customers and partners, and thanks to everybody who works at Splunk. And now, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Dave Conte. All right. Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In Q3, we exceeded our overall plan, and as Doug said, we did so on the strength and outperformance across all regions. Q3 revenues totaled $329 million, a 34% increase over Q3 of last year. Total billings were $382 million, up 38% over last year. Cloud revenues totaled $24.4 million, and overall software revenues, which include license and cloud revenue, grew 34% year-over-year. Customer success remains our top priority, and adoption of our platform and solutions are driving software bookings growth, where more than 80% came from existing customers. We also added more than 450 new customers in the quarter, and we recorded 581 orders over $100,000.00. At our analyst meeting in January, I outlined a number of metrics to follow on our path to revenues of $2 billion in fiscal '20, one of which was ASPs. Consistent with our cohort, as customers continue to realize value from our product, their adoption of Splunk from one to many use cases increases, ultimately leading to our goal around standardization on our platform, like the EAA examples Doug just walked you through. Consistent with adoption overall, in Q3, the ASP for the 581 orders greater than $100,000, which includes two of the largest cloud transactions we've ever recorded, was this highest in our history, reflected continued value delivery from our platform. We'll update you on the full year ASPs once the year is complete, but I expect we'll be on track to our fiscal '20 annual ASP target. In Q3, international operations represented 24% of total revenues, consistent with previous levels and comparable on a year-over-year basis. Education and professional services represented ten% of revenue in Q3, which is typical for the quarter in which we hold .conf. Now, turning to margins and other results, which are all non-GAAP. Q3 overall gross margin was 84%, consistent with our expectations and reflecting improving cloud gross margins. Operating income was $32.3 million, representing a positive margin of 9.8%, better than planned, due to our outperformance on the top line. Q3 net income was $25.1 million, and EPS was $0.17 per share, based on a fully diluted weighted average share count of 144.4 million shares. Now, turning to cash generation and liquidity. Cash flow from operations was $52.3 million. Free cash flow was $46.9 million, and we ended the quarter with about $1.1 billion in total cash and investments, which reflects approximately $42 million paid during the quarter for the two acquisitions. Now, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we expect Q4 total revenues of between $388 million and $390 million, with a 16% non-GAAP operating margin. This translates to full-year revenues of between $1.239 billion and $1.241 billion, up from our prior high-end guidance of $1.215 billion. And we're increasing our full-year cloud revenue estimate to $90 million, up from our prior guidance of $85 million. We're also raising our full-year billings estimate to $1.485 billion, up from $1.450 billion, and we're raising our cloud billings estimate to $170 million, up from the $150 million we previously guided. With our increased full-year outlook and reflecting our performance through the first nine months of the year, we now expect operating margin to be closer to 8.5%, up from our original 8% estimate. Now for EPS, remember, because we expect to remain profitable on a non-GAAP basis for Q4 and the full year, full-year EPS calculations, you should use a fully diluted share count of approximately 146 million shares in Q4, at a 144 million shares for the full year. Looking beyond this fiscal year, we're excited about the success our customers are realizing from our offerings, and we expect that success to be reflected in our financial performance. With that, I wanted to provide top-line estimates for the next two years. We expect next year revenues to total approximately $1.55 billion, and we reiterate our fiscal 2020 total revenue target of $2 billion. As we continue to scale our product and field capabilities to capitalize on our market opportunity, we will accelerate these and other investments while maintaining our spending discipline and delivering about a 200 basis point margin expansion in fiscal 2019. This should result in non-GAAP operating margin of around 10.5% next year, on pace to achieve our fiscal '20 target of 12% to 14%. Now turning to the new revenue recognition accounting standard, 606, which we'll adopt next year, our fiscal '19, the seasonality revenues will be different than what we've experienced historically. Specifically, total revenues have typically been split between 42% to 58% first half to second. Under 606, we expect this will steepen some and be closer to 40%-60%, with almost all of the impact in our seasonally smallest Q1. As we conclude the current year and finalize our 606 adoption, we'll update you with more specifics to help ensure our models reflect the momentum we see in the business. More to come on this topic, obviously, in the near-term. In closing, our team continues to execute on our mission to deliver high value to our customers, and we're committed to driving the best possible customer experience through continued investments in our products, solutions, the cloud, our global reach, and, of course, our people. Overall execution and results in Q3 were excellent, and I'm looking forward to a strong finish to the year. Thanks so much for your time and interest. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, if you have a question, please press the * then the number 1 key on your touch-tone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the pound key. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please place your line on mute once your question has been stated. And our first question comes from the line of Brian White from Drexel. Your line is now open. Okay, great. Great quarter, guys. When we think about the quarter and the outlook, it's probably one of the strongest outlooks we've seen in a long, long time from Splunk, and now you're going out to even fiscal '19 in giving guidance. Maybe just give us an update on the competitive landscape. It seems like you're really starting to show more momentum than we've seen in recent memory. Thanks. Yeah, it was a really nice quarter. The competitive landscape remains really similar to what we've seen. Our win rates against the track competitors are generally in the 80% to upwards to 95% rate. And it just feels like there's a growing understanding of the value of Splunk, especially when you get to high intensity, production-oriented use cases, and you deal with more and more of the issues of a really broad and complex set of data. And I think our solutions-oriented strategy continues to help us as well with solutions like Enterprise Security, ITSI, UBA, and others, helping our customers understand what we do, how to use Splunk, and how to get quick time to value. And just a follow-up, on 606, Dave, is this a revenue headwind in fiscal '19? You gave numbers, but is that a headwind, a tailwind? And just remind us how we should think about the impact on deferred revenue. I remember we talked about $300 million or something in that range. Yup, yeah. Hey, thanks, Brian. The headwind, tailwind, is ultimately going to be dependent on the ending balance sheet. And, as you mentioned, when you adopt 606, there's an impact where you remove a certain amount of deferred revenue. The absolute number -- again, at Analyst Day, I used 300 as an example. We've got to get to the end of the year to actually quantify what that impact will be. So, headwind, tailwind, you get the detriment of a removal of deferred revenue; you get the benefit of upfront revenue on our ever-increasing subscription business. But we really have to get to the end of the year to quantify that. Okay, great. Congratulations. Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Brian. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Thanks very much and congrats, guys. It's phenomenal, phenomenal results. Thanks, Brad. Thanks, Brad. Sure. So first for Doug. Doug, in the quarter you put out a press release elevating Susan St. Ledger's role. I guess this quarter's result is early evidence of that. What, if anything, changes operationally in elevating her? And then related, on go-to-market, what's the latest update on leadership in EMEA? Good questions, Brad. So with Susan being promoted to President, she's now President of Worldwide Field Operations, and we added in a few areas like marketing to her responsibility. The core driver of that is, as we're looking to the next phase of our growth, beyond $2 billion, it's really important for us to gain leverage and scale across every single customer touch point that we have. She had a broad scope. I think we've broadened that a little bit more. Where I think it becomes even more important is when you add in the significance of our transition to a subscription focus, then elements like self-service, touchless transactions, from initial awareness on broad-based, above the funnel market orientation all the way through to support and renewals become just a critical portion of the machinery that needs to execute flawlessly on that horizontal basis across these different functions. I think moving -- ensuring that all those customer touch points are under one leader, and that she's got the job title and responsibility within the company clearly distinguished to make whatever moves were necessary is a good thing, and she's doing a fantastic job, as we all saw this quarter. On Europe, as you saw, we had a really nice quarter in Europe again. I think a lot of that is the luxury of the strong bench that I'd highlighted in Q1. I thought that we had some strong sub-theater leaders, but many of them are early in their tenure, and we spent a lot of time building out that management structure across EMEA and also across APAC, so we can get that scale in the international region that we're seeing and enjoying in the public sector in America's theaters. And she's had a really nice in-bound set of demands and interests for that position. She's down to the finalists, and I'm -- hopefully, you'll see an announcement coming out relatively soon. Awesome. And if I could just ask one follow-up for Dave. Dave, cash flow came in a little bit lighter than we had expected. If I look at DSOs, they look like they're a bit higher than trend. Other than linearity, is there anything we should be thinking about here and anything you might be doing to improve collections or better manage linearity of the business over time? Thanks. Yeah. No, we're pretty satisfied with the performance for the quarter, and candidly, for the year. We obviously had almost 600 greater than $100,000 orders. Those can impact linearity, as you would imagine. We think about cash flow on an annual basis. We don't guide it quarterly. And I guess I'm on a live call, Ken. I can go ahead and say we feel that we're on track for $250 million of operating cash flow for the year. So, I just want to echo Doug's commentary. The performance in the field was obviously quite strong, and we're very proud of the transactions that we closed. And I don't think there's anything to read into DSOs or quarterly cash flow. Great to hear. Thanks again, guys. All right. Thanks, Brad. Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Hey, guys, strong quarter. One for Doug and one for Dave. So, Doug, can you drill down on security demand? You mentioned that there was some impact, it sounded, from both the upgrade cycle on SIEM as well as recent events. How much of an impact do you feel like you've had from both Ransomware and Equifax from this summer, and what changes have you seen in terms of the shift in spending to SIEM? Good question, Michael. Yeah, we've been, I think, uniquely touting -- I think we probably started this trend four or five years ago on moving from an independent product-driven messaging to the need for broad-based security analytics, for people to really get a feel and understanding of anything that could be happening across the constantly changing cyber landscape that these guys have got to -- have to defend and be familiar with. And I think that the fundamental power of Splunk as a machine data platform, the schema-on-read architecture we always talk about allows multi-use case opportunities within the security departments, obviously, and outside security as well, is really resonating a little bit more clearly with these guys, as the attacks were coming fast and furious from multiple different areas, from ransomware, to kind of classic breaches, to insider threat, and other behavior analytics you can be driving as well. And as we all know, security is a boardroom topic. It is a critical agenda item for the exec team in most companies. And I think we're definitely seeing that with our execution in the security space over the past couple quarters. Okay. And then, Dave, obviously it's fine on billings too. It didn't look offhand like a mix shift, but license was particularly strong. So, was there any mix shift or less mix shift toward subscription at all this quarter and consequent positive impacts on rev rec? Again, we think about mix annually, as you know. I mentioned in prepared remarks, we recorded our two largest cloud transactions in our history. I raised our outlook for cloud revenue and cloud billings for the year, so I think we're feeling confident with our execution around our move toward subscription overall. Obviously, that -- we laid it out as a three-year journey back in January, and I think we're tracking well. Obviously, with the seasonally strongest and largest Q4 just ahead of us, as you guys know, individual transactions can move what will ultimately be our full-year metric, but the execution in the field around satisfying customer demand for how they consume our products, whether it's on prem with the subscription license or in the cloud with our SaaS service, has been really strong. Okay, Dave, thanks a lot, and congrats again on the quarter. Great job. Thanks, Michael. Thanks, Michael. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks, guys. for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter. One question for the team and just one follow-up specifically for Dave. Obviously, you touched on the curated experience down at the analyst session at .conf, and obviously, you talked tonight about security, ITSI, UBA, but wondering if you could give us just some more color in terms of how you think those curated experiences, those curated apps, are impacting business now. Any of those newer ones starting to inflect? And then as you start to scroll forward, '19 and '20 year guidance, I mean, how do you think about those curated experiences driving growth? Will it be free experiences just driving the base platform or add-ons? And then just one quick follow-up for Dave. Thanks, Phil. We're seeing increasing uptake around a few of these, but they're still early on. And those curated experiences aren't solutions; and again, we have lots of terminology around the thickness of the solution at Splunk. But different clustering of data visualizations, dashboards, alerts, remediations, some light workflow that specifically answer the needs of a set of users within the account so that they're not starting from scratch with the underlying Splunk Enterprise platform. They obviously can still do that, but they get what they need much more cleanly out of the box. This Project Waitomo that I talked about, again, on the call and that we previewed at .conf is a good example of one of these, where we're combining the metrics to our capability with the classic streaming log orientation of Splunk to really help systems administrators and site reliability engineers get up and running literally in minutes. It's a really cool experience as far as immediate power of Splunk. And we actually, for Waitomo, strip out things like our -- the flexibility of the search and investigate piece. It is a purpose-built view on top of Splunk Enterprise. I think that will increasingly be the way that we see our land opportunities happen in the coming two years. And the whole point is, let's get that -- first, let's make it easier to get that first set of data in, increase the time to value or decrease the time to value, increase the time to power for our different customers, so that we accelerate that use case journey across multiple different departments to eventually drive that more EAA platform-ish type sale that we're seeing with some of our bigger accounts. That said, I think the answer is it will depend on the account and the segment with the larger strategic accounts by getting a little bit less velocity on some of these curated insight experiences, and the newer accounts and more mid-size accounts probably getting a lot more of those and demanding those more strongly. Got it. Thanks, Doug. And then, Dave, at one point last year you talked about Splunk Cloud being about a five-point headwind to its margins. I'm wondering if you can give us an update into just about how that business is scaling from a margin perspective. Yeah. Hey, Phil. We're feeling good about the trajectory for Splunk Cloud from a margin perspective. Recall last quarter, I reported that we hit a milestone in Splunk Cloud in Q2 of 30% positive gross margins, and that we expect it to be about that level for the remainder of the year. And that held true for the third quarter. So, good progress, good scale, and heading in the right direction. Got it. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Phil. Thanks, Phil. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Thank you. I have a question for Doug and maybe a follow-up for Dave. And Doug, my question is actually a follow-up to Mike's question, to Michael Turits' question. So these are really strong results, as a couple of people had said so far today, and we're seeing decent results from a lot of software names, but not so much in the security space. I mean, that's been a little bit mixed. Can you talk a little bit about the strong aggregate momentum we're seeing here in your numbers relative to what we're seeing in security? It sounds like security is doing pretty well, but are you seeing better results in the other areas, or is security keeping up, which would kind of you make you somewhat of an anomaly given some of the recent reports? Hey, John. So this quarter's security actually did really well for us. We talk about it being in the 40% to 50% range. It was over 50% for us in this quarter. And the IT sector is still healthy, growing, and vital to our future, and we see these trade-offs back and forth every quarter. A lot of these security wins I talked about, they started with IT operations and then moved over to security, so we see it moving both ways. But just going back to what do we -- there was a mixed bag in the security arena right now, and what we're -- where I see people leaning in for Splunk is we provide an abstraction layer with Splunk Enterprise and then solutions like ES that is agnostic to the typically hundreds of different security solutions that most decent-sized organizations have across their security landscape. And what I hear from a lot of CSOs is, yeah, I mean, it'd be nice to get the benefits of a next generation X, Y, or Z in the security landscape, but what I really need is, I need to be able to tie all of those together into a platform, into what I had called the nerve center of the brain, so I can take advantage of all the capability, and data, and strength of the multitude of different solutions I've already paid for and deployed. And I think that's why we're seeing some good traction. And I think the SIEM replacement cycle works to our advantage as well. Got it. Okay, that makes sense. Thanks, Doug. And, Dave, if I could -- actually, another follow-up for Brad's question. I think I understood where you're kind of saying. I know you don't guide to cash flow, but as he pointed out, AR was greater than -- was a greater use of cash than we anticipated anyway, and I assume he did, too. But I just want to make sure I understand. You've signed the -- Doug mentioned a lot of large deals, a lot of enterprise agreements. Those are typically signed -- not all of them. They're typically signed at the end of the quarter, and I just want to make sure -- I mean, I would expect to see those receivables be collected next quarter benefiting cash flow in that period. And the reason for the question is, I mean, every number looks really strong. It doesn't look bad. It's just a little low. It's the only one that's a little lower, more than where people were estimating. Yeah. Again -- hey, John -- I feel very good about our cash collections, the process, the age of our receivables. We had the benefit in the quarter from a DSO perspective that federal year-end is September, as we all know. And the government tends to pay on time. Not always. But I don't think there's any -- there's no news. There's no there as it relates to DSOs or cash flow. It was a really strong quarter. You can see that across all of our financial -- relevant financial metrics. And the benefit is in receivables, and you bet we're gonna collect it next quarter. So, for the year, we're on track for our $250 million of operating cash flow. And in any particular quarter, one large order comes in on one timeline versus another, can affect the quarterly DSO. But overall, the review that we do internally, the quality of the balance sheet is really high. And again, you see it on the P&L. Great. That's all clear. Nice job, guys. Thank you very much. Thanks, John. Thanks, John. Operator Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is now open. Hey, thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones. Doug, one for you. Can you talk a little bit toward the AWS relationship? You mentioned a couple of interesting wins this quarter, which is great. I'm just wondering, your relationship with them seems to be different than a lot of the other vendors. For example, they offer Elastic, and Elastic is kind of probably hurting because of that. They do the Hadoop, and their works are hurting. Well, you actually seem to have a very good kind of working relationship where they are actually pushing you. So, can you talk to kind of the motivations there and how you see that evolving? And then just one quick one for Dave. I assume your '19 guidance in terms of revenue and margins is all 606 based. Just to clarify that, so that there's no kind of confusion there. Thank you. Yeah. Hey, Raimo. Yes. Our outlook for fiscal '19 and fiscal '20 are based on 606. And then on the AWS front, yeah, I mean, we're really happy with our relationship. As I've said for a couple of years, they still continue to commission and quota credit their reps, and any of these partnerships are a true multi-year journey. The number of reps at AWS that actually understand Splunk now grows quarter after quarter. As our AWS-dedicated team spends more time educating those folks, we get more lunch and learns, and drink nights, and just have the reps at the field level get to know each other. And we're seeing an increasing cadence of deals come in through that AWS reference approach. And with our marketplace footprint, I think we'll see even more. And ideally, more of those being touchless as people go through the marketplace itself. I think what's a little bit different about us versus the core open source components is that at the heart of Splunk is a semantical layer above different aspects like file systems, storage, vehicles, transport mechanisms. And a lot of what I've been talking about with the data orientation long-term for the company is it doesn't really matter long-term whether we transport data through a Splunk Forwarder or through a cost interface. It doesn't matter whether we store data in the Splunk Index or store it in another format. And because of that, within the AWS landscape, I think we add unique value on top of the different services that they offer. And the message that we are continuously trying to harp on, and you might see a little bit more of that from our marketing department, is Splunk and. Now, Splunk and the Hadoop open source ecosystem, Splunk and data warehouses, Splunk and Palo Alto. And as long as we keep that ability to add value around the core components other people offer, then hopefully, customers will continue to feel like we're worth being a strategic vendor for them. Perfect, thank you. Congratulations. Again, great quarter. Thank you, Raimo. Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nate Cunningham from Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us a rough sense of what the attach rates are looking like on new business for both ES and ITSI? No, I don't think that we disclose those. Yeah. Hey, Nate. It's Dave. We obviously monitor that pretty carefully, but we don't disclose that as a metric externally. We might do so on an annual basis, but not for the quarter. What we can say, though, is the attach rate is increasing. And you hear it in a lot of the examples that Doug talks about in terms of security, the move away from the legacy SIEM folks, just in terms of breadth of capability. So, both in security with ES and in IT with ITSI, we're pleased with the attach rate. We've got plenty of room to go. Okay, fair enough. And as we think about the fiscal '19 guidance, are you assuming any change in the velocity of new customer addition? Well, our goal is by 2020, that we reach the 20,000 customer milestone. So, as we think about new customer acquisition, obviously, to get to that number, we do expect to see an uptick in terms of the annual addition, which, of course, means the quarterly addition, yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Nate. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open. Hi. Thank you very much. Dave, the first question is for you. Really strong billings results this quarter and acceleration, very strong acceleration to call it 38%. And yet, if I look at the guidance for the year, it would suggest that you're anticipating that year-over-year billings would perhaps be back below a 30% growth rate. Was there something, for instance, in the Q3 results, government or otherwise, that would suggest such a deceleration, or is there something missing, perhaps, in terms of why billings would break perhaps below 30% for Q4? Yeah. I mean, I think, first and foremost, as you would expect, Q4 is a tougher comp than any of our other quarters, typically. We obviously had an extremely strong quarter in the public sector space, as you would imagine. But also, a significantly strong performance with our cloud business. And that performance in the quarter certainly led to a billings contribution. Two of our largest -- our largest cloud transactions in our history were recorded in the quarter, and was a basis for me to actually raise our full-year revenue and billings guidance for cloud. So, we'll see how the composition comes in the fourth quarter. That's always been part of the fun here in terms of that mix estimate -- how much is cloud, how much is term, how much is perpetual. That obviously can have some impact on billings. Okay. Okay. All right, fair enough, then. I also wanted to revisit on the customer acquisitions. I think in this press release you indicated 450 new customers. I don't know what the net customer count -- I think it was just under 15,000. And so, you've been flat for the last -- call it three quarters, round numbers. What do you think causes you to get to that 20,000 number in '20, because I think you need a little bit of acceleration, which so far, this year really hasn't experienced? What do you think changes that? Let me step back. And to just make sure I start with my happiness around the adoption in growth rates within our current customers. It's a great feedback signal that they understand the power of our offerings and the strategic nature of Splunk as a data platform that can really power a whole host of use cases across a multitude of different departments. However, I agree with you. I definitely would like the number of new customers to be higher. We've targeted a higher number of new customers over the course of that three-year guidance period that we talked to you guys about. And we are making continued investments in the global reach of our field to increase capabilities and appeal to new customers. We've got to continue, also, to invest in the customer success. That's our number one corporate priority. But really, as Dave has said for as long as I've been listening to these calls, before I even became a Splunker, that coverage is his number one concern area. And it's a choice every year on where we rotate coverage to make sure we can continue to drive that cohort that we're so proud of, of increasing adoption with end customers, as well as dedicating enough overall resourcing, both direct and indirect, for that net new customer piece. We have been making a lot of investments this year. Like so many of these, I think it takes a few quarters to get people onboard, to get them trained, put the programs in place, experiment and figure out what's really working and what's not. But it is a top priority for us through FY '19 and into FY '20 to ensure that we get to that 3,000 or more customers per year that we told you guys about at Analyst Day. Okay. Well, many thanks to you guys. Sounds like it was a really good quarter, particularly in the security area. Best of luck. Cheers. Thank you. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Yeah, thanks, guys. Just one question for me. Doug, with several different purchasing and deployment options, do you find that deal cycles could start to accelerate going forward, as the pricing model, or where Splunk's deployed -- is it an inhibiting factor or friction for additional adoption? I mean, that is another one. When we think about what -- how do we continue to drive the velocity for that $2 billion target and the increased number of transactions and customers, that is part of what we're focused on. These insights, packages, what's so-called the curated -- or what we'd probably describe as the curated experiences at Analyst Day are one of many vehicles that we're looking at, which is how do you create a pricing mechanism for underlying Splunk Enterprise that adheres to the solution that's on top and create a quick bundle that can do even a simpler job of landing into new accounts. And I think moving to subscription, so that customers increasingly just have the choice of one, two, or three-year terms. And the only big decision is, do I want to run it in my own private cloud, or I do want to run it in their public cloud? I think that's another big lever for us to cut down on the cycles that many of our reps have to go through to walk our customers and prospects through all of the options that they have with Splunk. Great, thanks. Congrats again. Thank you. Thanks, Matt. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Let's go to the next question, please. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anne Meisner from Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Thank you, and congrats on the great quarter. Thanks, Anne. So, you guys called out two very large cloud transactions, and you increased your guidance there, so it sounds like cloud is really performing nicely, ahead of your own internal expectations. Are there one or two specific items that you can point to that are really driving the business? So, for example, is it the prepackaged app functionality for cloud, such as the AWS functionality, that's really starting to drive that acceleration? I honestly think that it is the acceleration of cloud across the enterprise sector that's dragging us. And then I think that some of the work that we've been doing to have the specific AWS apps, we now have a number of them in AWS, is a great landing point for people going to AWS, as well as, I do think it's easier for us and our customers to understand what an ES and Splunk bundle looks like, ES and Splunk Enterprise, or an ITSI and Splunk. And I think the more that we can get to a focused solution delivery for our customers that, of course, drags in Splunk Enterprise behind it, but it is something specific to the needs of that buying center or user, the better velocity we have, and the quicker that our customers understand the power of Splunk and get an ROI on their investment. And it's a little bit easier in cloud just because we can kind of preassemble all the bits for our customers, and instead of having the classic arrival of hardware, PS, or a ProServ, or some other consulting assistance that goes with an on prem piece. Okay. Thank you. Very helpful. Thanks, Anne. Thanks, Anne. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Yeah. I have one for Doug and a quick follow-up for Dave. Doug, to follow up on Anne's questions, the two large cloud transactions in the quarter, I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail about those. First, what was the use case? Was it security, or do you have any visibility into that? And were these existing on premise customers that moved to the cloud, or are they in a hybrid environment, or new customers, or something else? Just curious there. So, on the use case basis, I think one was security-focused, and one, I think, is multi-use case, and one was a net new cloud customer, and one was an existing customer. And I think from an existing perspective, there was some on prem. Yeah, I think the existing one is hybrid. Yeah, but it's a minimal amount. I mean, they were really looking for Splunk to help them with their data that they were hosting in the cloud. So, that's where we became more applicable. And to Anne's earlier question, why we had great momentum is, customers were looking to associate our solutions with proximity to where their data resides, which is why it's so important that we can provide both cloud and on prem in a hybrid environment for many of these customers. Now, I think that gets even -- that becomes even more important in an IoT world. It's like you've got -- I think we'll all see multiple layers of delivery of technology, with public cloud still being incredibly important and obviously growing like crazy, like we see it growing, but there are needs for many different deployment types based on the use case and the technology architecture. Gotcha. That's very helpful, guys. And to follow up on the earlier question about ratable mix, are you still on target for the full-year to be 50% ratable, Dave? Thank you. Yeah, hey, Jesse. Obviously, again, great success in the quarter. Increasing our outlook for cloud is all going to contribute toward ratable mix for the full year. With our largest seasonal quarter -- today is the 16th -- we've still got the balance of Q4 ahead of us. We've got to get those transactions closed to finally quantify what is the mix for the year. But we're -- again, I think the execution by the field and collectively, the company, around enabling customers to consume our products both subscription and perpetual was really strong in the quarter. So, looking forward to the balance of the quarter and updating you guys in February. Thank you. Thanks, Jesse. Operator Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Thank you. Appreciate your squeezing me in. And I know you've heard this a lot of times, but it can't hurt to hear it again. Congrats on the quarter. Two quick questions. The first one is, could you talk about what you've seen in terms of demand for term licenses so far this year, especially the past couple of quarters, and maybe what you're thinking about for next year? And then a follow-up. Yeah. As part of that journey, too, we want to get to a minimum of 65% subscription by the end of '19 and 75% by the end of '20. That's very dependent upon continued growth in cloud and obviously a high growth rate on true term. Yeah, so true subscription, I guess I'd say -- on prem subscription. We've been emphasizing that this year. We're seeing good traction with customers and our sales force being excited about and leaning forward with subscription on prem contracts, and we definitely expect that to continue to grow next year and the year after, especially as we continue to come out with additional packaged solutions that take advantage of some of the term architectures. Excellent. And then, given the partnerships in new products, can you give us some color on how you think about or what you're expecting from the partnerships in terms of driving new customer adoption, how we should think about all that? Yeah, I mean, we've been focusing on building out an effective ecosystem, including the solutions on Splunkbase, for a while now. I think most of those have been free, interesting accompaniments. And we hear from a lot of customers that one of the things they love about Splunk is when they need a solution for X, Y or Z, they can go to Splunkbase and find it. But that turn that we started to make with Booz Allen, with Accenture, with some of the apps that we're developing or co-developing with AWS is, I think, that next leg, that next generation. And what we're seeing with those three in particular -- the AWS, Booz Allen and Accenture -- is a higher preponderance of net new customers. They bring their own Rolodex to the table. And the use case is often -- if it's not a new customer, it's a new department within an existing customer, which is still a really nice thing for us, because they, in general, are driving delivery of solutions for use cases, complementary to or in addition to what we're doing with ES, ITSI, or other apps. So, it should be a help with net new customer ads, but we all need to get the motion, go to market motion, solidified to make sure that we realize those net new adds. Mark L. Moerdler-Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC That makes sense. Appreciate it. Thanks. Thanks, Mark. Bye, Mark. Operator Thank you. And that concludes our question and answer session for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Ken Tinsley for closing remarks. Terrific. Thanks, Glenda. I really appreciate your help today. And thanks everybody for joining. As always, we're available here if you have any follow-up questions. Hope everybody has a nice evening and a happy Thanksgiving. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

    Splunk Inc. (SPLK) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript -- The Motley Fool

  "
"Matthew Frankel, CFP",11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett has famously said in regard to Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) stock portfolio that ""our favorite holding period is forever."" Buffett's ideal stock is one that he can buy and whose business continues to grow reliably over time. Having said that, Buffett does buy and sell stocks regularly, and Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio has changed considerably over the years. Even over the past few years, there have been some major additions and subtractions among Berkshire's largest stock positions. Image source: The Motley Fool. Berkshire's stock portfolio consists of more than 45 positions but is heavily weighted toward its largest holdings. So here's a look at how Berkshire's ""top 10"" stocks have changed since the third quarter of 2015. Rank Q3 2015 Q3 2016 Q3 2017 1 Wells Fargo Kraft Heinz Wells Fargo 2 Kraft Heinz Wells Fargo Kraft Heinz 3 Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 4 IBM (NYSE:IBM) IBM Coca-Cola 5 American Express American Express Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) 6 Phillips 66 Phillips 66 American Express 7 Procter & Gamble U.S. Bancorp Phillips 66 8 Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) Moody's IBM 9 U.S. Bancorp Charter Communications U.S. Bancorp 10 DaVita HealthCare DaVita HealthCare Moody's Data source: Berkshire Hathaway 13-F filings. Many of the major positions have remained the same. The Kraft Heinz, Coca-Cola, and American Express positions haven't changed much, to name a few examples. However, there have been a few big changes over the past couple of years that investors should be aware of. Buffett is known for his avoidance of the tech sector, but he has made exceptions for well-established tech companies with big competitive advantages. For the past several years, this has been IBM, which until 2017 was one of Berkshire's ""big four"" stocks. However, Buffett has been selling off Berkshire's IBM stake, saying that the competition in its industry has become more intense and that he's revalued the stock downward. Instead, Buffett has been accumulating a position in Apple, which, thanks to several additions to the position and an all-time high for the stock, has become Berkshire's third largest stock position. Buffett loves the ""stickiness"" of Apple's product line, as well as the business' fundamentals, and so far, it has proved to be a wise investment. Another addition to the top five is Bank of America, although this isn't exactly a new investment. In the wake of the financial crisis, Buffett invested $5 billion in Bank of America preferred stock, and as part of the deal, he received warrants to buy 700 million shares of the bank for just $7.14. In other words, Buffett had the ability to swap his preferred stock for 700 million shares of common stock. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett said that if Bank of America's dividend was raised to a point where Berkshire could generate more income by owning common stock, the warrants would be exercised. Well, Bank of America raised its dividend beyond Buffett's threshold, so Berkshire is now Bank of America's largest shareholder. One stock that appears in the top 10 in 2015 but not again is Wal-Mart. In the third quarter of 2015, Berkshire owned 56.2 million shares of the retail giant, with a total value of more than $3.6 billion, but the company decided to sell most of its position during 2016. Now, the company owns just over $130 million in Wal-Mart stock. While Buffett referred to Wal-Mart as a ""fabulous company"" even after he sold Berkshire's shares, Buffett said the retail business had become too tough, and that the ""online thing"" was very difficult to figure out. Buffett believed that Wal-Mart would experience continued success, but he wasn't sure if the company could successfully compete with Amazon.com and other e-commerce headwinds. It appears that Buffett may have been wrong to doubt Wal-Mart's ability to take on Amazon. In fact, in Wal-Mart's most recent earnings report, the company reported 50% year-over-year growth in e-commerce sales and its best same-store-sales growth in more than five years. The market seems to agree. Wal-Mart's stock price is up nearly 40% so far in 2017, meaning that based on how much of Wal-Mart's stock Berkshire owned two years ago, Buffett missed out on more than $1.5 billion in gains. Berkshire's portfolio is extremely top-heavy -- in fact, the company's five largest holdings are worth more than its other 40 or so combined. So it makes sense that Berkshire's largest stock holdings get most of the attention. After all, a big move in these stocks could significantly affect the company's market value. However, while Buffett and his team haven't been too active with its largest stocks, there have been lots of smaller moves over the past two years. Just to name a few examples, Berkshire sold its stakes in Suncor Energy, AT&T, General Electric, and Chicago Bridge & Iron and has added Synchrony Financial, Store Capital, and stakes in all four major U.S. airlines. Berkshire has been relatively quiet in the stock market lately. With the exception of the Apple investment and the conversion of its Bank of America warrants, the company hasn't made any stock investments recently that would be considered big by Berkshire's standards. Stock valuations are high, and Buffett and his team have said that it's been difficult to find attractive investments. ","

Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Spectrum Brands Holdings' Fiscal 2017 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm Dave Prichard, Vice President of Investor Relations for Spectrum Brands, and I'll be your moderator for our call today. Now, to help you follow along with our comments, we have placed a slide presentation on the Event Calendar page in the Investor Relations section of our website at spectrumbrands.com. This document will remain there following our call. Now, if we start with Slide 2 of the presentation, you'll note that our call will be led by Andreas Rouvé, our Chief Executive Officer, and Doug Martin, our Chief Financial Officer. Andreas and Doug will deliver opening remarks, and then they will conduct the Q&A session. Now, let's turn to Slide 3 and also Slide 4. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, including our outlook for fiscal 2018 and beyond. These statements are based upon management's current expectations, projections, and assumptions, and are by nature uncertain. Actual results may differ materially. Now, due to that risk, Spectrum Brands encourages you to review the risk factors and cautionary statements outlined in our press release dated November 16th, 2017, and our most recent SEC filings, and Spectrum Brands Holdings' most recent 10-K.

The reconciliations on a GAAP basis for these measures are included in today's press release and 8-K filing, which are both available on our website in the Investor Relations section. With that, I'm very pleased now to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Andreas Rouvé. Thanks, Dave, and thank you all for joining us. Turning to Slide 6: We finished a challenging fiscal 2017 with a solid fourth-quarter performance. Net of acquisitions and of favorable currency impact, we grew organic net sales in Q4 by 3.1%. If we consider our decision to exit low-margin, non-strategic business, then the adjusted organic sales growth of our core business was even 4.2%. Accordingly, we increased our organic adjusted EBITDA by 5% and our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 50 basis points to 19.5%. Our Home and Garden and Hardware and Home Improvement led the away with record quarterly results. Also, Global Auto Care and Personal Care delivered a solid performance, and I'm pleased to report that our E-commerce business remains a bright spot with growth of over 50% in our core U.S. market. Regionally, our growth was broad-based and driven by North America, Europe, and Asia/Pacific. Sales were up also in Latin America if we exclude the exit of non-strategic business. Let me add here that the integration of our PetMatrix and GloFish acquisitions from Q3 are proceeding well, and both are delivering ahead of our expectations. Fiscal 2017 was our eighth consecutive year of record adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margins, and adjusted free cash flow, which grew 10%, in large part from excellent working capital improvement. Our reported EBITDA margin increased by 20 basis points to 19.1%, which was also a record annual level. In 2017, major U.S. retailers had adjusted their inventory levels, especially in our seasonal categories. While we expect retailers to continue their focus on lower inventory levels also in the future, we believe that the inventory levels are now much healthier than a year ago. In addition, the two-year up and down impact of the Zika virus on our repellents business in our Home and Garden division has now been completed. Also, the adverse impact of exiting low-margin non-strategic business, which reduced our top line in 2017 by approximately $42 million or 0.8% will lessen in 2018 to approximately $25 million, which is related to the exit of a dog and cat food customer tolling agreement in Europe. At the same time, we have increased the pace of new product development, and are bringing more innovation to the market, and are moving into more channels, categories, and countries around the world, such as our launch of major brands through China's leading e-commerce retailer, JD.com, and the U.S. launch last month of the leading British Russell Hobbs brand of kitchen appliances. Also, in batteries, we are stepping up our investment to enable further international growth with the expansion of our alkaline battery plant in Germany and our hearing aid battery plant in the U.K. We are also making good progress in our two transformational projects in the U.S. The consolidation of our global auto care manufacturing and distribution in Dayton, Ohio is now complete, and the consolidation of our hardware and home improvement distribution in Kansas is currently 65% complete, and we expect to complete this project in March 2018. Both projects streamline our supply chain and will allow us to reduce our inventory levels and improve our service levels. Finally, our voluntary U.S. pet rawhide recall in June continued to have an operating cost and sales impact in Q4. We have corrected the production issue, have restarted the three South American plants, and continue to restock retailers in the U.S. and Canada. However, we will still have some impact at the beginning of this fiscal year. Turning to Slide 7: Looking forward, we are optimistic about delivering organic net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth in fiscal 2018. As many of you have seen, we also guided this morning to another year of record adjusted free cash flow with an increase of as much as 9%. This growth is driven by our focus to have Spectrum Brands present with our superior quality and superior value product wherever and however the consumer chooses to shop. This is why we place such an emphasis on strengthening our retailer relations around the world. This also implies the need to accelerate product innovation, selectively increase marketing, and add more digital resources to better educate today's mobile consumer on the superior value proposition of our broad portfolio of everyday nondiscretionary products. Therefore, we are launching two important and complementary initiatives -- Project Alpha and Project Ignite -- which are designed to accelerate our multiyear growth ambitions. In the case of Project Alpha, we plan to spend up to an additional $20 million this year to expand into adjacent market segments through selective investment in new product development and strong market launches using new digital and social media marketing campaigns. This will help us to leverage our strong brands and retailer relations to launch innovation with key brands such as Armor All, Russell Hobbs, and Nature's Miracle. Project Ignite is an initiative to ensure that our organization adapts to rapidly changing consumer preferences and retail channels, and that resources are allocated to our best growth opportunities. Both of these projects are expected to be multiyear in duration, and we expect Project Ignite to partly fund the increased investments made through Project Alpha in fiscal 2018. Let me turn it over now to Doug for the financial review and details from our performance by product category. Thanks, Andreas, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9: Let's review Q4 results, beginning with net sales. Fourth quarter reported net sales of $1.32 billion increased 5.8% versus last year. Excluding the favorable impact of $12.4 million of foreign currency and acquisitions sales of $20.8 million, organic net sales grew 3.1%, our best quarterly result in 2017. This increase included the negative impacts of planned unprofitable business exits of approximately $14 million or 1.1%. HHI and Home and Garden delivered record fourth quarter performances along with strong performances from Global Auto Care and Personal Care. Reported gross margin of 37.5% decreased 140 basis points from 38.9% last year, primarily due to unfavorable mix, the negative impact of the rawhide recall, and operating start-up inefficiencies, primarily in Edgerton, Kansas. Reported SG&A expense of $322.1 million or 24.4% of revenue, compared to $294.4 million last year or 23.6%, primarily due to acquisitions, higher share-based compensation expense, and increased marketing investments to support new product launches. Reported operating margin of 8.2% decreased 450 basis points versus 12.7% in the prior year, largely driven by increased marketing investment, restructuring charges, and impairments. On a reported basis, Q4 diluted earnings per share of $1.63 increased compared to $1.49 last year, primarily due to reduced interest expense, a larger income tax benefit, and lower average shares outstanding. Adjusted EPS of $1.35 improved 3.1% versus $1.31 last year. Q4 reported a tax benefit of 77.7%, which is improved from an 8.4% benefit last year, primarily due to a discrete tax benefit recorded in the quarter to reverse a previously recorded tax liability for the anticipated repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. Turning to Slide 10: Reported interest expense in fiscal 2017 of $211 million decreased $39 million from $250 million last year, driven by the benefits of our 4% euro-denominated notes and repricing of our U.S. term loans in October and April of this year, partially offset by interest related to acquisitions and share repurchases. Cash interest payments of $183 million were $55 million lower than last year. The full-year tax rate of 13.8% increased from 10.1% last year due to a non-recurring release of a U.S. valuation allowance in 2016, net of the impact of the current-year benefit described previously. Cash taxes of $37.5 million were comparable to $35 million in 2016. Depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation were $256 million compared to $247 million last year. Cash payments for acquisition and integration and restructuring and related charges for 2017 were $44.3 million and $22.3 million respectively. Now, to our operating unit results, beginning with Slide 11 in Global Auto Care. Global Auto Care ended fiscal 2017 with a good Q4. Reported net sales of $102.6 million increased 1.9% against solid growth last year, driven by Europe and Asia/Pacific, while U.S. revenues were essentially unchanged with higher U.S. appearance product sales being offset by lower refrigerant revenues, primarily due to cooler weather conditions in the prior year and tighter auto retailer inventory levels. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.5% with a margin improvement of 50 basis points, primarily driven by lower expenses. In fiscal 2018, Global Auto Care will continue its focus on accelerating organic growth through increased cross-selling, share gains, and adjacency expansions in the U.S., improving its vitality rate with larger investments behind new product development and faster international growth. GAC expects further benefits from the second year of its Armor All Ultra Shine Wash and Wax Wipes, which were successfully launched in 2017, with two more items being added to the line, and also, the introduction of a full line of Armor All air fresheners. Turning to Slide 12: Hardware and Home Improvement rebounded from Q3 as expected to boast a strong Q4 reported net sales and adjusted EBITDA increases of 6.3% and 10.6%, resulting in an 80 basis point adjusted EBITDA margin expansion to 21.9%. This solid performance was driven by strong growth in residential security and plumbing in our core U.S. business, and to a lesser degree in Canada. The planned exit of unprofitable businesses in Mexico adversely impacted growth by 1.6% in the quarter. HHI has now fully lapped this exit, so it will not impact fiscal 2018. HHI's core U.S. businesses in residential security, builder's hardware, and plumbing are healthy and growing, supported by a multiyear new product roadmap which is delivering steady innovation. Important homebuilder channel wins will also benefit HHI this year, and exciting recent news also includes Amazon's announcement in late October that two Kwikset smart locks -- our Kwikset Convert and our Kwikset Smart Code -- will be smart lock solutions for the new Amazon Key In-Home Kit, which allows Prime members in 40 markets to receive in-home delivery and grants secure home access for guests using the Amazon Cloud Cam and our compatible smart lock, where we continue to be the innovation leader in the U.S. residential smart lock market. Operationally, HHI continues to complete its U.S. distribution center consolidation into a single new, larger facility in Kansas. The project began in April and has experienced some operating start-up issues, cost inefficiencies, and higher than normal customer backlog, but we've now closed the West Coast distribution center successfully, and the East Coast facility will wind down soon. This consolidation will result in a more streamlined footprint and lower inventories later in 2018 and beyond. Now, to Global Pet, which is Slide 13. Global Pet continues to be a business in transition, with Q4 reported net sales of $217.2 million, increasing 5.1% as a result of $20.8 million of revenue from the PetMatrix and GloFish acquisitions. Excluding acquisition revenues and favorable Fx of $2.3 million, organic net sales decreased 6.1%. Reported adjusted EBITDA increased 5.5% to $44 million due to the acquisitions with a 10-basis point margin improvement, while organic adjusted EBITDA of $36.2 million declined 13.2%, excluding the acquisitions and positive Fx of about $1 million. Organic sales declined in both Europe and the U.S. The primary driver for lower European revenue was a significantly lower dog and cat food sales from the acceleration of the planned exit of a pet food customer tolling agreement, which totaled $6.4 million and negatively impacted pet sales by 3.1%. And, in the U.S., as we mentioned in the last quarter, companion animal sales were adversely impacted by the rawhide dog chew product recall in June, as well as continued sluggish store traffic in certain channels. In fiscal 2018, pet top- and bottom-line results will be boosted by the full-year impact of PetMatrix and GloFish acquisitions, whose integrations are going smoothly and ahead of schedule, and by delivering growth in our legacy businesses through new product launches, new customers, cross-selling, and strong e-commerce growth. The impact of the exit of the pet food customer tolling agreement for 2018 is expected to be about $25 million. Moving to Home and Garden, which is Slide 14: Home and Garden also rebounded from Q3 to deliver a very strong double-digit performance in Q4. Reported net sales and adjusted EBITDA increased 26% and 62% respectively, resulting in a 590-basis point margin improvement to 27%. All categories posted solid growth, driven by favorable POS coupled with increased replenishment orders triggered by generally lower retailer inventory levels and a modest positive benefit from the Q4 hurricanes. While fiscal 2017 could be described as a reset year, with more quarterly volatility than normal, Home and Garden nevertheless achieved record POS, record household control brand sales, and market share gains. Home and Garden plans measured above-category growth in fiscal 2018 with quarterly phasing reverting to more traditional historic pacing based upon more normal spring and summer weather pattern expectations. Growth will be driven by innovation in spring and annualization of 2017 innovation. Now, to Personal Care, which is Slide 15: Personal Care reported a strong Q4, with growth in nearly every region. Reported net sales of $127.3 million increased 5.6%, while organic revenues climbed 3.9%, excluding favorable Fx of $2 million. The improvement was led by solid growth in the U.S. and Asia/Pacific and moderate growth in Europe and Latin America. A bright spot in the quarter was strong double-digit growth in e-commerce sales, where these businesses have already built significant channel presents. Reported and organic adjusted EBITDA increased double digits, with a reported margin improvement of 130 basis points. The increase was driven by higher volumes, favorable mix, and continuous improvement savings. Looking to fiscal 2018, Remington will continue a steady launch of impactful products in shave, groom, and hair care, supported by targeted marketing investments to drive volume growth and even greater awareness of the global Remington brand. Now, let's turn to Small Appliances on Slide 16: Q4 reported net sales of $171.5 million, decreased 2.9% percent. Excluding favorable Fx of $1.1 million, organic revenues fell by 3.6%. Higher sales in Europe and Latin America, primarily from new product launches and new listings, were more than offset by lower U.S. and Canadian revenues as a result of sluggish POS, increased competitor promotions, and retailer adjustments. Reported and organic adjusted EBITDA fell high single digits with a reported margin decline of 70 basis points due to unfavorable mix, decreased volumes, and unfavorable Fx. Small Appliances will continue its strategy in fiscal 2018 to broaden its product portfolio and distribution points around the world with a focus on wide-space opportunities and continued e-commerce growth, where the business has a significant percentage of its revenues today. As some of you have seen, the most prominent and recent exciting U.S. launch is our exciting Russell Hobbs brand, which is a stylish, top-quality family of products that we launched within e-commerce within the last few months. Finally, to Global Batteries, which is Slide 17: Q4 reported net sales of $235.1 million, increase 5.6%, driven by strong growth in Europe, Latin America, and Asia/Pacific. U.S. revenues were essentially unchanged, including a modest positive benefit from the hurricanes and continued strong performance from Fusion, our highest-performing alkaline battery. Excluding a $4.5 million favorable Fx benefit, organic sales improved 3.5%. Adjusted EBITDA and margin fell as pricing pressure and commodity cost increases more than offset higher volumes, cost savings, and positive Fx. Led by the alkaline and hearing aid categories, Global Batteries will pursue growth in 2018 in under-indexed channels, and countries, and through distribution gains. Rayovac is also launching its next-generation Active Core technology product that gives consumers longer-lasting, high-quality hearing aid battery performance with an improved design, delivering higher voltage for high-tech device applications. Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 18: We ended fiscal 2017 in a strong liquidity position with more than $680 million available on our $700 million cash flow revolver, a cash balance of $168 million, and debt outstanding of $3.9 billion. We generated record adjusted free cash flow in fiscal 2017 of $587 million, which was within our guidance range, primarily as a result of strong working capital management, and surpassing 2016 free cash flow of $535 million and 2015 free cash flow of $454 million. Total leverage was approximately 4.1x at the end of fiscal 2017, slightly higher than the 3.9x at the end of '16, primarily as a result of acquisitions and share repurchases. Capital expenditures were $115 million compared to $95 million in the prior year. And, in fiscal 2017, we repurchased over 2 million shares of common stock for $253 million, or about $122 a share, and in the fourth quarter, we purchased over 700,000 shares of stock for $87, or just under $119 million per share. Clearly, we still have a lot of confidence in the value of our stock and are continuing to support it in an aggressive way. Turning to Slide 19 and our 2018 guidance: We expect reported net sales to grow above category rates for most categories, including the anticipated positive impacts from Fx of approximately 160 to 180 basis points, based on current rates. We expect to deliver record adjusted free cash flow of between $620 million and $640 million. Full-year interest expanse is expected to be between $210 million and $220 million, including approximately $15 million of non-cash items. And, cash interest payments in the year are expected to be between $185 million and $195 million. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be between $245 million and $255 million for 2018, including approximately $50 million for amortization of stock-based compensation. Our 2018 effective tax rate is expected to be between 30% and 35%, and recall that for adjusted earnings, we use a 35% tax rate. Cash taxes are expected to be between approximately $55 million and $65 million, and we do not anticipate being a significant U.S. federal cash taxpayer during 2018, as we continue to use net operating loss carry-forwards. Cash payments for acquisition and integration and restructuring and related charges are expected to be between $40 million and $60 million, and capital expenditures are expected to be between $110 million and $120 million. Thank you, and now, back to Dave for Q&A. Thank you, Andreas and Doug. Operator, with that, you may now begin the Q&A session, please. Operator At this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, please press *1 on your telephone keypad. Your first question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Yes, hi, thank you. Good morning. I guess my first question is just on the categories. What are you anticipating the categories are going to grow in fiscal '18, and perhaps, what did they grow in fiscal '17? Let me first start with the question on the category growth. I think overall, we expect all categories to grow somewhere in the low single digits, with probably the strongest growth in the Hardware and Home Improvement, where we have a strong tailwind from the U.S. housing market. But, we also expect some long-term benefits coming from the hurricanes, so therefore, that is probably the category growing fastest. Now, the other extreme is probably going to be on the section of Home Appliances, where again, the growth is quite often driven by innovation, which leads to a peak in market demands, and then that slows down. Right now, for instance, the Home Appliance category is slightly shrinking. We estimate it -- based on market data -- shrinking by about 0.5%, and the other categories are somewhere in between. Now, if you look at 2017, how that -- I would say that was overall very similar, so there was really no dramatic shift. The only real difference is that in the Global Auto Care, where we have the A/C business, which is a very strong weather-dependent business, there we saw a decline this year in the category of about 5%, but this was really purely driven by cooler summer weather in our core U.S. market, and there again -- we believe that's not a long-term indication, it's just a short-term weather impact. Similarly, we had in our Home and Garden division our personal repellant business, where again -- as I mentioned earlier -- we had in 2016 the exceptionally strong demand coming from the Zika virus, whereas now, in '17, both retailers and consumers had pretty much their household equipped with personal repellents, so that category was also down. But again, we believe this was a two-year up and down. So, overall, we believe that also those categories will continue to grow in the low single-digit rates. Okay. And then, if I may just ask a second question regarding your two new projects, Alpha and Ignite. If you could maybe give us just a little more detail on what the $20 million will be spent on, how these projects will be managed, how do you determine the ROI on these projects, what adjacent market segments are you targeting -- any more detail that you can provide on those two will be very helpful. Yes, very good. The background is really -- Spectrum Brands, as you know -- back in 2009, we recovered from bankruptcy, and we still had a little bit -- as part of our corporate culture -- of relatively short-term thinking. That means we pursued projects which had more or less a self-funding principle. That means we invested not more than what we were expecting as a payback so that the Year 1 impact was neutral to positive. However, what we are doing now is we are investing more into innovation to expand into adjacencies, and when we then launch such innovation, we are going to invest more into the marketing to drive growth in those categories. To a certain extent, our step with the Wash and Wax Wipes in Armor All is a good example. This is, in 2017 net -- if we consider our marketing investment -- a loss. However, we have established the brand, we have gained strong retail distribution, it is aware in the consumer mind, and now we can continue to earn the fruits in '18 and beyond. And, a similar approach we are going to drive now in other categories and examples would be, for instance, here in the U.S., we are relatively strong in Home Appliances with the Black and Decker brand, more in mid price point, lower price point, and there, we are going to leverage our innovative higher-priced products from Europe under the Russell Hobbs brand. We are going to enter it, but of course, we will have to invest into the respective marketing means to drive it. Now, you asked about the return on investment. It is still a very compelling return. Payback is typically in the range of one and a half years, so therefore, this is not going to be a long-term drag. It's a kind of start-up investment to get it going, and then we are going to reap the benefits in the future. Okay, great. And, just quickly, is this $20 million excluded or included in your free cash flow guidance? It's included in the free cash flow guidance. Great, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Your line is open. Good morning. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the shifting retail landscape. Can you talk about how your go-to-market strategy has evolved? And, please talk also about your online strategy. You mentioned the 50% growth online, which is fantastic. Maybe talk a little about where you are now in terms of online sales and where you expect to be in three years. Okay. That's a complex question. The first point is online -- or, let me say ""multichannel"" because it's also a combination where you order online, you pick up in store, and all those kinds of options -- it is one of many channels, and if you look at the market, we are still somewhere in the 25% and less of the respective market channel. So therefore, it is an important, very rapidly growing channel, which we are fully exploiting. However, we have to realize that the majority of the demand is still in other channels, and that can be the mass, that can be specialty, that can be discount channel, so there are a multitude of other channels, and the key challenge going forward, really, is to avoid the channel conflict, because of course, the online is driving huge price transparency, and therefore, the biggest challenge in our online growth is really minimizing channel conflict, therefore having meaningful product differentiation, features, and those kinds of specifics is going to be key. Now, if we look at our growth strategies, of course there are certain categories which are more prominent online, and really, the highest online share is in the Personal Care category, where it's in the high 20s already for us today, and we expect that to continue to grow, and I can tell you openly that, for instance, in Europe, the biggest online retailer is also our biggest customer in Europe already. So therefore, we are already developing very well and very fast. Other categories it is less prominent, but also here, we are investing because online is not only shopping, it is also increasingly information surge -- a validation, a comparison of competitors. So, it's also an information-building process, and that is why we are increasing our investment also into digital marketing. And, Bob, just to be a little more specific on what we currently sell online -- as we can measure it, anyway, because as Andreas said, it's multichannel, so sometimes, we may sell online, but a consumer converts at a brick-and-mortar location, and we don't necessarily have visibility to that. But, what we can measure -- which is fairly direct e-commerce -- would be about 6% across the entire portfolio. Okay, fantastic. And then, just following up on that, do you have any idea where you would want that to be in three to five years? Is it even knowable? What's the thought process to drive it higher, and do you have a goal? Again, it depends very much on the category. For instance -- I think Doug mentioned it earlier -- as we are launching Russell Hobbs in the U.K., we are launching it exclusively online, because again, it's the easiest way to reach many consumers fast, you can highlight the features, the superior value proposition very fast. But really, I would say it's difficult to now pick a number, so we want to continue to grow faster than the category, and again, if we assume, for instance, that the category grew online in the mid-20s, we grew about twice as fast as the category, and that continues to be our objective. Okay, super. Thanks. And then, if I can, just shifting gears completely, any update you can give us on the HRG situation, where that stands right now, and possible timing of any outcomes or resolutions? Unfortunately, we can't have too much detail for you. The board -- as we have communicated earlier -- has formed a special committee where we have all our independent directors represented, and this special committee is representing the interests of all our shareholders, and they are in direct discussions with HRG, and unfortunately, there are no more specifics which we can share today with you, but we will keep you updated as soon as something materializes. Great. Thank you very much. Operator Your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. This is Christine on for Joe. My first question is -- I believe you had an extra shipping day in the quarter versus the base period, and I was just wondering what the impact was on organic growth. There would have been no material impact on that, certainly for the entire year. It all balanced out. So, I wouldn't call out a number on that for one day. Okay -- not even for fiscal 4Q? No. Okay. And then, can you give us an update on the pricing environment in the U.S. consumer battery market? It's a tough question. I think there are two distinct trends. The one trend is that there is an upgrade to higher-quality, higher-featured, and higher-priced products, so there is an upgrade in the market which is supporting the price. However, in all fairness, we have to -- or, at least, we are seeing it -- that the retailers are increasingly leveraging their purchasing power, and therefore, you have also seen -- in our case, we had a decline in the quarter, especially in our U.S. market. So therefore, it's still a very profitable category, it is growing, there are positive trends in the category, but it remains a very competitive market. Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator Your next question comes from Sam Reid, Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. I had a quick question on the Auto Care segment. I guess if you could talk to where you're seeing the tighter inventory levels that you mentioned -- is it primarily on the specialty side, or are you seeing it in in-mass as well? And then, I guess to sort of piggyback off of that question, how rationalized are retailer auto care inventories at this point in time, and do you think the pendulum could actually swing the other way and we actually see some restocking if weather trends are favorable this year? Well, I think the most -- the biggest impact we saw this year was really in our two seasonal categories, Home and Garden and Auto Care. And, if you look at it, we had partly -- in the past years -- actually product returns coming at the end of the season. So, retailers had stocked more inventory during the peak season, but then, also, were pretty hard in returning it at the end of the season. So, we have not seen that this year, and if you think, for instance, at the biggest retailer in the U.S., they have implemented in parallel with this inventory reduction a scheme which they call ""On Time, In Full."" That means improving the cooperation with their suppliers where they get deliveries on time and in full. And again, this allows the retailer and the manufacturers to take total inventory levels out of the supply chain. So, we believe that we are at a much healthier level today than we were last year, but in all transparency, we believe that it will remain a core point -- and again, coming back to this biggest retailer in the world, I think they are announcing publicly that they will continue to focus on further inventory reduction, and I think we are well-positioned -- we don't see the big impact coming in the future as we had seen it this year, but there will be some minor twists and tweaks in different categories. Got it. That's super helpful. A slightly different question here -- the builder channel. I know you guys have mentioned that as a growth opportunity. When should we see some of the moves that you've made into that channel start to flow through in HHI in 2018? Well, that's actually beginning right now. We had a nice win with a very large homebuilder in the latter part of the summer, and we've loaded up their showrooms and are beginning to ship into that channel right now. Got it. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Operator Your next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi, guys. This is actually Chris Carey on for Olivia. So, I guess a little bit of a change in language on the businesses that are growing above-category growth are now most, not all. So, can you provide some perspective on what that means for the total company and maybe how you think about Project Alpha contributing to the ability to get some of those businesses where you don't expect them to grow in line with the category or above the category -- how Project Alpha is going to help you do that? Let me start from the beginning, and then I'll turn it over to Andreas for Alpha. On the tone, Chris, we actually changed that earlier in 2017 to communicate that most of our categories will grow most quarters above category rate. That's what we were intending to communicate, which allows some volatility by category within the year. That's all we're trying to do there, and we expect every one of our businesses and plan for every one of our businesses to grow faster than their categories every year. And again, I think no dramatic change in our strategy with Project Alpha. Our core strategy to grow faster than the market is the ""more, more, more"" approach. That means expanding into more categories, expanding into more channels, and expanding into more countries. And, let me give you some nice examples. I mentioned earlier launching Russell Hobbs here in the U.S. to capture higher-price point, different-featured products. At the same time, we are expanding now with Home and Garden products into Latin America. We are going to launch Auto Care in Brazil, where we are a very strong leading brand with batteries, where we have a fantastic distribution footprint, strong retailer relations. So, we are going to leverage that to launch Auto Care into Brazil. And, these are the kinds of initiatives where we said yes, we are going to launch into new channels, categories, countries, and we are going to support it, so we have a fast, impactful growth instead of slowly, marginally growing it in a self-funding way. Okay, understood. That makes sense. And then, just one follow-up on gross margins -- can you disaggregate the impacts in Q4? I'm specifically trying to get a sense of mix, given that the gross-margin trend has trended down over the course of fiscal '17? I'm just trying to get a sense of how to think about that going into fiscal '18. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. I think some of the drivers in gross margin this year from a reported basis -- which is what I would speak to -- include some of the start-up inefficiencies related to those major footprint decisions we made in Dayton, Ohio around Global Auto Care, which -- as you'll recall -- is five locations into one between manufacturing and distribution sites, as well as moving in our R&D facility into a greenfield operation. So, you would have an expectation -- and, we did have an expectation -- of some normal start-up inefficiencies there, and that's been a little bit of a drag on gross margin in the year, and similarly in Kansas, where we're moving two DCs into one -- another greenfield operation -- and some consolidation and start-up inefficiencies in that location as well have had an impact on gross margin this year. The pet recall is another major driver in gross margin. And then, across the company, beginning in the fourth quarter, we've begun to see some input cost pressures from commodities that we haven't seen for a couple years. Okay, thanks for that. Operator Your next question comes from Majid Khan with Tourbillon. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. First of all, congratulations on the quarter. It's nice to see the fundamentals have turned the corner and you expect that trend to continue into next year, especially given the very difficult macro backdrop for the sector. I know you haven't commented on the potential HRG deal, but I just wanted to highlight that with your free cash flow guide of $650 million-ish at the midpoint ex the additional growth spend, the stock is trading at almost an 11% free cash flow yield. It's by far the cheapest stock in the group, and by far the cheapest the stock has been for many years. I think even Energizer is trading at an 8% free cash flow yield. And, as you're aware, we've communicated that we're obviously in favor of an accretive deal with HRG, but with your stock at these prices and... Clearly, there's an overhang from the lack of resolution of the HRG issue weighing on the shares. I think any Spectrum shareholder at this point would be supportive of tabling an HRG deal in favor of doing a buyback. Between this quarter and the next four, you're going to generate over 1 billion yuan of free cash flow, and your entire float is only 2.3 billion. Even if you repurchase stock at the prices you paid last quarter -- almost 20% from where it was trading yesterday -- you can retire over 40% of your float and exit fiscal '18 earning almost $13 of free cash flow per share. That's on your guided midpoint of the free cash flow guide, and that's after retiring almost 9 million shares. And, obviously, you could always deal with HRG sometime in the future, and I'm just wondering if you've considered this alternative versus negotiating a deal with HRG while your stock is on its lows. Thank you. One point of clarity before we get in. The midpoint of our guidance next year is $630 million, not $650 million -- so, $620 million to $640 million is the range. But, you're right. We're very bullish on our ability to generate cash flow on a sustainable basis -- high-quality cash flow as a company, and that is currently and has been a focus of ours for a long time. And then, beyond that, you can rest assured that the special committee continues to think about different alternatives and different options, and that's their role, and they'll continue to do this. And, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we continue to be very -- believe our stock is undervalued, and we've continued to buy into it. I understand what you're saying from a bigger perspective, but those are decisions for the board to make. Fair enough. Thank you, and congratulations again. Good drop. Operator Your next question comes from Jim Chartier at Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Your line is open. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, I want to touch on the impact of the rawhide recall on the fourth quarter. Doug, can you quantify what the impact was on fourth-quarter sales? And then, you mentioned that it would continue to be a drag in the first quarter. How much of an impact do you expect it to be? And then, net for 2018, does it become a positive swing factor for you this year? Well, the impact in the quarter was relatively limited -- less than $5 million on top line. The point, of course, is we do see a recovery as we are now replenishing the retailer inventories. However, in all transparency, we did face a couple of challenges, especially in private-label contracts, which we have been supplying. So, it will take some time to regain those contracts which were lost in the meantime. But, overall, we have learned from this process, we have established best-in-class processes now, and really, I think it's going to be a long-term clear, competitive advantage. Great. And then, on the HHI supply chain disruption, did you -- have you guys fulfilled the backlog that you had at the end of last quarter, and if not, when do you expect that will be fully worked through? We did make some progress on the backlog in the quarter, but interestingly enough -- and positively -- we had very strong order inflow during the quarter, so we didn't take the backlog down as much as we might have wanted to, but it wasn't because we weren't making progress in the facility, it was more because the order flow continued to be strong. So, that's good news for us, we think, going into 2018. We can continue to impact that backlog as we complete the transition. Great. And then, in terms of the margin improvement this year, up until 2017, you guys had some good EBITDA margin improvement. So, in light of Project Alpha, do you expect your margin improvement to be a little bit depressed this year, and does it rebound in 2019 and beyond? I would say... We've historically said that our objective is to grow EBITDA margin 20 to 50 basis points a year, and we would stick with that. I would say that you should factor in the Alpha investments, though. Great. Thanks, and best of luck. Operator Your next question comes from Karru Martinson with Jefferies. Your line is open. Good morning. Just on the Alpha investments, you talked about Project Ignite possibly offsetting some of those. How should we think about the magnitude of savings that you can get from operational improvements? We're not ready to lay those out yet at this point. This is early stages on the initiative, but I think you can think about it in the way we approach continuous improvement across the company, which has largely been focused on the cost of goods sold and supply chain parts of our P&L. Project Ignite will take us above that in the gross-to-net customer rebate areas, and it's really about -- in the first instance, anyway -- identifying the effectiveness and productivity of our spend, and making sure that we're spending with customers that help drive profitable growth for us, and prioritizing where we spend. So, against innovation is a really good place for us to put new dollars. It helps the entire brand portfolio while launching new products, and potentially, in new categories or new channels. And then, making sure that the investments that we make across SG&A are also aligned with those priorities for growth. Okay. And, when we look at Project Alpha, I think historically, the mantra has always been, ""We offer you the same or better quality than our competitors at a much better price."" As you go into line extensions and innovations, are you looking at a new competitive landscape, or is the goal still to adhere to that core message? We prefer to talk about superior value. That means that the product performance/price ratio is superior compared to competition, and that can apply to lower-priced products, but that can also apply to premium, higher-priced products. And, the point -- and, that is a slight shift, and that's really supported by Alpha, especially if you launch innovative, new products if you enter new categories. You have to educate the consumer. You have to tell the consumer that you're doing this offering, that you are an option available, and that's the biggest change -- that we are going to invest more to support those market launches in a more aggressive way using digital social media to really reach our target consumer and convince them about our superior value proposition. And, when you guys think about the robust cash flow that you have, what are your thoughts in terms of growing these innovations organically versus going out and acquiring some smaller start-ups who might have some additions that you want to put into the portfolio? As you have seen with the acquisition of PetMatrix and GloFish, we remain open. If there are the right acquisition opportunities which are a nice complement to our strategic priorities, we will continue to pursue that. However, we believe that even if you're doing a very attractive deal, you're easily in a 10x multiple, we believe that if we invest organically, and even if it's a two-year payback, it's a much more compelling offer. So, we believe that long-term, it's also going to help the company grow organic sales and EBITDA in a very attractive way if you think about return on assets -- those kinds of metrics. Thank you very much, guys. Appreciate it. Okay. Operator, with that, we have no further questions at this time, so we will go ahead and conclude our conference call. With that, I certainly want to thank Andreas and Doug, and on behalf of all of us here at Spectrum Brands, we want to thank you for participating in our 2017 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Have a good day. Thank you. Operator This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Duration: 55 minutes More SPB analysis ","

Mitch Tuchman,11232017,MarketWatch,11162017,"Published: Nov 16, 2017 9:57 a.m. ET These seemingly small costs can eat into your retirement savings By Gasoline right at the highway exit is usually cheapest. Drive a few miles toward town and you might see a 10 cent a gallon jump. Ever wonder why? If you said “competition,” go to the head of the class. Gas stations tend to cluster around knots of highway traffic. The driver near empty on a country lane has to gas up immediately or take the risk of running dry miles from the next fill-up. Gasoline is gasoline. Where there’s competition, prices are usually low — even identical down to a fraction of a penny. So what gives with investment fees? A new report shows that the cost difference between low-fee and high-fee financial advisers is staggering — roughly nine times more costly, mostly hidden in fine print. The lowest cost adviser, according to the data, is Vanguard Group. No surprise there. The firm founded by indexing pioneer John Bogle offers personalized investment advice at a cut-rate price of just 0.38% of assets. That means an account with $100,000 in investment value costs $380 a year to manage, counting both fund fees and face time with an adviser.

Read: Why lawmakers keep trying to whack retirees Many investors seeing this list will squawk and say, “Well, I’m sure I don’t pay that!” But are you sure? A lot of well-educated, smart people — folks who know their way around numbers and otherwise manage their finances well — clam up when it comes to asking about investment costs. One survey showed that 61% of us have no idea what we pay. Many in 401(k) plans think they pay nothing! Stockbrokers absolutely love the cost-shy client. If pressed, of course, they will explain some of your fees, a lie by omission that goes like this: Client: “How much do I pay you?” Broker: “Me? About 1%, the industry standard. Don’t worry about it.” Read: 7 ways to improve target-date funds Cost control You probably do pay your broker a 1% fee based on your assets. What’s missing, however, are the multitudes of smaller fees that you don’t pay the broker directly but you nevertheless do pay. Mutual fund fees, for instance. Add up all that and paying an additional 1% is typical. Fees matter. That 2% or 3% taken by your financial adviser and fund managers is based on your total account balance, no matter what happens in the stock market. Personal Capital helpfully summed up the impact of fees in the report. A typical retirement portfolio that charges 1% costs the investor $334,754 in fees over decades of investing, the company calculated. The same portfolio at a fee of 3.50% a year, meanwhile, costs $830,931. The difference is nearly $500,000, cash sucked right out of your retirement plan, quarter by quarter, year after year. That’s not even counting forgone returns. That fee money instead is compounding away in the retirement plans of your broker and his preferred fund managers, firms that may have paid your broker extra for recommending them over similar but cheaper funds. Asking for your fees — all of them — is not a sign that you don’t trust your broker. Being afraid to ask, however, is a serious and costly mistake.

,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co announced on Friday it fired its head of consumer lending, a move that people familiar with the matter said was because he disparaged a bank regulator to a fired employee. The abrupt departure of Franklin Codel, Wells Fargo’s head of consumer lending, came as the bank grapples with the fallout from a sales scandal in which thousands of employees enrolled perhaps millions of customers in products they did not want or need. The fired employee, Greg Gwizdz, reported Codel’s comments to Wells Fargo, which then fired Codel, one of the people said. Gwizdz, a former mortgage sales executive, was fired by Wells Fargo several months ago for a number of issues, according to Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda. A call to Gwizdz was answered by a woman who said she was his wife and who declined to take a message. A call to Codel’s home was not returned. Wells Fargo is now subject to tighter regulatory oversight and faces ongoing probes and lawsuits due to the scandal. As a result, once top Wells Fargo executives became aware of Codel’s comments, they felt they needed to take action, one of the sources said After being promoted as part of a broader management shakeup last year, Codel had become a key executive in the bank’s effort to make things right with customers and fix operational flaws that led to a hard-charging sales culture. In announcing the dismissal earlier on Friday, Wells Fargo said it expects to name a replacement by year-end. Codel forfeited more than 61,000 stock options and nearly 16,000 restricted shares, according to securities filings Friday. Goyda said the forfeitures were in connection with his firing. The conversation between Gwizdz and Codel was about  compensation Wells Fargo withheld from Gwizdz, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. As part of a $190 million settlement Wells Fargo reached with regulators in September 2016, payouts to departing employees must be cleared by the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC). They have approved payouts for hundreds of former Wells Fargo employees since that time but have disagreed on a handful of executives. The decision process can sometimes take months, frustrating former employees waiting for deferred stock or severance. It was not clear, however, whether Gwizdz would have been entitled to a payout since he was fired by the bank. Goyda declined to comment on the bank’s policies regarding employees fired for cause. Bryan Hubbard, spokesman for the OCC, said the regulator does not comment on banks’ personnel matters. A call to FDIC spokesman David Barr was not immediately returned. In Friday’s announcement, Wells Fargo said it dismissed Codel because his behavior “was contrary to the company’s policies and expectations of its senior leaders during a communication he had with a former team member regarding that team member’s earlier termination.” Goyda declined to elaborate on the communication. “We hold our executives to high standards regardless of the regulatory environment, and if something was done that was improper, that would have applied regardless of the scrutiny that we’re under,” he told Reuters in a statement. Wells Fargo, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, has been mired in scandal since the settlement, which involved thousands of employees enrolling customers into credit card and deposit accounts without their knowledge to meet sales targets. Since then, it has faced more lawsuits and probes and detailed more sales practice issues in other businesses. The number of phony accounts has grown to as many as 3.5 million. Codel had been overseeing efforts to fix problems related to auto lending and mortgages that Wells Fargo unveiled in August. The mortgage issue, related to inconsistent application of policies regarding interest rate lock extensions, was one of the reasons Gwizdz was fired, Goyda said. People who know Codel described him as an ethical person who had a careless interaction with a former employee. Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan described it as a “difficult” situation in the company statement. Sloan will be the boss of Codel’s direct reports until a replacement is found. Those reports include Michael DeVito, interim head of Wells Fargo Home Lending; Laura Schupbach, head of Wells Fargo Dealer Services; John Rasmussen, head of personal lending; and Laurie Nordquist, head of personal and small business insurance.

,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans are not expected to push major tax cuts through Congress this year, according to a majority of economists in a Reuters poll, who in any case were skeptical that the legislation would provide a significant boost to the economy. While optimism about a tax overhaul has helped push the U.S. stock market up for most of this year, the administration of President Donald Trump, a Republican, is still seeking its first major legislative win after almost a year in office. Skepticism about major tax cuts has been growing over the past two weeks, causing share prices to wobble. The House of Representatives on Thursday approved a package of tax reductions estimated to raise the federal deficit by nearly $1.5 trillion over a decade. The Senate, where the Republican majority is slimmer, will be the focus for debate. Nearly two-thirds of the more than 60 economists who answered an extra question in the Nov. 13-17 poll, which mostly took place before the tax cuts passed the House, said they were not confident the administration would get the legislation passed this year. “We feel that if it does pass next year, it is likely to be less ambitious and more focused on temporary cuts than reform,” Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of macro research at Barclays, wrote in a note. The effect of tax cuts would probably be muted because of a lack of wage growth and a high level of employment, he added. In a Reuters poll last month, a strong majority of economists said the U.S. economy did not need a big fiscal stimulus at this late stage of the business cycle. This month’s poll of more than 100 economists showed most respondents had upgraded their near-term forecasts for the U.S. economy, which they expect to grow just above the roughly 2 percent trend rate over the next two years but with muted inflation. When asked what the economy needs most, the top pick was increased infrastructure spending. Nearly as many said the United States ought to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement - Trump pulled the nation out of negotiations just days after becoming president - as those choosing tax cuts. “It is hard to say with any level of confidence until we see a final plan (for tax cuts) what really are the benefits to the (economic) outlook,” said Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina. “If we don’t get one, clearly there would be a response (from the financial markets) to a failure to not pass some kind of tax legislation. But if we get it, it would support the ‘glass half full’ levels of sentiment we have seen.” In the meantime, most respondents did not expect the core PCE price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, to reach the central bank’s target until the second quarter of 2019. At last measure, it was no higher than it was just before the Fed first started raising interest rates from zero nearly two years ago. The poll still showed the Fed raising rates by 25 basis points more to 1.25-1.50 percent in December, with two increases next year - less than the three the central bank is projecting. While there are few signs of any economic slowdown in broad economic data, the current cycle is mature. Movements in the U.S. government bond market have grabbed attention in recent weeks as well, suggesting some kind of slowdown may be at hand. Two-year U.S. Treasury yields have hit a nine-year high on expectations for higher interest rates, but a weak inflation outlook has pushed the yield curve to its flattest in a decade. The gap between two-year US2YT=RR and 10-year US10YT=RR yields contracted to just above 63 basis points US2US10=TWEB on Thursday. That was the tightest since November 2007, not long before the last recession took hold. While the current yield curve is not inverted, which is often viewed as a recessionary warning sign, it has flattened by more than 60 basis points in less than a year. Economists polled by Reuters gave only a median 10 percent chance of a U.S. recession over the coming year. The highest probability provided was 40 percent. Wells Fargo’s Bullard said economic data had been strengthening over the past couple of quarters. “That is certainly supportive to sustained moderate U.S. economic expansion,” Bullard said. “But yet financial markets, at least the yield curve, are reflecting something that suggests that maybe there are some signals out there that need to be paid attention to, and clearly not everything is right.” (For other stories from the Reuters global long-term economic outlook polls package) ","

,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"TORONTO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Strong inflows of foreign money into Canadian stocks and bonds this year are adding to investor confidence that the rally since May in the country’s currency is sustainable because it is not just supported by speculative flows. Equity and bond market investors, so-called “real money,” tend to have longer horizons than often-leveraged speculators betting on the direction of a currency. Increased buying of Canadian securities by foreign portfolio managers could leave the loonie more resilient should market sentiment turn bearish on the currency. “Real money flows tend to be much less volatile,” said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. “You become more confident (about the outlook for the currency), because it is less likely for these guys to pull their money out on short-term headlines.” Foreign investment in Canadian securities rose to C$52 billion ($40.8 billion) in the third quarter from the second quarter on the back of two interest rate increases by the Bank of Canada that boosted the appeal of Canada’s triple A-rated government bonds and its corporate debt. That has pushed the year-to-date foreign inflows to C$152 billion, on track to match or beat last year’s record of C$172 billion. Net inflows easily exceed the amount needed to cover Canada’s annual current account deficit of about C$60 billion. Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York, said the sustained inflows indicate there is more to the Canadian dollar rally than speculators “getting excited and getting long” the currency. The loonie surged as much as 14 percent between May and September as speculators swung from being heavily bearish on the currency to raising bullish bets in October to the highest in five years. Some of that hot money left the Canadian dollar, the world’s sixth most actively traded currency, after the central bank dampened prospects for further rate increases this year, Still, market players say that fundamentals point to further portfolio inflows, as a pick-up in global growth boosts commodity prices. “For international investors, when you want to buy commodity producers, you end up buying Canada,” Anderson said. Canada’s resource-heavy TSX has rallied as much as 8 percent since August to reach a record high, underpinned by strong domestic economic growth. “I think Canada is doing better than what the Bank of Canada is saying,” said Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank Financial. “I think foreigners are responding to the economy and that is why we are seeing such huge inflows into Canada.” ($1 = 1.2755 Canadian dollars) ","

 ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"If confirmed to head the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Joseph Otting would be one of the last major regulatory appointments by President Donald Trump. | Nick Ut/AP Joseph Otting's background has sparked a fierce backlash against the nomination from Senate Democrats. By VICTORIA GUIDA 11/16/2017 01:18 PM EST The Senate voted to confirm Joseph Otting as comptroller of the currency on Thursday, putting the former banker in charge of a regulator he once battled with over his firm's foreclosure practices. The vote was 54-43, with two Democrats voting in favor of President Donald Trump's nominee. Story Continued Below Otting was CEO of OneWest Bank, a lender co-founded by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that drew criticism over its handling of foreclosures after the financial crisis. The bank was scolded by its federal regulator in 2011 for not properly overseeing the loans of thousands of people at risk of losing their homes and was bound by a consent order for four years. Now, it will be Otting's job to punish such violations by national banks. His background has sparked a fierce backlash against the nomination from Senate Democrats. ""This Administration is putting the banking industry back in charge of policing itself,"" Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) tweeted during Otting's confirmation vote. ""Joseph Otting is yet another bank exec who profited off the financial crisis who is being rewarded by the Trump Administration with a powerful job overseeing our nation’s banking system.""

Still, Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) voted with Republicans on Thursday to confirm Otting. As head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Otting would be one of the last major regulatory appointments by Trump, a lineup that's likely to go much lighter on overseeing the nation's financial institutions and to peel back some post-crisis rules. Otting has not previously served in government. Like some of Trump's other appointees, his industry background is cause for celebration among congressional Republicans, who argue that bureaucrats and academics who have dominated the regulatory ranks have led to less practical policymaking. ""I actually find that refreshing, versus bureaucrats that just ride this escalator learning how to regulate, regulate, regulate more, so I think that’s a good thing, not a bad thing,"" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said of industry experience during Otting's confirmation hearing. By taking the reins of an agency deeply involved in supervising national banks, Otting — an alumnus of U.S. Bancorp, Union Bank of California and Bank of America — will be in a strong position to implement the regulatory rollback that Trump has promised will spur lending. But some of that work has already started this year under acting Comptroller Keith Noreika, who was brought in from a law firm to run the agency — an unusual setup since acting heads are usually drawn from the ranks of existing agency officials. Noreika used his temporary position to speak boldly about controversial topics, including suggesting that banks should be allowed to own non-financial companies, and vice versa, which would be a radical change to U.S. law. The chief of staff and chief counsel under former Comptroller Thomas Curry, an appointee of President Barack Obama, departed from the agency under Noreika, giving Otting the chance to fill those two top staff positions with his own people. Noreika also secured some concrete policy changes, such as making it easier for national banks to make small, short-term loans to customers who regularly receive direct deposits. That move is likely supported by Otting, who in his July confirmation hearing lamented that banks had been pushed out of the small-dollar lending sector. Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street — weekday mornings, in your inbox. By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. Otting also said during the hearing that the various layers of capital requirements imposed on banks are “highly complex” and need to be examined. But he had some praise for the regulatory work done after the crisis. “The regulatory system we have in place today has resulted in banks understanding their risks much better than they ever have, and we have better capital levels,” he said. “I am a believer in a well-capitalized banking system.” He mentioned his desire to ease regulations on community banks and emphasized the importance of improving financial access for lower-income and minority people, including to affordable housing. “A big concern is that a lot of people at the lower echelon ... are not qualifying for banking products and services. You have branches going away,” he said. “There needs to be a real focus of, how do we make banking available for the lower economic and ethnic people across America?” While Otting will probably continue in the same direction as Noreika on deregulation, with a five-year term ahead of him he will perhaps be more diplomatic, both with people outside the agency and within it. Noreika sparred openly with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray, another Obama appointee regarded by many Republicans as an overly aggressive regulator. That included issuing a report backing the ultimately successful Republican push in Congress to kill a CFPB rule that restricted financial companies from imposing mandatory arbitration on their customers to resolve disputes without class-action lawsuits. Cordray announced Wednesday he plans to step down from the CFPB by the end of the month. Noreika also took a top-down approach in dictating policy to staff, leading to a drop in morale at the OCC, according to sources close to the agency. “I believe the OCC’s greatest resource is its staff of highly trained, professional bank supervisors and support personnel,” Otting wrote to Brown after his hearing. Otting will once again work under Mnuchin, but only in the loosest sense. The OCC is an independent agency housed within Treasury, meaning that Otting has complete discretion over supervisory and enforcement matters but defers to the department on management-related issues. The new comptroller will now be required to divest a range of investments in financial companies. He will divest call options and unvested restricted stock units from CIT Group within 90 days of his confirmation, which will yield an accelerated $10.5 million payout, according to his June 23 ethics agreement. The former OneWest CEO kept those assets after his bank was bought in 2015 by CIT Group, which then terminated his employment. Missing out on the latest scoops?

 ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"Rockwell has resisted Emerson’s overtures not just because of disagreements over price, but also because it has argued that the combined company’s industrial customers would be worse off because its products would no longer be available on a single platform and in one software environment. A combination with Emerson would “dampen, not enhance, the ability to grow in the evolving industrial automation and information market,” Rockwell Chief Executive Blake Moret wrote in a letter to Emerson CEO David Farr published on Wednesday. Investors reacted by largely dismissing the likelihood of a tie up between the companies in the short term. Rockwell shares traded down 1.3 percent to $190.57, far below Emerson’s $225 cash-and-share bid and close to the level they were trading before Emerson’s acquisition interest became public last month. Emerson shares rose 2.5 percent to $61.87, as investor concerns that the company would proceed with an expensive deal that would overstretch its finances eased. “We believe it is unlikely there will be follow-up offer from Emerson,” Wells Fargo Securities LLC analysts wrote in a note. Rockwell is a leader in so-called discrete automation, helping assemble component parts to make automobiles, household appliances and computer systems. Emerson’s strength is in process automation, which helps power plants and factories in sectors including mining and cement operate more efficiently. Rockwell caters to its discrete automation customers using a programmable logic controller platform it calls Logix. It has been seeking to expand this control platform to process automation and cater to so-called hybrid customers using a combination of process and discrete automation. Emerson uses a distributed control system platform for its process and hybrid automation customers called DeltaV. Should it acquire Rockwell, it plans to offer its Logix platform to customers alongside DeltaV. Rockwell has argued that this approach could disrupt the business of some of its customers who want a single platform, and even cost it revenue. This is despite it previously having tried to challenge Emerson’s DeltaV by developing a similar distributed control system platform called PlantPAx, which never captured significant market share. Rockwell has been gradually making progress in increasing its footprint in process automation, thanks partly to acquisitions, including of MAVERICK Technologies last year. In his letter to Farr, Moret challenged Emerson’s assumption of $400 million of run-rate synergies in a deal. A full one-third of these synergies are assumed to be revenue synergies, which are notoriously difficult to achieve, while the cost and revenue synergies are uncertain at best, Moret wrote. Earlier this month, Emerson outlined a plan for a combined “Emerson Rockwell” that will maintain a significant presence in Milwaukee and become an “automation centre of excellence.” Under Emerson’s latest proposal, Rockwell shareholders would own 40 percent of the combined company. Emerson could try to alleviate concerns about Rockwell shareholders’ exposure to the combined company by adding more cash to its offer and reducing its stock element. However, Moody’s Investors Service said last week that Emerson’s current proposal would saddle the combined company with $25 billion in debt, giving it little leeway to raise its offer much further. Moody’s has also estimated Emerson’s latest offer values Rockwell at a hefty 23 times multiple of Rockwell’s earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortisation reported for the last 12 months ending Sept. 30, almost double where many of its peers are trading.

 ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding jumped to a one-year high in October as disruptions caused by recent hurricanes in the South faded and communities in the region started replacing houses damaged by flooding. The sharp rebound in home construction reported by the Commerce Department on Friday was also driven by robust gains in the Northeast and Midwest regions. The broad recovery could ease concerns about the housing market, which has been a drag on economic growth since the second quarter. The report added to labor market, manufacturing and retail sales data that have pointed to strong economic momentum as the year winds down. “Homebuilders are building and that signals greater confidence in the economy ahead,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “Housing construction has been the missing link in the puzzle over why investment spending has lagged in this recovery.” Housing starts surged 13.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29 million units. That was the highest level since October 2016 and also the second-best reading in 10 years. September’s sales pace was revised up to 1.135 million units from the previously reported 1.127 million units. Groundbreaking activity in the South, which accounts for almost half of U.S. residential construction, plummeted in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The storms slammed Texas and Florida in late August and early September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts rising to a pace of 1.185 million units last month. The PHLX housing index was 0.5 percent higher, bucking a broadly weaker U.S. stock market. Shares in the nation’s largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton, rose 0.6 percent and Lennar Corp gained 0.5 percent. Pultegroup shares increased 0.4 percent. Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries were trading higher, while the dollar was weaker against a basket of currencies. Housing starts in the South soared 17.2 percent in October to 621,000 units, with single-family construction vaulting 16.6 percent to its highest level since 2007. There were also increases in homebuilding in the Midwest and Northeast. “The pace of building came back stronger than before the storms hit, which suggests the increase from recovery may have already started in fourth quarter,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. October’s increase in starts ended three straight months of declines, leading economists to expect that housing would contribute to gross domestic product in the fourth quarter. Homebuilding has struggled this year, hamstrung by shortages of land and labor as well as expensive lumber. Investment in homebuilding has contracted for two consecutive quarters. That has contributed to a worsening housing shortage, which has held back home sales. A survey on Thursday showed confidence among homebuilders in November at the second-highest level since July 2005 amid optimism about current sales conditions and buyer traffic. Builders, however, continued to complain about the lack of buildable lots, land and pricey materials. Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 5.3 percent to a rate of 877,000 units in October, the highest level in eight months. Single-family starts fell 22.4 percent in the Northeast and slipped 7.7 percent in the West. They rose 7.8 percent in the Midwest. Groundbreaking on single-family housing projects has slowed since racing to near a 9-1/2-year high in February. Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment surged 36.8 percent to a rate of 413,000 units. Permits for future homebuilding increased 5.9 percent to a rate of 1.297 million units in October, the highest level since January. Single-family home permits rose 1.9 percent to their highest level since September 2007, while permits for the construction of multi-family homes jumped 13.9 percent. Housing completions increased 12.6 percent to a rate of 1.232 million units last month, the highest level since February 2008. The rise in completions was, however, driven by the multi-family housing segment, which will probably do little to eliminate the acute shortage of properties available for sale. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completions need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units to plug the inventory gap. Home completions for buildings with five units or more surged 37.9 percent last month to their highest level since April 1988. Single-family home completions increased only 2.6 percent last month. “For a significant increase in new homes, municipalities are going to have to work harder to make more land available for building,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.

 ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production recorded its biggest increase in six months in October as the drag from hurricane-related disruptions unwound, but the underlying growth trend in output at the nation’s factories, mines and utility plants remained moderate. Other data on Thursday showed an unexpected rise in new filings for unemployment benefits last week in part because of the processing of a backlog of applications from Puerto Rico. The reports are consistent with an economy growing at a steady clip and tightening labor market conditions, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates next month. “With encouraging fundamentals in place, we expect the slow but steady improvement in the U.S. factory sector to continue in the coming months,” said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Fed said industrial production accelerated 0.9 percent last month with output at factories surging 1.3 percent as operations returned to normalcy after being disrupted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which made landfall in late August and early September. The increase in industrial production was the largest since April and followed a 0.4 percent gain in September. Production was also buoyed by a 2.0 percent jump in output at utility plants. But Hurricane Nate, which struck the Gulf Coast in early October, resulted in a decline in oil and gas drilling and extraction. That led to a 1.3 percent drop in mining output last month. The Fed said excluding the impact of the hurricanes, industrial production rose 0.3 percent in October, with manufacturing output advancing 0.2 percent. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of U.S. economic activity, is being supported by a weakening dollar, firming global economy and inventory accumulation by businesses. With the surge in output last month, manufacturing capacity use rose 0.9 percentage point to 76.4 percent, the highest level since May 2008. “The Fed estimates that manufacturing capacity is only growing by 0.7 percent per year, which points to the need to expand capacity at a faster rate should manufacturing output continue to grow at a solid pace,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.The outlook for manufacturing is upbeat, with a measure of factory activity hovering near a 13-1/2-year high. Although a separate report by the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday showed its index of factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region fell to a reading of 22.7 this month from 27.9 in October, manufacturers reported robust demand for their products, rising backlogs and declining inventories. Factories, however, reported a slowdown in hiring as well as a shorter average workweek this month. A survey on Wednesday from the New York Fed mirrored the findings of the Philadelphia Fed survey. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, boosted by strong results from Wal-Mart. The world’s largest retailer said sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 2.7 percent in the third quarter, excluding fuel price fluctuations. In a third report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 249,000 for the week ended Nov. 11. It was the second straight weekly increase and partly reflected the clearing of a backlog of claims in Puerto Rico as the infrastructure damaged by hurricanes Irma and Maria is restored. Last week marked the 141st straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. “The data continue to signal enough strength in employment growth to keep the unemployment rate trending down,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 44,000 to 1.86 million in the week ended Nov. 4, the lowest level since December 1973. Tightening labor market conditions and signs that inflation is steadily creeping up make it most likely that the Fed will increase interest rates next month. The U.S. central bank has raised borrowing costs twice this year and has forecast three rate hikes in 2018. Another report from the Labor Department showed import prices gained 0.2 percent last month amid increases in the cost of imported petroleum and capital goods. Import prices rose 0.8 percent in September. ","

 ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A top U.S. bank regulator has been working to ensure that examiners on the ground have a lighter touch with institutions they scrutinize, but change will take more time, acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika said in an interview on Friday. Bankers at institutions regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have said they have not experienced much change from examiners, who inspect loan-level data on balance sheets as well as firm-wide risk taking and cultural issues. “I’ve spent a lot of time in the field and we are starting to get a sense that examiners are listening,” said Noreika, who last week said he plans to resign from his role after Congress confirms President Donald Trump’s choice for a permanent comptroller. The OCC is “at the front end of this,” he added. “I think we’ll see the fruits of that later.” Bank examiners can wield great power to crack down on lenders. During the Obama administration they toughened up on big banks regarding issues like leveraged lending and exposure to energy- and auto-loan defaults. Trump has promised to cut regulatory red tape across corporate America, including at big banks. Noreika has been aggressive in pursuing that agenda, particularly as a temporary appointee. For instance, he opened up the Volcker rule – a controversial post-crisis reform that was widely disliked on Wall Street – for public comment, the first step before changing the regulation. Noreika told Reuters he expects a proposal for Volcker revisions to be ready by spring. Though based in Japan, MUFG has a U.S. retail banking operation and significant stake in Morgan Stanley. Its decision to change regulators was widely seen as a move from a tough state regulator in New York to an easier-going OCC. In Noreika’s view, examiners must be empowered to use their own judgment rather than simply enforcing rules handed down by lawmakers and bureaucrats in Washington. “It has the effect of undermining bank regulators’ ability to do their job,” he said.

 ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales increased more than expected in October as hurricane-related disruptions eased, but a chronic shortage of houses which is pushing prices beyond the reach of some first-time buyers remains an obstacle. The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday that existing home sales rose 2.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48 million units last month. The NAR said sales in Houston and Jacksonville, regions which bore the brunt of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, had rebounded. Sales in South Florida, however, remained weak last month. The Realtors group said it expected activity in the areas affected by the storms to fully recover by the end of the year. “While this summer’s storms undoubtedly took some steam out of the housing market, the greater problem remains the general lack of inventory,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. “People simply are not moving as much as they used to.” Existing home sales make up about 90 percent of U.S. home sales. They fell 0.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in October and remained well below a 10-year-high 5.70 million-unit pace touched in March. Economists had forecast home sales rising 0.7 percent from September to a 5.42 million-unit rate last month. October marked two straight months of increases. There are concerns that an effort by Republicans in the U.S. Congress to overhaul the tax code could undermine the housing market. Republicans in the House of Representatives have proposed allowing interest payment deductions on mortgage debt only up to $500,000, and only on a primary residence. Their colleagues in the Senate want to keep the existing limit at $1 million but eliminate the deduction of interest on home-equity loans. “We just hope the tax cut plans are not too radical and end up scaring the consumer and make the purchase of a new home even less affordable after taxes,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. The PHLX housing index .HGX was trading higher in line with a broadly firmer stock market. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. The South, which accounts for almost half of the existing homes sales market, recorded a 1.9 percent increase in sales last month. There were also gains in sales in the Northeast, Midwest and West regions. Home sales remain constrained by an acute shortage of properties, which is exerting upward pressure on house prices, and sidelining some first-time buyers, who accounted for 32 percent of transactions last month. Economists and realtors say a 40 percent share of first-time buyers is needed for a robust housing market. The number of previously owned homes on the market fell 3.2 percent to 1.80 million units in October, a seven-month low. Supply was down 10.4 percent from a year ago. Housing inventory has dropped for 29 straight months on a year-on-year basis. At October’s sales pace, it would take 3.9 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 4.2 months in September. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. As a result, the median house price increased 5.5 percent from a year ago to $247,000 in October. That was the 68th consecutive month of year-on-year price gains. In contrast, annual wage growth has struggled to break above 2.9 percent since the 2007/09 recession ended. “Roughly half of what’s available to buy is priced in the upper one-third of home values, leaving scant options for those aging millennials and young families trying to get their foot in the door,” said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow. Builders have failed to plug the inventory gap, citing land and labor shortages, as well as expensive raw materials. A report last week showed housing starts surged 13.7 percent to a 1.290 million-unit pace in October. Housing completions increased 12.6 percent to a rate of 1.232 million units last month, the highest level since February 2008. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completions need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units to bridge the inventory shortfall. Homes sold in October typically stayed on the market for 34 days, down from 41 days a year ago. ","

Telecoms .SPLRCL are down 17 percent this year, compared with a 15 percent advance on the S&P 500. “There’s a bounce in telecoms, which have been the worst group so far this year,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp in Chicago. “There’s always a chance that something disrupts the apple cart, but there’s very little news and a lot of people focusing on the football games and the turkey dinner,” he said, referring to the staples of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. The semiconductor index .SOX rose 1.2 percent and touched its highest level since the highs of the Y2K bubble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 72.09 points, or 0.31 percent, to 23,430.33, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 3.29 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,582.14 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 7.92 points, or 0.12 percent, to 6,790.71. Small cap stocks on the Russell 2000  rose 0.7 percent, outperforming the large-cap indexes. Time Warner ended down 1.1 percent at $87.71. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.50-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.54-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 129 new highs and 28 new lows.

Shoshanna Delventhal,11232017,Investopedia,11162017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs It’s been a rough year for Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) investors, with shares down 13.5% year-to-date (YTD) versus the S&P 500’s 16.1% gain over the same period. Despite a period of setbacks, one team of analysts on the Street expects America’s largest carrier to outperform the market as it returns to annual service growth by the third quarter of 2018. On Sunday, analysts at Wells Fargo lifted their rating on VZ to outperform from market perform, applauding the New York City-based company’s significant investment in fiber as it prepares for the 5G era. Wells Fargo’s Jennifer Fritzsche increased her price target to $50 from $48, suggesting that “much of the bad news is behind the stock in terms of wireless service revenue declines.” (See also: Sprint Now Offering Free Hulu Service.) Last month, Verizon posted fiscal Q3 results in which profit came in flat at $0.89 per share and revenue grew 2.5% year-over-year (YOY) at $31.7 billion. Wireless, the company’s largest business segment, slumped 2.4% while its wireless service business fell 5.1%. Moving forward, Wells expects a “more rational” pricing environment in wireless as benefiting Verizon the most out of its competitors. She noted that wireless accounts for 68% of the telecommunications conglomerate’s total revenue. Further, Fritzsche sees opportunity in Verizon’s continued investments in fiber technology, which should “generate material cost savings” and reduce the cost of constant customer acquisition as the company is forced to replace old customers lost to churn. “We think Verizon is an attractive yield play, with its 5.3% dividend yield nearly 100 basis points above its long-term average,” wrote the Wells analyst. “We expect Verizon to grow free cash flow nearly 6% in 2018 as working capital headwinds from device purchases moderate, service revenue stabilizes and pension funding requirements drop.” (See also: Verizon Needs Growth To Drive Stock Price Higher.)

In an interview with CNBC on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Quincey responded to Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog indicating that philosophically, he believes in a never-say-never approach. The investment bank lifted its rating on shares of the 125-year global beverage giant to outperform, highlighting upside from an expansion of its beverage lineup and its continued growth overseas. Herzog increased her price target on KO to $51 from $45, remaining upbeat on Coca-Cola’s stake in energy drink leader Monster Beverage Corp.

Buffett increased his holdings in Apple, Monsanto, and Synchrony Financial, and reduced his holdings in International Business Machines (IBM) and Charter Communications, according to a report by Seeking Alpha. When it comes to contemporary investors, few draw the same respect and admiration as Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway has been a giant of the business world for decades, and a recent 13F report suggests the company remains a major player, even as its CEO approaches 90 years of age. Warren Buffett has bought big into Apple (AAPL) over the past several quarters. In early 2017, he doubled his holdings. In the third quarter, he added a more modest amount to his holdings, increasing them by 3%. Buffett also augmented his position in food company Monsanto (MON). He added about 10% to his holdings over the previous quarter, although Monsanto maintains only 0.6% of Berkshire's total portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway added about 20% to its holdings in Synchrony Financial (SYF) during Q3, buying the stock at $28.50 to $31.25 a share. Synchrony occupies about 0.36% of Buffett's total portfolio as of the end of Q3. Buffett bought into IBM (IBM) in 2011, and has since increased his holdings by 40% by making periodic quarterly purchases. Then, beginning in Q1 of 2017, he began to sell off portions of the stock. This quarter saw a one-third reduction of the remaining shares, which were sold at prices ranging between $140 and $156 per share. In 2014, Berkshire bought into Charter Communications (CHTR), and the position is about 1.74% of the company's total portfolio of stocks. Buffett has moved up and down since then, alternately buying additional shares and trimming his holdings. This past quarter, he sold off about 10% of his shares. (See also: Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett Richer Than Poorest Half of U.S. Combined.) Warren Buffett is famous for his long-term investments and they apparently have not changed significantly over the latest third quarter. The top five positions in Berkshire's portfolio account for an astounding 60% of the assets invested. These include Wells Fargo (WFC), Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC), Apple, Coca-Cola (KO), and Bank of America (BAC). All together, Buffett held 43 individual stock positions at the end of the third quarter.

Mark Kolakowski,11232017,Investopedia,11162017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Investors should remain invested in equities and not get scared into selling by pullbacks in the market, according to strategists at Morgan Stanley (MS), as quoted by Bloomberg. In a detailed report of more than 40 pages, Morgan Stanley acknowledges that ""most major asset classes look rich versus history,"" but they add that ""equities can still get richer into end-of-cycle,"" per Bloomberg. Three factors typically send economies into recession and stock markets tumbling, Morgan Stanley says: excessive tightening of credit by central banks, large increases in debt, and extreme optimism among investors that former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once dubbed ""irrational exuberance."" Morgan Stanley does not see any of these three factors in place right now, Bloomberg says. Joseph Zidle of Bernstein Portfolio Advisors LLC, recently among the most bullish strategists, now expects excessive tightening by the Fed to be an inevitable recessionary trigger, though he adds that the bull market may have many more months left to run. Meanwhile, another prominent strategist, Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse Group (CS), expects the S&P 500 Index (SPX) to reach 2,875 in 2018, an advance of nearly 12% from its opening on November 15. (For more, see also: Get Ready For The Coming Bear Market and Recession.) Strategists at Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) remain bullish on equities, for a variety of reasons. Among these: December historically sees gains, including the so-called Santa Claus rally; all major world economies continue to grow; corporate profits are still rising; and the markets are habitually shrugging off political risks. (For more, see also: Charles Schwab Upbeat as Impact Conference Kicks Off.) Investors should be on the lookout for three leading indicators of a downturn in the economy and in equities, Morgan Stanley says. First, when the currencies of emerging market countries and key commodities peak in value versus the U.S. dollar, the S&P 500 tends to reach its own peak about seven to 10 months later. Second, credit spreads, or the difference in yield on U.S. Treasury debt and lower-quality bonds with similar maturities issued by corporate borrowers, tend to bottom out about four months before the U.S. stock market peaks. Third, declining measures of economic activity, such as manufacturing surveys, orders for durable goods, and average weekly hours worked, tend to precede an equity market peak by four to six months. Morgan Stanley suggests keeping some cash at the ready as a prudent measure right now. They also recommend that cautious investors shift their equity holdings into call options on the S&P 500 as a way to participate in further upside while capping the downside. They also recommend using a bear put spread options strategy on high yield debt as a hedge, Bloomberg indicates. (For more, see also: Stock Investors' Handbook for a Bear Market.) Meanwhile, publicly-traded stocks are becoming an increasingly scarce commodity, driving equity prices upward for this reason alone, the Financial Times reports. Share repurchases by U.S. corporations since the financial crisis have added up to a staggering figure of nearly $5 trillion, per the FT. According to research by S&P Global, the number of shares outstanding from S&P 500 companies is about the same as it was a decade ago, even as the index has almost doubled in value. Another factor driving scarcity is the growth of passive investing in index funds and ETFs​, the FT adds, citing analysis by Christopher Harvey at Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC). As these funds grow in size, they need to buy more of the equities in the market indexes that they track, removing yet more shares from general circulation. This only adds to the scarcity of equity shares in the open market, propping up their prices. Harvey sees a parallel with quantitative easing by central banks, which took government bonds out of the open market, thereby boosting their prices.

Matthew Johnston,11232017,Investopedia,11162017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Financial reform is not just about the giants of Wall Street. A bipartisan agreement announced this past Monday would give midsize U.S. regional banks some relief from regulatory scrutiny, serving to free up excess capital that could be distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends or share buybacks, according to the Wall Street Journal. Seven of the most overcapitalized of these midsize lenders include Comerica Inc. (CMA), Zions Bancorp (ZION), Citizens Financial Group Inc. (CFG), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), CIT Group Inc. (CIT), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) and KeyCorp (KEY). As of the close of trading on Thursday, Comerica was up 15.14% year to date (YTD), Zions was up 7.13%, Citizens Financial was up 6.43%, M&T was up 2.20%, CIT was up 10.24%, Fifth Third was up 5.56% and KeyCorp was down 0.77%. (To read more, see: Midsize Banks Poised to Win in the Trump Era.) Currently, banks with more than $50 billion in assets are subject to more stringent regulatory oversight, including having to undergo annual stress testing. The new rules would push that minimum threshold up to $250 billion. Such a move would put less pressure on banks to hold excess capital on their books, freeing up equity that could be returned to shareholders through increased dividend payouts and buybacks. Reducing the total number of shares outstanding through share buybacks over the next couple of years could boost earnings per share by between 13% and 17% for banks like Comerica, Citizens Financial, Zions and CIT, according to the Journal. (To read more, see: Top 4 Bank ETFs as of August 2017.) But it’s not just the midsize banks that would benefit. Smaller banks with total assets less than $50 billion would have more freedom to increase lending activity before reaching the new $250 billion threshold. Many banks remained small in order to avoid complying with the tougher rules that came with having more than $50 billion in assets. That increased room to expand assets would also likely lead to a wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the banking industry, especially for those banks in the $10–50 billion range. There are currently over 50 banks in this range, according to the Journal. While things are looking up for small and midsize banks, don’t forget about the Wall Street giants. Warren Buffet hasn’t. According to a note published earlier this week by Barron’s, Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway still owns a $17.2 billion stake in Bank of America, and with a 9.4% $464.2 billion stake in Wells Fargo, is also that bank’s largest institutional investor.

Liz Moyer,11232017,CNBC,11162017,"Wells Fargo's head of consumer lending was fired this week over a communication he had with another former executive about that person's firing. The San Francisco-based bank said Friday that Franklin Codel, a senior executive vice president who had been promoted to the position as head of Consumer Lending only last year, was dismissed, effective immediately. The dismissal, the bank said, was because Codel acted ""in a manner that was contrary to the company's policies and expectations of its senior leaders."" The bank wouldn't get more specific about the nature of the communication. Reached by phone Codel would only say, ""I'm proud of my career at Wells Fargo."" Codel oversaw 45,000 workers in home lending, auto dealer services, personal lending and personal insurance. Wells Fargo is the nation's biggest mortgage lender and servicer. The executive, based in Iowa, joined Wells in 1993 and was head of home lending from 2015 to 2016, when he was promoted to head consumer lending in a big management shuffle. Wells is still reeling from the fallout of a fake account scandal that cost its former CEO and other executives their jobs after it was discovered workers had created millions of accounts without customer approval or knowledge in order to achieve internal sales goals. Wells said Friday the dismissal didn't involve the business or operations of the consumer lending operations and was not related to sales practices. It said a permanent successor will be named by the end of the year. ""Difficult as this situation is, the decision reflects our commitment to our values and culture and to executive accountability,"" said Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo's president and CEO.

Jake Novak,11232017,CNBC,11162017,"Now that the Justice Department has sued to block the $85 billion AT&T-Time Warner merger and AT&T has vowed to fight it in court, we've learned two things for sure: AT&T doesn't know a real gift when it sees one. And AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson should probably stop talking so much if he doesn't want to bring more scrutiny to the industry and its constantly rising cable bills. The official reasons the DOJ gave for its decision were that the deal will harm consumers with higher prices and potentially stifle innovation. But the growing suspicion is that President Donald Trump's continuing feud with Time Warner asset CNN is behind the effort to block the deal until AT&T agrees to sell off CNN first. That suspicion gained some traction today with the news that the Justice Department's new antitrust chief, Mark Delrahim, didn't voice any real objections to this same merger deal a year ago. Despite that, the administration is denying any singling out of this deal for political reasons connected to CNN. Of course, President Trump himself has done little lately to avoid the appearance of personal anger at the news channel: Trump cnn tweet This is where AT&T continues to be missing a major opportunity. If AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson really believes what he said Monday about how the government's move ""defies logic,"" then this move really is about CNN. And selling CNN for a decent price, when the network is riding a relative ratings high, might be easier now than it has been in many years. Potential buyers include  Comcast (parent company of CNBC), Verizon, Disney, Bloomberg, Sinclair, CBS,  and Hearst. According to Wells Fargo analyst Marci Rykvicker and Reuters Breaking Views, CNN could be worth as much as $10 billion. CNN's recent rise is very much connected to the Trump presidency and the unique viewer interest in all things connected to this White House. But even if he's re-elected, Donald Trump won't be in office forever. This very well might be a temporary high for CNN and AT&T would be foolish not to consider that, antitrust issues or not. Of course, those who believe that AT&T caving to real or imagined Trump administration pressure to sell a news channel is a chilling development for the First Amendment have a point. But selling off CNN and having the network silenced are two different things and should be viewed in that less dire context. AT&T shareholders probably have a different set of priorities. If the merger will otherwise drive prices and profits up for combined AT&T and Time Warner assets, why not call the government's bluff and sell off CNN now and reap those benefits instead? Many experts believe that feud or no feud, there is something to the official DOJ objection to the AT&T-Time Warner combination. Craig Moffett, founder and analyst with MoffettNathanson, told CNBC Monday that the deal could easily lead to higher prices, especially for customers of Time Warner's HBO networks and programming. And that's where Stephenson and his public comments come in. The AT&T CEO is treading on thin ice by claiming there's no logic in blocking the deal. He might be right that the DOJ under both parties hasn't blocked similar cable content and service provider mergers in the past. But many consumer groups consider that a problem that needs to be rectified by nixing this deal, not a justification for it. Cable TV subscription prices are going up and have been for a long time in what Consumer Reports calls an ""annual tradition."" The Consumers Union first noted the correlation of mergers to higher prices back in a 2003 report, and others have followed suit right up to this year with complaints about the repercussions of the Charter-Time Warner Cable deal. CEOs are usually smart enough to steer clear of playing politics. Perhaps Stephenson believes he'll get some kind of political public relations boost by standing up to an administration that remains under serious fire. But on that level, he has less to gain than he has to lose. He can still backtrack and avoid a costly legal battle that might end up in more problems for him and the entire industry than just the nixing of one big deal. The last thing AT&T and its peers need is extra scrutiny on costs even as lower cost streaming networks are encouraging more Americans every month to cut the cable cord. It's been about two weeks since reports first surfaced that the DOJ was pushing back on this merger. So far, neither side is backing down. But only AT&T has the luxury of reversing course and still getting what it really wants. That's a luxury that may not last long as soon as the public gets a better idea of what this deal could cost them. It's time for AT&T and Stephenson to grab that lifeline and stay silent all the way to the bank. ",AT&T should not fight the DOJ on TW merger. It should sell CNN instead—commentary
Bill George,11232017,CNBC,11162017,"Throughout the twentieth century, business schools heralded General Electric (GE) as America's most iconic company. It set the standards in leadership, organization, and effective management processes. The company delivered remarkable results over its storied history, evidenced by its stature as the only original component of the Dow Jones industrial average still on the list. Today GE is becoming a shadow of its former self. On November 13, new CEO John Flannery announced the shrinking of GE's holdings to three businesses – aviation, health care and energy and power – while shedding such legacy businesses as lighting and locomotives. Flannery also declared a 50 percent dividend cut, only the third in GE's history – this one coming when the economy is strong. Even by spinning off $20 billion in assets, GE apparently can't move fast enough to preserve the dividends that millions of retired Americans depend upon to maintain their standard of living. In describing these dramatic cutbacks, Flannery failed to shed any light on the end of GE's tunnel. Disappointed investors drove GE stock down an additional 13 percent in the two succeeding days, bringing the cumulative decline to 40 percent since Flannery was announced on June 12, 2017 as successor to former CEO Jeff Immelt. Credit activist investor Nelson Peltz and his partner Ed Garden (now a GE board member) for blowing the whistle earlier this year, accelerating the CEO transition from Immelt to Flannery. Welch followed a long line of fabled CEOs that includes Charles Coffin (1892-1922), Ralph Cordiner (1950-1963), and Reginald Jones (1972-1981). He moved aggressively as soon as he took over in 1981 to remake GE with his own imprint – even though it meant undoing predecessor Jones's legacy. Recognizing GE needed to be much leaner and faster-moving to compete globally in the 21st Century, Welch slashed its bloated corporate staff, cut several layers of management, and radically changed GE's cumbersome processes to accelerate decision making – enabling GE to move in front of major global competitors like Siemens, Phillips and Mitsubishi. Welch is not without his critics, especially after the recent declines. Numerous observers correctly criticize the dependence he created on GE Capital, which accounted for nearly half of GE's business by the end of his reign. But Welch left GE with a strong balance sheet and abundant cash flow to adapt to any difficulties encountered. The task to correct GE's overreliance on GE Capital fell to Immelt. He understood the issues, but failed to act in his first seven years – violating Welch's maxim that new CEOs are judged by their decisions in their first ninety days. When financial markets crashed in 2008, GE's balance sheet and cash flow were so drained that Immelt had to phone President George W. Bush and ask for a line of credit to keep the company afloat. Yet Immelt still hesitated, not completing the final sale of GE Capital to Wells Fargo until 2016, fifteen years after Welch retired. What other CEO gets fifteen years to make desperately needed changes? How did GE invest the proceeds? By buying back $50 billion in stock at high prices, thus diminishing its balance sheet just as its competitors were bulging with cash. Where was the GE board during these long years of value destruction? Was it asleep, or did management fail to shed light on its difficulties? Now Flannery is remaking the GE board, cutting it from 18 to 12 members, and adding three new board members with industry expertise. The sighs of ""finally,"" are drowned out by the cries of, ""what took so long?"" GE's deep problem today is that it doesn't know what business it is in. There is no central purpose that unites its disparate businesses, or enables them to be greater than the sum of its parts. Even GE's three remaining businesses – aviation, health care, and energy and power – bear little relationship to each other. As CNBC's Steve Liesmann noted after Flannery's announcements, why not go all the way and split GE into three separate companies, thereby eliminating the corporate staff and associated corporate costs? Barring a strategy for revitalization and dominance of its global markets, GE is destined to become an industrial holding company that buys and sells businesses during market cycles and whose only mission is making money. Surely that will not inspire its customers, employees or shareholders. Meanwhile, GE may fall further behind competitors with clarity of mission and strategy like Boeing, Honeywell, United Technologies, and Johnson & Johnson. If anyone ever needed convincing that leadership matters, GE's example provides the proof. Welch was an exceptional leader whose track record is not diminished by the company's steady decline after he retired. Immelt was a talented manager who erred by overly-emulating his predecessor's style when he more appropriately needed to emulate his urgency. In Immelt's early years he lacked the courage to make bold moves, and the discipline to achieve consistent execution. In fairness to Flannery, the jury is still out as he gets started. Thus far, he has given every indication that he is a pure financial manager who lacks vision, strategy, and passion to rebuild GE as a mission-driven, values-centered company. While Flannery may achieve modest improvement in GE's numbers, he has not demonstrated he can restore its soul.

Ruth Umoh,11232017,CNBC,11162017,"From Mark Cuban to Bill Gates, top thought leaders have confirmed that the future of work revolves around artificial intelligence. Tech hubs, both in and out of Silicon Valley, are now in a race to perfect AI and these companies are seeking top talent to do so. As competition stiffens among HR teams, leading tech companies are now willing to shell out lucrative salaries to fill these roles with the brightest and the best. According to job site Glassdoor, the average AI job commands $111,118 annually — more than twice the U.S. median base pay for full-time workers of $51,220 per year. Though AI has received a bad rap for stealing jobs, the artificial intelligence sector has continued to make a splash in the hiring world. At a recent Adweek Panel, execs at IBM and Microsoft discussed the proliferation of AI and its impact on the job market. ""[AI] is going to create all sorts of new jobs,"" said Jordan Bitterman, CMO of IBM Watson Content and Internet of Things Platform. ""I think it's nothing but upside and exciting for those who know what to do with it."" Aaron Levie, CEO of Box, agrees that AI development will lead to unfounded innovation in a variety of sectors, which will ultimately increase job opportunities. ""If you look at human history, any time there has been some major technological innovation, you ultimately have some significant increase in productivity that then creates the need for a new set of industries, a new set of jobs,"" says Levie. Chuck Edward, Microsoft's head of global talent acquisition, confirmed that artificial intelligence is one of the most in-demand industries in an interview with CNBC Make It and a quick google search shows hundreds of open positions within the company. IBM has also revamped its hiring practices in order to find fresh talent to fill these new AI roles. Joanna Daly, IBM's vice president of talent, tells CNBC Make It that the company will now now be focusing on skill-based hiring rather than education level. So when it comes to AI, which companies are hiring the most new talent? According to Glassdoor research, Amazon, NVIDIA and Microsoft lead the pack. However, an increasing number of financial service firms, consultancies and government agencies are also emerging as major employers of AI talent. The job site also noted that most open AI roles are still located in a few central locations, namely San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles and New York City.

Trading volumes usually drop during shortened trading weeks, opening up the door for more volatile moves.

After the news of the now-infamous ""fake accounts"" scandal broke a little over a year ago, Warren Buffett spoke favorably of the bank's long-term prospects, and it appeared that Berkshire's Wells Fargo stake would remain just under the key 10% regulatory threshold. Well, fast-forward a year, and Berkshire's third-quarter SEC filings show that the Wells Fargo stake has decreased in size by nearly 3.8 million shares. This raises the question -- is Warren Buffett starting to lose faith in Wells Fargo? Image source: The Motley Fool. As Buffett often does after such major news about one of his stock holdings, he remained quiet in the weeks following the news of the scandal. When he finally broke his silence about two months later, many investors were surprised to learn that Buffett hadn't sold a single share in reaction to the news. Buffett told CNN in an interview that the bank's incentive system for its employees was a ""terrible mistake,"" as the bank's sales goals led to a culture of corruption and bad behavior, and that management should have stepped in and made changes long before they did. However, Buffett went on to say that the bank is an ""incredible institution"" with a fantastic record of smart risk management, efficient operations, and profitability that consistently ranked among the highest in the banking industry. Buffett has used the line ""There's never just one cockroach in the kitchen"" many times throughout his investing career to describe what typically happens when a major scandal or other problem with a company is revealed. In other words, when you start looking closer, it's hardly ever just the one thing that's wrong. That has certainly been the case with Wells Fargo. For starters, just a few months ago, a third-party review of the bank's sales practices found that 3.5 million accounts may have been improperly opened, which was 67% higher than the original estimate. The bank has also been accused of wrongdoing in several other smaller-scale scandals recently. It isn't much of a surprise that the scandals would have somewhat of a negative effect on Wells Fargo's business, at least in the short term. The bank's third-quarter earnings showed that this is indeed the case. For starters, Wells Fargo's revenue fell by 2% year over year, while all of the other big U.S. banks' revenue grew. More alarming is that Wells Fargo's profitability and efficiency have taken a hit. The bank's return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) have dropped to 0.94% and 9.06% over the past year, below the industry benchmarks of 1% and 10%, respectively. This is the first time in years that Wells was not the best out of the ""big four"" U.S. banks in both categories. Plus, the bank's efficiency ratio has eroded from 59.4% to 65.5% since the third quarter of last year, another troubling sign. As a final thought, it's important to point out that the reduction of Berkshire's Wells Fargo stake is actually pretty small. It's certainly more than Buffett would need to sell to keep his position from growing, which has been the reason for some previous Wells Fargo sales. In fact, Berkshire said in April 2017 that the company planned to sell about 9 million shares of the bank during the second quarter in order to manage the size of the position. Well, Berkshire ended up selling 11.7 million during the second quarter, in addition to the 3.8 million Berkshire sold during the third quarter. To be perfectly clear, it's entirely possible that the sales are in anticipation of Wells Fargo buying back more shares, which would make Berkshire's stake represent a higher percentage of the company. And since Wells Fargo was given the green light for an increased $11.5 billion buyback plan in June 2017, this could certainly be the reason for some, if not all, of the sales. However, if Berkshire's recent reduction of its Wells Fargo stake was simply for regulatory compliance, it seems odd that the company wouldn't announce this, as it did for the earlier sales. Another possible reason is that Wells Fargo added a massive investment in Bank of America to its portfolio as a result of the company exercising warrants, so it's possible that Berkshire simply wanted to reduce its financial sector exposure a bit. Whatever the reason, the recent sale represents less than 1% of Berkshire's Wells Fargo stake, so there's no reason to get too excited just yet. However, Berkshire's Wells Fargo stake is certainly worth monitoring to see if the Oracle of Omaha may be running short of patience with the bank, especially with the rest of the financial sector firing on all cylinders.

    Is Warren Buffett Losing His Patience With Wells Fargo? -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) climbed 1.6% on Thursday, roughly double the gain in the broader market, as a changeover at the top of the bank industry's newest regulatory body could help the nation's third biggest bank by assets put last year's fake-account scandal in the rearview mirror. Image source: Getty Images. Earlier this week, the current head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Richard Cordray, said that he plans to leave his post by the end of the month. Cordray has led the agency for six years, cracking down hard on banks that run afoul of consumer rules and regulations. ""It has been a joy of my life to have the opportunity to serve our country as the first director of the Consumer Bureau by working alongside all of you here,"" Cordray told employees. ""I trust that new leadership will see that value also and work to preserve it -- perhaps in different ways than before, but desiring, as I have done, to serve in ways that benefit and strengthen our economy and our country."" The CFPB's aggressive posture under Cordray is almost certainly bound to change. On Thursday, it was reported that President Donald Trump will appoint Mick Mulvaney to run the CFPB. Mulvaney is currently in charge of the Office of Management and Budget, a position he will keep while serving as the interim director of the CFPB. Mulvaney is a known critic not only of the heightened regulatory environment in the financial services industry since the financial crisis, but of the CFPB, in particular. The net result is that banks could soon see the CFPB ease its oversight of banks. One could argue whether this is good for consumers or not, but there's no question that it's a positive development for banks. Unlike the other prudential regulators in the bank industry -- the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency -- the CFPB isn't tasked with maintaining the safety and soundness of the bank industry. Its sole concern is on reducing harm to consumers from illicit financial practices. By design, it's innately antagonistic to banks. And few banks have been impacted more heavily by this than Wells Fargo. In September of last year, the CFPB revealed that thousands of Wells Fargo's branch-based employees had spent years opening millions of accounts for customers without the customers' approval to do so. At the time, it may not have seemed like a material issue for Wells Fargo, as the $185 million fine announced by the CFPB in conjunction with other governmental bodies amounted to a small fraction of the $5.6 billion earned by Wells Fargo that same quarter. But it soon became clear that the $185 million fine was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of consequences. Since then, the bank has replaced its CEO, missed out on much of the post-presidential election rally in bank stocks, uncovered similar practices in other areas of its business, and had its reputation severely maligned. The net result is that Wells Fargo has not only seen its revenue take a hit, falling in the latest quarter on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, but its expenses are on the rise, as well. Most recently, the California-based bank earned $4.6 billion in the third quarter. That was down 21% from the second quarter, and it was off 19% relative to the year-ago period. Consequently, when you trace all of this back to the CFPB's revelation last year, it seems logical that shares of Wells Fargo would outperform other bank stocks given the impending changeover at the top of the industry watchdog.

Todd Campbell,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It shouldn't be too big of a surprise that Warren Buffett has soured on IBM (NYSE:IBM). The Oracle of Omaha has been unloading his position in Big Blue all year. But IBM isn't the only stock Buffett's been reducing in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. He's also been selling Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) and, a bit more surprisingly, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Are the best days behind these stocks? Big ships can't turn on a dime, and IBM is a freighter. Plans to reshape IBM back into a growth company are taking forever, and apparently, Warren Buffett's done waiting. He's been steadily selling Berkshire Hathaway's massive stake in IBM all year. IMAGE SOURCE: MOTLEY FOOL. IBM was once one of his biggest positions -- he owned over 80 million shares -- but he sold 17 million shares in Q1, nearly 10 million shares in Q2, and another 17 million shares in Q3. As of September 30, he only has 37 million shares left. I suspect that number is even lower now. IBM was formerly a technology powerhouse, but declining demand for its legacy technology solutions hasn't been fully offset by growing demand for its strategic-imperatives businesses. As a result, its year-over-year revenue has declined in 22 straight quarters. During the past three years, trailing 12-month sales have fallen from more than $100 billion to less than $80 billion, despite its investments in the fastest-growing parts of its business, such as cloud computing. IBM's sales only fell 0.4% from one year ago in Q3, but flat isn't very inspiring. Until strategic-imperatives revenue represents a large enough share of sales to return this company to growth, IBM's shares are likely to remain under pressure. Those businesses produced $34.9 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months, representing 45% of IBM's total revenue, and sales grew 11% year over year in Q3. IBM's heading in the right direction, but there's still work to be done. Could IBM become a bargain-basement buy at some point? Maybe. It's typically been smart to buy IBM when its trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is about 9.5. It's about 12.4 right now, so share prices will need to fall further, or we'll have to see some significant earnings expansion to get to that level again. Until then, it's hard to argue that there aren't better investment ideas out there. It seems Buffett agrees. IBM PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. Warren Buffett added Charter Communications to his portfolio in 2014, and over the past three years, he's more than doubled his money. Apparently, that gain is a bit too much for Buffett to pass up because he sold 10% of his Charter Communications stake in the third quarter. Charter Communications has been on a roll since 2016 when it completed its acquisitions of Time Warner Cable and Bright House. Share prices got an additional boost earlier this year when rumors emerged that Verizon (NYSE:VZ) had approached it about an acquisition, too. However, Charter Communications has given back some of its gains since CEO Tom Ruttledge dashed takeover speculation in September, saying the company's fine going it alone. Perhaps Charter Communications' decision to stay single is enough of an incentive for Buffett to want to book his profit. He still owns 8.5 million shares, so we'll need to see what happens in the fourth quarter before we know for certain that he's moving on to other stocks. In the meantime, I don't see much reason to buy Charter Communications following the past year's rumor-fueled run-up. IMAGE SOURCE: WELLS FARGO. Let's face it... Wells Fargo has lost some of its allure since admitting that workers opened millions of fake accounts to meet heavy-handed sales goals. But that doesn't mean that Buffett's bailing on his second-largest holding. Yes, he did finish last quarter with 3.8 million fewer shares than he began the quarter, but his selling was only to keep Berkshire Hathaway's ownership below 10% so that he could avoid Berkshire Hathaway being classified as a bank holding company. Since Wells Fargo has a big buyback program that's continuously reducing its share count, Warren Buffett has to trim his position every quarter just to maintain it at his target 9.8% ownership level. Although Buffett hasn't soured on Wells Fargo, you might want to. Despite industry tailwinds, including a strong economy and rising interest rates, Wells Fargo's adjusted earnings fell year over year, to $1.04 per share. Its net interest income was flat and its net interest margin, or the spread between how much it pays to fund loans and how much it collects in interest, declined to 2.87% quarter over quarter. Noninterest income, mortgage banking income, and total loans also dipped sequentially. Overall, there's no denying that Wells Fargo will remain a banking giant, but I expect its growth from here will be more tepid than it's been in the past. If so, investors might do better buying a different bank stock. Warren Buffett's famous for his disciplined investment approach. His ability to turn over stones and thoroughly understand opportunities and risks allows him to ride out a stock's inevitable downturns more easily than others. Given his penchant for patience, his selling of shares in IBM and Charter Communications should give investors in those two stocks pause. At a minimum, it suggests going back to your investment diary to make sure the reason why you bought shares still is valid. As for Wells Fargo, it's a different story. Buffett seems committed to keeping his ownership in the bank just underneath the crucial 10% mark. As long as this is true, he won't be propping up Wells Fargo's price by buying more shares. Instead, Wells Fargo is going to trade higher or lower based on its ability to move beyond its account scandal, boost its loan growth, and increase its profit. There's an opportunity for it to do that, but that doesn't mean that it's the best bank stock for new investors to be buying. ","
      
    Why Warren Buffett Is Selling These Stocks -- The Motley Fool

Rich Smith,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. 2017 has not been a great year for Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) shareholders. Verizon stock has lost 15% of its value since the year began, and with barely a month remaining in the year, there's not much time left for Verizon to make up for lost ground. Next year, however, could be another matter. Earlier this morning, investment banker Wells Fargo announced it is upgrading Verizon stock to outperform and assigning the stock a $50 price target over the next 12 months. If the analyst is right, 2018 could see Verizon make up much of its losses from 2017, and deliver a 10% profit -- and Verizon's generous 5.2% dividend yield on top of that. Here are three things you need to know. Operator? Wells Fargo would like to place a call -- to buy Verizon stock. Image source: Getty Images. Verizon reported its fiscal Q3 earnings numbers last month. Revenue inched up only 2.5% year over year to $31.7 billion, and profits were flat at $0.89 per diluted share. Within the company's two main business segments, however, results differed wildly. Things were both better, and worse, in Verizon smaller wireline business (landlines and Fios). Here, Verizon boasted a 1.1% revenue growth rate, but profits declined 11% year over year, and wireline still remains mired at a minuscule 0.8% operating profit margin. In short, the news was not great at Verizon last quarter. And yet, according to Wells Fargo, now that Q3 is in the rearview mirror, ""much of the bad news is behind the stock."" In Wells' opinion, the wireless business is in a trough right now. But going forward, Wells Fargo believes that more ""rational pricing"" among competing wireless providers will boost revenue in Verizon's wireless division. If Wells is right about that, the strong profit margins that Verizon earns in wireless should yield substantial profit growth as revenue resumes growing. As TheFly.com explains today in a note on Wells Fargo's upgrade, however, the analyst sees the greater opportunity for improvement in Verizon's wireline division. According to the analyst, Verizon's continued investments in fiber technology should ""generate material cost savings"" for the company. Fiber may even reduce Verizon's costs of constantly acquiring new customers to replace old customers lost due to customer churn. Earlier this month, J.D. Power and Associates surveyed more than 26,000 cable and internet users and concluded that Verizon's television and internet services are ""Highest Ranked by Customers for Residential Internet and Television Service Satisfaction in the East."" Polling customers on such subjects as network performance and reliability, cost of service, billing, communication, customer service, and programming choices, J.D. Power found that even in an industry as disliked as cable television, customers at least seem to prefer Verizon over alternatives such as Comcast, Cox, and Charter. (For the record, and to be fair, both Charter and Cox topped J.D. Power's rankings in the American South and West regions, respectively. In the North, AT&T trumped all comers. But in the one region where Verizon was allowed to compete head to head with these rivals, it came out on top.) On top of all this, Wells Fargo also argues that with its 15% decline in share price since the year's beginning, Verizon's valuation is looking more attractive today -- but it's here that I fear Wells Fargo's reasoning breaks down. Wells Fargo starts off by describing Verizon as an ""attractive yield play"" based on the company's 5.2% dividend yield -- well and good. The problem is that Wells Fargo then goes on to praise Verizon for its improved free cash flow, and arguing that this, too, is a mark in Verizon stock's favor. But it isn't. Over the past four reported quarters, Verizon has earned just over $15.9 billion in reported net income under GAAP, resulting in an enticingly low (-seeming) P/E ratio of just 11.7. Problem is, Verizon's free cash flow number entirely fails to back up that reported profit. Cash from operations at Verizon over the past year has amounted to $22.2 billion. Unfortunately, minus $16.9 billion in capital expenditure, that leaves free cash flow of only $5.3 billion for the period. Divided into Verizon's $185.3 billion market capitalization, this results in a price-to-free cash flow ratio of 35 -- much more expensive than the stock's low P/E ratio makes it appear. Whatever the prospects for a revival of revenue growth at Verizon's wireless division, and whatever Verizon's chances of pulling its wireline operating profit margin back above 1%, I simply don't believe these prospects are great enough to justify paying 35 times free cash flow for Verizon stock today. If you ask me, Verizon Communications stock simply costs too much. Wells Fargo is wrong to recommend it. ","
      
    Verizon Stock Upgraded: What You Need to Know -- The Motley Fool

John Ballard,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been a huge winner in the growth of mobile commerce. Since 2012, PayPal's revenue has more than doubled, and total payment volume (TPV) has consistently grown more than 20% per year. One of PayPal's most valuable assets is Venmo -- a peer-to-peer (P2P) payment app that is very popular with millennials. Venmo's TPV grew more than 100% to about $30 billion over the trailing-12-month period as of the third quarter of 2017. These numbers understandably make banks feel uneasy. After all, PayPal's mission as a business is to democratize the flow of money, which implies that traditional banking hasn't been very customer-friendly. At the same time, every major bank and credit card company has been forced to partner with PayPal because of its growing 200 million-plus customer base. While major financial institutions appear to be friendly with PayPal, behind the scenes big banks and credit card companies have linked arms to create their own version of Venmo called Zelle, and it's already surpassed Venmo in TPV. Despite what you might think this doesn't spell trouble for Venmo. Below I will explain the distinguishing features of each service which will allow Zelle and Venmo to each settle into its own space within the wide open market of P2P payment services. IMAGE SOURCE: PAYPAL HOLDINGS More than 35 banks, payment processing firms, in addition to Mastercard and Visa, are backing Zelle, which launched about a year ago. In the first half of 2017, Zelle processed $33.6 billion of payments, covering more than 100 million transactions in just six months. It's rapidly being adopted by banking customers. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) are two banks that are backing Zelle, and both have reported strong growth from the new service. Here's what Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan had to say about Zelle on the company's third-quarter conference call: Since launching the Zelle person-to-person experience in June, we've seen significant growth in both the number of transactions and the dollar sent. In the third quarter, peer-to-peer payment sent by our customers increased 46% from a year ago. Here's Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan on Zelle's impact: [O]ur volumes through Zelle this quarter were $4 billion in the third quarter. We processed nearly 14 million transactions and the growth continues. We recently processed $0.5 billion in a single week. Our customers are using Zelle and we look forward to further growth in that area. The rapid growth of a new payment app backed by the largest financial institutions in the world makes the situation look shaky for Venmo, but this shouldn't concern PayPal investors. Two reasons why: Venmo's social features, and a market opportunity that is too big for one service to capture. First, let me tell you how Zelle works. Basically, anyone with a major U.S. bank account can use it. Zelle can either be accessed within the mobile banking app of accepted banks, or you can download the Zelle app on your phone. All you need to send money is an email address or phone number, and there are no fees for sending money. Money sent with Zelle is directly deposited within minutes to the recipient's bank account. This is the key differentiator over Venmo, which serves more like a middleman between your bank and your money. When you send money with Venmo, the money sits in the recipient's Venmo account which has to be withdrawn to their bank, which typically takes one business day. The convenience of Zelle's direct depositing is very appealing, but Venmo has a stickier service because of its social feed. With Venmo, friends can send messages, emojis, or split the bill by sending requests for money. The social features of Venmo is very powerful for attracting merchants to PayPal's payment platform. For example, when Venmo users buy something, they can type a message recommending what they just paid for. It serves as free marketing for the merchant, and merchants love it. PayPal already has more than 17 million merchants signed up on its payment platform, and PayPal's relationships with these merchants should grow even stronger as the new Pay with Venmo feature can connect merchants with a coveted millennial demographic. Venmo has gotten to where it is through millennial adoption, and given its ubiquity among that demographic, I don't see Venmo losing steam with that base. Zelle's lack of social features means it will probably appeal mainly to others who haven't tried mobile payment apps before. Banks could always update Zelle with additional features, but for now, the service is purely about sending money. The opportunity for Zelle and Venmo is too big for any single service to capture all of it. In the U.S. alone, eMarketer forecasts mobile P2P payments to reach $244 billion by 2021, dwarfing the current size of either Zelle or Venmo, so expect to see both of these services, as well as additional entrants, continue to grow very fast.

John Maxfield,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Last week, I was seated on an airplane next to a student in his final year at Vanderbilt. He was on his way to Seattle to interview for a position with Microsoft, after already interviewing at a number of other big-name technology companies. We got to talking about the technological upheaval that's going on in the bank industry. What I found most interesting was that his perception of the future of banking corresponds closely to something that Hugh McColl, the legendary former CEO of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), once told me -- namely, that the banks that are best positioned to dominate in the future are those that give current and future generations of consumers more control over their money. Image source: Bank of America. To younger generations, using cash and checks is akin to crossing the country on a train powered by a steam locomotive as opposed to the Boeing 737 we were on. There is nothing wrong with steam locomotives per se, but they are slow, cumbersome, and inefficient. As are cash and checks. Why in the world would anybody use either to pay rent, reimburse a friend, or settle up with a plumber? (I ask that somewhat rhetorically because dinosaurs like me still do.) And it isn't just inefficient and cumbersome for the consumer. Banks look at cash and checks the same way. ""We still spend about $5 billion moving cash, currency, and checks around our company,"" said Bank of America's current chairman and CEO, Brian Moynihan, in an interview with CNBC earlier this year. ""Our ATMs distribute about $200 million a day in cash. Do you know how much work it is to get that cash in those machines?"" Talk to any exceptional banker today, and they will tell you the same thing: that the future of banking is less about the storage of money and more about its secure and unencumbered movement. It's accordingly Bank of America's lead in this regard that seems to position the nation's second-biggest bank by assets to succeed in the future. Bank of America chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source: Bank of America. On Monday, Bank of America announced that its new person-to-person payments network, Zelle, processed $1.5 billion worth of payments in October. That was up 90% from the same month last year. And this trend should continue to gain momentum. There are now 2.5 million active users of Zelle, with thousands more signing on every day. ""Zelle makes it easy for consumers to send, receive and request money, allowing them to use the existing contacts on their mobile device,"" explains the bank. ""Funds are sent from one bank account to another typically within minutes, when both parties are enrolled, using only a recipient's email address or mobile number."" Bank of America's success in this regard builds on its customers' rapid adoption of its mobile banking application. At the end of the third quarter, there were 23.6 million active users of its mobile app. The volume of mobile check deposits made on the app corresponds to the work of 1,100 branches -- the steam locomotive of the financial services industry. Image source: Bank of America. For investors, these moves are important for two reasons. First, because they keep Bank of America at the forefront of the technological transformation of financial products and services. There could come a day when all banking is done digitally and remotely, so any bank that isn't positioned for that is facing an uncertain future. Additionally, because digital banking products are much more efficient for Bank of America to provide, they are almost certainly helping it continue to cut expenses. Since Moynihan took the reins at the beginning of 2010, the bank has cut its annual expenses from $70 billion down to $55 billion in 2016. And it isn't done. Last year, the bank vowed to drop its yearly operating costs to $53 billion by 2018, a goal that it is has already achieved on an annualized basis. An efficient cost base is essential to banking. There is the direct benefit of allowing more revenue to fall to the bottom line, fattening shareholders' wallets. But there's also an important indirect benefit to running a lean operation: Efficient banks don't have to cut corners on underwriting in order to earn the type of return investors expect. It's no coincidence that the most efficient banks also tend to have fewer nonperforming loans when the credit cycle takes a turn for the worse. And lest there by any doubt about Bank of America's progress on the efficiency front, its results last quarter speak for themselves. It was the second quarter in a row that the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank turned in a lower efficiency ratio than the notoriously efficient Wells Fargo. This goes a long way toward explaining why Bank of America appears to have supplanted Wells Fargo as Warren Buffett's favorite bank. ","
      
    Bank of America's P2P Payments Business Almost Doubled in October -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. I spend most of my days studying banks and their stocks, but the thing I'm focused on right now has little to do with the fundamentals at the banks I follow most closely -- namely, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). What I'm watching instead is the likelihood that corporate tax reform will make it through Congress. If it does, it seems fair to think that bank stocks will respond positively to the news, as it will mean that more of these banks' earnings will be passed on to shareholders as opposed to the government. Image source: Getty Images. If you rank the companies on the S&P 500 based on net income over the last four quarters, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo make up three out of the six most profitable companies on the large-cap index. In other words, if the corporate tax rate were in fact to drop from 35% to 20%, few companies would benefit more than banks. So what's the chance of tax reform passing Congress? It depends on whom you ask. We need real, fiscally responsible #TaxReform that doesn't explode the nat'l debt. https://t.co/h0iBN2wcoD  Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative organization that lobbies for lower taxes, says that the odds of passing are high. ""I believe the Senate will pass a tax reform close enough to House bill to get it conferenced and signed into law by December 15,"" Norquist wrote on Twitter. ""Odds: 90%....never know how many [Republican] Senators will be in hospital or funk on a given day."" I believe the Senate will pass a tax reform close enough to House bill to get it conferenced and signed into law by December 15.Odds: 90%....never know how many R Senators will be in hospital or funk on a given day.No R votes against on policy https://t.co/n5lirF6Ql0  Analysts at KBW agree that the odds of a tax bill passing are high, but not as high as Norquist thinks. One of the investment bank's lead analysts, Brian Gardner, ""sees no unresolvable differences between the two bills and increases his view on the likelihood of a tax bill passing to around 70-75% from 60-65%,"" KBW wrote in a recent note to clients. Whether these predictions prove accurate will come down to six Republican senators: Ron Johnson, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, Bob Corker, and John McCain. I applaud @senorrinhatch & @GOPSenFinance on completing markup of #TaxReform & moving it through the regular order w/ hearings, debate & amendments. https://t.co/Jsjz5CjGzg  For anyone trying to get a handle on the future direction of bank stocks -- especially big banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, which earn more money than all but a few other companies -- you'll want to watch pronouncements from these senators closely over the next couple weeks.

Image source: The Motley Fool. Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Splunk Inc. 3rd quarter 2018 financial results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should require assistance during the conference, please press *, then 0 on your touch-tone telephone. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ken Tinsley, Corporate Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Great. Thank you, Glenda. Appreciate that. Good afternoon. With me on the call today are Splunk CEO Doug Merritt and CFO Dave Conte. Our press release was issued after the close of market today, and it is posted on our website. This conference call is being broadcast live via webcast, and following the call, an audio replay will be available on our website. On today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including financial guidance and expectations for our fourth quarter and fiscal years 2018 and 2019, our long-term targets for fiscal 2020, the expected effects of new revenue recognition standards; our market opportunity, our strategies, and our competitive position; and our planned investments, including product services, market groups, and sales. These statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us, and actual events or results may differ materially. Please refer to documents we filed with the SEC, including the Form 8-K filed with today's press release. Those documents contain risks and uncertainties, and other factors which may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are being made as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these statements. If this call is reviewed after today, the information presented during this call may not contain current or accurate information. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the press release and on our website. With that, here's Doug. Thank you, Ken. Hello, everyone, and welcome to the call. I am happy to report a strong Q3, delivering revenue of $329 million, up 34% over last year. Our growth continues to come from a combination of new customers and our existing customers expanding their deployments on prem and in the cloud. We saw strength across all of our regions as strong demand for Splunk Solutions continues to grow. With the U.S. federal year-end in September, I'm happy to call out the public sector team and report that they had a great finish to their year with multiple large orders. I also want to congratulate the leadership covering the EMEA theaters for delivering another fantastic quarter. As I've said many times, our market opportunity is massive, and we're still early on the Splunk adoption journey, even within our largest accounts. Q3 also allows me to thank the 7,000 customers, partners, and Splunk fans who joined us at .conf, our eighth annual user conference. Hundreds of innovative use cases were presented. Two of my favorites were Dubai Airports, where Michael Ibbitson joined me onstage to share how they are using Splunk as their data and analytics platform at one of the world's busiest international airports. The team uses Splunk to analyze sensor data in every corner of the airport to drive efficiencies and improve the passenger experience. For example, they're monitoring security stations to ensure passengers get through in less than five minutes; analyzing data from the baggage system to deliver bags on team; Splunking the Wi-Fi network to remove rogue hotspots and guarantee high-speed access; and even keeping bathrooms clean with alerts on bathroom centers. Next up, Dubai Airports is working to save $25 million per year by monitoring its energy consumption. What an amazing showcase for the creativity of our consumers and the power of the Splunk platform. Another great use case came from the Global Emancipation Network, one of our Splunk Pledge recipients, who's using Splunk to identify and work toward eliminating human trafficking activity around the world. In partnership with our Splunk4Good team, the Global Emancipation Network analyzes seemingly disparate datasets from across the Internet, public and private organizations, and other sources to identify trafficking activity, and then teams up with law enforcement to take action. This organization is a fantastic example of applying the power of big data analytics and machine learning to solve one of the world's most complex problems. At .conf, we also showcased our latest product releases, including new versions of Splunk Enterprise 7.0, Splunk Cloud, IT Service Intelligence 3.0, Enterprise Security Content Updates, and User Behavior Analytics 4.0. We are widening our lead in the market with the 7.0 release of the Splunk platform. With our new native support for metrics, which are numerical data points captured over time, Splunk Enterprise is doing to metrics what we did to event data. Our customers can now seamlessly unify, correlate, and visualize logs and metrics in the same platform, enhancing their ability to analyze, monitor, and investigate their environments. With 7.0, our customers can leverage their metrics data with better TCO and at massive increase in speed -- at least 20 times faster. This capability is particularly relevant to the monitoring portions of IT ops and apps delivery, and also for IOT use cases, where telemetry generated by the increasing number of connected devices is metrics based. Finally, this capability creates a launching point for new products and solutions, such as Project Waitomo, which we previewed at .conf. This solution will combine metrics and logs to make infrastructure monitoring easy, specifically built to help systems administrators and site reliability engineers who may have never tried Splunk and need to get it up and running in minutes. Following .conf, we announced two acquisitions this quarter. SignalSense, which offered cloud-based, advanced data collection and breach text and solutions powered by machine learning, and selected assets of Rocana, which provided analytics solutions for the IT market. These additions will further advance our data platform and our machine learning capabilities across Splunk's portfolio. Technologies like these and the teams behind them fit into our broader strategy of leveraging the ecosystem around us as an extension of our internal R&D efforts. We also introduced new advancements of our premium solutions Splunk IT Service Intelligence 3.0, which is revolutionizing event monitoring by combining service context with machine learning. ITSI's new event analytics capabilities broaden the use cases that we can address within IT operations. Our Enterprise Security Content Update is a new subscription service that regularly delivers dynamic, prepackaged security content for Splunk ES customers. User Behavior Analytics, or UBA, 4.0, enables customers to create and use their own machine learning models to identify custom anomalies and threats via a new software developers kit. And we debuted Splunk Essentials for Fraud Detection, a free app that guides customers in how to use Splunk to identify and investigate different types of fraud. This is another example of our ability to leverage the flexibility of our platform to quickly introduce a new solution that helps our customers deal with a critical pain point. I'm proud of our product teams, who delivered an awesome set of releases. We also showcased new solutions developed with our partner ecosystem. Let me begin with AWS, where we continue to deliver on our commitment to provide a comprehensive range of AWS integrations that meet our customer's needs. As just one example, we delivered a new release of the Splunk app Creative US with major enhancements around ingestion speed and usability. We also announced the general availability of Booz Allen Hamilton's Cyber4Sight for Splunk, a solution empowering security analysts and threat hunters with actionable threat intelligence. We released new integrations between Splunk and Puppet, including the Splunk app for Puppet Enterprise, and Splunk ITSI module for Puppet Enterprise to help customers address issues in real time through machine learning. And we showcased multiple Accenture offers powered by Splunk, including Accenture's cyber defense platform and Accenture's POS Zoom, which is a Splunk-based analytics solution for retail customers. Using POS Zoom, retailers can leverage analytics to unlock growth and future customer value. In addition to the rich customer and partner content, we unveiled our next set of activities related to our Splunk4Good initiative, including three training programs to help military veterans and youth train for careers in technology. I'm thrilled that more than 2,200 people have already signed up for this training. Stepping back, with the move to digital, e-commerce, mobile, and social, organizations are now increasingly using machine data to provide critical context to transactions they typically stored in their databases and data warehouses. Splunk's platform is the best solution to enable customers to harness this largely unstructured data and use it to make real-time decisions. Our goal remains the same: to become the standard for machine data in every account -- the ubiquitous machine data platform solving our customer's big data challenges, and IT operations, and application delivery; and security, compliance, and fraud; as well as in business analytics and the Internet of Things. These markets are going through a shift to an analytics and machine learning-based approach, where Splunk is uniquely positioned to lead this change and deliver for our customers. During the quarter, we saw continued momentum in both our Splunk platform and in our premium apps. Starting with IT ops and app delivery, wins in this quarter include SunTrust Bank, who expanded its use of Splunk Enterprise and ITSI to gain real-time visibility into potentially fraudulent digital activity; monitor mission-critical KPIs, like customer response times; and ensure compliance. Thanks for our partner Trace3 for our help with this win. Longtime customer Vodafone Egypt expanded its use of Splunk Enterprise to gain 360-degree visibility across all customer touch points, from their websites, mobile app, and customer call centers. Deakin University, a leading university in Australia with our 53,000 students, expanded with Splunk Enterprise to manage its IT operations and networking environment. Other notable customer wins include Defense Health Agency, BCD Travel, Hong Kong's Li & Fung Limited, and Johns Hopkins University. Moving to security, where the market opportunity is being driven by an ongoing SIEM replacement cycle, as well as a multitude of security events in the past several months. Security departments are increasingly realizing the need to shift to an analytics-based security strategy, an approach that Splunk has been defining and driving for years. We are leading and helping our customers with this migration from structured legacy SIEM to an analytics-based approach. Notable wins in the quarter include the Smithsonian Institution, who upgraded its use of Splunk to improve threat detection and mitigation across its world-famous museums and research centers; a large federal agency who expanded their use of Splunk Enterprise and ES to meet their strict compliance requirements. Thanks to our partners at Spear and Cumulus for their work on this opportunity. Daimler, the German automotive group, signed a multi-terabyte deal to replace its legacy SIEM with Enterprise ES. The group will use Splunk as its nerve center for security, providing insights across the entire organization. The University of Leeds, one of the largest higher education institutions in the UK, expanded its use of Enterprise and ES as their SIEM. The university is already using Splunk and IT ops to monitor their networks. Thanks for our partners at Softcat for their contribution to this expansion. Splunk is the strategic technology at the Department of Homeland Security, which made a major expansion to replace its legacy SIEM with ES and DHS datacenter. Other notable customer wins include the CallidusCloud, Domo, U.S. Army, Arizona State University, the UK's Derbyshire Fire & Rescue Service, and Banner Health. And we continue to see our champions expanding their use of Splunk to monitor critical business services to understand the increasing amount of data coming from centers and connected devices. The Dubai Airports use case I mentioned earlier is a great example of that. Another example in Q3 was our customer Norsk Helsenett, a service provider for Norway's healthcare sector. They made a large expansion of enterprise to move beyond IT and security to monitor the usage of their healthcare services to drive care improvements to their customers. I was lucky enough to be in the Nordics to sign the contract with Norsk in person this quarter, and we look forward to seeing them again at our upcoming Splunk Live in Stockholm. And as we do each quarter, we highlight a handful of customers who standardize on Splunk as their data platform. A few of this quarter's customers include 21st Century Fox, a Splunk customer for nearly five years, who signed an EAA to standardize on Splunk, and will now use the platform on AWS across all IT and business operation centers to gain visibility across the company in IT, security, and in the business. Our longtime customer Atlassian expanded its EAA in Q3 as well. Atlassian uses Enterprise and ES for security globally. This expansion moves Splunk further into IT to help ensure that Atlassian products, such as JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket, and their recent acquisition, Stride, are always available to the customers and their staff. Nutanix is another great example of a new technology alliance partner who is also leveraging Splunk to improve IT and security within their own organization. Nutanix quadrupled its use of Enterprise for visibility across IT and security. As you'd guess, the team is running Splunk on Nutanix software and driving great scale on TCO. Thanks to our partners at Avant Garde, who were instrumental in the deal. And leading software development platform Github expanded their use of our solutions to ensure their platform stays online and is secure. In engineering, Github will increase use of Splunk throughout their development and operations life cycle. And in security, the instant response team will use Splunk to identify and respond to attacks. Our cloud business continues to grow, with Q3 being our largest quarter ever. Our customers are leveraging the Splunk platform to analyze their data, regardless of its location, on prem or in the cloud. A few of our cloud wins this quarter include PIMCO, the investment management firm, who's adding Splunk Cloud to provide visibility and insights into its business critical applications; and ATB Financial, a new Cloud customer who signed a multiyear agreement to use Splunk to improve customer experience by ensuring availability of its online banking systems. A few other cloud wins include Blackbaud and the Texas Department of Transportation. In addition to the joint partner solutions we unveiled at .conf and the customer wins with our partners that I mentioned above, I want to call out a few go to market wins in Q3, starting with AWS, for a large European pharmaceutical company purchased Splunk Enterprise and ES through the AWS marketplace to replace the legacy SIEM. AWS was also instrumental in closing a large rental car company as a new Splunk Cloud customer, again through the AWS marketplace. On the security side, we had several joint wins with our managed security partner, the Herjavec Group, including two new Splunk Cloud Security customers. We've seen an increase in demand for skilled managed security service providers that support hybrid offerings, and we're continuing to invest in our managed service security providers like the Herjavec Group. We were humbled with new recognitions and awards in Q3. One in particular to call out is Fortune Magazine naming Splunk to its inaugural Fortune Future 50 List, which highlights the most forward-looking, innovative companies in the world. In summary, it was a strong quarter, and as always, I'm very proud of our Splunk team. We have a tremendous opportunity in front of us. We are delivering high value to our customers, who are expanding their adoption of Splunk as their platform for machine data analytics and for machine learning, both on prem and in the cloud. Splunk is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity, and we are pursuing it aggressively. Thanks again to all of our customers and partners, and thanks to everybody who works at Splunk. And now, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Dave Conte. All right. Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In Q3, we exceeded our overall plan, and as Doug said, we did so on the strength and outperformance across all regions. Q3 revenues totaled $329 million, a 34% increase over Q3 of last year. Total billings were $382 million, up 38% over last year. Cloud revenues totaled $24.4 million, and overall software revenues, which include license and cloud revenue, grew 34% year-over-year. Customer success remains our top priority, and adoption of our platform and solutions are driving software bookings growth, where more than 80% came from existing customers. We also added more than 450 new customers in the quarter, and we recorded 581 orders over $100,000.00. At our analyst meeting in January, I outlined a number of metrics to follow on our path to revenues of $2 billion in fiscal '20, one of which was ASPs. Consistent with our cohort, as customers continue to realize value from our product, their adoption of Splunk from one to many use cases increases, ultimately leading to our goal around standardization on our platform, like the EAA examples Doug just walked you through. Consistent with adoption overall, in Q3, the ASP for the 581 orders greater than $100,000, which includes two of the largest cloud transactions we've ever recorded, was this highest in our history, reflected continued value delivery from our platform. We'll update you on the full year ASPs once the year is complete, but I expect we'll be on track to our fiscal '20 annual ASP target. In Q3, international operations represented 24% of total revenues, consistent with previous levels and comparable on a year-over-year basis. Education and professional services represented ten% of revenue in Q3, which is typical for the quarter in which we hold .conf. Now, turning to margins and other results, which are all non-GAAP. Q3 overall gross margin was 84%, consistent with our expectations and reflecting improving cloud gross margins. Operating income was $32.3 million, representing a positive margin of 9.8%, better than planned, due to our outperformance on the top line. Q3 net income was $25.1 million, and EPS was $0.17 per share, based on a fully diluted weighted average share count of 144.4 million shares. Now, turning to cash generation and liquidity. Cash flow from operations was $52.3 million. Free cash flow was $46.9 million, and we ended the quarter with about $1.1 billion in total cash and investments, which reflects approximately $42 million paid during the quarter for the two acquisitions. Now, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we expect Q4 total revenues of between $388 million and $390 million, with a 16% non-GAAP operating margin. This translates to full-year revenues of between $1.239 billion and $1.241 billion, up from our prior high-end guidance of $1.215 billion. And we're increasing our full-year cloud revenue estimate to $90 million, up from our prior guidance of $85 million. We're also raising our full-year billings estimate to $1.485 billion, up from $1.450 billion, and we're raising our cloud billings estimate to $170 million, up from the $150 million we previously guided. With our increased full-year outlook and reflecting our performance through the first nine months of the year, we now expect operating margin to be closer to 8.5%, up from our original 8% estimate. Now for EPS, remember, because we expect to remain profitable on a non-GAAP basis for Q4 and the full year, full-year EPS calculations, you should use a fully diluted share count of approximately 146 million shares in Q4, at a 144 million shares for the full year. Looking beyond this fiscal year, we're excited about the success our customers are realizing from our offerings, and we expect that success to be reflected in our financial performance. With that, I wanted to provide top-line estimates for the next two years. We expect next year revenues to total approximately $1.55 billion, and we reiterate our fiscal 2020 total revenue target of $2 billion. As we continue to scale our product and field capabilities to capitalize on our market opportunity, we will accelerate these and other investments while maintaining our spending discipline and delivering about a 200 basis point margin expansion in fiscal 2019. This should result in non-GAAP operating margin of around 10.5% next year, on pace to achieve our fiscal '20 target of 12% to 14%. Now turning to the new revenue recognition accounting standard, 606, which we'll adopt next year, our fiscal '19, the seasonality revenues will be different than what we've experienced historically. Specifically, total revenues have typically been split between 42% to 58% first half to second. Under 606, we expect this will steepen some and be closer to 40%-60%, with almost all of the impact in our seasonally smallest Q1. As we conclude the current year and finalize our 606 adoption, we'll update you with more specifics to help ensure our models reflect the momentum we see in the business. More to come on this topic, obviously, in the near-term. In closing, our team continues to execute on our mission to deliver high value to our customers, and we're committed to driving the best possible customer experience through continued investments in our products, solutions, the cloud, our global reach, and, of course, our people. Overall execution and results in Q3 were excellent, and I'm looking forward to a strong finish to the year. Thanks so much for your time and interest. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, if you have a question, please press the * then the number 1 key on your touch-tone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the pound key. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please place your line on mute once your question has been stated. And our first question comes from the line of Brian White from Drexel. Your line is now open. Okay, great. Great quarter, guys. When we think about the quarter and the outlook, it's probably one of the strongest outlooks we've seen in a long, long time from Splunk, and now you're going out to even fiscal '19 in giving guidance. Maybe just give us an update on the competitive landscape. It seems like you're really starting to show more momentum than we've seen in recent memory. Thanks. Yeah, it was a really nice quarter. The competitive landscape remains really similar to what we've seen. Our win rates against the track competitors are generally in the 80% to upwards to 95% rate. And it just feels like there's a growing understanding of the value of Splunk, especially when you get to high intensity, production-oriented use cases, and you deal with more and more of the issues of a really broad and complex set of data. And I think our solutions-oriented strategy continues to help us as well with solutions like Enterprise Security, ITSI, UBA, and others, helping our customers understand what we do, how to use Splunk, and how to get quick time to value. And just a follow-up, on 606, Dave, is this a revenue headwind in fiscal '19? You gave numbers, but is that a headwind, a tailwind? And just remind us how we should think about the impact on deferred revenue. I remember we talked about $300 million or something in that range. Yup, yeah. Hey, thanks, Brian. The headwind, tailwind, is ultimately going to be dependent on the ending balance sheet. And, as you mentioned, when you adopt 606, there's an impact where you remove a certain amount of deferred revenue. The absolute number -- again, at Analyst Day, I used 300 as an example. We've got to get to the end of the year to actually quantify what that impact will be. So, headwind, tailwind, you get the detriment of a removal of deferred revenue; you get the benefit of upfront revenue on our ever-increasing subscription business. But we really have to get to the end of the year to quantify that. Okay, great. Congratulations. Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Brian. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Thanks very much and congrats, guys. It's phenomenal, phenomenal results. Thanks, Brad. Thanks, Brad. Sure. So first for Doug. Doug, in the quarter you put out a press release elevating Susan St. Ledger's role. I guess this quarter's result is early evidence of that. What, if anything, changes operationally in elevating her? And then related, on go-to-market, what's the latest update on leadership in EMEA? Good questions, Brad. So with Susan being promoted to President, she's now President of Worldwide Field Operations, and we added in a few areas like marketing to her responsibility. The core driver of that is, as we're looking to the next phase of our growth, beyond $2 billion, it's really important for us to gain leverage and scale across every single customer touch point that we have. She had a broad scope. I think we've broadened that a little bit more. Where I think it becomes even more important is when you add in the significance of our transition to a subscription focus, then elements like self-service, touchless transactions, from initial awareness on broad-based, above the funnel market orientation all the way through to support and renewals become just a critical portion of the machinery that needs to execute flawlessly on that horizontal basis across these different functions. I think moving -- ensuring that all those customer touch points are under one leader, and that she's got the job title and responsibility within the company clearly distinguished to make whatever moves were necessary is a good thing, and she's doing a fantastic job, as we all saw this quarter. On Europe, as you saw, we had a really nice quarter in Europe again. I think a lot of that is the luxury of the strong bench that I'd highlighted in Q1. I thought that we had some strong sub-theater leaders, but many of them are early in their tenure, and we spent a lot of time building out that management structure across EMEA and also across APAC, so we can get that scale in the international region that we're seeing and enjoying in the public sector in America's theaters. And she's had a really nice in-bound set of demands and interests for that position. She's down to the finalists, and I'm -- hopefully, you'll see an announcement coming out relatively soon. Awesome. And if I could just ask one follow-up for Dave. Dave, cash flow came in a little bit lighter than we had expected. If I look at DSOs, they look like they're a bit higher than trend. Other than linearity, is there anything we should be thinking about here and anything you might be doing to improve collections or better manage linearity of the business over time? Thanks. Yeah. No, we're pretty satisfied with the performance for the quarter, and candidly, for the year. We obviously had almost 600 greater than $100,000 orders. Those can impact linearity, as you would imagine. We think about cash flow on an annual basis. We don't guide it quarterly. And I guess I'm on a live call, Ken. I can go ahead and say we feel that we're on track for $250 million of operating cash flow for the year. So, I just want to echo Doug's commentary. The performance in the field was obviously quite strong, and we're very proud of the transactions that we closed. And I don't think there's anything to read into DSOs or quarterly cash flow. Great to hear. Thanks again, guys. All right. Thanks, Brad. Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Hey, guys, strong quarter. One for Doug and one for Dave. So, Doug, can you drill down on security demand? You mentioned that there was some impact, it sounded, from both the upgrade cycle on SIEM as well as recent events. How much of an impact do you feel like you've had from both Ransomware and Equifax from this summer, and what changes have you seen in terms of the shift in spending to SIEM? Good question, Michael. Yeah, we've been, I think, uniquely touting -- I think we probably started this trend four or five years ago on moving from an independent product-driven messaging to the need for broad-based security analytics, for people to really get a feel and understanding of anything that could be happening across the constantly changing cyber landscape that these guys have got to -- have to defend and be familiar with. And I think that the fundamental power of Splunk as a machine data platform, the schema-on-read architecture we always talk about allows multi-use case opportunities within the security departments, obviously, and outside security as well, is really resonating a little bit more clearly with these guys, as the attacks were coming fast and furious from multiple different areas, from ransomware, to kind of classic breaches, to insider threat, and other behavior analytics you can be driving as well. And as we all know, security is a boardroom topic. It is a critical agenda item for the exec team in most companies. And I think we're definitely seeing that with our execution in the security space over the past couple quarters. Okay. And then, Dave, obviously it's fine on billings too. It didn't look offhand like a mix shift, but license was particularly strong. So, was there any mix shift or less mix shift toward subscription at all this quarter and consequent positive impacts on rev rec? Again, we think about mix annually, as you know. I mentioned in prepared remarks, we recorded our two largest cloud transactions in our history. I raised our outlook for cloud revenue and cloud billings for the year, so I think we're feeling confident with our execution around our move toward subscription overall. Obviously, that -- we laid it out as a three-year journey back in January, and I think we're tracking well. Obviously, with the seasonally strongest and largest Q4 just ahead of us, as you guys know, individual transactions can move what will ultimately be our full-year metric, but the execution in the field around satisfying customer demand for how they consume our products, whether it's on prem with the subscription license or in the cloud with our SaaS service, has been really strong. Okay, Dave, thanks a lot, and congrats again on the quarter. Great job. Thanks, Michael. Thanks, Michael. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks, guys. for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter. One question for the team and just one follow-up specifically for Dave. Obviously, you touched on the curated experience down at the analyst session at .conf, and obviously, you talked tonight about security, ITSI, UBA, but wondering if you could give us just some more color in terms of how you think those curated experiences, those curated apps, are impacting business now. Any of those newer ones starting to inflect? And then as you start to scroll forward, '19 and '20 year guidance, I mean, how do you think about those curated experiences driving growth? Will it be free experiences just driving the base platform or add-ons? And then just one quick follow-up for Dave. Thanks, Phil. We're seeing increasing uptake around a few of these, but they're still early on. And those curated experiences aren't solutions; and again, we have lots of terminology around the thickness of the solution at Splunk. But different clustering of data visualizations, dashboards, alerts, remediations, some light workflow that specifically answer the needs of a set of users within the account so that they're not starting from scratch with the underlying Splunk Enterprise platform. They obviously can still do that, but they get what they need much more cleanly out of the box. This Project Waitomo that I talked about, again, on the call and that we previewed at .conf is a good example of one of these, where we're combining the metrics to our capability with the classic streaming log orientation of Splunk to really help systems administrators and site reliability engineers get up and running literally in minutes. It's a really cool experience as far as immediate power of Splunk. And we actually, for Waitomo, strip out things like our -- the flexibility of the search and investigate piece. It is a purpose-built view on top of Splunk Enterprise. I think that will increasingly be the way that we see our land opportunities happen in the coming two years. And the whole point is, let's get that -- first, let's make it easier to get that first set of data in, increase the time to value or decrease the time to value, increase the time to power for our different customers, so that we accelerate that use case journey across multiple different departments to eventually drive that more EAA platform-ish type sale that we're seeing with some of our bigger accounts. That said, I think the answer is it will depend on the account and the segment with the larger strategic accounts by getting a little bit less velocity on some of these curated insight experiences, and the newer accounts and more mid-size accounts probably getting a lot more of those and demanding those more strongly. Got it. Thanks, Doug. And then, Dave, at one point last year you talked about Splunk Cloud being about a five-point headwind to its margins. I'm wondering if you can give us an update into just about how that business is scaling from a margin perspective. Yeah. Hey, Phil. We're feeling good about the trajectory for Splunk Cloud from a margin perspective. Recall last quarter, I reported that we hit a milestone in Splunk Cloud in Q2 of 30% positive gross margins, and that we expect it to be about that level for the remainder of the year. And that held true for the third quarter. So, good progress, good scale, and heading in the right direction. Got it. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Phil. Thanks, Phil. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Thank you. I have a question for Doug and maybe a follow-up for Dave. And Doug, my question is actually a follow-up to Mike's question, to Michael Turits' question. So these are really strong results, as a couple of people had said so far today, and we're seeing decent results from a lot of software names, but not so much in the security space. I mean, that's been a little bit mixed. Can you talk a little bit about the strong aggregate momentum we're seeing here in your numbers relative to what we're seeing in security? It sounds like security is doing pretty well, but are you seeing better results in the other areas, or is security keeping up, which would kind of you make you somewhat of an anomaly given some of the recent reports? Hey, John. So this quarter's security actually did really well for us. We talk about it being in the 40% to 50% range. It was over 50% for us in this quarter. And the IT sector is still healthy, growing, and vital to our future, and we see these trade-offs back and forth every quarter. A lot of these security wins I talked about, they started with IT operations and then moved over to security, so we see it moving both ways. But just going back to what do we -- there was a mixed bag in the security arena right now, and what we're -- where I see people leaning in for Splunk is we provide an abstraction layer with Splunk Enterprise and then solutions like ES that is agnostic to the typically hundreds of different security solutions that most decent-sized organizations have across their security landscape. And what I hear from a lot of CSOs is, yeah, I mean, it'd be nice to get the benefits of a next generation X, Y, or Z in the security landscape, but what I really need is, I need to be able to tie all of those together into a platform, into what I had called the nerve center of the brain, so I can take advantage of all the capability, and data, and strength of the multitude of different solutions I've already paid for and deployed. And I think that's why we're seeing some good traction. And I think the SIEM replacement cycle works to our advantage as well. Got it. Okay, that makes sense. Thanks, Doug. And, Dave, if I could -- actually, another follow-up for Brad's question. I think I understood where you're kind of saying. I know you don't guide to cash flow, but as he pointed out, AR was greater than -- was a greater use of cash than we anticipated anyway, and I assume he did, too. But I just want to make sure I understand. You've signed the -- Doug mentioned a lot of large deals, a lot of enterprise agreements. Those are typically signed -- not all of them. They're typically signed at the end of the quarter, and I just want to make sure -- I mean, I would expect to see those receivables be collected next quarter benefiting cash flow in that period. And the reason for the question is, I mean, every number looks really strong. It doesn't look bad. It's just a little low. It's the only one that's a little lower, more than where people were estimating. Yeah. Again -- hey, John -- I feel very good about our cash collections, the process, the age of our receivables. We had the benefit in the quarter from a DSO perspective that federal year-end is September, as we all know. And the government tends to pay on time. Not always. But I don't think there's any -- there's no news. There's no there as it relates to DSOs or cash flow. It was a really strong quarter. You can see that across all of our financial -- relevant financial metrics. And the benefit is in receivables, and you bet we're gonna collect it next quarter. So, for the year, we're on track for our $250 million of operating cash flow. And in any particular quarter, one large order comes in on one timeline versus another, can affect the quarterly DSO. But overall, the review that we do internally, the quality of the balance sheet is really high. And again, you see it on the P&L. Great. That's all clear. Nice job, guys. Thank you very much. Thanks, John. Thanks, John. Operator Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is now open. Hey, thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones. Doug, one for you. Can you talk a little bit toward the AWS relationship? You mentioned a couple of interesting wins this quarter, which is great. I'm just wondering, your relationship with them seems to be different than a lot of the other vendors. For example, they offer Elastic, and Elastic is kind of probably hurting because of that. They do the Hadoop, and their works are hurting. Well, you actually seem to have a very good kind of working relationship where they are actually pushing you. So, can you talk to kind of the motivations there and how you see that evolving? And then just one quick one for Dave. I assume your '19 guidance in terms of revenue and margins is all 606 based. Just to clarify that, so that there's no kind of confusion there. Thank you. Yeah. Hey, Raimo. Yes. Our outlook for fiscal '19 and fiscal '20 are based on 606. And then on the AWS front, yeah, I mean, we're really happy with our relationship. As I've said for a couple of years, they still continue to commission and quota credit their reps, and any of these partnerships are a true multi-year journey. The number of reps at AWS that actually understand Splunk now grows quarter after quarter. As our AWS-dedicated team spends more time educating those folks, we get more lunch and learns, and drink nights, and just have the reps at the field level get to know each other. And we're seeing an increasing cadence of deals come in through that AWS reference approach. And with our marketplace footprint, I think we'll see even more. And ideally, more of those being touchless as people go through the marketplace itself. I think what's a little bit different about us versus the core open source components is that at the heart of Splunk is a semantical layer above different aspects like file systems, storage, vehicles, transport mechanisms. And a lot of what I've been talking about with the data orientation long-term for the company is it doesn't really matter long-term whether we transport data through a Splunk Forwarder or through a cost interface. It doesn't matter whether we store data in the Splunk Index or store it in another format. And because of that, within the AWS landscape, I think we add unique value on top of the different services that they offer. And the message that we are continuously trying to harp on, and you might see a little bit more of that from our marketing department, is Splunk and. Now, Splunk and the Hadoop open source ecosystem, Splunk and data warehouses, Splunk and Palo Alto. And as long as we keep that ability to add value around the core components other people offer, then hopefully, customers will continue to feel like we're worth being a strategic vendor for them. Perfect, thank you. Congratulations. Again, great quarter. Thank you, Raimo. Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nate Cunningham from Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us a rough sense of what the attach rates are looking like on new business for both ES and ITSI? No, I don't think that we disclose those. Yeah. Hey, Nate. It's Dave. We obviously monitor that pretty carefully, but we don't disclose that as a metric externally. We might do so on an annual basis, but not for the quarter. What we can say, though, is the attach rate is increasing. And you hear it in a lot of the examples that Doug talks about in terms of security, the move away from the legacy SIEM folks, just in terms of breadth of capability. So, both in security with ES and in IT with ITSI, we're pleased with the attach rate. We've got plenty of room to go. Okay, fair enough. And as we think about the fiscal '19 guidance, are you assuming any change in the velocity of new customer addition? Well, our goal is by 2020, that we reach the 20,000 customer milestone. So, as we think about new customer acquisition, obviously, to get to that number, we do expect to see an uptick in terms of the annual addition, which, of course, means the quarterly addition, yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Nate. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open. Hi. Thank you very much. Dave, the first question is for you. Really strong billings results this quarter and acceleration, very strong acceleration to call it 38%. And yet, if I look at the guidance for the year, it would suggest that you're anticipating that year-over-year billings would perhaps be back below a 30% growth rate. Was there something, for instance, in the Q3 results, government or otherwise, that would suggest such a deceleration, or is there something missing, perhaps, in terms of why billings would break perhaps below 30% for Q4? Yeah. I mean, I think, first and foremost, as you would expect, Q4 is a tougher comp than any of our other quarters, typically. We obviously had an extremely strong quarter in the public sector space, as you would imagine. But also, a significantly strong performance with our cloud business. And that performance in the quarter certainly led to a billings contribution. Two of our largest -- our largest cloud transactions in our history were recorded in the quarter, and was a basis for me to actually raise our full-year revenue and billings guidance for cloud. So, we'll see how the composition comes in the fourth quarter. That's always been part of the fun here in terms of that mix estimate -- how much is cloud, how much is term, how much is perpetual. That obviously can have some impact on billings. Okay. Okay. All right, fair enough, then. I also wanted to revisit on the customer acquisitions. I think in this press release you indicated 450 new customers. I don't know what the net customer count -- I think it was just under 15,000. And so, you've been flat for the last -- call it three quarters, round numbers. What do you think causes you to get to that 20,000 number in '20, because I think you need a little bit of acceleration, which so far, this year really hasn't experienced? What do you think changes that? Let me step back. And to just make sure I start with my happiness around the adoption in growth rates within our current customers. It's a great feedback signal that they understand the power of our offerings and the strategic nature of Splunk as a data platform that can really power a whole host of use cases across a multitude of different departments. However, I agree with you. I definitely would like the number of new customers to be higher. We've targeted a higher number of new customers over the course of that three-year guidance period that we talked to you guys about. And we are making continued investments in the global reach of our field to increase capabilities and appeal to new customers. We've got to continue, also, to invest in the customer success. That's our number one corporate priority. But really, as Dave has said for as long as I've been listening to these calls, before I even became a Splunker, that coverage is his number one concern area. And it's a choice every year on where we rotate coverage to make sure we can continue to drive that cohort that we're so proud of, of increasing adoption with end customers, as well as dedicating enough overall resourcing, both direct and indirect, for that net new customer piece. We have been making a lot of investments this year. Like so many of these, I think it takes a few quarters to get people onboard, to get them trained, put the programs in place, experiment and figure out what's really working and what's not. But it is a top priority for us through FY '19 and into FY '20 to ensure that we get to that 3,000 or more customers per year that we told you guys about at Analyst Day. Okay. Well, many thanks to you guys. Sounds like it was a really good quarter, particularly in the security area. Best of luck. Cheers. Thank you. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Yeah, thanks, guys. Just one question for me. Doug, with several different purchasing and deployment options, do you find that deal cycles could start to accelerate going forward, as the pricing model, or where Splunk's deployed -- is it an inhibiting factor or friction for additional adoption? I mean, that is another one. When we think about what -- how do we continue to drive the velocity for that $2 billion target and the increased number of transactions and customers, that is part of what we're focused on. These insights, packages, what's so-called the curated -- or what we'd probably describe as the curated experiences at Analyst Day are one of many vehicles that we're looking at, which is how do you create a pricing mechanism for underlying Splunk Enterprise that adheres to the solution that's on top and create a quick bundle that can do even a simpler job of landing into new accounts. And I think moving to subscription, so that customers increasingly just have the choice of one, two, or three-year terms. And the only big decision is, do I want to run it in my own private cloud, or I do want to run it in their public cloud? I think that's another big lever for us to cut down on the cycles that many of our reps have to go through to walk our customers and prospects through all of the options that they have with Splunk. Great, thanks. Congrats again. Thank you. Thanks, Matt. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Let's go to the next question, please. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anne Meisner from Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Thank you, and congrats on the great quarter. Thanks, Anne. So, you guys called out two very large cloud transactions, and you increased your guidance there, so it sounds like cloud is really performing nicely, ahead of your own internal expectations. Are there one or two specific items that you can point to that are really driving the business? So, for example, is it the prepackaged app functionality for cloud, such as the AWS functionality, that's really starting to drive that acceleration? I honestly think that it is the acceleration of cloud across the enterprise sector that's dragging us. And then I think that some of the work that we've been doing to have the specific AWS apps, we now have a number of them in AWS, is a great landing point for people going to AWS, as well as, I do think it's easier for us and our customers to understand what an ES and Splunk bundle looks like, ES and Splunk Enterprise, or an ITSI and Splunk. And I think the more that we can get to a focused solution delivery for our customers that, of course, drags in Splunk Enterprise behind it, but it is something specific to the needs of that buying center or user, the better velocity we have, and the quicker that our customers understand the power of Splunk and get an ROI on their investment. And it's a little bit easier in cloud just because we can kind of preassemble all the bits for our customers, and instead of having the classic arrival of hardware, PS, or a ProServ, or some other consulting assistance that goes with an on prem piece. Okay. Thank you. Very helpful. Thanks, Anne. Thanks, Anne. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Yeah. I have one for Doug and a quick follow-up for Dave. Doug, to follow up on Anne's questions, the two large cloud transactions in the quarter, I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail about those. First, what was the use case? Was it security, or do you have any visibility into that? And were these existing on premise customers that moved to the cloud, or are they in a hybrid environment, or new customers, or something else? Just curious there. So, on the use case basis, I think one was security-focused, and one, I think, is multi-use case, and one was a net new cloud customer, and one was an existing customer. And I think from an existing perspective, there was some on prem. Yeah, I think the existing one is hybrid. Yeah, but it's a minimal amount. I mean, they were really looking for Splunk to help them with their data that they were hosting in the cloud. So, that's where we became more applicable. And to Anne's earlier question, why we had great momentum is, customers were looking to associate our solutions with proximity to where their data resides, which is why it's so important that we can provide both cloud and on prem in a hybrid environment for many of these customers. Now, I think that gets even -- that becomes even more important in an IoT world. It's like you've got -- I think we'll all see multiple layers of delivery of technology, with public cloud still being incredibly important and obviously growing like crazy, like we see it growing, but there are needs for many different deployment types based on the use case and the technology architecture. Gotcha. That's very helpful, guys. And to follow up on the earlier question about ratable mix, are you still on target for the full-year to be 50% ratable, Dave? Thank you. Yeah, hey, Jesse. Obviously, again, great success in the quarter. Increasing our outlook for cloud is all going to contribute toward ratable mix for the full year. With our largest seasonal quarter -- today is the 16th -- we've still got the balance of Q4 ahead of us. We've got to get those transactions closed to finally quantify what is the mix for the year. But we're -- again, I think the execution by the field and collectively, the company, around enabling customers to consume our products both subscription and perpetual was really strong in the quarter. So, looking forward to the balance of the quarter and updating you guys in February. Thank you. Thanks, Jesse. Operator Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Thank you. Appreciate your squeezing me in. And I know you've heard this a lot of times, but it can't hurt to hear it again. Congrats on the quarter. Two quick questions. The first one is, could you talk about what you've seen in terms of demand for term licenses so far this year, especially the past couple of quarters, and maybe what you're thinking about for next year? And then a follow-up. Yeah. As part of that journey, too, we want to get to a minimum of 65% subscription by the end of '19 and 75% by the end of '20. That's very dependent upon continued growth in cloud and obviously a high growth rate on true term. Yeah, so true subscription, I guess I'd say -- on prem subscription. We've been emphasizing that this year. We're seeing good traction with customers and our sales force being excited about and leaning forward with subscription on prem contracts, and we definitely expect that to continue to grow next year and the year after, especially as we continue to come out with additional packaged solutions that take advantage of some of the term architectures. Excellent. And then, given the partnerships in new products, can you give us some color on how you think about or what you're expecting from the partnerships in terms of driving new customer adoption, how we should think about all that? Yeah, I mean, we've been focusing on building out an effective ecosystem, including the solutions on Splunkbase, for a while now. I think most of those have been free, interesting accompaniments. And we hear from a lot of customers that one of the things they love about Splunk is when they need a solution for X, Y or Z, they can go to Splunkbase and find it. But that turn that we started to make with Booz Allen, with Accenture, with some of the apps that we're developing or co-developing with AWS is, I think, that next leg, that next generation. And what we're seeing with those three in particular -- the AWS, Booz Allen and Accenture -- is a higher preponderance of net new customers. They bring their own Rolodex to the table. And the use case is often -- if it's not a new customer, it's a new department within an existing customer, which is still a really nice thing for us, because they, in general, are driving delivery of solutions for use cases, complementary to or in addition to what we're doing with ES, ITSI, or other apps. So, it should be a help with net new customer ads, but we all need to get the motion, go to market motion, solidified to make sure that we realize those net new adds. Mark L. Moerdler-Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC That makes sense. Appreciate it. Thanks. Thanks, Mark. Bye, Mark. Operator Thank you. And that concludes our question and answer session for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Ken Tinsley for closing remarks. Terrific. Thanks, Glenda. I really appreciate your help today. And thanks everybody for joining. As always, we're available here if you have any follow-up questions. Hope everybody has a nice evening and a happy Thanksgiving. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

    Splunk Inc. (SPLK) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript -- The Motley Fool

  "
"Matthew Frankel, CFP",11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett has famously said in regard to Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) stock portfolio that ""our favorite holding period is forever."" Buffett's ideal stock is one that he can buy and whose business continues to grow reliably over time. Having said that, Buffett does buy and sell stocks regularly, and Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio has changed considerably over the years. Even over the past few years, there have been some major additions and subtractions among Berkshire's largest stock positions. Image source: The Motley Fool. Berkshire's stock portfolio consists of more than 45 positions but is heavily weighted toward its largest holdings. So here's a look at how Berkshire's ""top 10"" stocks have changed since the third quarter of 2015. Rank Q3 2015 Q3 2016 Q3 2017 1 Wells Fargo Kraft Heinz Wells Fargo 2 Kraft Heinz Wells Fargo Kraft Heinz 3 Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 4 IBM (NYSE:IBM) IBM Coca-Cola 5 American Express American Express Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) 6 Phillips 66 Phillips 66 American Express 7 Procter & Gamble U.S. Bancorp Phillips 66 8 Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) Moody's IBM 9 U.S. Bancorp Charter Communications U.S. Bancorp 10 DaVita HealthCare DaVita HealthCare Moody's Data source: Berkshire Hathaway 13-F filings. Many of the major positions have remained the same. The Kraft Heinz, Coca-Cola, and American Express positions haven't changed much, to name a few examples. However, there have been a few big changes over the past couple of years that investors should be aware of. Buffett is known for his avoidance of the tech sector, but he has made exceptions for well-established tech companies with big competitive advantages. For the past several years, this has been IBM, which until 2017 was one of Berkshire's ""big four"" stocks. However, Buffett has been selling off Berkshire's IBM stake, saying that the competition in its industry has become more intense and that he's revalued the stock downward. Instead, Buffett has been accumulating a position in Apple, which, thanks to several additions to the position and an all-time high for the stock, has become Berkshire's third largest stock position. Buffett loves the ""stickiness"" of Apple's product line, as well as the business' fundamentals, and so far, it has proved to be a wise investment. Another addition to the top five is Bank of America, although this isn't exactly a new investment. In the wake of the financial crisis, Buffett invested $5 billion in Bank of America preferred stock, and as part of the deal, he received warrants to buy 700 million shares of the bank for just $7.14. In other words, Buffett had the ability to swap his preferred stock for 700 million shares of common stock. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett said that if Bank of America's dividend was raised to a point where Berkshire could generate more income by owning common stock, the warrants would be exercised. Well, Bank of America raised its dividend beyond Buffett's threshold, so Berkshire is now Bank of America's largest shareholder. One stock that appears in the top 10 in 2015 but not again is Wal-Mart. In the third quarter of 2015, Berkshire owned 56.2 million shares of the retail giant, with a total value of more than $3.6 billion, but the company decided to sell most of its position during 2016. Now, the company owns just over $130 million in Wal-Mart stock. While Buffett referred to Wal-Mart as a ""fabulous company"" even after he sold Berkshire's shares, Buffett said the retail business had become too tough, and that the ""online thing"" was very difficult to figure out. Buffett believed that Wal-Mart would experience continued success, but he wasn't sure if the company could successfully compete with Amazon.com and other e-commerce headwinds. It appears that Buffett may have been wrong to doubt Wal-Mart's ability to take on Amazon. In fact, in Wal-Mart's most recent earnings report, the company reported 50% year-over-year growth in e-commerce sales and its best same-store-sales growth in more than five years. The market seems to agree. Wal-Mart's stock price is up nearly 40% so far in 2017, meaning that based on how much of Wal-Mart's stock Berkshire owned two years ago, Buffett missed out on more than $1.5 billion in gains. Berkshire's portfolio is extremely top-heavy -- in fact, the company's five largest holdings are worth more than its other 40 or so combined. So it makes sense that Berkshire's largest stock holdings get most of the attention. After all, a big move in these stocks could significantly affect the company's market value. However, while Buffett and his team haven't been too active with its largest stocks, there have been lots of smaller moves over the past two years. Just to name a few examples, Berkshire sold its stakes in Suncor Energy, AT&T, General Electric, and Chicago Bridge & Iron and has added Synchrony Financial, Store Capital, and stakes in all four major U.S. airlines. Berkshire has been relatively quiet in the stock market lately. With the exception of the Apple investment and the conversion of its Bank of America warrants, the company hasn't made any stock investments recently that would be considered big by Berkshire's standards. Stock valuations are high, and Buffett and his team have said that it's been difficult to find attractive investments. ","

Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Spectrum Brands Holdings' Fiscal 2017 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm Dave Prichard, Vice President of Investor Relations for Spectrum Brands, and I'll be your moderator for our call today. Now, to help you follow along with our comments, we have placed a slide presentation on the Event Calendar page in the Investor Relations section of our website at spectrumbrands.com. This document will remain there following our call. Now, if we start with Slide 2 of the presentation, you'll note that our call will be led by Andreas Rouvé, our Chief Executive Officer, and Doug Martin, our Chief Financial Officer. Andreas and Doug will deliver opening remarks, and then they will conduct the Q&A session. Now, let's turn to Slide 3 and also Slide 4. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, including our outlook for fiscal 2018 and beyond. These statements are based upon management's current expectations, projections, and assumptions, and are by nature uncertain. Actual results may differ materially. Now, due to that risk, Spectrum Brands encourages you to review the risk factors and cautionary statements outlined in our press release dated November 16th, 2017, and our most recent SEC filings, and Spectrum Brands Holdings' most recent 10-K.

With that, I'm very pleased now to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Andreas Rouvé. Thanks, Dave, and thank you all for joining us. Turning to Slide 6: We finished a challenging fiscal 2017 with a solid fourth-quarter performance. Net of acquisitions and of favorable currency impact, we grew organic net sales in Q4 by 3.1%. If we consider our decision to exit low-margin, non-strategic business, then the adjusted organic sales growth of our core business was even 4.2%. Accordingly, we increased our organic adjusted EBITDA by 5% and our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 50 basis points to 19.5%. Our Home and Garden and Hardware and Home Improvement led the away with record quarterly results. Also, Global Auto Care and Personal Care delivered a solid performance, and I'm pleased to report that our E-commerce business remains a bright spot with growth of over 50% in our core U.S. market. Regionally, our growth was broad-based and driven by North America, Europe, and Asia/Pacific. Sales were up also in Latin America if we exclude the exit of non-strategic business. Let me add here that the integration of our PetMatrix and GloFish acquisitions from Q3 are proceeding well, and both are delivering ahead of our expectations. Fiscal 2017 was our eighth consecutive year of record adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margins, and adjusted free cash flow, which grew 10%, in large part from excellent working capital improvement. Our reported EBITDA margin increased by 20 basis points to 19.1%, which was also a record annual level. In 2017, major U.S. retailers had adjusted their inventory levels, especially in our seasonal categories. While we expect retailers to continue their focus on lower inventory levels also in the future, we believe that the inventory levels are now much healthier than a year ago. In addition, the two-year up and down impact of the Zika virus on our repellents business in our Home and Garden division has now been completed. Also, the adverse impact of exiting low-margin non-strategic business, which reduced our top line in 2017 by approximately $42 million or 0.8% will lessen in 2018 to approximately $25 million, which is related to the exit of a dog and cat food customer tolling agreement in Europe. At the same time, we have increased the pace of new product development, and are bringing more innovation to the market, and are moving into more channels, categories, and countries around the world, such as our launch of major brands through China's leading e-commerce retailer, JD.com, and the U.S. launch last month of the leading British Russell Hobbs brand of kitchen appliances. Also, in batteries, we are stepping up our investment to enable further international growth with the expansion of our alkaline battery plant in Germany and our hearing aid battery plant in the U.K. We are also making good progress in our two transformational projects in the U.S. The consolidation of our global auto care manufacturing and distribution in Dayton, Ohio is now complete, and the consolidation of our hardware and home improvement distribution in Kansas is currently 65% complete, and we expect to complete this project in March 2018. Both projects streamline our supply chain and will allow us to reduce our inventory levels and improve our service levels. Finally, our voluntary U.S. pet rawhide recall in June continued to have an operating cost and sales impact in Q4. We have corrected the production issue, have restarted the three South American plants, and continue to restock retailers in the U.S. and Canada. However, we will still have some impact at the beginning of this fiscal year. Turning to Slide 7: Looking forward, we are optimistic about delivering organic net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth in fiscal 2018. As many of you have seen, we also guided this morning to another year of record adjusted free cash flow with an increase of as much as 9%. This growth is driven by our focus to have Spectrum Brands present with our superior quality and superior value product wherever and however the consumer chooses to shop. This is why we place such an emphasis on strengthening our retailer relations around the world. This also implies the need to accelerate product innovation, selectively increase marketing, and add more digital resources to better educate today's mobile consumer on the superior value proposition of our broad portfolio of everyday nondiscretionary products. Therefore, we are launching two important and complementary initiatives -- Project Alpha and Project Ignite -- which are designed to accelerate our multiyear growth ambitions. In the case of Project Alpha, we plan to spend up to an additional $20 million this year to expand into adjacent market segments through selective investment in new product development and strong market launches using new digital and social media marketing campaigns. This will help us to leverage our strong brands and retailer relations to launch innovation with key brands such as Armor All, Russell Hobbs, and Nature's Miracle. Project Ignite is an initiative to ensure that our organization adapts to rapidly changing consumer preferences and retail channels, and that resources are allocated to our best growth opportunities. Both of these projects are expected to be multiyear in duration, and we expect Project Ignite to partly fund the increased investments made through Project Alpha in fiscal 2018. Let me turn it over now to Doug for the financial review and details from our performance by product category. Thanks, Andreas, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9: Let's review Q4 results, beginning with net sales. Fourth quarter reported net sales of $1.32 billion increased 5.8% versus last year. Excluding the favorable impact of $12.4 million of foreign currency and acquisitions sales of $20.8 million, organic net sales grew 3.1%, our best quarterly result in 2017. This increase included the negative impacts of planned unprofitable business exits of approximately $14 million or 1.1%. HHI and Home and Garden delivered record fourth quarter performances along with strong performances from Global Auto Care and Personal Care. Reported gross margin of 37.5% decreased 140 basis points from 38.9% last year, primarily due to unfavorable mix, the negative impact of the rawhide recall, and operating start-up inefficiencies, primarily in Edgerton, Kansas. Reported SG&A expense of $322.1 million or 24.4% of revenue, compared to $294.4 million last year or 23.6%, primarily due to acquisitions, higher share-based compensation expense, and increased marketing investments to support new product launches. Reported operating margin of 8.2% decreased 450 basis points versus 12.7% in the prior year, largely driven by increased marketing investment, restructuring charges, and impairments. On a reported basis, Q4 diluted earnings per share of $1.63 increased compared to $1.49 last year, primarily due to reduced interest expense, a larger income tax benefit, and lower average shares outstanding. Adjusted EPS of $1.35 improved 3.1% versus $1.31 last year. Q4 reported a tax benefit of 77.7%, which is improved from an 8.4% benefit last year, primarily due to a discrete tax benefit recorded in the quarter to reverse a previously recorded tax liability for the anticipated repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. Turning to Slide 10: Reported interest expense in fiscal 2017 of $211 million decreased $39 million from $250 million last year, driven by the benefits of our 4% euro-denominated notes and repricing of our U.S. term loans in October and April of this year, partially offset by interest related to acquisitions and share repurchases. Cash interest payments of $183 million were $55 million lower than last year. The full-year tax rate of 13.8% increased from 10.1% last year due to a non-recurring release of a U.S. valuation allowance in 2016, net of the impact of the current-year benefit described previously. Cash taxes of $37.5 million were comparable to $35 million in 2016. Depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation were $256 million compared to $247 million last year. Cash payments for acquisition and integration and restructuring and related charges for 2017 were $44.3 million and $22.3 million respectively. Now, to our operating unit results, beginning with Slide 11 in Global Auto Care. Global Auto Care ended fiscal 2017 with a good Q4. Reported net sales of $102.6 million increased 1.9% against solid growth last year, driven by Europe and Asia/Pacific, while U.S. revenues were essentially unchanged with higher U.S. appearance product sales being offset by lower refrigerant revenues, primarily due to cooler weather conditions in the prior year and tighter auto retailer inventory levels. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.5% with a margin improvement of 50 basis points, primarily driven by lower expenses. In fiscal 2018, Global Auto Care will continue its focus on accelerating organic growth through increased cross-selling, share gains, and adjacency expansions in the U.S., improving its vitality rate with larger investments behind new product development and faster international growth. GAC expects further benefits from the second year of its Armor All Ultra Shine Wash and Wax Wipes, which were successfully launched in 2017, with two more items being added to the line, and also, the introduction of a full line of Armor All air fresheners. Turning to Slide 12: Hardware and Home Improvement rebounded from Q3 as expected to boast a strong Q4 reported net sales and adjusted EBITDA increases of 6.3% and 10.6%, resulting in an 80 basis point adjusted EBITDA margin expansion to 21.9%. This solid performance was driven by strong growth in residential security and plumbing in our core U.S. business, and to a lesser degree in Canada. The planned exit of unprofitable businesses in Mexico adversely impacted growth by 1.6% in the quarter. HHI has now fully lapped this exit, so it will not impact fiscal 2018. HHI's core U.S. businesses in residential security, builder's hardware, and plumbing are healthy and growing, supported by a multiyear new product roadmap which is delivering steady innovation. Important homebuilder channel wins will also benefit HHI this year, and exciting recent news also includes Amazon's announcement in late October that two Kwikset smart locks -- our Kwikset Convert and our Kwikset Smart Code -- will be smart lock solutions for the new Amazon Key In-Home Kit, which allows Prime members in 40 markets to receive in-home delivery and grants secure home access for guests using the Amazon Cloud Cam and our compatible smart lock, where we continue to be the innovation leader in the U.S. residential smart lock market. Operationally, HHI continues to complete its U.S. distribution center consolidation into a single new, larger facility in Kansas. The project began in April and has experienced some operating start-up issues, cost inefficiencies, and higher than normal customer backlog, but we've now closed the West Coast distribution center successfully, and the East Coast facility will wind down soon. This consolidation will result in a more streamlined footprint and lower inventories later in 2018 and beyond. Now, to Global Pet, which is Slide 13. Global Pet continues to be a business in transition, with Q4 reported net sales of $217.2 million, increasing 5.1% as a result of $20.8 million of revenue from the PetMatrix and GloFish acquisitions. Excluding acquisition revenues and favorable Fx of $2.3 million, organic net sales decreased 6.1%. Reported adjusted EBITDA increased 5.5% to $44 million due to the acquisitions with a 10-basis point margin improvement, while organic adjusted EBITDA of $36.2 million declined 13.2%, excluding the acquisitions and positive Fx of about $1 million. Organic sales declined in both Europe and the U.S. The primary driver for lower European revenue was a significantly lower dog and cat food sales from the acceleration of the planned exit of a pet food customer tolling agreement, which totaled $6.4 million and negatively impacted pet sales by 3.1%. And, in the U.S., as we mentioned in the last quarter, companion animal sales were adversely impacted by the rawhide dog chew product recall in June, as well as continued sluggish store traffic in certain channels. In fiscal 2018, pet top- and bottom-line results will be boosted by the full-year impact of PetMatrix and GloFish acquisitions, whose integrations are going smoothly and ahead of schedule, and by delivering growth in our legacy businesses through new product launches, new customers, cross-selling, and strong e-commerce growth. The impact of the exit of the pet food customer tolling agreement for 2018 is expected to be about $25 million. Moving to Home and Garden, which is Slide 14: Home and Garden also rebounded from Q3 to deliver a very strong double-digit performance in Q4. Reported net sales and adjusted EBITDA increased 26% and 62% respectively, resulting in a 590-basis point margin improvement to 27%. All categories posted solid growth, driven by favorable POS coupled with increased replenishment orders triggered by generally lower retailer inventory levels and a modest positive benefit from the Q4 hurricanes. While fiscal 2017 could be described as a reset year, with more quarterly volatility than normal, Home and Garden nevertheless achieved record POS, record household control brand sales, and market share gains. Home and Garden plans measured above-category growth in fiscal 2018 with quarterly phasing reverting to more traditional historic pacing based upon more normal spring and summer weather pattern expectations. Growth will be driven by innovation in spring and annualization of 2017 innovation. Now, to Personal Care, which is Slide 15: Personal Care reported a strong Q4, with growth in nearly every region. Reported net sales of $127.3 million increased 5.6%, while organic revenues climbed 3.9%, excluding favorable Fx of $2 million. The improvement was led by solid growth in the U.S. and Asia/Pacific and moderate growth in Europe and Latin America. A bright spot in the quarter was strong double-digit growth in e-commerce sales, where these businesses have already built significant channel presents. Reported and organic adjusted EBITDA increased double digits, with a reported margin improvement of 130 basis points. The increase was driven by higher volumes, favorable mix, and continuous improvement savings. Looking to fiscal 2018, Remington will continue a steady launch of impactful products in shave, groom, and hair care, supported by targeted marketing investments to drive volume growth and even greater awareness of the global Remington brand. Now, let's turn to Small Appliances on Slide 16: Q4 reported net sales of $171.5 million, decreased 2.9% percent. Excluding favorable Fx of $1.1 million, organic revenues fell by 3.6%. Higher sales in Europe and Latin America, primarily from new product launches and new listings, were more than offset by lower U.S. and Canadian revenues as a result of sluggish POS, increased competitor promotions, and retailer adjustments. Reported and organic adjusted EBITDA fell high single digits with a reported margin decline of 70 basis points due to unfavorable mix, decreased volumes, and unfavorable Fx. Small Appliances will continue its strategy in fiscal 2018 to broaden its product portfolio and distribution points around the world with a focus on wide-space opportunities and continued e-commerce growth, where the business has a significant percentage of its revenues today. As some of you have seen, the most prominent and recent exciting U.S. launch is our exciting Russell Hobbs brand, which is a stylish, top-quality family of products that we launched within e-commerce within the last few months. Finally, to Global Batteries, which is Slide 17: Q4 reported net sales of $235.1 million, increase 5.6%, driven by strong growth in Europe, Latin America, and Asia/Pacific. U.S. revenues were essentially unchanged, including a modest positive benefit from the hurricanes and continued strong performance from Fusion, our highest-performing alkaline battery. Excluding a $4.5 million favorable Fx benefit, organic sales improved 3.5%. Adjusted EBITDA and margin fell as pricing pressure and commodity cost increases more than offset higher volumes, cost savings, and positive Fx. Led by the alkaline and hearing aid categories, Global Batteries will pursue growth in 2018 in under-indexed channels, and countries, and through distribution gains. Rayovac is also launching its next-generation Active Core technology product that gives consumers longer-lasting, high-quality hearing aid battery performance with an improved design, delivering higher voltage for high-tech device applications. Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 18: We ended fiscal 2017 in a strong liquidity position with more than $680 million available on our $700 million cash flow revolver, a cash balance of $168 million, and debt outstanding of $3.9 billion. We generated record adjusted free cash flow in fiscal 2017 of $587 million, which was within our guidance range, primarily as a result of strong working capital management, and surpassing 2016 free cash flow of $535 million and 2015 free cash flow of $454 million. Total leverage was approximately 4.1x at the end of fiscal 2017, slightly higher than the 3.9x at the end of '16, primarily as a result of acquisitions and share repurchases. Capital expenditures were $115 million compared to $95 million in the prior year. And, in fiscal 2017, we repurchased over 2 million shares of common stock for $253 million, or about $122 a share, and in the fourth quarter, we purchased over 700,000 shares of stock for $87, or just under $119 million per share. Clearly, we still have a lot of confidence in the value of our stock and are continuing to support it in an aggressive way. Turning to Slide 19 and our 2018 guidance: We expect reported net sales to grow above category rates for most categories, including the anticipated positive impacts from Fx of approximately 160 to 180 basis points, based on current rates. We expect to deliver record adjusted free cash flow of between $620 million and $640 million. Full-year interest expanse is expected to be between $210 million and $220 million, including approximately $15 million of non-cash items. And, cash interest payments in the year are expected to be between $185 million and $195 million. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be between $245 million and $255 million for 2018, including approximately $50 million for amortization of stock-based compensation. Our 2018 effective tax rate is expected to be between 30% and 35%, and recall that for adjusted earnings, we use a 35% tax rate. Cash taxes are expected to be between approximately $55 million and $65 million, and we do not anticipate being a significant U.S. federal cash taxpayer during 2018, as we continue to use net operating loss carry-forwards. Cash payments for acquisition and integration and restructuring and related charges are expected to be between $40 million and $60 million, and capital expenditures are expected to be between $110 million and $120 million. Thank you, and now, back to Dave for Q&A. Thank you, Andreas and Doug. Operator, with that, you may now begin the Q&A session, please. Operator At this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, please press *1 on your telephone keypad. Your first question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Yes, hi, thank you. Good morning. I guess my first question is just on the categories. What are you anticipating the categories are going to grow in fiscal '18, and perhaps, what did they grow in fiscal '17? Let me first start with the question on the category growth. I think overall, we expect all categories to grow somewhere in the low single digits, with probably the strongest growth in the Hardware and Home Improvement, where we have a strong tailwind from the U.S. housing market. But, we also expect some long-term benefits coming from the hurricanes, so therefore, that is probably the category growing fastest. Now, the other extreme is probably going to be on the section of Home Appliances, where again, the growth is quite often driven by innovation, which leads to a peak in market demands, and then that slows down. Right now, for instance, the Home Appliance category is slightly shrinking. We estimate it -- based on market data -- shrinking by about 0.5%, and the other categories are somewhere in between. Now, if you look at 2017, how that -- I would say that was overall very similar, so there was really no dramatic shift. The only real difference is that in the Global Auto Care, where we have the A/C business, which is a very strong weather-dependent business, there we saw a decline this year in the category of about 5%, but this was really purely driven by cooler summer weather in our core U.S. market, and there again -- we believe that's not a long-term indication, it's just a short-term weather impact. Similarly, we had in our Home and Garden division our personal repellant business, where again -- as I mentioned earlier -- we had in 2016 the exceptionally strong demand coming from the Zika virus, whereas now, in '17, both retailers and consumers had pretty much their household equipped with personal repellents, so that category was also down. But again, we believe this was a two-year up and down. So, overall, we believe that also those categories will continue to grow in the low single-digit rates. Okay. And then, if I may just ask a second question regarding your two new projects, Alpha and Ignite. If you could maybe give us just a little more detail on what the $20 million will be spent on, how these projects will be managed, how do you determine the ROI on these projects, what adjacent market segments are you targeting -- any more detail that you can provide on those two will be very helpful. Yes, very good. The background is really -- Spectrum Brands, as you know -- back in 2009, we recovered from bankruptcy, and we still had a little bit -- as part of our corporate culture -- of relatively short-term thinking. That means we pursued projects which had more or less a self-funding principle. That means we invested not more than what we were expecting as a payback so that the Year 1 impact was neutral to positive. However, what we are doing now is we are investing more into innovation to expand into adjacencies, and when we then launch such innovation, we are going to invest more into the marketing to drive growth in those categories. To a certain extent, our step with the Wash and Wax Wipes in Armor All is a good example. This is, in 2017 net -- if we consider our marketing investment -- a loss. However, we have established the brand, we have gained strong retail distribution, it is aware in the consumer mind, and now we can continue to earn the fruits in '18 and beyond. And, a similar approach we are going to drive now in other categories and examples would be, for instance, here in the U.S., we are relatively strong in Home Appliances with the Black and Decker brand, more in mid price point, lower price point, and there, we are going to leverage our innovative higher-priced products from Europe under the Russell Hobbs brand. We are going to enter it, but of course, we will have to invest into the respective marketing means to drive it. Now, you asked about the return on investment. It is still a very compelling return. Payback is typically in the range of one and a half years, so therefore, this is not going to be a long-term drag. It's a kind of start-up investment to get it going, and then we are going to reap the benefits in the future. Okay, great. And, just quickly, is this $20 million excluded or included in your free cash flow guidance? It's included in the free cash flow guidance. Great, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Your line is open. Good morning. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the shifting retail landscape. Can you talk about how your go-to-market strategy has evolved? And, please talk also about your online strategy. You mentioned the 50% growth online, which is fantastic. Maybe talk a little about where you are now in terms of online sales and where you expect to be in three years. Okay. That's a complex question. The first point is online -- or, let me say ""multichannel"" because it's also a combination where you order online, you pick up in store, and all those kinds of options -- it is one of many channels, and if you look at the market, we are still somewhere in the 25% and less of the respective market channel. So therefore, it is an important, very rapidly growing channel, which we are fully exploiting. However, we have to realize that the majority of the demand is still in other channels, and that can be the mass, that can be specialty, that can be discount channel, so there are a multitude of other channels, and the key challenge going forward, really, is to avoid the channel conflict, because of course, the online is driving huge price transparency, and therefore, the biggest challenge in our online growth is really minimizing channel conflict, therefore having meaningful product differentiation, features, and those kinds of specifics is going to be key. Now, if we look at our growth strategies, of course there are certain categories which are more prominent online, and really, the highest online share is in the Personal Care category, where it's in the high 20s already for us today, and we expect that to continue to grow, and I can tell you openly that, for instance, in Europe, the biggest online retailer is also our biggest customer in Europe already. So therefore, we are already developing very well and very fast. Other categories it is less prominent, but also here, we are investing because online is not only shopping, it is also increasingly information surge -- a validation, a comparison of competitors. So, it's also an information-building process, and that is why we are increasing our investment also into digital marketing. And, Bob, just to be a little more specific on what we currently sell online -- as we can measure it, anyway, because as Andreas said, it's multichannel, so sometimes, we may sell online, but a consumer converts at a brick-and-mortar location, and we don't necessarily have visibility to that. But, what we can measure -- which is fairly direct e-commerce -- would be about 6% across the entire portfolio. Okay, fantastic. And then, just following up on that, do you have any idea where you would want that to be in three to five years? Is it even knowable? What's the thought process to drive it higher, and do you have a goal? Again, it depends very much on the category. For instance -- I think Doug mentioned it earlier -- as we are launching Russell Hobbs in the U.K., we are launching it exclusively online, because again, it's the easiest way to reach many consumers fast, you can highlight the features, the superior value proposition very fast. But really, I would say it's difficult to now pick a number, so we want to continue to grow faster than the category, and again, if we assume, for instance, that the category grew online in the mid-20s, we grew about twice as fast as the category, and that continues to be our objective. Okay, super. Thanks. And then, if I can, just shifting gears completely, any update you can give us on the HRG situation, where that stands right now, and possible timing of any outcomes or resolutions? Unfortunately, we can't have too much detail for you. The board -- as we have communicated earlier -- has formed a special committee where we have all our independent directors represented, and this special committee is representing the interests of all our shareholders, and they are in direct discussions with HRG, and unfortunately, there are no more specifics which we can share today with you, but we will keep you updated as soon as something materializes. Great. Thank you very much. Operator Your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. This is Christine on for Joe. My first question is -- I believe you had an extra shipping day in the quarter versus the base period, and I was just wondering what the impact was on organic growth. There would have been no material impact on that, certainly for the entire year. It all balanced out. So, I wouldn't call out a number on that for one day. Okay -- not even for fiscal 4Q? No. Okay. And then, can you give us an update on the pricing environment in the U.S. consumer battery market? It's a tough question. I think there are two distinct trends. The one trend is that there is an upgrade to higher-quality, higher-featured, and higher-priced products, so there is an upgrade in the market which is supporting the price. However, in all fairness, we have to -- or, at least, we are seeing it -- that the retailers are increasingly leveraging their purchasing power, and therefore, you have also seen -- in our case, we had a decline in the quarter, especially in our U.S. market. So therefore, it's still a very profitable category, it is growing, there are positive trends in the category, but it remains a very competitive market. Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator Your next question comes from Sam Reid, Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. I had a quick question on the Auto Care segment. I guess if you could talk to where you're seeing the tighter inventory levels that you mentioned -- is it primarily on the specialty side, or are you seeing it in in-mass as well? And then, I guess to sort of piggyback off of that question, how rationalized are retailer auto care inventories at this point in time, and do you think the pendulum could actually swing the other way and we actually see some restocking if weather trends are favorable this year? Well, I think the most -- the biggest impact we saw this year was really in our two seasonal categories, Home and Garden and Auto Care. And, if you look at it, we had partly -- in the past years -- actually product returns coming at the end of the season. So, retailers had stocked more inventory during the peak season, but then, also, were pretty hard in returning it at the end of the season. So, we have not seen that this year, and if you think, for instance, at the biggest retailer in the U.S., they have implemented in parallel with this inventory reduction a scheme which they call ""On Time, In Full."" That means improving the cooperation with their suppliers where they get deliveries on time and in full. And again, this allows the retailer and the manufacturers to take total inventory levels out of the supply chain. So, we believe that we are at a much healthier level today than we were last year, but in all transparency, we believe that it will remain a core point -- and again, coming back to this biggest retailer in the world, I think they are announcing publicly that they will continue to focus on further inventory reduction, and I think we are well-positioned -- we don't see the big impact coming in the future as we had seen it this year, but there will be some minor twists and tweaks in different categories. Got it. That's super helpful. A slightly different question here -- the builder channel. I know you guys have mentioned that as a growth opportunity. When should we see some of the moves that you've made into that channel start to flow through in HHI in 2018? Well, that's actually beginning right now. We had a nice win with a very large homebuilder in the latter part of the summer, and we've loaded up their showrooms and are beginning to ship into that channel right now. Got it. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Operator Your next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi, guys. This is actually Chris Carey on for Olivia. So, I guess a little bit of a change in language on the businesses that are growing above-category growth are now most, not all. So, can you provide some perspective on what that means for the total company and maybe how you think about Project Alpha contributing to the ability to get some of those businesses where you don't expect them to grow in line with the category or above the category -- how Project Alpha is going to help you do that? Let me start from the beginning, and then I'll turn it over to Andreas for Alpha. On the tone, Chris, we actually changed that earlier in 2017 to communicate that most of our categories will grow most quarters above category rate. That's what we were intending to communicate, which allows some volatility by category within the year. That's all we're trying to do there, and we expect every one of our businesses and plan for every one of our businesses to grow faster than their categories every year. And again, I think no dramatic change in our strategy with Project Alpha. Our core strategy to grow faster than the market is the ""more, more, more"" approach. That means expanding into more categories, expanding into more channels, and expanding into more countries. And, let me give you some nice examples. I mentioned earlier launching Russell Hobbs here in the U.S. to capture higher-price point, different-featured products. At the same time, we are expanding now with Home and Garden products into Latin America. We are going to launch Auto Care in Brazil, where we are a very strong leading brand with batteries, where we have a fantastic distribution footprint, strong retailer relations. So, we are going to leverage that to launch Auto Care into Brazil. And, these are the kinds of initiatives where we said yes, we are going to launch into new channels, categories, countries, and we are going to support it, so we have a fast, impactful growth instead of slowly, marginally growing it in a self-funding way. Okay, understood. That makes sense. And then, just one follow-up on gross margins -- can you disaggregate the impacts in Q4? I'm specifically trying to get a sense of mix, given that the gross-margin trend has trended down over the course of fiscal '17? I'm just trying to get a sense of how to think about that going into fiscal '18. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. I think some of the drivers in gross margin this year from a reported basis -- which is what I would speak to -- include some of the start-up inefficiencies related to those major footprint decisions we made in Dayton, Ohio around Global Auto Care, which -- as you'll recall -- is five locations into one between manufacturing and distribution sites, as well as moving in our R&D facility into a greenfield operation. So, you would have an expectation -- and, we did have an expectation -- of some normal start-up inefficiencies there, and that's been a little bit of a drag on gross margin in the year, and similarly in Kansas, where we're moving two DCs into one -- another greenfield operation -- and some consolidation and start-up inefficiencies in that location as well have had an impact on gross margin this year. The pet recall is another major driver in gross margin. And then, across the company, beginning in the fourth quarter, we've begun to see some input cost pressures from commodities that we haven't seen for a couple years. Okay, thanks for that. Operator Your next question comes from Majid Khan with Tourbillon. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. First of all, congratulations on the quarter. It's nice to see the fundamentals have turned the corner and you expect that trend to continue into next year, especially given the very difficult macro backdrop for the sector. I know you haven't commented on the potential HRG deal, but I just wanted to highlight that with your free cash flow guide of $650 million-ish at the midpoint ex the additional growth spend, the stock is trading at almost an 11% free cash flow yield. It's by far the cheapest stock in the group, and by far the cheapest the stock has been for many years. I think even Energizer is trading at an 8% free cash flow yield. And, as you're aware, we've communicated that we're obviously in favor of an accretive deal with HRG, but with your stock at these prices and... Clearly, there's an overhang from the lack of resolution of the HRG issue weighing on the shares. I think any Spectrum shareholder at this point would be supportive of tabling an HRG deal in favor of doing a buyback. Between this quarter and the next four, you're going to generate over 1 billion yuan of free cash flow, and your entire float is only 2.3 billion. Even if you repurchase stock at the prices you paid last quarter -- almost 20% from where it was trading yesterday -- you can retire over 40% of your float and exit fiscal '18 earning almost $13 of free cash flow per share. That's on your guided midpoint of the free cash flow guide, and that's after retiring almost 9 million shares. And, obviously, you could always deal with HRG sometime in the future, and I'm just wondering if you've considered this alternative versus negotiating a deal with HRG while your stock is on its lows. Thank you. One point of clarity before we get in. The midpoint of our guidance next year is $630 million, not $650 million -- so, $620 million to $640 million is the range. But, you're right. We're very bullish on our ability to generate cash flow on a sustainable basis -- high-quality cash flow as a company, and that is currently and has been a focus of ours for a long time. And then, beyond that, you can rest assured that the special committee continues to think about different alternatives and different options, and that's their role, and they'll continue to do this. And, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we continue to be very -- believe our stock is undervalued, and we've continued to buy into it. I understand what you're saying from a bigger perspective, but those are decisions for the board to make. Fair enough. Thank you, and congratulations again. Good drop. Operator Your next question comes from Jim Chartier at Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Your line is open. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, I want to touch on the impact of the rawhide recall on the fourth quarter. Doug, can you quantify what the impact was on fourth-quarter sales? And then, you mentioned that it would continue to be a drag in the first quarter. How much of an impact do you expect it to be? And then, net for 2018, does it become a positive swing factor for you this year? Well, the impact in the quarter was relatively limited -- less than $5 million on top line. The point, of course, is we do see a recovery as we are now replenishing the retailer inventories. However, in all transparency, we did face a couple of challenges, especially in private-label contracts, which we have been supplying. So, it will take some time to regain those contracts which were lost in the meantime. But, overall, we have learned from this process, we have established best-in-class processes now, and really, I think it's going to be a long-term clear, competitive advantage. Great. And then, on the HHI supply chain disruption, did you -- have you guys fulfilled the backlog that you had at the end of last quarter, and if not, when do you expect that will be fully worked through? We did make some progress on the backlog in the quarter, but interestingly enough -- and positively -- we had very strong order inflow during the quarter, so we didn't take the backlog down as much as we might have wanted to, but it wasn't because we weren't making progress in the facility, it was more because the order flow continued to be strong. So, that's good news for us, we think, going into 2018. We can continue to impact that backlog as we complete the transition. Great. And then, in terms of the margin improvement this year, up until 2017, you guys had some good EBITDA margin improvement. So, in light of Project Alpha, do you expect your margin improvement to be a little bit depressed this year, and does it rebound in 2019 and beyond? I would say... We've historically said that our objective is to grow EBITDA margin 20 to 50 basis points a year, and we would stick with that. I would say that you should factor in the Alpha investments, though. Great. Thanks, and best of luck. Operator Your next question comes from Karru Martinson with Jefferies. Your line is open. Good morning. Just on the Alpha investments, you talked about Project Ignite possibly offsetting some of those. How should we think about the magnitude of savings that you can get from operational improvements? We're not ready to lay those out yet at this point. This is early stages on the initiative, but I think you can think about it in the way we approach continuous improvement across the company, which has largely been focused on the cost of goods sold and supply chain parts of our P&L. Project Ignite will take us above that in the gross-to-net customer rebate areas, and it's really about -- in the first instance, anyway -- identifying the effectiveness and productivity of our spend, and making sure that we're spending with customers that help drive profitable growth for us, and prioritizing where we spend. So, against innovation is a really good place for us to put new dollars. It helps the entire brand portfolio while launching new products, and potentially, in new categories or new channels. And then, making sure that the investments that we make across SG&A are also aligned with those priorities for growth. Okay. And, when we look at Project Alpha, I think historically, the mantra has always been, ""We offer you the same or better quality than our competitors at a much better price."" As you go into line extensions and innovations, are you looking at a new competitive landscape, or is the goal still to adhere to that core message? We prefer to talk about superior value. That means that the product performance/price ratio is superior compared to competition, and that can apply to lower-priced products, but that can also apply to premium, higher-priced products. And, the point -- and, that is a slight shift, and that's really supported by Alpha, especially if you launch innovative, new products if you enter new categories. You have to educate the consumer. You have to tell the consumer that you're doing this offering, that you are an option available, and that's the biggest change -- that we are going to invest more to support those market launches in a more aggressive way using digital social media to really reach our target consumer and convince them about our superior value proposition. And, when you guys think about the robust cash flow that you have, what are your thoughts in terms of growing these innovations organically versus going out and acquiring some smaller start-ups who might have some additions that you want to put into the portfolio? As you have seen with the acquisition of PetMatrix and GloFish, we remain open. If there are the right acquisition opportunities which are a nice complement to our strategic priorities, we will continue to pursue that. However, we believe that even if you're doing a very attractive deal, you're easily in a 10x multiple, we believe that if we invest organically, and even if it's a two-year payback, it's a much more compelling offer. So, we believe that long-term, it's also going to help the company grow organic sales and EBITDA in a very attractive way if you think about return on assets -- those kinds of metrics. Thank you very much, guys. Appreciate it. Okay. Operator, with that, we have no further questions at this time, so we will go ahead and conclude our conference call. With that, I certainly want to thank Andreas and Doug, and on behalf of all of us here at Spectrum Brands, we want to thank you for participating in our 2017 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Have a good day. Thank you. Operator This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Duration: 55 minutes More SPB analysis ","

Mitch Tuchman,11232017,MarketWatch,11162017,"Published: Nov 16, 2017 9:57 a.m. ET These seemingly small costs can eat into your retirement savings By Gasoline right at the highway exit is usually cheapest. Drive a few miles toward town and you might see a 10 cent a gallon jump. Ever wonder why? If you said “competition,” go to the head of the class. Gas stations tend to cluster around knots of highway traffic. The driver near empty on a country lane has to gas up immediately or take the risk of running dry miles from the next fill-up. Gasoline is gasoline. Where there’s competition, prices are usually low — even identical down to a fraction of a penny. So what gives with investment fees? A new report shows that the cost difference between low-fee and high-fee financial advisers is staggering — roughly nine times more costly, mostly hidden in fine print. The lowest cost adviser, according to the data, is Vanguard Group. No surprise there. The firm founded by indexing pioneer John Bogle offers personalized investment advice at a cut-rate price of just 0.38% of assets. That means an account with $100,000 in investment value costs $380 a year to manage, counting both fund fees and face time with an adviser.

In dollar terms, that means that a portfolio that costs $380 a year at Vanguard could run you as much as $3,500 a year at Ameriprise. (TV advertising is expensive, right?) Read: Why lawmakers keep trying to whack retirees Many investors seeing this list will squawk and say, “Well, I’m sure I don’t pay that!” But are you sure? A lot of well-educated, smart people — folks who know their way around numbers and otherwise manage their finances well — clam up when it comes to asking about investment costs. One survey showed that 61% of us have no idea what we pay. Many in 401(k) plans think they pay nothing! Stockbrokers absolutely love the cost-shy client. If pressed, of course, they will explain some of your fees, a lie by omission that goes like this: Client: “How much do I pay you?” Broker: “Me? About 1%, the industry standard. Don’t worry about it.” Read: 7 ways to improve target-date funds Cost control You probably do pay your broker a 1% fee based on your assets. What’s missing, however, are the multitudes of smaller fees that you don’t pay the broker directly but you nevertheless do pay. Mutual fund fees, for instance. Add up all that and paying an additional 1% is typical. Fees matter. That 2% or 3% taken by your financial adviser and fund managers is based on your total account balance, no matter what happens in the stock market. Personal Capital helpfully summed up the impact of fees in the report. A typical retirement portfolio that charges 1% costs the investor $334,754 in fees over decades of investing, the company calculated. The same portfolio at a fee of 3.50% a year, meanwhile, costs $830,931. The difference is nearly $500,000, cash sucked right out of your retirement plan, quarter by quarter, year after year. That’s not even counting forgone returns. That fee money instead is compounding away in the retirement plans of your broker and his preferred fund managers, firms that may have paid your broker extra for recommending them over similar but cheaper funds. Asking for your fees — all of them — is not a sign that you don’t trust your broker. Being afraid to ask, however, is a serious and costly mistake.

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"DiNapoli oversees the New York State Common Retirement Fund, the third largest U.S. state pension fund with more than $200 billion in assets and a top 50 Wells Fargo shareholder with nearly 14 million shares. “The bank has not reassured investors that its pay practices encourage long-term, sustainable growth,” DiNapoli said in an emailed statement. Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk said the bank values input from shareholders and is reviewing the proposal. Wells Fargo’s scandal began in September 2016 when the bank settled with regulators over the creation of potentially up to 2.1 million fake accounts, a number the bank later revised to as high as potentially 3.5 million. Compensation incentives “contributed to problematic behavior,” in the creation of fake accounts, according to an internal report by Wells Fargo’s board of directors released on April 10. Other problems have since come to light in different areas of the bank, including auto insurance, residential mortgages, and foreign exchange trading. The proposal by DiNapoli requests that Wells Fargo’s board prepare a report disclosing detailed information about incentive-based pay throughout the bank. Should the board agree to produce such a report, DiNapoli would withdraw the proposal, according to a letter by his staff to Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan. Barring such an agreement, DiNapoli requested the proposal be included on the bank’s proxy statement to be voted on by shareholders at Wells Fargo’s annual meeting in the spring. DiNapoli submitted a similar proposal last year, but Wells Fargo got permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to leave it off the proxy, arguing it was similar to another shareholder proposal calling for a broader report on several matters, including “evidence that incentive systems are aligned with customers’ best interests.” ","

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"An investigation by the department found the company had issued about 1,500 insurance policies and charged premiums without customers’ knowledge or permission, the agency said in a statement late on Tuesday. Wells Fargo was not immediately available for comment. The third-largest U.S. lender by assets last week announced plans to exit the personal insurance business, which includes auto, homeowners, renters and umbrella insurance products, and said it would immediately begin winding down marketing and product promotion activity. Wells Fargo has been working for more than a year to recover from a sales scandal that has impacted several of its consumer businesses, including some insurance products. In 2016, the San Francisco-based bank paid $185 million to regulators after an investigation found that Wells Fargo had opened fraudulent deposit and credit card accounts.

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"The changes to Wells Fargo Advisors’ 2018 compensation plan, which were sent to the firm’s 14,500 brokers on Friday, also mean that the firm will pay more brokers a top tier salary than ever before because teams can also qualify for the benefits. “This is a big thing for us culturally to encourage people to continue to evolve their practices as we march toward the next stage of the advice business,” Rich Getzoff, head of Wells Fargo Advisors’ east coast business, said by phone. Wells Fargo’s bank and retail brokerage have traditionally served Main Street customers. But as regulatory costs, increased competition and changing customer preference have weighed on firms’ profits, brokers have had to seek wealthier clients whom they say benefit more from their advice. “Clients who have more wealth have more complicated needs,” said John Alexander, Wells Fargo Advisors. “But we’re not just a high net worth firm.” Wells Fargo Advisors has no such minimum. But brokers are encouraged to refer clients with less than $200,000 to brokers at bank branches or call centers, or Wells Fargo’s robo-advisor platform, Intuitive Investor, which accepts clients with at least $10,000. The new compensation plan rewards top advisers by paying them half of the revenue they generate for the brokerage if, in 2017, they made at least $2 million in revenue, and if more than three-quarters of their clients have over $750,000 with them. The broker must also be part of an internal coaching program called DELTA. The brokerage will extend the same offer - a 50 percent pay out rate - to teams of brokers if they generated $2 million in combined revenue, and if each broker managed at least $800,000 in assets. Brokerages traditionally pay employees a percentage of the annual revenues they make. Wells Fargo has historically paid all its brokers based on two percentage rates of revenue that combined make up their monthly salary. The new plan makes both of those rates 50 percent for top brokers. ","

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co will likely see improvement in its business lending segment when it reports fourth-quarter earnings in January, Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said at an investor presentation on Tuesday. Commercial lending was a weak spot for the U.S. lender when it reported third-quarter results in October, with balances falling by more than $5 billion compared to the prior period. Sloan said the commercial lending environment has been slower than he expected overall this year, though the run-off of two large corporate loans in the third quarter also had what he called an “idiosyncratic” impact. Sloan said he sees the residential mortgage business  slowing in the fourth quarter, primarily due to seasonal factors. Wells Fargo is the third-largest U.S. bank by assets and the leading U.S. mortgage lender. Much of Sloan’s presentation was devoted to Wells Fargo’s expense targets. While he offered no update to the bank’s plans to cut $2 billion off expenses in 2018 and another $2 billion in 2019, he said he would offer more detail when Wells Fargo reports fourth-quarter results. Wells Fargo shares were up 0.4 percent in morning trading. ","

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"The San Francisco-based bank said in October that it would refund homebuyers who were wrongly charged fees to secure low mortgage rates - a black mark against a lender which has already been roiled by scandal over its treatment of customers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) had been investigating the mortgage issue since early this year, said one current and two former officials. The agency accepted an internal review from Wells Fargo and set settlement terms in early November, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak about internal discussions. But that matter and roughly a dozen others are in question now that Mick Mulvaney, the agency chief tapped by President Donald Trump, has said he is reviewing the CFPB’s prior work. Richard Cordray, the former CFPB director who initiated the Wells Fargo action, approved the terms of a possible settlement before stepping down, said the sources. That proposal envisions a Wells Fargo payout of tens of millions of dollars but likely short of the record, $100 million payout the bank made to the CFPB last year over a phony accounts scandal, sources said. More than 100,000 borrowers paid the fee to lock in a fixed-rate loan between September 2013 and February 2017, the bank has said, adding it believes a “substantial number” of those charges were appropriate. A Wells Fargo spokesman on Thursday declined to comment on the CFPB actions but said the bank was committed to returning any fees that were wrongly levied. “Over the next few months we will be contacting other customers who paid those fees and will provide refunds,” said spokesman Tom Goyda. Mulvaney has pledged to examine enforcement work that Cordray had left unfinished, which includes the potential Wells Fargo sanctions. In an interview with the Washington Times newspaper last week, Mulvaney said he is reviewing 14 open enforcement matters that Cordray left on his desk. A CFPB official said that review should not taint any eventual settlements. “Acting Director Mulvaney made it clear to staff that any pause should not and will not impact any ongoing negotiations,” said John Czwartacki, an adviser to Mulvaney. Mulvaney has moved swiftly to change course at the CFPB, which was created during President Barack Obama’s administration and has forced financial services companies to pay out $12 billion in fines and consumer relief. No new staff will be hired and no new rules will be written for industry until a review of the agency is completed, Mulvaney has said. Before he took charge of the CFPB, Mulvaney had been one of its vocal critics and called the bureau a “joke.” Mulvaney is now in a legal fight with Leandra English, another senior CFPB official, over who should lead the agency until a permanent chief can be appointed. English has vowed to defend the bureau’s existing consumer protections while Mulvaney has pledged to have the agency step out of the way of business. A federal court has so far endorsed Mulvaney’s position at the top of the bureau, but English is continuing a legal fight. One of the CFPB’s major achievements was the $100 million fine it levied on Wells Fargo last year after it was revealed that staff were opening bank accounts without customer consent. In September, Republican staff for the U.S. House of  Representatives’ Financial Services Committee asked whether that settlement was too paltry. In a report titled “Did the CFPB let Wells Fargo ‘Beat the Rap’?” Republican staff wrote that the CFPB might have had room to seek a penalty of $10 billion or more against Wells Fargo. The committee’s policy director, Brian Johnson, joined Mulvaney last week as a senior adviser to the CFPB. ","

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A proposal driven by President Donald Trump to overhaul the country’s tax system is moving through U.S. Congress, lifting the overall stock market and raising hopes that corporate earnings will get a boost. The S&P 500 .SPX rallied this week as the drive to push sweeping tax legislation through the U.S. Senate gained momentum, although gains were tempered by a report that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was prepared to testify that before taking office Trump had directed him to make contact with Russians. Senate Republicans said on Friday they had gathered the votes needed to pass a sweeping tax overhaul. While negotiations are ongoing, the legislation could cut the corporate tax rate to as low as 20 percent from 35 percent. UBS strategists project that overall S&P 500 earnings would rise by 6.5 percent should the corporate tax rate fall to 25 percent and increase by 9.5 percent should the rate go to 20 percent. But certain stocks could benefit more than others from the Republican-led plans. “It will be favorable to companies with primarily domestic business that are paying close to the full tax rate,” said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. Investors appear to have already rotated into some of these tax-sensitive areas. Some market watchers caution about generalizing winners, noting big differences in effective rates between companies in the same sectors. But strategists point to industries with a concentration of companies poised to benefit, particularly from a lower corporate tax rate. (For a graphic on industries that stand to win from corporate tax cuts, click reut.rs/2zVJls9) (For a graphic on sector benefits from a corporate tax cut, click reut.rs/2AMn9AU) (High tax stocks underperform in 2017: reut.rs/2AMdrP5) Of the major S&P sectors, financials pay the highest effective tax rate at 27.5 percent, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of historical tax rates. Brian Klock, managing director in equity research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods who covers large regional banks, expects tax cuts to add 16 percent to median bank earnings in 2018 and 18 percent in 2019. “We’re assuming whatever the benefit is will drop right to the bottom line,” Klock said. “They won’t give up on loan pricing or put any big investments in. With the increased capital they’ll return it to shareholders.” Transportation ranks among the top industries expected to receive a big earnings boost from a lower corporate tax rate, according to UBS. Railroads would benefit from provisions allowing them to expense their capital expenditures in one year as opposed to over time, lowering their taxable income, Schoonmaker said. “We’ll see what comes out as far as the ability to depreciate immediately, but that certainly would be beneficial because they are all big capital spenders,” Schoonmaker said, noting that railroads spend 18 percent to 20 percent of revenue on capital expenditures. Domestically geared healthcare companies that focus on services would likely benefit more from tax rate reductions than pharmaceutical and medical device companies that sell their products overseas. “Healthcare services is one of the most taxed industries and would be a big beneficiary of reductions in corporate tax rates,” Lance Wilkes, an analyst at Bernstein, said in a recent note. According to Leerink analyst Ana Gupte, a corporate tax rate cut to 20 percent could boost health insurer earnings by about 20 percent to 40 percent, but some of those gains would be expected to be passed through to employer and individual customers. Department stores head the list of retailers that will benefit because they have among the heaviest U.S. exposure, said Bridget Weishaar, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. “Retail companies will benefit from paying a lower tax rate,” Weishaar said. “Consumers hopefully will have additional cash, which will help consumer discretionary spending.” “They’re domestically focused companies with a very high percentage of their employee base in the U.S. and significant amounts of investments in U.S. infrastructure,” said Amir Rozwadowski, telecom equity analyst at Barclays. “Therefore they’re predisposed to benefit from tax reform.” AT&T has climbed 4.9 percent this week, while Verizon has surged 9 percent.

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"(Reuters) - Shares of the biggest U.S. banks rose on Monday, after the Senate approved a tax overhaul bill on Saturday, raising investor hopes that their earnings would get a boost from a  significantly lower tax bill. JPMorgan Chase rose 2.4 percent to hit a record on Monday, while Bank of America rose 3.5 percent to its highest since October 2008. Both were the top performers on the S&P 500 Index, which was up 0.7 percent. Mid-cap and regional banks also gained, with KeyCorp, Citizens Financial and M&T Bank Corp rising almost 4 percent. Zions Bancorp and Comerica Inc rose more than 2.5 percent. “Banks might be the biggest winners from the tax reforms,” Michael Mayo, a senior Wells Fargo analyst said. Of the major S&P sectors, financials pay the highest effective tax rate at 27.5 percent, a Wells Fargo analysis of historical tax rates showed. The tax cuts could add 16 percent to median bank earnings in 2018 and 18 percent in 2019, said Brian Klock, managing director in equity research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, who covers large regional banks. Among large regional banks, Zions Bancorp, M&T Bank Corp and Comerica Inc stand to benefit the most, Klock said. Talks will begin, likely next week, between the Senate and the House, which has already approved its own version of the legislation, to reconcile their respective bills. While negotiations are ongoing, the legislation could cut the corporate tax rate to as low as 20 percent from 35 percent. The tax overhaul is seen by President Donald Trump and Republicans as crucial as they head into mid-term elections in November 2018, when they will have to defend their majorities in Congress. The S&P financial index rose nearly 2 percent to its highest since 2007, while the KBW Bank Index rose 2.7 percent. ","

It has also given rewards from its credit card program to mortgage borrowers. It has to use such tactics to expand its business since it is barred by law from growing via acquisitions in the United States, as long as it holds more than 10 percent of insured deposits. Amazon is an important customer of JPMorgan’s credit card business, which processes many of its online payments and issues co-branded cards for the retailer.

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin fans are salivating over the potential of long-awaited legitimacy for the cyptocurrency when futures trading launches this weekend, but experts worry the risks associated with bitcoin’s Wild West-like nature could overshadow the debut. While Cboe, CME and Nasdaq offer strictly policed trading environments, the underlying bitcoin market is riddled with crypto-exchanges lacking even basic oversight. That has stoked fears of market manipulation, inaccurate pricing and systemic risk to clearing houses. “I’m kind of taken aback by what’s happened in the last three months,” said Richard Johnson, an analyst at Greenwich Associates who owns digital currencies and considers himself a bitcoin bull. “I’m concerned things are moving a bit too quickly.” Some of the world’s largest brokers on Thursday voiced concerns about the process through which bitcoin futures had come to market, noting that market participants should have been better consulted on issues such as margin levels and trading limits. Through an open letter to the U.S. derivatives watchdog from the Futures Industry Association, the brokers said more safeguards are needed to protect against bitcoin’s high volatility and the risk of manipulation in the underlying spot market. “We remain apprehensive with the lack of transparency and regulation of the underlying reference products on which these futures contracts are based,” the FIA letter said. On Thursday, its hypervolatility was on full display as it broke through $15,000 for the first time on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP, jumping more than 12 percent from the previous day.. Since August 2011, bitcoin has averaged a daily price change of nearly 3 percent, up or down, compared with a daily average change in the U.S. dollar-euro cross rate EUR= of less than 0.5 percent since the euro's debut in 1999. “Maybe it’s just the most unique market that is going to continue to go up forever and ever and so everybody on the long side is going to make money and it’s a great thing, but I’ve been around long enough to know that’s not going to work out so well,” said John Lothian, CEO of advisory firm John J Lothian and Company. As a virtual currency, bitcoin can be used to move money around the world without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government, which is a double-edged sword, said Steve Grob, director of group strategy at Fidessa. “There is no backstop. If suddenly tomorrow everyone decided bitcoin was worthless, it would be worthless, and I’m not sure whether people have really thought that one through,” he said. Still, new entrants, from retail investors to high-frequency traders, have piled into bitcoin. U.S.-based crypto-exchange Coinbase said it added 100,000 accounts in the three days around the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, for 13.1 million overall. If the futures market were to exceed the size of the spot market, with current daily trading volume of around $6 billion per day, the underlying price could be more susceptible to manipulation, said Kevin Zhou, co-founder of crypto currency fund Galois Capital. “You’ve seen these problems before in bitcoin futures, where right before the settlement, the price pegs it high or low and then bounces back right after,” he said. (GRAPHIC: Bitcoin price hits record high - reut.rs/2AL7Ubh) As volumes increase, there are also questions about the robustness of the technology at bitcoin exchanges, Lothian said. “Particularly when you’re talking about a high-frequency approach to this where people are trying to arb multiple exchanges.” Last month, the Gemini bitcoin exchange, which will set the price for Cboe’s futures contract, and GDAX and Kraken, two of the four exchanges in CME’s bitcoin index, had systems issues. “Every single bitcoin exchange receives and is receiving complaints by users due to the unbelievably surging bitcoin price and the result that has on capacity,” Christina Yee, a Kraken representative, recently told Reuters in an email. Kraken is planning to launch a new trade engine “soon” which should increase the exchange’s capacity, Yee said. The volatile nature of bitcoin could also present a risk to clearing houses, said Thomas Peterffy, CEO of Interactive Brokers Group Inc IBKR.O. Clearing houses act as a middlemen between the parties to futures transactions. If there were a wild price swing in bitcoin and a smaller brokerage failed to meet its margin call, the clearing house would have to take over the position, further moving the price of bitcoin, which could cause other brokers to fail, Peterffy said. “If that happens at a time when bitcoin spikes up for whatever crazy reason, there could be an avalanche,” he said. “We didn’t think it was obvious to rush out a product and be first and settle against an index on a lot of exchanges that are not particularly transparent,” ICE Chief Executive Jeffrey Sprecher said this week at a Goldman Sachs conference.

Morganlander cites chocolate maker Hershey, meat processor Hormel, and soft drink maker Dr. Pepper Snapple as ""growing, profitable, well-capitalized"" companies that also are doing well even without tax reform, in his comments to CNBC. But they also have high average tax rates, he said, largely because about 90% of their revenues are generated domestically. As a result, tax cuts could improve their earnings significantly, as with Katz's picks. ""Even without the tax break, we believe these companies can outperform the S&P 500 with considerably less volatility,"" he told CNBC. The tax reform bill passed by the Senate on December 2 would cut the top federal corporate income tax from 35% to 20%, the same provision as in the bill approved by the House. Both bills allow businesses to reduce taxable income by deducting 100% of most capital expenditures in the year that they are made, rather than through depreciation charges spread over a number of years. However, these provisions for accelerated tax writeoffs expire after five years. On the other hand, both the House and Senate bills put limits on the deductibility of interest by corporations, and eliminate a variety of other business credits and deductions. Both bills also cut taxes on repatriated overseas cash and profits. The next step calls for members of both the House and Senate, chosen by the leadership in each body, to meet in conference, iron out the differences in the two bills, and write a new reconciled bill that will be voted upon by both chambers, CNN reports.

Liz Moyer,12072017,CNBC,11302017,"California's insurance regulator wants to suspend or take away Wells Fargo's insurance license for sales practices related to the bank's online referral program that it says were improper. About 1,500 unauthorized policies were opened on behalf of customers, many without their knowing, through the program, according to California, which filed the accusation against Wells Fargo last week. The sales concerned renter's insurance policies and term life policies offered by four different insurers through a referral program Wells offered in its branches. In a statement on Wednesday, Wells Fargo said, ""As we previously announced, Wells Fargo suspended online referrals of renters and simplified term life insurance products in December 2016 and initiated an internal review of those products. We have been cooperating with the CA Department of Insurance (DOI) over the course of this year."" Last month, Wells said it would get out of the property and casualty personal insurance business but said the move was unrelated to the insurance department's investigation. The bank has been trying to recover from a much broader fake accounts scandal that prompted a top management upheaval last year. Wells, based in San Francisco, paid $185 million in fines to federal regulators and the city of Los Angeles over the fake accounts problem uncovered last year that affected 3.5 million customers. Bank employees, under pressure to meet aggressive sales targets, were opening unwanted deposit or credit card accounts in customers' names or enrolling them in services they didn't request. The scrutiny has since spread to mortgage and auto lending businesses at the bank. The insurance sales through the referral program were mentioned in a footnote to a report about the bigger fake accounts scandal released by Wells' board of directors in April. California's insurance regulator said in the accusations filed with the department last week that the unauthorized sales occurred between 2008 and 2016. Wells said in its statement on Wednesday, ""We are sorry for any harm this caused our customers and we are making things right for them as part of an ongoing remediation.""

LASRY: I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WILL. BECAUSE IT JUST ECONOMICALLY – IT JUST COSTS YOU TOO MUCH MONEY. WAPNER: SO IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT THAT WERE IN, I SAID DOW 24,000. NEW HIGHS ALL THE TIME. WHERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY THEN FOR A GUY LIKE YOU? LASRY: WELL, I THINK FOR US, IT'S NOT IN THE EQUITY MARKETS. RIGHT? IT'S GOING TO BE IN SITUATIONS WHERE YOU'RE GETTING OVERPAID. SO FOR US IT'S GOING TO BE IN ASIA RIGHT NOW WHERE WE CAN DO DIRECT LENDING, WE'RE MAKING 15, 20% ON THOSE LOANS. IT CAN BE IN AVIATION, WHERE WE'RE BUYING END OF LIFE PLANES AND YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE 20% PLUS ON THAT. IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE ENERGY SECTOR. IT'S TRYING TO FIND AREAS WHERE OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOT COMPETING AND WHERE THE LIQUIDITY OR THE DEMAND FOR LIQUIDITY IS NOT AS HIGH BUT THE DEMAND FOR CAPITAL IS VERY HIGH. WAPNER: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF EQUITY THOUGH, THE ENVIRONMENT IS SUCH THAT DISTRESSED OPPORTUNITIES ARE LIMITED. AREN'T THEY? THERE ISN'T THAT MUCH DISTRESS OUT THERE. LASRY: THERE ISN'T THAT MUCH DISTRESS HERE IN THE U.S. IT'S MORE FOR SPECIAL SITUATIONS. BUT WHAT THERE IS IS THERE'S A REAL NEED FOR CAPITAL. SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE INVESTING IS MORE IN SPECIAL SITUATIONS AS OPPOSED TO DISTRESS. WAPNER: OK, SO THE AREA THAT I'D THINK THAT YOU ARE TAKING A LOOK AT IS THE ONE THAT WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME, RELATIVE TO AMAZON, AND THAT IS RETAIL. ARE YOU CURRENTLY ACTIVE IN RETAIL EITHER ON THE DEBT OR THE EQUITY SIDE? LASRY: SO, WE'RE ACTIVE ON THE DEBT SIDE. SO NEIMAN MARCUS WOULD BE ONE WHERE WE ACTUALLY OWN THE BONDS. YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN J. C. PENNEY. AND A COUPLE OTHERS. SO IT'S AN AREA WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT IT PRETTY HARD, ESPECIALLY ON THE DEBT SIDE. AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FIND AFTER THE HOLIDAYS, DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH BRICK AND MORTAR, I THINK THERE WILL BE MORE OPPORTUNITIES ON THE DEBT SIDE FOR FIRMS LIKE OURS. WAPNER: OK – SO WE'VE SEEN A JUMP IN RETAIL STOCKS. YOU THINK THE SAME THING THAT COULD UNWIND RETAIL STOCKS IS THE SEASONAL BOOST MAYBE THEY'VE GOTTEN— LASRY: IT IS. WAPNER: -- IS GOING TO CREATE GREATER OPPORTUNITY ON THE DEBT SIDE, AS WELL, DEBT'S GONNA TO BECOME CHEAPER. LASRY: I THINK SO. OR AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING. AND IF THAT IS, THEN WE'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. IF NOT, THEN IT'S FINE. YOU KNOW, REALLY, WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THINGS AT A PRICE WHERE WE THINK WE CAN'T GET HURT, WHERE IF THERE'S GONNA BE A LIQUIDATION, WE'RE GONNA GET OUR MONEY OUT. WAPNER: YOU MENTIONED J.C. PENNEY. ARE YOU CURRENTLY TAKING A LOOK ONCE AGAIN AT JC PENNY, WHICH YOU'VE OWNED ON THE DEBT SIDE BEFORE? LASRY: YES WE HAVE. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT IT PRETTY HARD AGAIN. THE BONDS ARE DOWN TO ABOUT 70 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. SO YOU'RE GENERATING SORT OF A DOUBLE DIGIT YIELD, WHICH IN THIS ENVIRONMENT IS GOOD. BUT WE'D LIKE TO GET INVOLVED IN THOSE BONDS, YOU KNOW, HOPEFULLY, IF THEY GET DOWN TO THE 50, 60, 70 LEVEL. WAPNER: LET ME SWITCH GEARS AND ASK YOU ABOUT HARVEY WEINSTEIN. LASRY: SURE. WAPNER: YOU WERE ON THE BOARD OF THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY FOR A YEAR OR SO. LASRY: YES. WAPNER: YOU WERE NAMED YESTERDAY IN A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST HARVEY WEINSTEIN, THE BOARD AND OTHER OF HIS COMPANIES. WHAT DID YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WERE ON THE BOARD? LASRY: DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING. I JOINED THE BOARD. AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT, WHICH WAS A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE EVERYBODY ELSE, WE HAD A BOARD CALL, I THEN RESIGNED THE FOLLOWING DAY. SO LOOK, I UNDERSTAND AND I THINK WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING JUST WASN'T – WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG. BUT AS FAR AS FOR ME, I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF IT. WAPNER: YEAH. HOW COULDN'T YOU HAVE KNOWN AS A BOARD? I THINK PEOPLE WOULD HEAR THAT ANSWER AND SAY, IF SEEMINGLY THERE WAS THIS REPUTATION OF THIS GUY FOR 30 YEARS IN HOLLYWOOD. YOU KNOW, BEN AFFLECK TELLS THE ""TODAY"" SHOW EVERYBODY KNEW THAT HE WAS A SLEEZE AND KIND OF A BULLY. HOW DIDN'T THE BOARD KNOW? LASRY: WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IF EVERYBODY KNEW, WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL ME? NOBODY CALLED, NOBODY SENT ME EMAILS, NOBODY SAID ""HEY, BY THE WAY, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT."" SO IT'S REALLY NICE THAT EVERYBODY SAYS THAT, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, A LOT OF BOARD MEMBERS JUST DIDN'T KNOW. AND EVERYBODY CAN SAY TODAY IT WAS AN OPEN SECRET. IF IT WAS SO OPEN, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF SOMEBODY HAD CALLED OR SOMEBODY HAD SAID ANYTHING. WAPNER: HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM AT ALL RECENTLY? LASRY: NO, NOT AT ALL. WAPNER: YEAH. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT BITCOIN. WE'LL SWITCH GEARS BACK TO THE MARKET. 15,000. THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU? LASRY: YOU KNOW, THE ONLY THING I'M UPSET ABOUT IS WHY DIDN'T I BUY IT WHEN IT WAS AT 300 OR 500? YOU KNOW, IN THE BACK OF MY MIND, I'M LIKE WHY DIDN'T I BUY THAT THING. I WANTED TO BUY IT WHEN IT HIT 9,000, 10,000. I WAS LIKE YOU KNOW, I'LL JUST WAIT FOR IT TO TAKE A LITTLE DIP. AND IT HASN'T TAKEN A DIP. AND LOOK, I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. I JUST SORT OF LOOKED AT IT AND SAID IT SEEMS LIKE A NEW CURRENCY IS BEING CREATED, AND THEREFORE IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO TRY TO PARTICIPATE IN IT. BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANY ANALYSIS WHY IT MAKES SENSE OR NOT. WAPNER: RIGHT. I MEAN – AMID THE COMMENTARY ON BOTH SIDES, WHETHER IT'S REAL OR IT'S A FRAUD AS JAMIE DIMON HAS NOW FAMOUSLY SAID, YOU DON'T HAVE AN OPINION ONE WAY -- DO YOU THINK IT'S REAL? LASRY: I THINK IT'S REAL. I THINK THE REASON YOU'RE SEEING THIS HUGE RUN-UP IN IT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS IS JUST THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE NOW ARE STARTING TO BUY IT. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT, WHEREAS BEFORE IT MAY HAVE BEEN MORE TECHIES, NOW WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IT'S COMING TO THE MAINSTREAM, AND AS IT COMES INTO THE MAINSTREAM, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO GET INVOLVED IN IT. I DO THINK IT'S REAL. AND I THINK WHEN NOVOGRATZ SAYS IT'S GOT A POSSIBILITY OF BEING WORTH 20,000 OR 40,000, I CAN SEE THAT AS IT BECOME MORE MAINSTREAM. WAPNER: LET ME ASK YOU – WRAP IT UP BY ASKING YOU TO REACT TO SOMETHING LARRY FINK SAID ON THE STAGE, THAT I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING. AS YOU SORT OF LOOK AHEAD TO WHAT THE MARKETS ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR, HE SAID WE'VE NEVER HAD A TIME WHERE THE FED HAS BEEN ON THIS AGGRESSIVE TIGHTENING PATH, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME UNLOADING THE BALANCE SHEET, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME DOING SUCH A SIZABLE FISCAL STIMULUS. AND HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE IMPACT OF ALL THAT IS GOING TO BE. DO YOU? LASRY: I DON'T. I DO THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING IS CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS HIGH. PEOPLE ARE SPENDING MONEY. SO, I THINK THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL AND BECAUSE OF THAT, YOU'LL FIND THAT THE MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO DO WELL. AND THAT'S WHY RATES ARE GOING TO MOVE UP, RIGHT? SO IF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS HIGH, THE ENVIRONMENT IS GOOD, THE MARKET WILL GO UP. WAPNER: APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. LASRY: THANK YOU. WAPNER: IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AS ALWAYS. MARC LASRY IS THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO, AS WE SAID, OF AVENUE CAPITAL. DAVID, BACK TO YOU.

Jordan Novet,12072017,CNBC,11302017,"Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood was complimentary of Google's cloud computing unit on Tuesday, and had particularly flattering words for CEO Diane Greene. Speaking at the 2017 Wells Fargo Tech Summit in Utah, Hood said that Microsoft has been seeing Google's rival cloud more frequently in a competitive setting. Microsoft's Azure cloud service and Office 365 cloud-based productivity apps are in a high-stakes battle with the Google Cloud Platform and G Suite. In the public cloud business, both Microsoft and Google trail market leader Amazon Web Services. In her Tuesday remarks -- which came after Wells Fargo analyst Philip Winslow specifically asked about Google -- Hood also praised Greene, the head of Google's cloud efforts for the past two years. Greene, who was formerly CEO of VMware, announced last week that she hired Diane Bryant from Intel to be operating chief of Google's cloud. ""We've seen more of them in the past few quarters than we've seen before,"" Hood said. ""I think they're making a good effort. I think Diane Greene is an excellent leader and an established enterprise CEO."" Hood went on to say that Greene has ""always been a winner."" Hood's amicable tone represented quite the contrast to the war of words of late between AWS and Oracle when it comes to the cloud. Oracle CEO Mark Hurd went after Amazon in October, claiming a workload on AWS could be six times more expensive than on Oracle's cloud. AWS CEO Andy Jassy responded last week saying, ""I think they're a long way away in the cloud."" In the third quarter, Amazon had 31.8 percent share of the cloud infrastructure services market, Microsoft had 13.9 percent and Google had 6 percent, according to Canalys. Hood talked more broadly about cloud competition in certain parts of the world and she acknowledged the growth of the Alibaba public cloud. Alibaba isn't among the leaders in the U.S., but elsewhere in the world, particularly in Asia and Africa, it's a different story. The company is ""well-funded, well capitalized, certainly aggressive."" Hood said. ",Microsoft CFO Amy Hood says Google cloud becoming a bigger competitor
Michelle Fox,12072017,CNBC,11302017,"Tax reform is expected to boost the market, but certain stocks will certainly benefit more than others, two experts told CNBC on Friday. Noted value investor David Katz's top picks are Schlumberger, Target, AT&T and Wells Fargo. He likes the companies with or without tax relief, but noted they do pay higher taxes. ""If there is tax relief, they are going to get a nice 5 or 10 percent earnings kicker on top of better earnings next year and they are all selling at pretty reasonable valuations,"" the chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors said in an interview with ""Closing Bell."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Friday that Senate Republicans have enough votes to pass their bill. Once that happens, the House and Senate must reconcile their bills and then send a final version to President Donald Trump to sign into law. Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, said he likes Hershey, Hormel and Dr Pepper Snapple. These ""boring"" stocks have 90 percent of their revenues coming from the U.S., he told ""Closing Bell."" ""These companies are growing, profitable, well-capitalized. Even without the tax break, we think that these companies can outperform the S&P 500 with considerably less volatility,"" Morganlander said. However, Katz had a word of advice: Don't chase the stocks if the Senate passes its bill because there's still a lot that happens before the legislation becomes law. In other words, tax relief isn't about whether there will be a one-week jump, he said. Instead, it ""sets the tone for a better market for the next six to 12 months because you're going to have a better economy and better earnings."" ","Tax reform winners: Experts' top picks include Schlumberger, Target"

The interview aired Thursday, December 7 on CNBC's ""Fast Money Halftime Report"" (M-F 12:00PM – 1:00PM.)

All references must be sourced to CNBC. SCOTT WAPNER: ALL RIGHT, GUYS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO ""THE HALFTIME REPORT."" I'M SCOTT WAPNER. WE ARE LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY FROM THE WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT THOUGHT LEADERSHIP FORUM. AND WE ARE JOINED TODAY BY SEVERAL SPECIAL GUESTS THROUGHOUT THIS HOUR. OUR FIRST IS HEDGE FUND LEGEND, LEON COOPERMAN, OF OMEGA ADVISORS. OUR OWN JIM LAVENTHAL IS HERE WITH US WELL. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE LEE WITH US. JIM, GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE AS WELL. JIM LAVENTHAL: THANKS SCOTT. THANKS LEE FOR JOINING US. WAPNER: LEE, LET'S CATCH UP WITH YOU ON WHERE YOU THINK WE ARE NOW IN THE MARKET. FROM YOUR LAST APPEARANCE, NOT THAT LONG AGO, WE CONTINUE TO MOVE HIGHER. THERE'S CONSIDERABLE TALK ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACT OF TAX REFORM IS GOING TO BE ON THE STOCK MARKET. IF WE WERE FAIRLY VALUED FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF TIMES, FEW TIMES YOU'VE BEEN ON THE NETWORK, WHERE ARE WE TODAY WITH THE DOW NORTH OF 24,000? LEON COOPERMAN: WELL, YOU KNOW, FAIR VALUE RISES BECAUSE THE MARKET HAS A CAPITAL MARKET LINE AND PROBABLY GOES UP 6% A YEAR. I WOULD SAY I VIEW THE MARKET AS REASONABLY FULLY VALUED. I DON'T THINK IT'S OVERVALUED. WAPNER: YOU DON'T THINK IT'S OVERVALUED YET? COOPERMAN: NO. I DON'T THINK IT'S OVERVALUED. THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOU DISCOUNTING THE EARNINGS WITH? THE TEN YEAR GOVERNMENT IS 2.3%, THE FED FUNDS RATE IS 1%. THOSE ARE VERY, VERY UNCOMPETITIVE INTEREST RATE LEVELS FOR THE STOCK MARKET. AND SO IF RATES STAY DOWN HERE, I THINK THE MARKET IS OKAY. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS I THINK THE MARKET IS REASONABLY FULLY VALUED WITH THE CONDITIONS THAT WOULD LEAD TO A BIG DECLINE DON'T SEEM TO BE PRESENT. AS I'VE OFTEN SAID ON THE PROGRAM, THE CONDITIONS ARE, NUMBER ONE, THE MARKET SMELLING AN ONGOING RECESSION. IF ANYTHING, THE ECONOMY IS GAINING A LITTLE BIT OF MOMENTUM, NOT DECLINING MOMENTUM. SECONDLY WOULD BE A HOSTILE FED. IF ANYTHING, I THINK THE FED HAS BEEN TOO SLOW ADJUSTING POLICY. THEY'RE FAR FROM HOSTILE. THIRD WOULD BE EUPHORIC VALUATIONS. AND I DON'T SEE EUPHORIC VALUATIONS. AND FOURTH WOULD BE SOME UNFORESEEN GEOPOLITICAL EVENT WHICH I CAN'T FORECAST. WAPNER: SO, WHAT ABOUT THIS ROTATION THAT WE'VE BEEN WITNESSING IN THE MARKET, PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS? COOPERMAN: HEALTHY. HEALTHY. WAPNER: YOU DON'T THINK IT'S A SIGN OF SOMETHING BIGGER? THIS MOVE OUT OF THESE HIGH GROWTH, HIGH FLYING TECHNOLOGY STOCKS INTO OTHER AREAS OF THE MARKET? COOPERMAN: THEY'RE MOVING OTHER THINGS THAT WERE UP 30, 40, 50% TO GO INTO THINGS THAT HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING, WHERE COMPANIES ARE DOING REASONABLY WELL. I DON'T SEE WHERE THAT'S UNHEALTHY. THE BROADER THE MARKET, THE BETTER OFF WE ARE. WAPNER: IS IT MORE LASTING, DO YOU THINK? IS THAT TREND RESETTING ITSELF IN A DIFFERENT WAY? COOPERMAN: I WOULD EXPECT – OUTPERFORM GROWTH AS LONG AS WE REMAIN AN EXPANDING ECONOMY. BUT WE DON'T LOOK AT THE WORLD THAT WAY, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. WE LOOK AT THE WORLD ONE STOCK AT A TIME, BOTTOM UP. AND WE'RE FINDING – AS MUCH AS I FIND THE S&P TO BE NOT EXCITING, YOU KNOW, FULLY VALUED, I'M FINDING A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL STOCKS THAT SEEM TO BE VERY ATTRACTIVE RELATIVE TO THE S&P. WAPNER: NOW, WE HAD CARL ICAHN ON LAST WEEK, WHO SAID YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT SMELLS A LITTLE LIKE EUPHORIA. WE DISCUSSED HIS FIRST ACTIVIST CAMPAIGN OF THE ENTIRE YEAR AND THE FACT, AT LEAST HE SAID, WAS SOMEWHAT REPRESENTATIVE OF IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND VALUE IN THE MARKET, GIVEN THE GAINS THAT WE'VE HAD. YOU'RE DIFFERENT KINDS OF INVESTORS – BUT COOPERMAN: NO, NO, NO, NO. HE'S— WAPNER: -- HOW ABOUT THE NOTION. VALUE IS HARDER TO FIND, IS IT NOT? WAPNER: OF COURSE. BY DEFINITION THE MARKET IS UP YOU KNOW, FROM 700 IN THE S&P TO 2600. BUT LET ME JUST SAY, CARL IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. I HAVE A WORLD OF RESPECT FOR HIM. I THINK HE CLOSED DOWN HIS FUND THE END OF 2008, BECAUSE HE SAW LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES AND HE DIDN'T WANT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF RUNNING OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY. WE'VE BASICALLY HAD A SEVEN OR EIGHT-YEAR BULL RUN, ONE OF THE LONGEST IN HISTORY. SO CLEARLY THE CONSERVATISM HE EXPRESSED IN 08 WAS WRONG. OK. HE HAD A VERY NEGATIVE VIEW OF HIGH YIELD A YEAR AGO. A VERY INCORRECT VIEW. HE'S BRILLIANT. HE'S BRILLIANT. I LOVE WHEN YOU GET ON WITH HIM AND YOU WANT HIM TO TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT AND HE SAYS NO, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. THE GUY IS A MASTER. WE FIND THINGS TO DO. AND AGAIN, I'LL GO BACK TO WHAT I SAID A MOMENT AGO, IF YOU HAVE NO RECESSION AND THE ECONOMY IS GROWING AND PROFITS ARE GROWING AND THE FED IS MOVING GRADUALLY TOWARDS A TIGHTENING REGIME, WE JUST FIND THINGS TO DO. WAPNER: SO, LET ME ASK YOU THIS, EARLIER THIS MORNING LARRY FINK ON THE STAGE IN WHICH YOU SAT JUST A SHORT TIME AGO. COOPERMAN: A LITTLE AFTER HIM. WAPNER: SAID WE HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THE SORT OF ENVIRONMENT WERE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON WHERE THE FED IS AGGRESSIVELY TIGHTENING, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ROLLING OFF THE BALANCE SHEET, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME INTRODUCING A LARGE AMOUNT OF FISCAL STIMULUS, AND HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE IMPACT OF ALL THAT IS GOING TO BE. COOPERMAN: NEITHER DO I. I MEAN, IF YOU ASK ME ABOUT MY MARKET VIEW, I CAN SAY I CAN SEE AMARKET NEXT YEAR UP 10% TO DOWN 15%, WHICH STRIKES ME AS YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE BOAT WITH EVERYBODY ELSE, AT THE BEGINNING OF 2017, YOU KNOW, BLOOMBERG PUTS AN EXHIBIT ON THEIR TERMINAL OF THE LEADING STRATEGISTS AND WHAT THE FORECAST IS. THE AVERAGE EXPECTATION FOR THE S&P 500 THIS YEAR WAS 2,350. HERE WE'RE NOW 2,625 WHEREVER WE ARE AND EVERYBODY IS STILL BULLISH, AND NOW WE'RE LOOKING FOR 2,800. BECAUSE NOBODY HAS A DOWN MARKET. NOBODY HAD A DOWN MARKET IN 2008. A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON. YOU JUST MENTIONED, A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON. I THINK THE TAX PACKAGE MAKES LONG-TERM SENSE. SHORT TERM, I THINK IT'S DANGEROUS. WE HAVE A REASONABLY RAPIDLY GROWING ECONOMY, AND WE HAVE TIGHTENING BY THE FED, WE HAVE BALANCING BY THE FED. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED AN ADDITIONAL FISCAL STIMULUS INJECTED INTO THE ECONOMY. WAPNER: BY DANGEROUS, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT COULD BE THE FALL OUT OF IT? COOPERMAN: WELL, YOU COULD SEE A RAPID ESCALATION IN INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES, WHICH THE MARKET IS NOT PREPARED FOR. WAPNER: DO YOU THINK THE FED COULD BE FORCED TO TIGHTEN RATES FASTER THAN THE MARKET THINKS? COOPERMAN: THAT'S A RISK. THERE'S A LOT OF RISKS. THERE'S A NORTH KOREA RISK. THERE'S A RISK THAT THAT THE FED BECOMES LESS HOSPITABLE. I THINK WHAT I SAID ON YOUR PROGRAM A YEAR AGO IS I THINK WE'RE HEADING TO NORMALIZATION. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS WE'VE BEEN IN A VERY ABNORMAL ENVIRONMENT THE LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS. EVEN TODAY, $11 TRILLION OF SOVEREIGN DEBT HAS A NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE. A YEAR AGO IF YOU BOUGHT A HOME IN DENMARK, YOU GOT A CHECK EVERY MONTH FOR TAKING OUT A MORTGAGE WITH A NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE. KIND OF CRAZY, RIGHT? DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. SO WE'RE HEADING TOWARD NORMALIZATION. NORMALIZATION TO ME IS A HALF OF ONE PERCENT GROWTH IN THE LABOR FORCE, ONE HALF PERCENT GROWTH IN PRODUCTIVITY. THAT DEFINES REAL GROWTH, THAT 2%. ADD ON ANOTHER 2% FOR INFLATION, THAT'S 4%. IN A 4% NOMINALLY GROWING WORLD, I THINK THE FED FUNDS RATE OUGHT TO BE 2% OR MORE AND THE TEN-YEAR GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO BE 4%. IT'S GONNA TAKE THE FED FUNDS RATE LESS THAN A YEAR TO GET TO 4% -- TO 2%, EXCUSE ME, AND IT'S GONNA TAKE ABOUT TWO, TWO AND A HALF YEARS TO GET TO 4% IN THE TEN-YEAR GOVERNMENT. IN THAT WORLD THE MARKET MULTIPLE SHOULD BE 17. THAT'S MY OPINION, I KNOW PEOPLE COULD ARGUE MORE OR LESS. 17 TIMES 150, WHICH IS POST TAX PACKAGE EARNINGS, YOU'RE 25.50 OR 26.25. WE'RE FAIR VALUED. KEEP IN MIND, MARKETS DON'T PEAK AT FAIR VALUATION, THEY PEAK AT OVERVALUATION. SO I CAN SEE WE'D GO UP 10%, AT WHICH POINT WE'D BE OVERVALUED. WAPNER: YEP. JIM. LAVENTHAL: WELL, LEE, THANKS FOR JOINING US. AND I FEEL A LITTLE KINDRED SPIRIT WITH YOU BECAUSE I'M A VALUE INVESTOR. AND LOOK, LET'S FACE IT, THE LAST TEN YEARS HAVE NOT BEEN KIND TO VALUE VERSUS GROWTH INVESTORS. IT'S BEEN ABOUT AN ANNUAL 1.5% OUTPERFORMANCE. DOES VALUE NEED TO BE REDEFINED? BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE RUSSELL 1000 VALUE, THEIR MAIN METRIC IS PRICE TO BOOK. AND IF YOU JUST GO ON PRICE TO BOOK, YOU GET INTO SOME CRUMMY AREAS. SOME REAL VALUE TRAPS. COOPERMAN: THE BOOK VALUE IS – THE BOOK VALUE IS – THE VALUE OF A BOOK IS A FUNCTION OF THE RETURN ON BOOK. IF RETURN ON BOOK IS RISING, IT SHOULD THEORETICALLY PAY A HIGHER MULTIPLE, SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LEVERAGE THAT COMPANIES ARE EMPLOYING. LAVENTHAL: AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT GOOD WILL AS WELL, AS SOMETIMES BOOK VALUE IS OVERSTATED. COOPERMAN: I DON'T REALLY PLAY THAT GAME. MY LARGEST POSITION HAS BEEN GOOGLE. GOOGLE IS GROWTH BUT IT'S NOT OVERVALUED. IT'S 20 TIMES ESTIMATED EARNINGS WITH A FORTRESSED BALANCE SHEET AND GROWING ITS MARKET SHARE. FACEBOOK IS A LARGE POSITION FOR ME. IT'S 17 TIMES EARNINGS, GROWING MUCH MORE THAN 17%. SO I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS INDIVIDUALLY. AND I DON'T BELIEVE -- A CERTAIN PART OF THE MARKET IS EFFICIENT, BUT WHAT KEEPS ME COMING BACK – I OWNED 5 MILLION SHARES OF TIME INC. ON NOVEMBER 9th OF THIS YEAR, TIME INC. STOCK SOLD AT $10. THREE – LESS THAN THREE WEEKS LATER, MEREDEITH BOUGHT IT AT $18.5 IN CASH. IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO TELL ME, TIME WAS EFFICIENTLY PRICED AT 10, NO. THAT'S WHAT KEEPS ME COMING BACK AND PLAYING THE GAME. TO ME – WAPNER: THAT'S – I KNOW YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT OF A GOLFER. THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF HITTING ONE RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE. IT MAKES YOU WANT TO COME BACK NEXT TIME. COOPERMAN: EXACTLY. AND I WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW, WHAT I CONSIDER VALUE COULD BE A GROWTH STOCK THAT IS A VALUE STOCK. LAVENTHAL: WELL, LET'S TAKE YOUR DEFINITION, GOOGLE BEING A GREAT EXAMPLE BECAUSE THE GROWTH RATE VERSUS THE PRICE OF EARNINGS MULTIPLE MAKES IT VERY TASTY FOR A VALUE INVESTOR. COOPERMAN: THAT'S THE METRIC I LOOK AT. LAVENTHAL: PRICE EARNINGS TO GROWTH. COOPERMAN: PRICE EARNINGS TO GROWTH. LAVENTHAL: IF YOU LOOK GOING INTO 2018, I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY VALUE SHOULD OUTPERFORM GROWTH THIS YEAR. CAN YOU TELL US WHY? COOPERMAN: WHAT I SAY IS WHAT I MIGHT CONSIDER A VALUE STOCK, SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT CONSIDER A GROWTH STOCK. LAVENTHAL: WELL LET'S USE YOUR DEFINITION. I LIKE YOUR DEFINITION. WAPNER: GOOGLE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE, ALL RIGHT. YOU LOOK AT IT AS A VALUE STOCK. IT IS A GROWTH STOCK IN TERMS OF THE BASKET THAT IT'S IN WITHIN THE NASDAQ THE WAY PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT. BUT YOU AS HAVING LARGE POSITIONS IN BOTH GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK, AND GOING BACK TO THE ROTATION QUESTION, AREN'T RETHINKING IN ANY WAY THOSE POSITIONS, IF YOU THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A MORE MEANINGFUL ROTATION OUT OF SOME OF THOSE AREAS INTO MORE UNDERVALUED OR OUT OF FAVORED PLACES HEADING INTO THE NEW YEAR? COOPERMAN: YEAH, I WOULD SAY THAT THINK THAT -- LOOK, I THINK I SAID THIS ON THE LAST PROGRAM AND PEOPLE LAUGHED ABOUT IT. BUT IF EVERY STOCK YOU OWN IS ON A NEW HIGH LIST, YOU'RE A MOMENTUM PLAYER. IF YOU'RE ON THE NEW LOW LIST, YOU'RE OUT OF BUSINESS. SO I AM LOOKING FOR A COMBINATION OF THINGS THAT ARE WORKING AND THINGS THAT ARE OUT OF FAVOR. WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND ON THE PROGRAM TODAY IS NOT WHAT'S WORKING WITH ONE EXCEPTION. I WOULD WORK WITH OUT OF FAVOR. SO AMC NETWORKS, BASICALLY 7.5 TIMES EARNINGS. SO LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, THE DOLAN FAMILY EARNS 17% OF THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE COMPANY. EVERY QUARTER, SIGNIFICANT BUYBACK OF STOCK. EVERY QUARTER. NOW IF YOU'RE DEALING WITH INTELLIGENT MANAGEMENT, INTELLIGENT MANAGEMENT UNDERSTANDS THAT THEY SHRINK THE CAP AND THEY'RE NOT SELLING THEIR STOCK, IF THEY'RE BUYING BACK STOCK AT INAPPROPRIATE PRICES, THEY'RE SCREWING THEMSELVES. SO I PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THAT, OK. AND THIS STOCK IS TRADING AT SEVEN TIMES EARNINGS IN A 17 MULTIPLE MARKET, LARGE FREE CASH FLOW. SURE VIEWERSHIP IS DECLINING A LITTLE BIT BUT THE MARKET IS WAY OVER DISCOUNT TO WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. SHIRE PHARMACEUTICAL, THEIR STOCK IS SELLING AT NINE TIMES EARNINGS. BASICALLY SHIRE HAS 20% OF THEIR EARNINGS EXPOSED TO A HEMOPHILIA FRANCHISE. --- IS COMING IN, CREATING SOME UNCERTAINTY. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A COMPANY CRUSHER. YOU KNOW, EVERY COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION. ONE THAT – I'M COMFORTED BY WARREN BUFFETT WHO OWNS 10% OF THE COMPANY, WE WERE THERE BEFORE HIM, OK. BUT UNITED AIRLINES. UNITED AIRLINES IS LIKE SIX TIMES WHAT WE THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA EARN. THEY BOUGHT BACK A THIRD OF THE COMPANY IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WITH STOCK REPURCHASE. THEY'RE BUYING BACK 10% OF THE COMPANY ANNUALLY. THE INDUSTRY IS LESS COMPETITIVE VERSUS CONCENTRATED. THERE'S THINGS THAT YOU COULD BE DOING, YOU KNOW. WAPNER: DO YOU – LET'S GO BACK TO SORT OF THE BIGGER MARKET PICTURE. DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH BECAUSE OF THE MORE RECENT RUN-UP THAT WE'VE PULLED FORWARD A SIZEABLE NUMBER OF GAINS INTO THIS YEAR? COOPERMAN: I THINK THE MARKET IS DISCOUNTED MORE IN THE FUTURE THAN I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT. LET ME BE HONEST WITH YOU. THE MARKET HAS DONE BETTER THIS YEAR THAN I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AND I THINK IT'S DISCOUNTING SOME OF THE RETURN NEXT YEAR. I THINK THE FED BY ITS POLICIES HAS FORCED PEOPLE OUT OF THE RISK CURVE. PEOPLE ARE GETTING FATIGUED. THEY CAN'T SURVIVE ON 1% MONEY MARKET RATES, THEY CAN'T SURVIVE ON 2% TEN-YEAR GOVERNMENTS. YOU KNOW, SO THEY'RE LOOKING TO TAKE ON MORE RISK. AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT THE WISE MAN DOES IN THE BEGINNING, THE FOOL DOES IN THE END. NOW WE'RE NOT THERE YET. THE MARKET IS NOT EXPLOITED. AS YOU KNOW, I LOVE JOHN TEMPLETON'S COMMENTARY. WAPNER: YES WE DO. SO WE HAVEN'T REACHED EUPHORIA. COOPERMAN: I DON'T SEE EUPHORIA. I DON'T SEE IT IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR BEHAVIOR. I DON'T SEE IT IN TERMS OF OVERALL MARKET VALUATION. THE ONLY WAY CURRENT LEVELS WOULD BE EUPHORIC IS IF THE FUNDAMENTALS DETERIORATED BEYOND ANYTHING WE ANTICIPATE. IN OTHER WORDS, I'D BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT IF WE'RE HEADING TO A RECESSION, MY FORECAST IS IN TROUBLE. IF THE FED HIKES FIVE, SIX TIMES NEXT YEAR, I'M IN TROUBLE. BUT THAT'S NOT – WAPNER: WHAT HAPPENS IF THE YIELD CURVE INVERTS? WHICH THAT'S SOMETHING SOME PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT. COOPERMAN: I THINK THAT'S A MORE TECHNICAL PHENOMENON. YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON IN THE WORLD I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I THINK MONETARY POLICY IS BEING RUN BY ACADEMICS. YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHY A TEN-YEAR BOND IS YIELD 38 BASIS POINTS IN GERMANY. THE ONLY EXPLANATION I CAN THINK OF IS INFLATION IS VERY LOW AND BASICALLY, IT'S A SHORTAGE OF LOW RISK AND NO-RISK ASSETS AND PEOPLE -- THERE'S A CERTAIN BUYER POPULATION THAT WANTS NO RISK AND THEY'RE BUYING NO-RISK ASSETS. LAVENTHAL: SO, ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE YIELD CURVE INVERSION IF IT HAPPENS IS A SYMPTOM, NOT A CAUSE? THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK TO WHAT THE UNDERLYING REASON IS? COOPERMAN: ABSOLUTELY. LAVENTHAL: BUT JUST A YIELD CURVE INVERTING WOULDN'T MAKE IT A – WAPNER: YOU WOULDN'T SAY IT WOULD PORTEND A CALAMITY OR CATASTROPHE? COOPERMAN: NOT AT ALL. WAPNER: PEOPLE SEE INVERTED YIELD CURVE AND THEY START THINKING OBVIOUSLY RECESSION. COOPERMAN: NO. – AND ALL THIS. IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE. IF LIFE WAS THAT SIMPLE, THE JOB WOULD BE A LOT EASIER. WAPNER: BUT YOU DO THINK WE'VE PULLED -- IS NEXT YEARS GOING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT? COOPERMAN: WELL AS I SAID, I WOULDN'T WANT TO MAKE A STAND-ALONE IN CONCRETE FORECAST. I THINK IF YOU SAID TO ME YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE ME A NUMBER, I'D SAY WE'LL BE UP 6% OR 7%. BUT THE MARKET COULD BE UP 10 OR DOWN 15. WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW FUNDAMENTALS UNFOLD. I LIKE WHAT I OWN. I THINK IT WILL OUTPERFORM WHATEVER THE MARKET DOES NEXT YEAR. OK. AND THAT'S NOT BEEN THE CASE FOR THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS. THE S&P HAS GOTTEN TO BE A TOUGH INDEX AS THEY KEEP REMAKING IT AND PUTTING IN NEW COMPONENTS IN THE INDEX. WAPNER: IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'D AGREE WITH HOWARD MARKS. I MEAN, THE EASY MONEY HAS BEEN MADE, HE'S BEEN SAYING THE LAST COUPLE— COOPERMAN: IT WASN'T EASY WHEN I WAS MAKING IT. IT WAS VERY HARD. ABOUT 14% THIS YEAR, BELIEVE ME, IT WASN'T EASY. IT'S 70-HOUR WORK WEEKS AND A LOT OF AGGRAVATION. WAPNER: BUT YOU GET THE POINT, RIGHT? THE S&P HAS QUADRUPLED OFF OF THE BOTTOM AND THAT'S SORT OF THE POINT HE'S MAKING. IT'S GOING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT TO MAKE MONEY. COOPERMAN: WELL, YOU HAVE INTEREST RATES GOING UP, THEY'VE BEEN GOING DOWN. YOU HAVE INFLATION LIKELY TO GO UP, IT'S BEEN GOING DOWN, OK. I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE FUNDAMENTALS – WE'RE GOING TO MOVE AWAY FROM QUANTITATIVE EASING. SO YEAH, THINGS ARE MOVING A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. THE QUESTION IS THE PACE THAT THEY'RE MOVING. WAPNER: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND COME PACK AND I'M GOING ASK YOU ABOUT BITCOIN. COOPERMAN: I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. WAPNER: WELL, YOU BETTER LEARN QUICK BECAUSE IT'S JUST EXPLODED THAT TRADE IN AND OF ITSELF CONTINUES TO WOW INVESTORS. WE'RE GONNA COME RIGHT BACK HERE AT THE WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT THOUGHT LEADERSHIP FORUM WITH MORE FROM OMEGA'S LEON COOPERMAN AND WE'LL DO THAT IN A COUPLE MINUTES BACK HERE ON HALFTIME. WAPNER: WE ARE BACK LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY. THIS IS ""THE HALFTIME REPORT."" LEON COOPERMAN IS STILL WITH US TODAY. JOE TERRANOVA HAS JOINED US NOW AS WELL. I ALLUDED TO THE FACT I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT BITCOIN AND JUST GIVEN WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IT, NOW TODAY IT GOES THROUGH 19,000 FOR THE FIRST TIME, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS PHENOMENON? AND THAT'S A PRETTY DECENT WORD TO USE. COOPERMAN: JOE GAVE ME THE ANSWERS. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND BITCOIN, THAT MEANS YOU'RE OLD. BLOCK CHAIN TECHNOLOGY IS INTERESTING. I DON'T GET IT. FROM 1,000 TO 15,000 IN A YEAR. THOUGH I LISTENED, MELISSA LEE HAD MIKE NOVOGRATZ, AN OLD PARTNER OF MINE FROM GOLDMAN SACHS ON, AND I'VE GOT TO GIVE THE MAN CREDIT. HE WAS THERE EARLY, HE ARTICULATED HIS VIEW AND SAID THAT HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE 40,000 SOMETIME IN 2018. ALL I CAN TELL YOU, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE 40,000 OF MY MONEY. WAPNER: YOU HAVE NO MONEY IN BITCOIN AT ALL? COOPERMAN: NO MONEY AT ALL. WAPNER: HAVE YOU PUT ANY OF YOUR ANALYSTS ON IT-- COOPERMAN: NO. WAPNER: AND SAID FIND OUT WHAT EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT? COOPERMAN: I KIND OF FEEL LIKE WAS IT JAMIE DIMON WHO SAID HE'D FIRE ANYBODY THAT WAS— WAPNER: HE CALLED IT A FRAUD. I WONDER— HE'S SPEAKING LATER TODAY, BY THE WAY. I WONDER IF HE'LL DOUBLE DOWN ON THAT OR SOFTEN HIS FEEL. COOPERMAN: WHENEVER HE SPEAKS YOU SHOULD LISTEN. BECAUSE, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BITCOIN BUT HE'S A MAN WORTH LISTENING TO. HE'S GOT A GOOD FEEL FOR THE ECONOMY AND A VERY INTELLIGENT GUY. WAPNER: WELL LET ME ASK YOU THIS WAY. WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE BITCOIN WITH A STRAIGHT LINE UP, THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE – IF THERE'S A SIGN OF EUPHORIA, IS THAT IT OR IS IT IT'S OWN INDIVIDUAL THING? COOPERMAN: THERE'S EUPHORIA IN BITCOIN. THERE'S EUPHORIA IN A SENSE IN BONDS AT 38 BASIS POINTS, BUT THE BROAD MARKET, I DON'T THINK IS EVIDENCE OF EUPHORIA. YOU KNOW, I WENT THROUGH NUMBERS IN THE CONFERENCE, I SPOKE THIS MORNING AT THE WELLS FARGO CONFERENCE, AND THEY ASKED ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY BUBBLE, WHETHER IT'S COMPARABLE TO 2000. IN 2000, CISCO WAS LIKE 100 TIMES FREE CASH FLOW. IT'S 11 OR 12 TIMES FREE CASH FLOW. ORACLE THE SAME THING. 20 TIMES EARNINGS FOR GOOGLE, 70 TIMES EARNINGS FOR FACEBOOK. THAT'S NOT EUPHORIC. RELATIVE TO GROWTH RATES, THAT'S LOW, THAT'S LOW. YOU KNOW, THE MAIN THREAT TO THESE COMPANIES, THEY'RE GAINING MARKET SHARE AND STRENGTH EVERY DAY, IS GOVERNMENT. WAPNER: YOU DON'T OWN AMAZON, RIGHT? COOPERMAN: I DO OWN AMAZON. WAPNER: YOU DO OWN AMAZON. COOPERMAN: IF I LISTENED TO MY ANALYST JOHN WOLF, I'D BE UP NOT 14% THIS YEAR, I'D BE UP 24%. BUT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A RELUCTANCE TO PLAY IN THE SUPER HIGH MULTIPLE AREA WHERE YOU'RE DISCOUNTING THE FUTURE. BUT AMAZON IS A CLASS COMPANY THAT IS GAINING STRENGTH. YOU KNOW, THEY'VE OUTEXECUTED EVERYBODY. THE MAJOR RISK TO AMAZON, I GUESS I COULD SAY THIS WITH TEN OTHER PEOPLE AT DINNER, I WAS HOSTED BY THE PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE IN MID-JULY AND TWICE HE ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT AMAZON WAS A MONOPOLY. WAPNER: THE PRESIDENT ASKED YOU? COOPERMAN: YEAH, EXACTLY. AND I SAID, NO, MR. PRESIDENT, I THINK THEY HAVE OUTEXECUTED PEOPLE, THEY'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB, ET CETERA. A LOT OF THE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS ARE LOOKING AT GOOGLE AND LOOKING AT FACEBOOK, YOU KNOW. AND THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO STICK THEIR BEAK INTO THIS THING AND THAT'S THE RISK. BUT I DON'T THINK THESE ARE EXPENSIVE STOCKS GIVEN THEIR GROWTH RATES. WAPNER: DID OTHER PEOPLE AT THE TABLE WITH THE PRESIDENT ALL PINE ON THE TOPIC AS WELL? WHAT WAS THE PREVAILING THOUGHT? IF THE PRESIDENT IS SEEKING OUT ADVICE FROM PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND OTHERS AT THE TABLE. COOPERMAN: I CHANGED THE SUBJECT VERY QUICKLY. HE DID SAY TO ME, LEE, I GUESS I CAN SAY THIS, HE SAID TO ME, LEE, YOU HAVE A FABULOUS REPUTATION. DO YOU THINK YOUR OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA CREATED YOUR S.E.C. PROBLEMS. SO SOMEBODY BRIEFED HIM. I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T KNOW, BUT, MR. PRESIDENT, THE S.E.C. TREATED ME VERY UNFAIRLY BUT I'M GETTING ON WITH MY LIFE. LET ME CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR VICTORY. I THINK PERSONALLY IF HILLARY CLINTON HAD WON, WE'D BE IN A RECESSION TODAY. YOU REPRESENT EXTRA INNINGS TO BOTH THE ECONOMY AND THE STOCK MARKET. AND THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS WORK VERY HARD TO UNIFY THE COUNTRY. THERE'S TOO MUCH DIVISIVENESS. HIS RESPONSE WAS I HEAR YOU. NOT REALLY LIKELY TO HAPPEN, TOO MUCH ANGER. WELL, WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE, YOU KNOW. WAPNER: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT THAT HE DOES CITE THE RECORD STOCK MARKET ALL THE TIME? COOPERMAN: I LIKEN THAT TO THE FACT THAT THE STOCK MARKET IS LOOKING AT ECONOMIC GROWTH, INFLATION, CORPORATE PROFITS, INTEREST RATES, RATHER THAN WHETHER THE UNITED STATES PRESTIGE AROUND THE WORLD IS GOING UP OR GOING DOWN. WE'RE CAPITALISTS. IT'S LIKE A DRUG COMPANY HAS A FAULTY DRUG, KILLS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE, PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT TEN PEOPLE KILLED, THEY TALK ABOUT THE EARNINGS PER SHARE IMPACT. SO THE MARKET IS FINANCIALLY ORIENTED. IT SAYS I CANT MAKE ANY MONEY IN BONDS SO I'M GONNA BUY MY FAVORITE STOCK. WAPNER: GIVEN THAT IT'S A YEAR ALMOST UNDER THE PRESIDENT, TO WHAT CREDIT OR HOW MUCH CREDIT DOES HE DESERVE FOR WHERE WE ARE AT 24,000 PLUS. COOPERMAN: I THINK A LOT. I THINK HE'S UNLEASHED ANIMAL SPIRITS TO A DEGREE. THE WAY I SEE IT AND I COULD BE DEAD WRONG, THE INTELLIGENT PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP A YEAR AGO SAID I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET WHEN I GET HILLARY. I DON'T WANT IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO GET WITH DONALD TRUMP, I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES. I'M SURPRISED, BUT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE STILL THAT WAY. OK. AND I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO HAPPEN, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE HE FINISHES OUT HIS FIRST TERM AND ELLECTS TO RUN AGAIN WHO THE DEMOCRATS RUN AGAINST HIM. I WOULD VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP AHEAD OF ELIZABETH WARREN OR BERNIE SANDERS. THE DEMOCRAT HAS BECOME A LEFTWARD LEANING PARTY IN THIS COUNTRY. I'M CENTERIST. I'M A REGISTERED INDEPENDENT. BI VOTE THE ISSUES. BUT YOU KNOW, UNLESS -- WE HAVE TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. THAT'S MY CENTRAL VIEW. THAT'S WHAT I THINK I'M ALL ABOUT. I'M ALL ABOUT GIVING EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, GIVING AN EDUCATION TO YOUNGSTERS, GIVING MY MONEY BACK TO SOCIETY. BUT WE – THIS DIVISIVENESS IS UNHEALTHY. BUT I BELIEVE WE'RE BETTER OFF WITH TRUMP LEADERSHIP THAN A BERNIE SANDERS OR ELIZABETH WARREN ADMINISTRATION. TERRANOVA: SO THE MARKET CLEARLY LIKES THE LIFTING OF REGULATION. IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARD TO SEE WHAT REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN LIFTED. BUT YOU WOULD AGREE THE MARKET LIKES IT. COOPERMAN: ABSOLUTELY. TERRANOVA: SECONDARILY NOW, YOU'VE GOT THIS TAX BILL. WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY SURE IF IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT WE HAD EXPECTED IT TO BE. COOPERMAN: 23, 22, 20, 19. TAXES ARE GOING DOWN FOR BUSINESS, THAT'S POSITIVE. IT'S A LITTLE DANGEROUS NEAR TERM BECAUSE WE HAVE A REGIME OF FED TIGHTENING, WE HAVE AN ECONOMY GROWING VERY NICELY, WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM Q.E. AND WE'RE INJECTING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FISCAL STIMULUS, SO YOU RUN THE RISK. THERE'S A RISK THERE, SO OVER THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS WE'RE MOVING THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WAPNER: BUT IS THAT THE END OF THE ROAD? IS THERE AN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL? WAS THAT JUST A DREAM? IS THIS – COOPERMAN: NO, I THINK HE'LL TRY TO DELIVER ON WHAT HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO DELIVER. HE'S TAKING -- LOOK, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD A FOOT ON THE THROAT OF THE ECONOMY. BUSINESS WERE CONFUSED, THEY DIDNT WANT TO INVEST. BUSINESSMEN ARE MORE FAVORABLY DISPOSED WITH CURRENT POLICIES, THEY HAVE VISIBILITY. THAT'S A POSITIVE THING, OKAY. I THINK REDUCED TAXES HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT AS A POSITIVE. WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE THE BIGGEST RISK I THINK FRANKLY IS IF WE DON'T GET CONSTRUCTIVE LEGISLATION THROUGH AND DON'T GET THE ECONOMY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A MIDTERM ELECTION WHERE THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO LOSE HOUSE. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY NEGATIVE. THAT'S ONE OF MY TENTATIVE THINGS ABOUT THE MARKET. WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A 12-MONTH AHEAD CAST A STONE FORECAST. I'VE GOT TO COME TO WORK EVERY DAY AND STUDY IT. I DO SAY THERE'S VALUE IN THE MARKET. THERE'S VALUE IN THE MARKET. THE MARKET IS NOT PRICED FOR EUPHORIA AT ALL. BITCOIN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. SO, I'M MORE HUMBLE. WHEN I MISS SOMETHING COMPLETELY, EVEN THOUGH IT'S UP NINEFOLD, ME DISMISSING IT IS NOT RELEVANT. BRING A GUY ON THE SHOW THAT MADE $200 MILLION ON BITCOIN AND SAID HE'S CHANGED HIS MIND, HE'S NEGATIVE. THAT'S THE GUY I LISTEN TO. WAPNER: IT'S NICE OF YOU TO CITE MELISSA AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE ON THAT SHOW ABOUT BITCOIN. COOPERMAN: HE SAYS 40,000. WHAT THE HELL DO I KNOW? IF I WAS SO SMART, I'D OWN IT. WAPNER: IT SEEMS LIKE ITS GETTING THERE QUICK. WE'LL TAKE A QUICK BREAK, WE'LL STEP AWAY. JOE'S GONNA STAY WITH US. WE THANK LEE COOPERMAN FOR SPENDING THIS WITH US, AS ALWAYS.

The banking sector has been one of the market's top performers over the past year or so, and there could be more good times ahead. If interest rates continue to rise, tax reform passes, and banking regulations get loosened, there could be more upside for bank stocks in the coming years. Two of the biggest players in the industry are Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and they are two very different ways to play the sector. For one thing, Wells Fargo is a pure-play commercial bank, while Bank of America has a much more diverse business. And while Bank of America has been one of the sector's biggest winners, Wells Fargo has underperformed. Is Wells Fargo a bargain, or is it still dangerous? Has Bank of America gotten too expensive? Here's a look at these two bank stocks, and which could be the better buy now. Image source: Getty Images. Bank of America has been one of the post-financial-crisis success stories. The bank, led by CEO Brian Moynihan, has successfully transformed itself into an institution of high asset quality and smart risk management, and is starting to produce consistent profits. In addition, Bank of America has emerged as a leader in mobile and online banking technologies and is using its digital success to reduce its physical footprint and run more efficiently. Over the past year alone, Bank of America's net income rose by 13%, deposits and loans grew by 4% and 6%, respectively, and thanks to a 3% drop in noninterest expense, the bank's efficiency ratio improved significantly. There's a good chance you're familiar with Wells Fargo's infamous fake-accounts scandal, in which thousands of employees improperly opened as many as 3.5 million accounts for customers. In addition, the bank has been the subject of a few smaller, but still troubling, scandals as well. To name one example, it was revealed in July 2017 that Wells Fargo wrongly charged more than 800,000 auto loan customers for insurance they didn't need. In the bank's recent third-quarter earnings report, the lingering effects of the scandal are apparent. The bank's generally strong profitability has eroded, and returns on equity and assets failed to meet the industry benchmarks of 10% and 1%, respectively, for the first time in a while. Furthermore, while most other banks saw revenue increases over the past year, Wells Fargo was an outlier with a 2% revenue drop. As a result of the scandals plaguing the bank, Wells Fargo has dramatically underperformed the rest of the banking sector, and Bank of America in particular. Since the beginning of September 2016, before news of the fake-accounts scandal broke, Bank of America has risen by 76%, while Wells Fargo is up by a comparably dismal 12%. WFC data by YCharts My preferred metric for evaluating the valuations of bank stocks is the price-to-tangible book value (P/TBV) ratio. However, this doesn't tell the entire story. The P/TBV ratio should be considered in combination with other factors, such as how profitable the bank is, to determine whether the stock is cheap or expensive. With that in mind, here are some of the key metrics for both banks. Bank Recent Stock Price Tangible Book Value P/TBV Return on Assets (ROA) Return on Equity (ROE) Bank of America $27.64 $17.23 1.60 0.98% 8.1% Wells Fargo $55.57 $28.21 1.97 0.94% 9.1% Data source: Stock prices from TD Ameritrade as of 11/28/17. All other metrics calculated using company financials as of 9/30/17. The takeaway from the chart in the previous section is that even though Bank of America's stock has dramatically outperformed Wells Fargo over the past year and a half or so, Wells Fargo still trades for a premium valuation. That used to make sense -- after all, Wells Fargo had been the most profitable of the big four banks consistently for some time. WFC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts ","
      
    Better Buy: Wells Fargo & Company vs. Bank of America -- The Motley Fool

Eric Volkman,12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has fallen out of favor among investors. One of the ""big four"" incumbent U.S. banks, the company has recently been dogged by scandal and dinged by fundamental under-performance. Just see how it's done compared to the other big banks: For many years, one of Wells Fargo's most enthusiastic bulls has been Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B) Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett. But is he morphing into a bear? Berkshire has trimmed its stake in the bank for two quarters in a row. Maybe that portends Buffett's eventual abandonment of his once beloved investment. Image source: Wells Fargo. According to Berkshire's latest 13-F regulatory filing, its Wells Fargo stake weighs in at over 464 million shares, or 9.4% of the company. This massive pile makes Berkshire the bank's top stockholder. Regulatory filings reveal that before the two rounds of sales Berkshire owned just under 480 million shares. So, all told, the company shed only 3% of its existing stake. After making the first, larger sell-off -- and promising a subsequent smaller one --  the company released a statement in April saying"" ""These sales are not being made because of investment or valuation considerations. Rather they are solely motivated by the desire to return to a percentage ownership below ... 10%."" Berkshire added that, ""the commitments that would be required of us by the Federal Reserve to retain ownership of 10% or more of Wells Fargo's outstanding common stock would materially restrict our commercial activity with Wells Fargo."" In other words, Berkshire has no desire to change the nature of the relationship with the company. This clearly isn't a hard-and-fast principle, as Berkshire holds over 17% in another major financial company, American Express (NYSE: AXP). And, similar to American Express, Buffett personally continues to support Wells Fargo and its management. Last month, he said bluntly of the current CEO that ""Tim Sloan has my faith."" When the first of Wells Fargo's apparently rolling set of scandals broke in November 2016, Buffett acknowledged the poor decisions the bank had made. Still, he maintained his support for it, describing Wells Fargo in an interview as an ""incredible institution."" Of course, anyone who's bought so deeply into a company has a vested interest in saying positive things about it publicly. After American Express lost a long-standing sweetheart deal it had with Costco Wholesale earlier this decade, Buffett continued to talk up the credit card giant's business and its management team. But Berkshire and Buffett tend to be fairly straightforward about their reasons for buying, selling, and holding stocks, one of the many refreshing things about them. For example, in the latest of Berkshire's famous annual letters to its shareholders, the legendary investor candidly admitted making a disastrous $434 million investment in a shoe company. Finally, Berkshire is an extreme example of a buy-and-hold portfolio investor. Just look at American Express -- the company began investing in the credit card incumbent way back in 1964. Through several recessions, market share crashes, and the ugly divorce from Costco, it has held on tight. Similarly, the scandals and underperformance at Wells Fargo probably aren't enough to drive it away from its long-term holding in the bank. So I buy Berkshire's explanation that it's shedding Wells Fargo stock so as not to complicate its relationship with the bank. The modest 3% sell-off also supports this assertion. Although we might see more small-scale divestments of the stake, I'd wager that Berkshire will maintain nearly all of it. The indications we have suggest that Buffett hasn't lost his faith in the bank, at least not enough for a major sell-off. ","
      
    Why Warren Buffett Sold Some Wells Fargo Stock -- The Motley Fool

Rich Duprey,12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When looking at the investment opportunities found in tobacco giants Altria (NYSE:MO), British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI), and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), it's really not a fair comparison. Altria and Philip Morris are more of a two-fer. Until 2008, they were parent and subsidiary, and the subsequent spinoff made them separate entities. Altria would sell in the U.S.; Philip Morris would sell everywhere else in the world. But in 2013, they started collaborating on reduced-risk products, with Altria giving Philip Morris the right to sell its NuMark e-vapor products outside of the U.S. in exchange for being able to sell two of Philip Morris's heated tobacco products in the U.S. Two years later they agreed to develop e-vapor products together to sell in the U.S., and that's leading to the proposed commercialization of Philip Morris iQOS heat-not-burn (HNB) electronic cigarette that is being marketed elsewhere in the world under Altria's Marlboro brand as HeatSticks. By joining forces, as it were, they may just make themselves formidable adversaries in the marketplace, and a potent combination in your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. Because of industry consolidation, British American Tobacco is a heavyweight in its own right, and owns both Reynolds American and Lorillard as Reynolds had previously acquired it. So British American is no shrinking violet in the tobacco world. In fact, it is the largest tobacco company in the world by revenue and profit, and is also the world's largest vapor (e-cigarette) manufacturer. Yet Altria owns the No. 1 brand, Marlboro, which has been the best-selling cigarette brand in the U.S. for over 40 years. Not coincidentally, Philip Morris declares Marlboro to also be ""the world's best-selling international cigarette"" and says it represents almost 10% of the cigarette market outside of the U.S. And while Altria owns nearly 51% of the U.S. cigarette market, over 43% of it comes from Marlboro alone. The brand also accounted for approximately 35% of Philip Morris International's total shipment volume in 2016, and because it has a number of other brands that support Marlboro's heft, Philip Morris owns at least a 15% share of the cigarette market in over 100 different countries. Their collaboration could also result in Altria gaining even greater share in the domestic electronic cigarette market. Image source: Philip Morris International. As the number of smokers declines in the U.S. and around the world, many are using e-cigarettes in their place. Philip Morris has an application before the FDA to allow it to commercialize its iQOS heat-not-burn electronic cigarette while also working to have it garner a reduced-risk designation. If that effort is successful, Altria will gain a big competitive advantage over others on the market without such a designation. Still, it's not a guaranteed win, and right now others hold a dominant position in the U.S. e-cigarette market. Reynolds owns what was once the leading e-cigarette on the market with its Vuse product, but analysts at Wells Fargo say that JUUL Labs' Juul device now leads with a 32.9% share as sales surged 35%. Vuse has slowly been losing share to competitors, but it still holds a large stake with a 27.4% share, far better than Altria's third-place showing at 15.2% with its NuMark MarkTen XL device. Imperial Brands blu eCig once owned nearly half the e-cigarette market when it was owned by Lorillard, but today its share has shriveled to around 11%, though that still puts it ahead of  Japan Tobacco's Logic e-cigarette with a 7% share. So to say which cigarette company would be the best buy, an investor could easily choose between Altria and Philip Morris and be satisfied, because they're pretty much getting two investments in one. In combustible cigarettes, for all the loss of smokers, Marlboro still holds a commanding lead in the U.S. and abroad, while in the still-developing next-gen electronic cigarette market, the iQOS could be the next big development. While British American Tobacco has its own top-selling glo device that operates on heat-not-burn technology, too, the massive rollout Philip Morris has set for iQOS makes it the better choice from an investment perspective. There's also one more thing that makes Altria or Phillip Morris the better investment: persistent rumors that PMI will acquire its one-time parent. That will officially roll the two companies into one and make an investment in either an investment in both. So it's a toss-up between Altria and Philip Morris International as the best buy.

    Better Buy: Philip Morris, British American Tobacco, or Altria? -- The Motley Fool

Jason Hall,12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Surprisingly enough, a huge portion of that value is derived from a very small group of companies. Of the thousands of publicly traded companies operating today, the 30 largest ones are worth almost $10 trillion -- about one-third of the entire market's value. Here is a closer look at each of the 30 biggest companies on the stock market. (Note: All market data as of Nov. 30, 2017.) Apple's iPhone X is just the latest tech marvel from the world's most valuable -- and profitable -- company. Image source: Apple. With a market capitalization of $868.8 billion, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has made for one of the greatest investing stories in history. And not once, but twice. Founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976, the early success of its Apple I, Apple II, and Macintosh computers made it a huge financial success for anyone who invested in the company after its 1980 IPO. But a number of challenges and a power struggle led to the departure of Jobs in 1985. After years of steady loss of market share to another company on this list, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple brought Jobs back in 1997, when the company was on the brink of failure. Following his return, Apple went on to develop the iMac, iPod (and subsequently iTunes), and the product that has made it the most valuable public company on Earth: the iPhone in 2007. The company is on track to ship 30 million of its new iPhone X smartphones in the current quarter. Given their price of $999 to $1,149 each, the company should command more than $30 billion in sales this quarter from this single product. Image source: Google. The parent company of Google, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), is worth $720.8 billion. But unlike Apple, which makes a living selling high-end tech devices, Alphabet doesn't charge its users much or anything at all for most of its services. YouTube, Google search, Gmail, Google Drive cloud storage, and Documents productivity software are all free at their basic levels, while some premium services -- like additional storage and ad-free content on YouTube -- are available for a modest fee. And Alphabet uses those massive profits to invest in even more innovation. The company is a leader in self-driving vehicle technology, clean energy, and connecting more of the world to the internet. Image source: Microsoft. Like Apple, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) played a big role in the advent of affordable personal computing. But while Apple developed a fully integrated software and hardware system, Microsoft is all about software. It also was a big reason why Apple lost the home PC wars in the late 1980s, while Microsoft, with its ""Wintel"" duopoly with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) (which is also on this list) went on to command virtually the entire personal computer market for decades. However, Microsoft has all but missed out on the smartphone revolution, with its Windows Phone never really garnering much commercial success. However, this lack of success with handheld devices hasn't kept Big Softy from being wildly profitable and still a growth company. After all, the company's operating systems and other software are still critically important to running the infrastructure that powers much of the world's computing power. Microsoft has become a major player in cloud computing, a huge growth market. The company increased its market share last year, growing segment revenue 14% to $7 billion last quarter alone. Microsoft may have lost out to Apple in mobile computing, but it's not going to miss out on the cloud. Image source: Getty Images. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of few companies to emerge from the late 1990s tech bubble a success. And with a market cap of $560 billion, it easily qualifies as the biggest. Started by Jeff Bezos as an online bookstore, Amazon sells just about everything today, and tens of millions of people subscribe to its Prime membership program for free shipping, free TV, and free movie streaming. Prime members count on Amazon as their first -- and often only -- stop for online shopping. The company's sales are growing strongly: Last quarter alone, revenue was up 34% to $44 billion. E-commerce isn't the only nascent industry Amazon is dominating, either. Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is the company's cloud computing provider, and Amazon commands substantial market share in this space as one of the lowest-cost providers. Last quarter, AWS generated almost $1.2 billion in operating income for Amazon, and it's set for potentially years of growth to come. Image source: Getty Images. The dominant social media platform, Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), is worth $508.9 billion. Founded by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and several other Harvard students in 2004, it was initially available only to fellow Harvard classmates and then a few other colleges. More than 26% of humanity regularly uses Facebook. That's a stunning figure, but it also means about three-fourths of us don't. Facebook's management would tell you that's room for growth. Image source: The Motley Fool. Led by legendary investor and CEO Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) is worth $468.4 billion. Since Buffett took over the company 50 years ago -- it was a struggling textile manufacturer at the time -- and converted it into a holding company for his various other investments, Berkshire has created enormous wealth for tens of thousands of shareholders. Today, Berkshire is a sprawling conglomerate, with subsidiaries engaged in insurance, railways, candy making, manufacturing, electricity production, and too many other businesses to name here. Much of Berkshire's value also owes to its stock portfolio, which includes a number of the other companies on this list. At last count, Berkshire's stock holdings were worth about $180 billion, an amount that's likely to grow for years to come. Alibaba founder and chairman Jack Ma. Image source: Alibabagroup.com. Alibaba Group has rocketed up the top 30 list on expectations that its growth is just getting started. This year, the stock price has climbed 90%, even after a recent 9% drop. With China's middle class on track to crack 500 million people within a few years, Alibaba's best days could well be ahead. Image source: Johnson & Johnson. More than 130 years after its founding, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is still one of the biggest innovators in the healthcare industry, as reflected by its $375 million market value. Best-known for consumer brands including Band-Aid and Tylenol, the healthcare giant is also a major medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturer. Last quarter, its pharmaceutical segment generated almost half of sales, while medical devices were worth twice as much revenue as the consumer-goods segment. Looking ahead, JNJ's management is banking on the need for more healthcare spending as a significant portion of the world's population gets older. Life expectancies are increasing, but it will require significant medical support to care for a growing aging population. Even after 130 years of success, the company's future still looks bright. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has its roots as far back as 1799, with the founding of one of its predecessors, the Bank of the Manhattan Company. After dozens of acquisitions and mergers in the many years since, today's JPMorgan Chase is America's biggest bank, and one of the world's largest by total assets. It's worth $360 million at recent share prices. Since the Great Recession, JPMorgan Chase, under the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon, has built up a fortress-like balance sheet and developed some of the most conservative lending practices in the industry. So, even as one of the biggest banks out there, it is also considered one of the safest for investors to own. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $348.6 billion, ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is similar to JPMorgan Chase in that it's a product of numerous acquisitions and mergers over the years. It also has its roots in the early days of the American oil industry, directly descended from multiple companies that were part of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil. A true integrated ""supermajor,"" ExxonMobil participates in every aspect of the oil and gas value chain, including exploration and production, distribution, refining and chemical manufacturing, and selling refined products. Last quarter, this generated $66 billion in sales and $4 billion in profits -- better than recent quarters thanks to higher oil prices. But at the same time, there are growing concerns that the advent of cheaper renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles will start making fossil fuels irrelevant sooner than many expect. Image source: Bank of America. With a market cap of $295.7 billion, Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) is second to JPMorgan Chase among the most valuable U.S. banks. It's also the nation's second-biggest bank by assets as well. Unlike many of its megabank peers, Bank of America's roots aren't in New York: The company started with the founding of the Bank of Italy in San Francisco in 1904 to serve the large immigrant community in the city, which faced discrimination by other banks at the time. By the late 1920s, Bank of Italy was renamed Bank of America and Italy, and it would merge with another California-based bank named -- you guessed it -- Bank of America. Now headquartered in North Carolina, B of A was one of the banks hit hardest by the financial crisis, with two major acquisitions -- Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch -- leading to billions of dollars in losses, as well as tens of billions in fines and penalties related to Countrywide's mortgage practices. But today, Bank of America has emerged strong and profitable under the solid leadership of CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source: Wal-Mart stores. Even as e-commerce becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the pie, brick-and-mortar behemoth Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) remains a retail giant, with a market cap of $289.8 billion. Founded by Sam Walton in the early 1960s, Wal-Mart now operates more than 11,600 stores, it sold $486 billion in merchandise last year, and it employs 2.3 million people around the world. And don't count the discount retailer out of the retail future, either. The company has aggressively invested in growing its e-commerce business, and it's paying off. Last quarter, Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales increased 50%, helping drive total sales up 4.2%. The ""death of retail"" may be grossly exaggerated, at least when it comes to Wal-Mart. Image source: Wells Fargo. The third bank to make the first half of our top 30, Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) makes the list at $279.3 billion. Founded in 1852 in San Francisco early during the gold rush, it not only offered banking services, but also express service to deliver gold and other valuables quickly. And while the modern Wells Fargo is the product -- like almost every big bank -- of numerous mergers and acquisitions over the years, its success has generally been a product of conservative management and lending practices that have kept it out of trouble during the numerous banking crises over the past 150-plus years. But that story may be changing. More recently, Wells' results have trailed its peers' as the effects of the fake accounts scandal play out. Last quarter, Wells was the only big bank to report a decline in its revenue, and it also saw earnings per share fall more than 10% from the year-ago quarter. In short, there's evidence that customers are avoiding Wells, and choosing instead to bank with its competitors. Over time, it's likely that this will change as long as the company can get its act together. But in the meantime, its tarnished reputation is hurting its bottom line. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $271.9 billion, Royal Dutch Shell plc (ADR) (NYSE:RDS-A)(NYSE:RDS-B) is the second-most valuable public energy company on the U.S. market, behind only ExxonMobil. Also like ExxonMobil, Shell is an integrated supermajor, engaging in the full range of oil and gas industry businesses. But Shell is a bit different from ExxonMobil in its strategy. Following its acquisition of BG Group in 2016, management launched a strategic shift toward natural gas, where it sees greater long-term demand growth versus oil. The company has also made reducing debt -- which ballooned to over $95 billion at the peak -- and expenses a priority, as well as taking steps to increase the return on its investments. Shell has only just begun chipping away at its debt, but over the past year, profits and cash flows have surged on improved operating results, as well as higher oil prices. Shell is still exposed to many of the same risks as ExxonMobil when it comes to disruption from renewables, but that's one of the reasons management has prioritized natural gas, which produces fewer emissions and serves more industrial uses than oil. Image source: Visa. It may surprise you to know that electronic payments network giant Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), with a market cap of $249.8 billion, has only been a public company for about 10 years. Started in 1958 as part of Bank of America and called BankAmericard, it would not become a separate company until 1970, and even then, it was largely under the control of the many banks that issued BankAmericards. In 1968, it would formally change its name -- and the name of the cards issued on its network -- to Visa, but it would remain privately held until finally going public in March 2008. Visa's IPO, which was for half of the company's shares, raised $19.1 billion, making it the biggest-ever IPO at the time. Even with its massive size, Visa still has strong growth prospects. Electronic payments are only a small fraction of global transactions, but that's quickly changing as mobile computing and the global middle class converge. As a trusted name that merchants, financial institutions, and customers all count on, Visa is positioned for many more years of growth. Image source: Procter & Gamble. With a market cap of $226.8 billion, Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE:PG) is one of the most valuable makers of branded consumer products in the world. There's a  good chance you have at least one P&G product in your home right now -- and more likely several. The company's most recognizable brands include Bounty, Crest, Gillette, Pampers, Tide, and Vicks, but that's just a handful of the more than 60 brands the company makes and sells in over 180 countries. Founded in 1837, the company has spent the past 180 years developing and acquiring products that people use in their daily lives, many of which were major innovations at the time. More recently, the company has struggled to grow, having already expanded into just about every global market, and also facing stiff competition in many of its core segments. This has led management to streamline its brands and focus more intently on its most important businesses. Since 2013, the company has reduced its brand portfolio by more than half. Sales have fallen almost $15 billion since then, but earnings have improved since bottoming out in 2015. This is helping the company continue its track record of dividend growth. P&G has increased its dividend annually for 61 straight years. Image source: Anheuser-Busch Inbev. Image source: Getty Images. The biggest and most valuable telecommunications company on the U.S. market, AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is worth $224 billion. When Alexander Graham Bell founded AT&T in 1885, he probably didn't have any idea how much his company would transform over the next 130 years, while also staying remarkably the same. AT&T is still the largest provider of fixed-line telephone access in the U.S., but it's also the second-largest cellphone cellphone service provider, and the largest pay-TV operator in the U.S., through its U-Verse cable and DirecTV satellite subsidiaries. The company is looking to get even bigger, with a pending acquisition for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) in the works. However, the U.S. Department of Justice is threatening to sue over the proposed acquisition, creating some uncertainty (and a lot of drama thanks to the political implications). Image source: Getty Images. The third integrated super-major on this list, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is worth $222.6 billion. The company's roots go all the way back to 1879, with the founding of Pacific Coast Oil Co. in San Francisco and developing some of the state's earliest oil discoveries in Southern California. Coast oil would be acquired by Standard Oil in 1900 and consolidate its operations and take the Standard name in 1906. In 1911, it once again became a separate company when the federal government's antitrust suit led to the breakup of Rockefeller's Standard Oil behemoth. Following decades of growth and expansion both in the U.S. and abroad, the company finally changed its name to Chevron in 1977 as part of its move to merge six domestic operations into one. Today, Chevron is solidly profitable, but its earnings and cash flows are still far below its historical levels, as it just isn't getting the same kinds of returns on its investments at recent oil prices. However, its results have improved over the past year as oil prices have risen. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $216 billion, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) is the second-most valuable healthcare company and the most valuable health insurer and managed care provider in the United States. Founded in 1974 as Charter Med Incorporated, UnitedHealthCare Corporation was created in 1977 as the parent company and taken public in 1984. In the 40 years since its founding, the Minnesota-based healthcare giant has steadily grown by expanding into new markets and acquiring companies in markets it wanted to enter. It also expanded its services to include prescription management and mail-order services, among others. At last count, the company insures 49 million people, and it generated more than $50 billion in revenue and $4.1 billion in operating income in its most recent quarter. Image source: Pfizer. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is the third-most valuable healthcare company on this list, with a $215.8 billion market cap. Founded by Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart in New York City in 1849, Pfizer found early success as a so-called ""fine chemicals"" maker for most of the first century of its existence. In the early 1950s, Pfizer scientists would discover and develop the antibiotic Terramycin, one of the first steps that began shifting its focus to research and development of pharmaceuticals. Over the past couple of decades, Pfizer has largely grown via acquisition of competitors including Warner-Lambert in 2000 and Wyeth in 2009, both of which have produced mixed results. Going forward, management continues to consider acquisitions to help augment its in-house R&D pipeline for new medicines. Image source: Roche. The third healthcare company in a row on this list, Switzerland-based Roche Holding Ltd. (ADR) (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY), is worth $214.5 billion. Founded in 1986 by young entrepreneur Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, Roche's roots are in the industrial manufacture of medicines. Fast-forward 130 years, and Roche is one of the leading biotechnology companies in the pharmaceutical industry, with a major pipeline of potential cancer treatments, including immunotherapies. Roche is also one of the biggest R&D spenders in the healthcare space, having spent nearly $9 billion to develop new medicines and treatments last year alone. Image source: Getty Images. With nearly 875 million subscribers on its network, China Mobile Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:CHL) is easily one of the world's biggest wireless providers, and it's worth $208.9 billion. One would expect it to carry a higher value, perhaps, due to its size and potential for growth. However, China Mobile -- and its biggest competitors -- are pretty much controlled by the Chinese government, which heavily regulates the wireless market in the country. Even with that reality, China Mobile is likely to grow in value as China's middle class continues to expand and mobile use becomes more prevalent. Mobile data consumption is also likely to increase across both consumer and business customers in the coming years, and that could be a catalyst for further growth for the Chinese wireless giant. Image source: Getty Images. Founded in 1979 with the opening of two stores in metro Atlanta, Home Depot Inc. (NYSE:HD) is worth $207 billion, only trailing Wal-Mart for U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers in market value. It's also very different from Wal-Mart and other general merchandise retailers, with many of the products it sells being highly resistant to infringement from e-commerce. This includes products like lumber, which carpenters and builders often prefer to hand select, as well as items customers want to choose in person, such as tile, flooring, paint, cabinets, fixtures, and other big-ticket items you have to live with every day. It's certainly played out that way. While many other big-box retailers struggle just to keep the doors open, Home Depot's sales have increased 6% so far this year, and earnings are on track to grow 14%. Image source: Intel. The other half of the ""Wintel"" duopoly with Microsoft that dominated personal computing for more than two decades, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was founded in 1968 and is worth $205.7 billion today, making it the the most valuable stand-alone semiconductor manufacturer in the world. Also like Microsoft, Intel has had middling success in mobile computing while remaining incredibly strong in the data centers that drive cloud computing and corporate infrastructures. However, there's some concern that the company's fortress-like competitive position in the data center could be weakening. If that proves to be true, and competitors start taking market share, that would seriously crimp Intel's future prospects. But with a half-century of successful innovation in microprocessors, and one of the biggest R&D budgets in the space, I wouldn't count Intel out just yet. Image source: Getty Images. Like Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:TSM) is a leader in the manufacture of microprocessors, and it has a similar market value of $204.4 billion. However, it's also a very different company, since Intel designs and develops nearly all of the processors it makes, while Taiwan Semiconductor primarily contracts with so-called ""fabless"" semiconductor designers -- companies like Apple -- to manufacture chips for them. The upside is the company doesn't have to spend nearly as much on R&D -- it spent $11 billion less than Intel over the past year -- and instead focuses on high-quality, low-cost manufacturing while its customers invest in chip design. The downside? Maintaining a competitive advantage to keep those fabless chip designers coming to you for chip fabrication. It's certainly worked well for Taiwan Semiconductor, which has seen its earnings and market value grow more than 250% over the past decade, better than Intel over the same period. Image source: Verizon. With a market cap of $203.6 billion, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is the second-biggest telecommunications company in the U.S. behind AT&T. Verizon leads the U.S. wireless market with 149 million customers, and it also has one of the biggest land-line operators. The company has also increased the size of its wireline internet business in recent years and says it now has 5.8 million customers using its Fios fiber-optic internet service. But where Verizon trails AT&T is in pay-TV subscribers, a gap that's likely to grow even wider when AT&T completes its acquisition of Time Warner. Will Verizon make an acquisition of its own to narrow the gap? It's unclear, but the company is certainly investing in next-generation wireless technology, with plans to begin testing a 5G network in 2018. Image source: Getty Images. Business software specialist Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is worth $202.4 billion. Like almost every other tech company that's been successful for many years, Oracle has spent decades out-innovating (or sometimes acquiring) its disruptors. In recent years, this has included a shift to subscription models for software -- something Oracle is still working through -- and now the company is facing stiff competition from the likes of Amazon and other cloud-computing providers. Going forward, Oracle may have to prove its mettle all over again in the ever-important enterprise database segment it has dominated for years. The early results offer promise, but it's in the very early innings as the company's customers -- almost 40% of the market for enterprise database software -- begin to compare in-house systems to cloud-hosted alternatives. Image source: Citigroup. With a market cap of $198.4 billion, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is the last bank in the top 30 and the fourth-most valuable bank behind JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. With over 200 million global customers and 219,000 employees, Citigroup does business in 160 countries around the world. With its roots in the founding of City Bank of New York in 1812, it underwent a series of name changes over the next 160 years before finally becoming Citibank in 1976. The current Citigroup was formed when Citicorp -- Citibank's holding company -- merged with Travelers Group in 1998. Citigroup was one of the hardest-hit banks during the subprime crisis and Great Recession, with its significant exposure to bad mortgages -- both directly through its lending and through its investment in collateralized debt obligations -- which led to substantial losses, and eventually required federal government intervention to keep the bank from failing. This intervention and investment essentially wiped out investors in the company. Even after a pretty big recovery in the past decade, Citigroup investors from right before the financial crisis are still down about 75%. On the other side of the coin, anyone savvy -- or lucky -- enough to have invested in the company in March of 2009 and held their shares has seen a fourfold return on their investment. Image source: Novartis. Another Swiss pharmaceutical company on the list, Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS) rounds out the top 30 with a market cap of $198.2 billion. But unlike Roche, which was founded more than a century ago, Novartis is the result of multiple corporate mergers, though several of its legacy companies do date back to the 1800s. However, Novartis is similar to Roche in several regards. The company spent $7.9 billion on pharmaceutical research and development last year, second only to Roche in pharmaceutical R&D investment. Much of that spending is on development of biologics and immunotherapies, two of the areas of medicine with the most promise for treatments with fewer side effects and better results. With expectations that the company will file for approval of five new molecules in 2018, Novartis's R&D investments seem to be paying off. ","
      
    The 30 Largest Companies on the Stock Market -- The Motley Fool

There's something very interesting going on in the stock market right now. While shares of banks and other large-cap stocks are climbing on hopes that Congress will cut the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 20%, which is in the bill passed by the Senate last Friday, shares of technology companies are dropping. Over the past week, shares of Facebook, Amazon.com, and Alphabet have dropped more than 4%. The S&P 500 is up 1.7% over the same time, with bank stocks leading the way. Shares of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) are doing especially well, up more than 9% each since the beginning of last week. BAC data by YCharts. Why the divergence? It's a good question that investors should ponder. On the one hand, it makes sense that bank stocks are up. If you look at the S&P 500, three out of the four companies on the large-cap index that pay the most in taxes are banks. JPMorgan Chase led the way over the past 12 months, setting aside $9 billion, followed by Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) at $8.7 billion, and Bank of America at $8.5 billion. The only company to pay more in taxes over the past year was Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Thanks to the incredible success of Apple's iPhone franchise, it had to pay $15.7 billion in taxes, according to data from YCharts.com. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. These three banks, in particular, pay a lot in taxes because they're among the biggest and most profitable companies in the United States. For its part, JPMorgan Chase's balance sheet weighs in at $2.6 trillion. No other U.S. company comes even close. That includes Apple, which has $375 billion in assets on its balance sheet. But it's not as if technology companies aside from Apple don't pay a lot in taxes, too. Alphabet, Google's parent company, ranks 11th on the S&P 500. Its tax bill over the past year adds up to $5 billion. Facebook is a bit further down, at $2.4 billion. And Amazon.com is at $1.2 billion. Given this, why aren't shares of these companies also rallying on the prospective corporate tax cut? An Apple store in Amsterdam. Image source: Apple. One explanation is that they may be serving as a canary in the coal mine. Recently, the head of JPMorgan Chase's investment bank warned that the market could be in for a sharp correction in the near future. If that were to happen, it would make sense that tech stocks would lead the way down, as they tend to have higher valuations than other types of stocks. This would also be consistent with the warnings from a number of other respected investors this year who have sounded an alarm about the current state of the market. For context, large-cap stocks are trading at their third-highest valuation in history, behind only 1929 and 1999. Data source: Robert Shiller. Chart by author. Here's what Howard Marks, the co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Group and one of the most respected distressed debt investors in the country, wrote in a memo to clients earlier this year: [I]t's essential to take note when sentiment (and thus market behavior) crosses into too-bullish territory, even though we know rising trends may well roll on for some time, and thus that such warnings are often premature. I think it's better to turn cautious too soon (and thus perhaps underperform for a while) rather than too late, after the downslide has begun, making it hard to trim risk, achieve exits and cut losses. Since I'm convinced ""they"" are at it again -- engaging in willing risk-taking, funding risky deals and creating risky market conditions -- it's time for yet another cautionary memo. Too soon? I hope so; we'd rather make money for our clients in the next year or two than see the kind of bust that gives rise to bargains. (We all want there to be bargains, but no one's eager to endure the price declines that create them.) Since we never know when risky behavior will bring on a market correction, I'm going to issue a warning today rather than wait until one is upon us. Sharing these concerns is Jeffrey Gundlach, co-founder and CEO of DoubleLine Capital, a hedge fund with $110 billion in assets under management: If you're waiting for the catalyst to show itself, you're going to be selling at a lower price. This is not the time period where you say, 'I can buy anything and not worry about the risk of it.' The time to do that was 18 months ago. And here's Ray Dalio, co-chairman and chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, writing in a LinkedIn post in June: Ordinarily, politics and economics influence each other with economics being more of a driver on politics than politics is on economics -- e.g., bad economic conditions normally lead to political changes -- and normally we don't need to pay much attention to politics to get the economics and markets right. However, there are times when politics becomes the most important driver. History has shown us that these times are when there is great economic, social, and political polarity within a country and there is the selection of populist leaders to fight for ""the common man"" in a battle against ""the elites."" These conditions exist now. The 1930s were the last time this happened in the developed world and globally. Is the recent decline in tech stocks like Facebook, Alphabet, and Amazon an early sign that these warnings are beginning to come to fruition? It's too early to say either way, but it's certainly something that investors should keep in the back of their minds right now. ","

Before getting into our Q1 results, I'd like to start the call by discussing the business transformation within Nutanix. You might have heard from us that we are increasingly taking a software-centric approach to go to market and financial reporting. I want to take the opportunity to zoom out and talk about the why behind our packing and distribution strategy over the last six years, and the somewhat obvious why of the future software strategy. I borrow from my annual shareholder letter to set the context. Digitization, or virtualization, as we call it, has been an unstoppable phenomenon in computing. We saw this with music, photography, shopping carts, and maps, as they all converged into pure software and as digital constructs in our consumer lives. We brought the foresight to enterprise storage and compute. And by doing so, we improved machine productivity by bringing data closer to applications, and also human productivity by breaking down artificial walls in IT departments. By standardizing on commodity hardware and a common operating system, we delivered economies of scale that were unprecedented in enterprise datacenters. But none of this would have been possible if we hadn't obsessively focused on product design. The elegance of Nutanix products is in their simplicity and in our ability to bring a consumer-grade experience to enterprise-grade systems. We are now on a path to digitizing networking, security, and effectively, the entire datacenter. This architecture, of an undifferentiated hardware running software services that then bring all the differentiation, is the only way to operate a cloud if the enterprise if the enterprise wants to stay in the business of computing. In 2011-'12, software-defined anything was too abstract for our customers to put their arms around. So, vendors were conflicted because they sold billions of dollars worth of hardware equipment that we, as disruptors, were digitizing into pure software. Our only route to market was to take control of our own destiny. The Nutanix appliance was born. We now had an iPhone-like design patent that people could touch and feel, and the channel could sell. Customers loved us for bringing the web-scale culture to them in a white box with the robust software, aided by a word-class customer service, was meaningfully more delightful than the current experience of sticking together vendors and inside teams that constantly finger-pointed at each other. Over time, as our architecture gained popularity, we relaxed our opinion of our own hardware and signed OEM relationships. We built the muscle memory on a two-hop customer service. Also in the last 18 months, we signed large ELAs in pure software, come up with your hyperscale customers running OCP-like software equipment. In the last 12 months, we ported our software to every major x86 solo vendor. IBM-powered microprocessor, ruggedized warfare servers, and even 4x4-inch Intel miniservers for the IoT edge. We now have a meaningful competitive advantage in being the most portable operating system built for the enterprise cloud. We have kept growing our total addressable market as we portered our software to all these platforms in the last three years. A software-only form factor gives us ubiquity. It also enables friction-free access of our technology to tinkerers, prospects who are at the top of the sales funnel. But the change is beyond just the product. It includes thoughtful changes to the port to cash process, sales compensation, software downloads, license management, and new tools at the top of the sales funnel. These changes also prepare us well as we embrace the subscription model next year with our Xi, spelled X-I, Cloud Services. The company that is obsessed with an iPhone-like motif is ready to institutionalize a pure software version of its operating system. And all that without compromising customer experience and without being negligent about the boundary at which hardware and software meet. Shifting gears to product, over the past two years, we've built a multi-product portfolio. We have built our own hypervisor AHV, which has consistently grown in market share quarter over quarter. We introduced AFS, a software-only scale-out filer to remove yet another hardware silo from enterprise datacenters. We added Prism Pro and Calm for operations management and model-driven automation, respectively. At a recent .NEXT Europe customer conference in Nice, France, we continued this innovation with the announcement of the Acropolis Object Storage Service, Acropolis Compute Cloud, and Nutanix App Marketplace. These services, which will be included with our software, help our customers run a growing set of cloud native applications. Acropolis Object Storage Service supports the growing number of applications with large unstructured data, and enables application development teams to consume storage as a high performance, on demand service, similar to public cloud offerings. Complementing Object Storage Service is our new AHV-based compute service, the Acropolis Compute Cloud. This new capability will help enable the enterprise customers to economically scale compute resources to better support applications like distributed analytics workloads, large-scale frontend web services, Citrix XenApp deployments, and other CPU-intensive workloads. Finally, on Nutanix Calm, spelled as C-A-L-M, we announced the addition of the app marketplace. This new marketplace service empowers IT teams to rapidly deploy fully validated applications via self-service portals, so new workloads can be deployed quickly and easily. Xi continues to be on track for a mid-2018 release. We are making meaningful process with Google on the go to market and deployment strategies around the world. On a related note, the bare metal as a service offering from the public cloud providers is a very promising breakthrough for our cloud OS, as we explore even more ubiquity for our software. Through APIs, automation, and digital delivery, bare metal in the cloud even further commoditizes the commodity server. Alliance partnerships move from business relationships to developer relationships, aided by SDKs and APIs. The next few years will be exciting in our cloud OS journey, as we forge deeper alliances with new hardware partners in the cloud. At .NEXT, one of our most intriguing announcements was a remote IoT Edge. We laid the foundation of the IoT edge with our 4x4 miniserver form factor port and Prism Pro software. Beyond providing an invisible IoT infrastructure, we are building an event-based method bus application that manages data between the Edge and the cloud core. Both object storage and this IoT data service are early forays into building platform services for developers beyond traditional infrastructure for IT operators. Consumer cloud operators like Amazon and Facebook have leveraged a lot of open source to their competitive advantage. Similarly, in the last eight years, they embraced Linux to build an elegantly simple yet enterprise-grade hypervisor and network virtualization, and also NoSQL databases to build the core metadata services of our operating system. 2018-'19 will be years when we embrace open-source Apache Software Foundation services even further to deliver consume- grade developer building blocks in Xi. Linking these building blocks into hybrid services is our big bet around the future of cloud. The true north for us is to provide a common IT experience in a hybrid cloud world, and we try to blur the line between owning and renting computing. Shifting to some Q1 KPIs now, last quarter, I shared the progress we have made in signing large deals. We continued our large deal momentum with 478 customers that have purchased in excess of $1 million lifetime to date, up 74 in the first quarter, and they have collectively spent nearly $1.4 billion with us in lifetime bookings. Additionally, we have 206 customers that have purchased over $2 million, up 40 from last quarter; 47 customers that have purchased over $5 million; and 16 customers that have purchased $10 million with us lifetime to date. As we have shared in the past, customers are increasingly trusting us with their most machine critical workloads. Our top three deals in Q1 were all in the federal vertical, and together comprise more than $15 million in billings. In two of those engagements, the customer went all in with AHV, our hypervisor, choosing to standardize on our built-in hypervisor or other virtualization offerings. The first customer, which is the largest revenue generating civilian agency in the federal government, selected Nutanix because of the inherent security and rapid time-to-value our platform provides. This customer will take advantage of our Prism Pro software edition, benefiting from reduced complexity and costs for operations and management. The other customer, a unit within the United States Armed Forces, which handles day-to-day operations around the globe, will use the Nutanix platform to support facilities that provide recreational and educational opportunities to the children and youth soldiers and U.S. Armed Forces civilians stationed at bases in both the U.S. and abroad. This quarter also saw great momentum in the healthcare vertical, with seven deals greater than $1 million. One such deal was with Baylor Scott & White Health, another existing customer that is using our platform to host Epic, its electronic health record system, and power its DNA sequencing environment. In fact, using the Nutanix solution, Baylor Scott & White Health has been able to process DNA sequencing results five times faster and at greater volume than its previous solution. Another great used case in the health services space is with an S&P 500 company that operates one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the world. The company is replacing its legacy of three-tier infrastructure with Nutanix, using our platform to run a host of different workloads, including powering the lab tests for a popular privately held personal genomics and biotechnology company. Outside of the healthcare and federal verticals, a leading entertainment provider with 17 facilities, including casinos, hotels, and show theaters, uses our platform to support its value gaining management software. To give some context on that workload, when the gaming management system goes down, the casino stops running and customers leave. It's the company's moneymaker, and they trust this mission-critical application to Nutanix. Another customer, an international group active in the design, manufacturing, and sale of watches, jewelry, and watch components, which had previously committed to a VMware-centric strategy, selected our platform because of its easy to use and simplified management console. In this quarter, we continue to see customers refocusing their infrastructure strategies away from public cloud-only ambitions. One such customer, a leading provider of device insurance, warranty, and support services for cellphones, consumer electronics, and home appliances, began adding a variety of machine-critical workloads to our platform after a yearlong focus on evaluating and testing AWS. Cost, service-level agreements, and security concerns were among the contributing factors for the shift. We saw robust demand for our software upsells, including Prism Pro and our ultimate software license. In Q1, Prism Pro adoption increased by 40% quarter-over-quarter. We also had 16 Prism Pro deals in excess of $100,000, including the previously mentioned largest revenue generating civilian agency in the federal government, which is one of our largest deals this quarter. Another customer a Fortune 100 multinational company that produces a variety of commercial engineering, aerospace, and consumer products continues to standardize the Nutanix software, including adding Prism Pro to their 300-plus Nutanix nodes so that they can execute proactive capacity planning to lower operation costs and reduce risk. This customer continues to invest in and rely on the Nutanix enterprise cloud platform across their enterprise, inclusive of mission-critical applications such as ERP and PLM. One win of particular interest is with the Department of Defense Agency. This software-only deal, coupled with our software with hardware from a partner, Klas Telecom, K-L-A-S Telecom, in order to deliver a ruggedized hyper convert solution that is roughly the same size as airline carry-on luggage. This agency plans to deploy these ruggedized Nutanix appliances across its field teams, who will operate the units on battery power to maintain communications and other critical applications in war zones. In closing, I'm very pleased with how the company is evolving toward its next act. Lou Attanasio, our new Chief Revenue Officer, will play a pivotal role in our transformation to software as he leads our growing sales force and a journey that blurs the lines between owning and renting computing. This now allows Sudhish Nair, our President, to focus on strategic partnerships -- importantly, Xi and its developer-oriented services, and our largest of the large customers. I sincerely believe that we now have a dream team to do justice to our mission. With that, I'll turn the call over to Duston to discuss our strong Q1 financial performance. Duston? Thank you, Dheeraj. I'm pleased that our Q1 results came in a bit better than expected, primarily driven by a solid quarter in our federal vertical. And as a reminder, we adopted ASC 606 beginning this quarter, and our results are reported under this new method of revenue recognition. Revenue for the quarter was $276 million, growing 46% from a year ago and up 9% from the previous quarter. We built $315 million in the quarter, representing a 32% increase from a year ago and a 9% increase from Q4. Our performance in our geographic regions were essentially in line with what we would expect for the first quarter of our fiscal year. As expected, our OEM business, although with approximately 10% of bookings, waned a bit from the very high level we experienced in Q4. On the upside, we saw good performance in our federal business, as well as continued strength in the APAC region. This strength was somewhat offset by seasonal declines in our North American commercial and EMEA businesses. Once again, we were pleased to see the number of large deals in Q1 keep pace with the strong levels we experienced in Q4. We booked 15 greater than $2 million deals in the quarter, and that was consistent with our strong Q4 performance. Bookings from our international regions were 37% in Q1 '18, up from 34% in Q1 '17. Our gross margin for the quarter was 61.9%, which was higher than our guidance and compares to 65.4% in the year ago quarter and 62.6% in the prior quarter. The Q1 '18 gross margins benefited by approximately 1.5 percentage points as we purposely eliminated more than 9% of revenue attributable to our pass-through hardware revenue. Our operating expenses were $193 million, below our guidance by $7 million, primarily due to timing of new hires and other personnel-related expenses. Our non-GAAP net loss was $25 million, or a loss of $0.16 per basic share. Before I review the balance sheet highlights and our Q2 guidance, this is a good time to take a step back for a high-level discussion on how we see our business model evolving over the next several years. Today, we are software company -- more specifically, an enterprise cloud operating systems company, that up until now has delivered a majority of its software via its own branded appliance and recognized the associated hardware revenue. This approach made sense at the beginning, as it allowed us to stand tall among our competitors in an emerging market, while at same time allowing us to build out a direct sales force and brand for what was early on an unknown company. It was this very same approach that yielded 60% gross margins, despite our significant software content, and which inadvertently disguised the true nature of the company. This left many investors wondering if we were really a software company or just another storage or appliance company. And despite our best efforts to establish Nutanix as a software company, in the minds of many investors, you simply are what your margins say you are. Going forward over time, Nutanix will emerge as exactly what it is, an enterprise cloud operating systems company. In conjunction with this, investors should expect the following to occur over the next few years. First, we will begin the migration away from pass-through hardware-related revenue. Beginning last quarter, we started the gradual migration away from recognizing pass-through revenue attributed to the hardware portion of our business. Today, the hardware portion of our business is approximately 26% of our total billings. This transition will come in two parts -- first, with straightforward changes that will allow us to step aside for most hardware-only invoicing by enabling our legacy appliance manufactures to begin selling the NX hardware directly to our distributors; and secondly, by simply focusing on more software-only transactions, allowing our customers to then choose to run on a large number of server platforms. It is important to know that stepping aside from this pass-through hardware does not in any way infer that customers are not ordering NX appliances. To be very clear, our customers' choices and experiences will remain the same. We expect this transition to take a year or so, and result in the elimination of at least 80% of all pass-through hardware-related revenue. All things being equal, the direct impact of this specific change would result in significantly higher software content and significantly higher gross margins, with no change to our growth and gross profit dollars. Probably the most important point to make here is that this change will have absolutely no impact to our future growth rates of our software and support billings, that being the portion of our business today that represents 74% of our billings. Over time, we would also hope to gain additional selling leverage that naturally comes from focusing on software-only transactions. The next modification in our business you should expect will be a gradual shift to ratable Software-as-a-Service revenue. Once our Xi Cloud Service offering takes hold, starting with services such as disaster recovery, we expect to see the emergence of some ratably recognized Software-as-a-Service revenue. And lastly, over time, we will start to position the Company for increasing ratable Software-as-a-Subscription revenue. Although not immediate and not yet quantifiable, with the introduction of both our Xi Cloud Services and Nutanix Calm, we believe we have the option to convert some of our perpetual and term-based software streams into ratably recognized subscription software. To help incentivize and expedite this transformation, starting February 1, 2018, our fiscal Q3 '18, we will start the process of compensating our sales teams on software-only related bookings. Once the change is fully implemented, sales representatives will no longer be compensated for pass-through hardware sales. To summarize, this transformation of our business will take place methodically over an extended period of time. The first phase will result more perpetual and term-based software as we begin to significantly reduce our pass-through hardware revenue. We then expect to see the emergence of ratable services revenue, followed by a gradual shift to more ratable subscription revenue over time. As we start to shift away from pass-through hardware revenue, we will also take this opportunity to change how we report the software content of our business. The previous methodology had us reporting software as a percentage of total bookings, with the software content comprised of OEM licenses, upsell of our addition software, and other miscellaneous software sales. What this methodology excluded was the significant software content attributable to the base operating system that was bundled into the appliance sale. Going forward, we will add the software content attributable to our base operating system into the total software metrics. The base operating system is simply calculated by taking the total billings attributable to the appliance sale, less the billings of the actual cost of the hardware. As we increasingly separate ourselves from the hardware sales, the related revenue and cost of goods sold would be eliminated in equal amounts, this amount representing the actual cost of the hardware. Under this new software-centric reporting, based on billings for Q1 2018, the splits of the business would be as follows: software and support, 74% of total billings, and hardware, 26%. It is this 26% attributable to the pass-through hardware that will mostly be eliminated overtime. We would encourage you to review the Q1 Nutanix Investor Deck located in the Investor Relations section of the corporate website for further details surrounding this new software-centric reporting and the associated historical breakouts. So, in summary, what would Nutanix have looked like over the last 12 months, if we chose not to build any pass-through hardware-related transactions? The resulting business would have been very interesting, basically yielding an $800 million pure software and support infrastructure company with gross margins above 80%, while at the same time being a market leader within $100 billion TAM. That's what Nutanix would have looked like over the past 12 months, void of any pass-through hardware billings. This level of size, growth, and gross margins compares very favorably to other software and service companies such as Splunk, Lassian, Tableau, and others. Now, let's turn to the balance sheet for a few highlights. We closed the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $366 million, up from $349 million in Q4 DSOs on a straight average with 57 days. That was eight days lower than the 65 days reported in the prior quarter. The weighted average DSO was 27 days in Q1. We generated $10 million of cash from operations in Q1, which was negatively impacted by $8 million of ESPP funding. We used $8 million in free cash flow during the quarter, and this was also negatively impacted by the $8 million of ESPP funding. Now, onto the guidance for the second quarter. The guidance on a non-GAAP basis is as follows. Revenue to be between $280 million and $285 million, gross margins between 62.5% and 63.5%. This revenue and gross margin guidance is expected to yield approximately $178 million gross profit dollars, versus the current Q2 gross profit consensus of about 173 million. Operating expenses of approximately $210 million and a per share loss of $0.20 to $0.22 using the weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 161 million shares. This guidance assumes that we will eliminate approximately $12 million or 15% of our pass through hardware revenue and an equal amount of hardware cost of sales during the quarter. Without this change, we would have guided revenue to the range of $292 million to $297 million, with gross margins of 60% to 61%. And lastly, for modeling purposes, we anticipate eliminating up to two-thirds of all pass-through hardware revenue by the end of Q4 '18. Additionally, we have also assumed that for every $5 million to $6 million reduction in pass-through hardware revenue, gross margins should increase by about 80 to 100 basis points. At this point, Operator, if you could open the call up for questions, that would be great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, please press * and the number 1 on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Jason Noland from Baird. Your line is open. Oh, OK. Great. Congrats on the quarter, and exciting stuff on the transition in the business. I guess, Duston, I wanted to ask on the elimination of 80% of your pass-through hardware in about a year, what has to happen over the next 12 months? I assume there's lots of negotiation with distributors to take that hardware revenue? Yeah, that has already happened in the U.S., so that's the good news. The team has done an excellent job getting those -- getting that process in place. So, North America is done. We need to now go execute on it, but those agreements are now complete. And we're now off working on some international regions. Okay. And we've spent some time on our team trying to figure out what your long-term operating model would look like. And I don't know if you are ready to point us -- point in any directions here. But would the profitability be pushed out a bit with more leverage in the model longer-term? Yeah, we'll give a full -- I think at the beginning of the year, we'll have a full deep dive on the operating model and how that changes. Obviously, gross margins go up substantially. The operating margin goes up and some other things there. And I don't think, from a cash flow perspective, there shouldn't be any major changes there. We've been hovering plus or minus, and that's kind of how we've been running the business from that perspective. But yeah, we've been doing awful lot of work on the long-term model and things like that. So, at some time, I think probably at the first quarter of the calendar year, we're anticipating scheduling some type of probably analyst event that will give a pretty deep dive into all that. Okay. Lots of questions, but I'll cede the floor. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Hey, thanks, guys. I'll offer my congrats again. I'm curious now. This is the second quarter in a row you guys have had really strong large deal momentum. I know you highlighted the federal vertical in particular this quarter. Can you talk about sort of the momentum that you're seeing there? How do you see that large deal funnel progressing here in a software-only model? I'm sort of kind of curious about the pipeline of these larger deals. Thanks, Matt. This is Dheeraj. Definitely, we've seen an uptick in the last three quarters. That's also because of the way we segmented our sales force. The focus is on global accounts and enterprise accounts -- strategic accounts, I should say. And a lot of the replatforming is now happening. So, for the first three, four, five years of selling, we were going and selling workloads and project-based spend, trying to go and exhaust the project-based spend. But many of our existing customers, we talked about 474 of those million-dollar customers. They are massively strong return customers for us, and we really focus hard on them. And you can see that from our net promoter score as well, which is one of the big determinants of large deals and the large deal pipeline for the last three quarters and the coming quarters as well. And then, I was curious .I don't think you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks anything about the GCP relationship. I know it's probably still early, but is there any updates on the progress of that? Yeah, I talked briefly about this in my call script as well. Making good progress, I think. You know, we are talking -- engaged with Google on the locations, like where do Nutanix's products go. And we've identified a couple of regions, both here in the U.S. and outside the U.S. as well, to make Nutanix as a service where customers can rent as well as own us. So, sometime in the middle of next year you'll actually see a big update around Xi, which is the cloud service. And it's not completely dependent on Google, but that's a big part of our overall push, is to go together as partners. Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. All right, thank you very much, and congrats on a great quarter. In the transition to your software model, are you assuming that most customers can do the integration work themselves between hardware and software, or are you going to become more reliant on channel partners like CW to do the integration work for you? Yeah, it's like a pyramid, Andrew. If you think about the top of the pyramid, it will be driven by global SIs. And especially as we've sold the software, some of which could actually go direct as well. So, we'd expect the channel and the SI to come back and help utilize that, deploy them on servers, on commodity servers, x86 servers. In the middle of the pyramid, we expect more of the resellers to do that. We made it extremely simple to actually go and deploy Nutanix. That's one of the biggest values of being an appliance company, the roots, because we really understood the value of the hardware/software boundary itself. So, we've made a lot of those deployments one-click. And the base of the pyramid could still be going through as NX. And, as Dustin mentioned, it could be an NX that's basically going through the ST model, where we just take the order, but then the software comes to us and the hardware goes to the hardware vendor. Okay, got it. And I just want to say one more thing about customer success, that we just seeded a team around customer success, where our technology relationship managers, we call them TRMs, who will be very active at the top of the pyramid with our largest customers. And we expect to get professional services, our own professional services, as well as the EPS of our resellers and the SI partners themselves for the middle of the pyramid. Great, that makes sense. And then I just have a follow-up. You had a fairly big jump in percentage of nodes sold with AHV this quarter, up to 28%. Are you seeing customers just getting more comfortable with Acropolis, or have there been changes on the competitive front that are prompting more customers to look at new options such as AHV? Thanks. Yeah, it's Duston. Yes, just on that metric there. We did continue to do great, as you can see from the investor presentation there. The only thing we did make a little tweak there, as you can see in that chart there, is that we've now, I think, more appropriately shown this just as NX nodes, and not including the OEM business in there, as you might expect. It's heavily tilted away from AHV. So, that tweaked it a little bit, but not substantially. And I think one of the correlations is with respect to our partnership with Citrix. The VDI business went up a little this quarter, and we've been doing some really good with Citrix using the AHV hypervisor and the Citrix workload. Yeah, and if we had used the exact same metric last quarter, I think it would have gone from 24 to 25. So, not a substantial change there, but up no matter what. Great. Keep up the good work. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Yeah, thanks for taking the questions as well, and congratulations. Just looking at your slide deck and looking at slide number seven -- and I can appreciate the fact that you're looking at the mix of business based on billings. But just simple math, I guess, looking at an 80%-plus gross margin on your software support revenue would leave us to think about a progression of gross margin into at least the 70, if not mid 70% range. So, I guess the first question is, is that how we should be thinking about the overall progression of the gross margin? And then to follow up on that, I think last quarter, you talked about adding $10 million of OPEX per quarter. It looks like your guidance is a little bit less than that. So, I'm curious of how we should think about the OPEX trajectory through the course of this year relative to your prior commentary? Sure. Yeah, on the first one -- and I actually gave you the metric because I wanted you guys to get this correct. You can do your own assumptions there. We gave you a couple data points -- two-thirds elimination by the end of the year at the end of Q4. And then for every $5 million to $6 million that you're gonna take out of your models of hardware, pass-through hardware revenue, gross margins should go up 80 to 100 basis points. So, it's a pretty simple way for you to go get to that endpoint, and it's from -- it's your models, obviously. But you should be able to easily do that from that perspective. On the expenses, yeah, I mean, we came in a little -- we were a little under hiring. It wasn't intentional. We didn't try to drive it down. We've still got, obviously, a lot of priorities and things like that. So, we'll continue to -- you'll see expenses -- I don't think we'll continue to be massively under. There's a lot of things going on, lot of hiring and things like that, so. Yeah, especially as we focus on the unrecovered global accounts and the unrecovered enterprise accounts, because we've done one phase of segmentation, but now we need to go back and figure out if we need to resegment it in the coming quarters as well. Okay. And then a quick follow-up. If you could, I would be interested in comment -- your comments on the IBM relationship, and then I'll cede the floor. Yes. So we did a GAR product a couple of months ago with IBM, and we have some really good momentum on the Linux applications. We have some proof of concepts going on in very large customers, both in the U.S. and Canada, and beyond as well. And we are working on the AIX product, which is one of the biggest sort of product sort of coverages that IBM has. And virtualizing that itself would grow the time on this whole relationship. So, we expect to see some news in the coming quarter or two. The product is off to a good start with the proof of concepts going on right now. Thank you very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair. Your line is open. Yeah, thank you. Hey, guys. I have a question on the -- let's see what slide it was. Oh, it's number seven. You assume support and other margin of 55% for future periods. And when I look at the model, it looks like the support gross margins are quite a bit higher than that. So, wondering what is happening with 55%? Yeah, good question. Nothing happening there. This includes support. It includes the small piece of professional services that we have, and then some residual other COGS that we have on a quarterly basis. So, nothing massively trending there. It's just kind of an all-in residual of what would be remaining there. And again, professional services is included in that support piece. Okay. So, that doesn't include the residual pass-through hardware. That's still . . . Correct. Correct. Right. Okay, so right now, your support gross margin is in the low 60s. So, what -- Yes, it's hovered 60, 62, or something like that. There's just some other COGS that we capture in that total, but it really is truly residuals left there. There's just some other stuff that gets bundled into there. Okay. So, today, that's in the product side. Yeah, you could argue either way. But it's residual, so it has to go someplace. Okay. I gotcha. All right. And then, Dheeraj, I see the guidance. If you include the pass-through hardware, obviously very strong. So, I'm assuming that with the strong federal performance, is it fair to say that you had some good backlog on the enterprise side and the commercial side? Yeah, I'll let Duston answer this one. Yeah. Yeah, the backlog didn't really surprise us for Q1 from that perspective. So, it bounces up and down, and we've maintained a reasonably healthy backlog over the last several quarters. So, we'll see how it progresses here with Q2, and obviously, we have the end of the calendar year. So, we will see how things play out with those efforts. Okay, and then last one quick one from me is on the billings differential from revenue. Is that just because you had a very strong billings quarter a year ago? And how should we think about the differential going forward between billings growth and revenue growth? Yeah, I don't think you'll see that much difference going forward. About a year ago or so, we had a little tweak to support pricing and how the mix to bill and revenue kind of tweaked a little bit there. But I think you're seeing some residual of that. But I wouldn't expect that you'll see that level of delta going forward on a year-over-year basis. Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just first wanted to see if we could clarify the federal. You highlighted it was strong this quarter. If we could just get some quantification around contribution, percent of revenue from federal, and where it is typically, and how much of this is seasonal? Yeah. So, we expected federal to be reasonably healthy, and it was pretty good. If you look at our federal business in total, on average, it averages 10% to 12% of bookings or so. And then Q1, it pops up. So, we had a pretty good popup in Q1. It wasn't quite exactly to the same percentage as last year. But the team did a great job. We had lots of large deals, as Dheeraj mentioned there. So, a little bit better, but not massively better. Great, and then -- sorry, go ahead. I was gonna say that obviously, the CR, the continued resolution, for most of the year, a lot of that budget will flush at the end of their fiscal, which was September. Great. And I wanted to see -- you gave us, I think, a number of helpful insights in terms of the software pivot, of how it affects our modeling and how the analyst might look at the financial metrics. But I guess what I'm a little bit hazy on is your customer experience -- how your customers will view Nutanix, how they're going to interact with you. I think my worry is, are they becoming more at arms length in terms of their interaction with Nutanix? Could you help us get a better understanding of, really, the interaction level and how that either does or does not change? Thank you. That's a great question, and we think about it all the time, simply because we are paranoid about customer experience, by the way. So, the first step, as Duston mentioned, is about having the same port to cash experience where they can order NX appliances and it'll get split in the channel via the ST to Nutanix and SuperMicro. So, we hope to continue to keep that experience, even if we end up selling more software than hardware, as we'll do over time. But then the customers can come back and fulfill the hardware by going through a very similar sales process. Even today, we have -- more than 30% of our nodes are actually OEM nodes, and we have tested -- being tested in customer service, customer support. And we've kept our OEM partners honest as well. So, we've actually gone through building that muscle memory of customer support at a nontrivial number of nodes that don't belong to NX nodes. And I think it's really important also just to really understand that there's absolutely zero change from what the customer sees. So, that process from the customer is left intact and exactly the same as it has been in the past. And that being said -- and obviously, we want folks to buy our software and run it on -- like I mentioned, some of our customers run into an OCP-like servers. In fact, others run it on Cisco. Cisco was a pretty good quarter for us this quarter. It substantially jumped from last quarter. HP is also going down a pretty robust path. So, we have really done a good job of building the right tools, all the way from installed tools. We call it Foundation. We have Sizer, which is a capacity-planning tool. We have X-ray, which is our POC automation tool, so it does a lot of the testing of the hardware upfront. We are in the process of actually pushing out our certification tool to all the partners so that they can actually go and certify this in the field itself. So, a ton of automation that was actually done to make sure that the transition from hardware to software is without a lot of these negligent things that one could end up doing, and software with experience. And not only the experience, but product reliability and integrity of data, and things like that. Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hi, this is Benjamin sitting in for Mark. Great quarter. Seems like a lot of moving pieces. So, as you -- my question was about the sales motion and how it changes. So, as you move to a software-centric company, and it seems there will be a lot of changes. I don't know if there are changes in the organization structure, but definitely comp will change for the sales guys. How does the sales motion for sales guys change? Is there a learning curve to selling software versus selling the appliances, etc.? And how confident are you that you'll be able -- that we will not see a period of oscillations with respect to bookings in the next 12 months? You know, one thing that we've learned in the last couple of years is to segment, segment, segment, our world and our lives. So, if you look at the pyramid, the middle of the pyramid, which is the midmarket, and the base of the pyramid, which is commercial business, we shouldn't see much of a difference. We've been selling OEM nodes with our software for the last couple of years. Our sellers have done a pretty good job of really managing relatively conflicted relationships in a way that hasn't hurt our relationship with the customer, including both sales in terms of professionals services and customer support itself. The top of the pyramid is where we expect to -- especially our global account managers, who have been used to selling software in their past lives as well, to go and do ELAs. And these could be very large ELAs that basically help replatform our customer's overall infrastructure. So, I think we're going to look at it in that segmented way, and I think that's the way to actually mitigate any risks along the way. But definitely, it's a cultural shift to think about how do you decouple the budget between the software budget and the hardware budget. And many of our folks have actually been thinking on these lines for a while, because it's hard, just the fact that we flipped the switch overnight. And we're talking about this for almost a year now, as we're porting our software to Cisco, or porting our software to HP and IBM, and porting our software to white boxes like OCP-like servers and so on. So, we've done a fairly thorough job in the last 18, 24 months, which is exactly what I told in that script, that this is not something that happened overnight. Okay, understood. The other question was, Duston, about -- on the software-centric disclosure. I think you mentioned $800 million of software and support if you add on the rate of the pass-through in the last 12 months. What portion of that is recurring today? And how do you think that recurring portion looks in 12 months from now? Yeah, that's something, again, as far as how that changes and the recurring piece of that, that we need to give some more thought to. And I think maybe at the beginning of year, we'll give some more thought there. We've obviously got a big piece of the support part of the transactions that are obviously all recurring in 95% renewal-plus rate there. And we continue to get more and more of the product portfolio set up that way to reoccur, but yeah, we'll give some insights -- Yeah, the good thing is also that our software additions, STARTER, PRO, and ULTIMATE --they are all term licenses, actually. So, most customers look at one-year, three-year terms, and they buy it with the support lifetime itself. Okay, got it. I'll cede the floor. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Yeah. Thanks, guys. Couple quick questions here. Dheeraj, at the beginning of the call, you talked about a hyperscale customer win or running on OCP. I don't know if that was new or not, but maybe you could refresh us on selling your software. Maybe not to the top four hyperscalers, but sort of maybe five through 20, if there's been sort of a development in the pipeline with that customer base? Yeah. I think one of the things we'll do, Alex, in the coming couple of quarters, is start talking about SaaS customers. We've done some good things with those folks in the past with a great vertical part. But the most exciting thing there is, more than the 15 to 20, is to take our software and put it in the bare metal service in the top four themselves, and they're all willing to open up, including the announcement that Amazon made about three, four days ago about bare metal as a service. That opens up some really good doors for us to go and use them as a platform where we make our software even more invisible than actually shipping systems to their on-prem environment. So, look out for some more SaaS-based insights in the coming quarters. And just a follow up with the moves to software. Have you seen any customers in the top 25 or maybe within the top global 2000 where they've approached you about just purchasing the software directly from you, and then just kind of going on their own as far as burning it onto the hardware? Yeah. So, we talked about a couple of these ELAs in the last quarter. In fact, one of the ELAs is a very giant retail chain. It's a Global 1000 company that has taken our software, an ELA version of it, and is running it on both Dell and HP servers, actually. So, a lot of what we did in terms of getting the support from HP was because the customer wanted it. So, we've done some other ELAs with Global 1000 customers in a very similar fashion. All right, thanks, guys. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Hi, thank you. So, this is Param Singh on behalf of Wamsi. So, firstly, I was wondering what was your average billing per customer in the quarter? How has that trended? It also looks like the number of new customers that came into your install base was lower than the past few quarters, so maybe you could comment on that as well. Thank you. Yeah. We've never really given a number on the average, if that was your question, average deal size or customer size there. Yeah, there's too many segments there. You've got the OEM piece, which is obviously lower. You've got Global 2000. That's higher. You've got all this other stuff there. So, we really haven't -- we haven't commented on it. But I think you can take away that with the big deals, that has a tendency to migrate up. And the deeper we get in the Global 2000, obviously, that deal size ends up taking care of itself. But even on ours, the product is built for repurchase also. So, it's a little deceiving there that you don't have to buy these massive amounts of upfront purchases. That's not how the product's designed, obviously. So, you always have a bunch of continuing repeat purchasing there. On the customer account, yeah, I wouldn't look too much into that. Q1's always little softer from a customer perspective. But we added a decent amount of customers there. In Q2, it will pop up naturally, which it usually does quite a bit from the Q1 level. And as a follow-up -- I appreciate the clarity you guys gave on the transition there. But if you could talk a little bit about what have you already done in the U.S.? What sales groups are you focusing on? Is it by vertical that have now been moved to kind of passing through the hardware, or is it just that you've opened up across the U.S. right now, and it's just taking time to show up on your P&L? And then, how do you expect to kind of incrementally launch that with your sales teams in the international markets? I'd appreciate any clarity there. Yeah, again, it's fairly transparent for most things there. And again, it's not -- it has nothing to really to do with verticals or customers or whatever. It's a generic process that we can start executing and eliminating the path through hardware on our books there. So, there's no limitations, if you will, from that perspective. And then, international is just another process there. We just haven't focused on it yet, but it's a similar process. It's a little bit more dispersed, so you lose a little of the concentration. So, maybe it takes a little longer to do some things there. But it's a very similar process that the folks are working on now. And in terms of any kind of segmentation to roll this out slowly and gradually, I think we just picked up some large deals and built some muscle memory, and we're just going down that path of deeper down the pyramid. Okay. And then with SuperMicro, is there anything that they would be doing differently than they are right now with the appliances in the new model? Just who they invoice. That's all. Okay, got it. Really appreciate the clarity, guys. Thank you. Operator Our last question comes from the line of Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Dheeraj, does deemphasizing the hardware increase your chances of new partnerships, or even the chance that partners like Dell will increase their commitment to selling your solutions versus their own? And then I have a follow-up. Yeah. I think it definitely it reduces friction in the sales motion, both for our sellers and the OEM sellers themselves. That being said, we also expect fully that the market we will make its decision on whether they want to get end-to-end support from us, or whether they are comfortable actually going through two-hop support. So, I think we have to hustle to prove that either our OEM partners are very good at support, even at scale, or our customers just pick us over going through two hops of support itself. But absolutely, we expect the friction to go down. We don't expect any kind of algorithms that people have to apply to take it through this route to market versus that route to market because there'll be normalized currency for how salespeople will make quota. Okay. And then at the user conference in June, I think you talked about Xi launching early 2018. Today. you talked about middle of the year. Is that just a function of early release versus GA, or is the timing different? And then maybe you can comment on when you think the memory market loosens, because I know that's been a factor on gross margins. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. I think one of the things, Katy, that we talked about in our overall engineering culture is how this release that we're actually doing in 5.5 took us a little bit longer to come out with in terms of general availability. And that pushes a few other things out as well. So there's, I would say, three months' worth of wait time in Xi, because we have to keep the lights on with on-prem customers as well. And we do expect to actually change the way we do engineering. In these two-piece teams, like really thinking about cloud engineering. What does it mean to have a platoon of developers who are independently releasing code? And it's becoming a company that's more DevOps-like. So, that's the foundation that the company is going through to actually improve our overall fidelity of releases as well. And Duston, do you have any comments on your thoughts around the memory market? Yeah. Yeah, as we've said, it's gotten, obviously, better. I don't think there's any insights right now to seeing it actually going the other way as far as pricing goes. It's gotten to a manageable level that we've been doing a good job managing around it, and doing a fine job with margins. And we expect it to be a little bit better this quarter, and then we'll see from there. Thank you. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining today's conference call. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Duration: 63 minutes More NTNX analysis ","

On the call today from management are Mark Butler, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; John Swygert, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jay Stasz, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer. I'll turn the call over to Mr. Stasz to get started. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you, and hello everyone. A press release covering the company's third-quarter fiscal 2017 financial results was issued this afternoon, and a copy of that press release can be found in the investor relations section on the company's website. I want to remind everyone that management's remarks on this call may contain forward-looking statements, including but not limited to predictions, expectations, or estimates, and that actual results could differ materially from those mentioned on today's call.

We will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, such as adjusted operating income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and adjusted net income per diluted share that we believe may be important to investors to assess our operating performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Mark. Thanks, Jay, and hello to everyone, and thanks for being with us on the call today. We had another strong quarter, and we are very excited about our results and the continued momentum in our business. Strong deal flow, great new store performance, and tight expense control drove our record results for the third quarter. Consistency and execution are two of our hallmarks that are critical to our success, and after 35 years are things that we will not change. For the quarter, we delivered record top and bottom line results, with an 18% increase in sales, a 31% increase in adjusted net income. Comparable store sales increased 2.1% against a 1.8% increase in the third quarter of last year and a 5% increase on a two-year stack basis. Our sales strength was once again broad-based, with nearly half of our departments comping positive. Some of our best performing categories were health and beauty aids, housewares, toys, furniture, and bed and bath. We continue to grow our vendor relationships with our increased size and scale, and we believe we're well-positioned to capitalize on the many buying opportunities in the marketplace. As we build these stronger direct relationships with major manufacturers, we're able to offer our customers what they want: brand name merchandise at drastically reduced prices. The best news is that we continue to see very strong deal flow. Our new stores performed above our expectations during the quarter. We opened 15 locations during the third quarter, and since quarter end, we've opened another three, for a total of 34 new stores in fiscal 2017. We continue to see a strong pipeline of leasing opportunities. Ollie's Army is stronger than ever. Growth of the army continues to outpace sales, with members spending significantly more than non-members. Next year, we plan to launch some exciting enhancements to the program that we've been working on for some time. We're introducing ranks for the army members, which will enable us to reward our most active customers. Members will receive different rewards and surprise offers based on their level of spending. We're also working on a mobile app that will allow us to communicate the latest and the greatest deals to our best customers. Our busiest night of the year, Ollie's Army Night, is just around the corner, and we're excited to once again open our doors exclusively to Ollie's Army members. Our stores are packed with great deals, and our team is eager to welcome our most loyal bargainoughts. The event is this Sunday, December 10th. If you're a member, we hope to see you; if not, there's still time. Enlist in the army now and join us for a great, great night. The stores will be packed. As we said before, we're celebrating our 35th birthday this year. We're proud of our long history of offering great deals to our customers and the successful expansion of Good Stuff Cheap to an ever-growing number of new markets. And we have no intention of slowing down. I want to acknowledge our more than 7,000 team members for their hard work and their dedication that has taken us to where we are today. We know the holiday season places extra demands on our associates, and I sincerely thank them for all they do, not only at this time of year but each and every day. It's their passion and commitment that are truly the drivers of our success. Let me wrap up by saying how proud we are of our third quarter results and the overall trends we're seeing in the business. As I like to say, we're hitting all of our marks. The consistency and the strength of our model proves itself each quarter, with stores across every vintage, state, and co-tenancy performing well. Our store openings are complete for the year, and we're building a full pipeline for the coming year, and our new stores continue to perform above our expectations across all geographies. We are laser-focused on the closeout industry, developing strong vendor relationships, and ensuring we are well-positioned in today's retail environment. Our third quarter results were strong, and early fourth quarter trends are encouraging. As a result, we're raising our full-year guidance, which John will give you more detail on in a moment. In our business, it begins and ends with deals. Bargains is our middle name, and we're living up to expectations by offering customers great deals on brand-name merchandise. We're well-positioned to continue to deliver those bargains to our customers and, in turn, deliver against our long-term objectives for our shareholders. Thank you once again for your support of Ollie's, and I'll now turn the call over to John, to take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail. Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to have delivered another solid quarter on top line sales increases, operating income leverage, strong adjusted net income, and EPS growth, all above our long-term expectations. Net sales increased 17.9% to $238.1 million. Comparable store sales increased 2.1% against a 1.8% increase in the third quarter of last year and a 5% increase on a two-year stack basis. The increase in comparable store sales was driven by an increase in both average basket size and transactions. We opened 15 stores during the quarter, ending the period with 265 stores in 20 states, an increase in our store base of 14.2% year-over-year. Subsequent to the quarter end, we opened three additional stores, for a total of 34 new stores in fiscal 2017. This brings our store count to 268 and completes our new store openings for the fiscal year. Our new stores continued to perform above our expectations across our new and existing markets, and we remain excited about the productivity of our overall store base. Gross profit increased 16.4% to $98 million, and gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 41.2% of net of -- net sales. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a decrease in merchandise margin, partially offset by favorable supply chain cost. SG&A expenses increased 12.6% to $68.1 million. The increase was primarily related to higher selling expenses from our new stores opened over the past year, increased sales volumes in our remaining store base, and investments in personnel to support our continued growth. As a percentage of net sales, we leveraged SG&A by 140 basis points to 28.6%. Excluding $600,000.00 of transaction-related expenses from prior year, we leveraged SG&A expenses by 110 basis points in the quarter. Operating income increased 29.8% to $24.2 million, and operating margin increased 100 basis points to 10.2%. Excluding that $600,000.00 of transaction-related expenses from last year, adjusted operating income increased 25.9%, and adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points. Net income increased 80.3% to $18.9 million, and net income per diluted share increased 70.6% to $0.29. Excluding the income tax benefits due to the accounting change for stock-based compensation this year and transaction-related expenses net of taxes in the prior year, adjusted net income increased 31.3% to $14.2 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share increased 29.4% to $0.22. EBITDA increased 28.2% to $27.3 million, and adjusted EBITDA increased 23.8% to $29.2 million in the third quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $42.2 million in cash and no outstanding borrowings under our $100 million revolving credit facility. We ended the quarter with total debt of $126.7 million, compared to $196.5 million last year. Subsequent to the quarter end, we paid down an additional $30 million of our term loan debt, resulting in a balance of $96.3 million. Capital expenditures totaled $6.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to $4.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase was largely due to the timing of new store openings and expenditures associated with our new data center. Turning to the outlook for fiscal 2017, as Mark discussed, we are raising our full-year guidance. As such, we are raising our total net sales expectations to a range of $1.062 to $1.065 billion. We expect comparable store sales to increase between 2 to 2.5%. We are raising our operating income expectations to a range of $131 to $132 million. We are raising our expectations for net income per diluted share to a range of $1.36 to $1.37 and our adjusted net income per diluted share to $1.21 to $1.22. Excluding the impact of the accounting for stock-based compensation, our outlook assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 38% and a diluted share count of 65 million. Our interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $5 to $5.5 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be $18.5 to $20 million for the year. And total depreciation and amortization expense, including the component that runs through costs of goods sold, is still projected at $12 to $12.5 million for the year. As a reminder, fiscal 2017 is a 53-week year, with the extra week occurring in late January. We continue to estimate the extra week will add approximately $18 million in sales and less than $0.005 to diluted earnings per share. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator to start Q&A session. Operator? Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you do have a question at this time, please press the * then the 1 key on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the # key. As well, we do ask that once you have asked your question, you please place your line on mute to prevent any background noise from entering the conference. Our first question comes from Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Thanks, and nice quarter guys. So, when we think about your model, if you exclude the fidget spinners last quarter, you've been pretty consistent. Two comp story now for really the last five quarters straight, and actually consistent at that level really for the last ten years plus. So, I guess my question, at a two comp, are you still comfortable with the model generating mid-teens top line and mid-teens EBITDA dollar growth going forward? Is that the best way to think about things? Matt, this is John, and absolutely, 100%. Based on the 1 to 2% top line -- the comp store sales growth, we expect to be able to generate the mid-teens revenue and the approximately 20% net income growth year after year, yes. Great, and then just a follow-up, John, the new store productivity just continues to accelerate. I think the returns this year are the best historically that we've seen in the model. I guess what do you see driving the performance of this most recent -- these most recent openings? And how do you see the store pipeline shaping up, as we think about next year? Sure. Matt, the new stores are performing well, and actually, in fact, above our expectations. And they've been performing well for several years now, but we are seeing a pretty good class of stores here in 2016 and 17 that definitely are above what we would have expected based on our new store model. But the deals are driving what's in the box, and we're continuing to see that revenue increase in our stores based on the deal flow that the merchants are able to get. And as you know, we've delivered a very consistent model year after year, so we're very excited about it. And next year, we believe we have a nice full pipeline for the new store growth. That's shaping up nicely, and we expect to see mid-teens growth in new store count next year as well. Great, best of luck guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Thomas, with Keybanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Hey, good afternoon guys, and let me add my congratulations as well. I guess first a question on the start here to the fourth quarter. Any more color on where you guys are running and, maybe more explicitly, what your comp expectations may be for this fourth quarter? Yeah, I'll go first Brad. Thank you for your comments. Typically, we don't give the monthly guidance or inter-quarter trends. I can tell you Thanksgiving weekend was very consistent with our expectations. We were pleased with our results. We're off to a good start in Q4, but as we are in everything, there's a lot of big days between now and the holiday of Christmas, inclusive of one coming Sunday night. A lot of it is predicated on weather, but all that being said, feel really good about where we are. As far as guidance, Jay? Yeah, I can speak to that Brad. This is Jay Stasz. And just to add on to what Mark said, the other thing we talk about is it's coming up against our own good numbers. We're facing a two-year stack of 7% and a three-year stack of 16% in the fourth quarter. But with that said, the last quarter, we talked about Q4 being in the low end of the 1 to 2% comp range. Really, and not a major shift, but what we're thinking of, is the comp range for the quarter now is probably in the mid to the high 1 to 2% range. Great, and then just to follow up on the earlier question about the long-term financial outlook, I guess just explicitly, as we think about 2018, obviously we need to adjust for the extra week you have this year, but any other early thoughts for us, John, as we start to fine-tune our model on an annual and quarterly basis for 2018? Yeah, Brad, we're not gonna give a whole lot of color on 2018, but I will tell you, as we've said for a long period of time now that we've been public, really go back to the long-term, consistent algorithm that we've given to you guys of top tine -- mid-teens top line growth, 1 to 2% comps, gross margins right at about 40%, and net income growth close to 20%. So, if you model that out, it's gonna be pretty consistent. As you know, we lever pretty well, once we get above the 1 to 1.5% comp store sales, but we don't build our infrastructure to do that, and we don't actually have -- we don't build our model as well so that we don't get ourselves behind the eight-ball if sales do slow down a little bit. So, same model per parameters that we've given to you in the past, we would stick to on a long-term basis. Great, thank you so much. Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Hi guys, it's actually Bobby Freenor on for Peter today. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the closeout opportunities you're seeing, specifically pertaining to consumables and branded CPG companies. I think that has pricing in an area where it remains hyper-competitive. A lot of retailers are moving more to private label, and you're seeing these branded CPGs look for new points of distribution. So, is this a dynamic you're benefiting from? If you could you just discuss the trends you're seeing in branded CPGs, that would be great. Thank you. Yeah, I don't know if anybody else's switch to private label is driving any CPG availability, to be honest with you. I will tell you that our focus, we are laser-focused on getting name brands at drastically reduced prices, and some of the greatest names in America are in our stores, of which I will tell you none of them. But it's certainly exciting the consumer. They're responding, we're offering them bargains, we're developing these relationships, we're strengthening these relationships. And the entire environment -- consistent with what I think I've said two or three quarters is, this is the best closeout buying environment that I've seen, and I've been doing this for 35 years, so -- and obviously that's in relation here to Ollie's. So, it's the strongest that I've ever seen, and our pipeline is full, our brands are big, bright, and beautiful, and they're bargains, so I feel really good about where we're at. Alright, great, and just a quick follow-up with consumables at 20% of sales, I believe. Have you given any thought to where this figure could go over the next couple years? Yeah, Bobby, this is John. With regards to the consumables, we're obviously not making a concerted effort to increase our consumable penetration in our model. As you know, we go where the deals come from, from the overall vendor base. So, where does consumables go? Potentially could go up 200 or 300 more basis points, but I would say we would not want it to increase much more than where it's at today. As you know, that puts additional margin pressure on the mix that we sell through the stores. But if we can drive additional volume and additional traffic to the store from consumables, we would take that any day. Alright. Thanks a lot. Good luck this quarter. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Hey guys, actually Robert Iannarone on for Scot today. Congrats on a good quarter. Thanks, Rob. You're very welcome. Just wanted to quickly touch on the inventory growth. It's been a little bit higher, and actually this first time, I think it's just a touch higher than sales this quarter. Did that have to do with the timing of store openings, gearing up for the holidays, or just deal flow? Is there anything there that you guys can speak to? Yeah, Rob, this is Jay, and I can speak to that. I mean, you're right: it is just a tick higher than our sales trends, but we're happy with our inventory position. It's really a byproduct and a reflection of the strong deal flow, as well as, to your point, there is a little bit of timing of store openings in there. But really, it's a byproduct of the strong deal flow that we're seeing. And we're happy with the inventory position, as we head into the remainder of the holiday season. Great, glad to hear it. And just one follow-up, unrelated, but more toward the Ollie's Army. Can you give us any updated metrics on member count? Kind of what percent of sales maybe those guys are doing now? Yeah, sure. The current member count is 8.1 million versus 6.7 million a year ago at the third quarter, which is about a 22% increase, and the metrics continue to be very consistent. They're making up over 65% of our sales, which is consistent with what we've had in the past. Thanks a lot, guys. Congrats again. Thanks, Rob. Operator Thank you, our next question comes from Rick Nelson, with Stephens. Your line is open. Thanks. Congrats on the quarter. Also, I'd like to follow up on the merchandise margin pressures that you discussed. Is that shift driven toward consumables or other factors weighing into that margin? Yeah, Rick, this is John. It's predominantly mixed shift that we're seeing in the consumable category that's driving the margin down. And we've talked about this for several quarters now, so it's not a big surprise to us, and it was expected, as we guided last year from a much higher gross margin down to the number we're at this year. So, not a big surprise there. We also had a slight improvement in the supply chain cost for the quarter as well, which is a little bit less than we had expected in that facet of the business. We're seeing a little bit of pressure on the inbound and outbound freight cost post-hurricanes, with the -- not a lot of availability on the trucking side of the business. So, we will be able to navigate through it, and we still are confident with north of 40% gross margins for the full-year basis. We had it previously guided to about a 40.3%. Right now, we're closer to about a 40.2% on a full-year basis, from a gross margin perspective. Gotcha, thanks for that color. Also, would like to follow up on the hurricanes: if you think that, in fact, was a headwind to the comp in the period. I'll take part of this, and Mark might take in a little bit here, Rick. With regards to the hurricane, we did not see a big impact on our business. We don't -- a lot of our stores down in the Florida markets are not comparable stores yet. So, we did have some disruption in the Florida market. Nothing significant. We were very lucky and fortunate not to have any stores damaged in any material way. We had some closed store days, but the comps in the hurricane areas were not impactful enough for us to really call out for the quarter. It probably had a little bit of a tiny impact, but we don't believe that that was something to speak to on a material basis. Gotcha. Finally, if I could ask on the HPA. You've called that out now as an area of strength for five consecutive quarters, so you're lapping some big numbers a year ago. How much more opportunity do you see in that category? Well, we think that because of our relationships in the growing scale and our ability to take more product from these major CPG companies, that we think that have a -- I'm very bullish on the outlook on the go-forward. Obviously, we wouldn't come up with numbers for you, but when you come into our stores, you're seeing incredible name brands in America at bargain prices, and we're very, very excited about the prospect. So, we think that it's helping us. We think that it's breaking the basket, getting people started, and we're excited about it. Sounds good. Thanks, guys, good luck. Thanks, Rick. Operator Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you do have a question, please press * then 1 on your touchtone telephone. Our next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Hi guys. Good afternoon. I just wanted to touch on SG&A. You have seen a tremendous amount of leverage in this line item in over the last year plus I guess, total costs growing at a rate of less than square footage growth for these quarters. I guess what I'm trying to get at is, how have you been able to keep costs down with the store expansion that you've seen, particularly even with going into new markets? I'll take part of this, and Jay and Mark might wrap it up here for me, but with regards to the overall SG&A cost, we're pretty much -- as we've said before, if we can do greater than a 1 to 1.5% comp, we're gonna be able to lever pretty heavily. So, we have a pretty light load on the SG&A front in the way we obviously run the business. So, that's a positive piece that we're able to drive with incremental sales volume. We run a tight control of expenses in our business, and as we continue to grow the top line sales, our G&A -- our goal is to continue to lever that G&A number as we continue to grow the sales base, and I think we've been able to do that pretty successfully as we continue to expand. And there are some one-time costs that we're not lapping related to becoming Sarbox compliant that were invested there. So, just looking forward, the leverage point doesn't change very much, do you think? Well, right now, with where we're at, we think we can lever it 1 to 1.5%. We have said in the past there are certain times where we may have a little bit heavier investment that we have to make on the people side of the business. So, this year was a little bit lighter than normal on the people side, and next year may be a little bit heavier, so I would not expect anywhere near the same leverage you've seen this year. While we've outpaced the 1 to 1.5% comp, we're getting a lot of leverage fall-through there, but when we build the model next year at the 1 to 2% comp, I would expect for SG&A ratios to stay pretty consistent to where they'd be this year, maybe at 10 to 20 basis point leverage point, when you model out for 2018. Okay. And then you had mentioned just some changes around Ollie's Army next year. I was just hoping maybe you could provide a bit more color as to what you're looking to do and potentially any impact that you would expect on sales. I don't know if there's a margin impact associated with all this. Just any other color there would be helpful. Yeah, I'll go first, and as I mentioned in the prepared comments, I've been wanting to do ranks for ages and ages and ages and just did not have the capabilities -- the internal capabilities of doing it. And then, of course, we've been telling everybody about phase one and phase two and the systems so that we can get our fingers around a lot more of the data that we've been gathering throughout the year. So, we're gonna be able to do the ranks, and we're gonna have a one-star, a two-star, and a three-star. And obviously, a one-star is going to be somebody who spends a certain amount of money in the year, a two-star will be more, and the three-star -- and perhaps we'll offer them additional discounts or incentives, or perhaps we'll offer them deals that might be exclusive to them only. But everybody has to stay with me on the Ollie's Army. I'm not gonna kill these people; these are our customers. We're protected of them. We're gonna talk to them in the fashion that we know that they wanna hear from us, and we're not embedding any underlying huge numbers to it. We know what they wanna hear, we know how they wanna hear it, we know how to motivate them. We think we're gonna have additional opportunities, but I'm asking everybody to stay with us, stay with me on the planning, and I wouldn't go planning or modeling any great advantages to it. Okay, excellent. Thanks, and best of luck in Q4. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners. Your line is open. Thanks. Hi guys. Just on the new store performance, which came in certainly ahead of my number and I think the street number as well, even though comps were relatively in line. And I know you've talked about it a little bit already, but any significant changes in terms of the selection process or the locations that you're getting as other retailers close stores? Are you doing anything differently, just with the pre-opening routine, or the marketing, or anything like that, that would play into the strong new store performance? Yeah, Patrick, this is John. With regards to the overall site selection process, we've not changed our site selection process whatsoever. We have the same team, the same individuals have head up the real estate department for many, many years. So, we are going to market the same way we have for a long period of time. Our preopening process or cadence is very, very consistent. We're doing the same thing we've done for a long period of time, so there's been really no -- nothing -- no big changes to speak of that we've done that would be driving the incremental business that we're seeing. Are we getting slightly better sites in certain situations where we've had other retailers go out, that we've been able to secure the site that we may not have got in the past? Possibly. But I would not say that's the majority of what we're able to do. We're pretty much getting the same or similar sites that we've had in the past, and we would always say that the deal is gonna drive the performance of the stores and the excitement in the stores, that when we get the customers in, they see what we have, and they're gonna buy and spend more money. So, that's what we're seeing, from our perspective, and we're excited to see it. And one thing we'd say, it's been broad-based; it's been across all of our stores. It's not just been one geographic area; we're seeing it consistently in all of the stores we've opened this year and last year as well. And then I know you don't wanna talk too much about the fourth quarter to date or the fourth quarter sales guidance, but looking at Thanksgiving -- I know you weren't open on Thanksgiving, but Black Friday, early in the morning, and then through the Thanksgiving weekend and on Cyber Monday, did you see any even let's say subtle change in-store traffic patterns on those days that would give you any indication that your core customer might be spending a little bit more online? Or was it relatively consistent with last year in terms of the basic pattern? Yeah, Patrick, we didn't see any of that at all. What we saw was a consistent response. And my biggest or our biggest and greatest deal flew first. That's no different than any other year. When we opened our stores, we had people waiting to get into the stores, but we absolutely saw no adverse effect whatsoever. Very consistent with previous years, and we were very pleased with the weekend and very pleased with the early trends so far to Q4. Got it. Okay, thanks, Mark. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you do have a question, please press * then 1 on your touchtone telephone. Our next question comes from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hey, terrific. Thanks, guys, very much for taking my question, and nice quarter there. Wanted to go back to one of Ed's questions, just on the SG&A opportunity. I know that you mentioned a couple times kinda above that 1-1.5 comp is where you really do see that nice leverage start to kick in, but can you just remind us a little bit with some of the -- kinda within that line where some of your bigger levers and bigger future opportunities may be going forward? Yeah, Vince, this is John. With regards to the biggest opportunity or biggest lever we'd be able to pull in the SG&A side, is 1 to 1.5%, you'd expect pretty much no -- very, very little to zero leverage. And most all leverage coming out above that is gonna be focused more on the G&A front. Store piece, we do get a small component of it, but the way we run our stores, there's a big fixed component in the store side that we're not gonna be able to lever until we get above that 1.5%. But the G&A is where we're gonna be able to pull the levers and see the biggest opportunity there, as we go forward on the long-term basis. But like we said, we don't expect to see a lot of leverage coming out of the model when we model out 2018. We're gonna be modeling our consistent 1 to 2% comp, and you're gonna see very little leverage, probably 10 to 20 BPS in the SG&A side compared to the share. Okay, perfect, that is very helpful, thank you. And then just a very quick follow-up on the enhancements to the Ollie's Army program. Should we -- how should we think of the progression there? Is that gonna be kinda on day one with both the ranks and the mobile app that it's going to be launched storewide? Are you gonna do different geographies kind of a step at a time? How should we think of that timing? Vincent, our personality is walk before we run. There's no way we would do both programs at the exact same time, but we do expect to have them rolled out this year. We think that the ranks are gonna be perceived as pretty cool by the army, they're gonna like it, but we wouldn't do them both at the same time. Now that you say it, would we do it geographically? That is perhaps -- that would fit our personality, so you are probably spot on. One thing to add to that, Vince, probably what we would expect is we would probably have both of those rolled out sometime by the first half of 2018. Obviously, it would not come together, but they'd be lined up back to back. But hopefully, both will be out by the first half of next year. Okay, perfect. Thanks very much. Good luck guys. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Your line is open. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Comps in the quarter seemed to be pretty much as you expected, maybe a little bit better, so great job on that. But investors have become accustomed to even larger upside surprises. Do you think we've reached an era where people should change their view and look at your guidance as something that should be relied upon more and not something that's conservative? Yeah, well Alvin, anybody who's been involved with us since we started talking about the IPO process has heard us, me say 1 to 2%. The way that I've always announced it is that we -- that's our comp, that's where we think we're gonna be. We're a growth story. We've been nothing but consistent, as I think on the first call -- or the first question, from what Matt said, you know, you go deeper, I think we're only allowed to go back 10 years or whatever, and we averaged about a 10% comp -- 1 to 2. 1 to 2, but we go back ten years. 1 to 2. I'm sorry. 2% comp. So, I think it's the consistency in the model. We went Q1 at a 1-7, Q2 at a 4-5, the spinners were in there, and Q3, we're at a 2-1. That's what I'm asking. We're asking everybody to stick with, everybody to understand how we run the business, how we budget the business, how we model the business, and then as I've said, as we've said, we just don't turn the registers off when we hit 2. If we can get more, we're gonna get more, but this is the way we run the business, and we think that's the right way and the most prudent and appropriate way to run the business. Thanks, and just a follow-up on your guidance, I think I heard you say you're expecting a mid to high 1 to 2% comp in the fourth quarter. If we use the midpoint of that, that seems to be a slowdown on a one-year and possibly two-year basis relative to what you saw in the third quarter. So, is that view reflecting what you're seeing today, or is it conservatism, or are there some unfavorable items that we should be considering in the fourth quarter? Yeah, Alvin, this is John. I would say that it's not anything that we're afraid of. It's the way we run the business, and I would say it's our conservative nature we have. But like Jay had alluded to I think earlier, we're up against a 16% three-year stack. We're not going up against easy numbers here, so we've had three or four years in a row where we've had positive comparable store sales, so we don't look at that as slowing down. We look at it more from a maintenance perspective in keeping customers and continuing to drive positive comparable store sales. So, we're excited where we're at, what we're seeing right now. Business is very strong, and like we said, we're going up against some very big numbers now, and to be able to beat them makes us very, very excited. Great, and last one for me, just wanted to your views on tax reform. If it passes, what do you expect to do with that benefit, or would you think it'd be competed away? And I guess related to that, if your customers get a higher personal income tax return, do you see that spending come through your stores in a bigger way? I mean, is that something you've seen in the past? Hi Alvin, this is Jay Stasz, and I can start with that. In regard to the tax reform, it's awful early to figure out exactly what's gonna happen or if the reform will become effective. I mean, we are a full taxpayer, so any reduction in the corporate rate will benefit us. And generally speaking, from the consumer standpoint, if they've got more discretionary income in their pocket, we don't view that as a bad thing certainly. Thank you very much. Thank you. Operator Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions in queue, so I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Butler for closing remarks. Okay, thank you, operator. Our stores are stocked with incredible deals, and we encourage all of you to get out there and shop at Ollie's. We believe we're well-positioned for the remainder of the holiday season. Thanks to everybody for participating in the third quarter earnings call, and thanks again to all of our Ollie's associates. We wish everyone a happy and a safe holiday season and look forward to speaking to you again on our fourth quarter call in late March. Thank you very much, and have a good day. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day. Duration: 40 minutes More OLLI analysis ","

Shares of Big Lots (NYSE:BIG) were moving higher on better-than-expected earnings reports from its peers and as strong Black Friday sales drove brick-and-mortar retail stocks up across the board. Investors were also anticipating the discount retailer's earnings report, which came out on Dec. 1. Image source: Big Lots. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock finished up 15.2%. As the chart below shows, it surged toward the end of the month as Black Friday weekend reports came out. BIG data by YCharts. Big Lots shares rose 9% over the four trading days following Black Friday as retail stocks climbed broadly. Data from Wells Fargo showed that Black Friday traffic had the slowest decline since 2013 and there were fewer markdowns than in previous years. Though traffic on Thanksgiving and Black Friday tumbled 1.6%, online sales were up 18%, a sign that retailers are successfully transitioning to e-commerce. The National Retail Federation also said 174 million people went shopping over the holiday weekend, better than expectations of 164 million people. Big Lots' stock fell 1.5% on its third-quarter earnings report on Dec. 1 even as the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Adjusted earnings per share increased from $0.04 to $0.06, beating estimates by a penny.  Comparable sales increased 1% as overall revenue inched up $1.11 billion, which missed expectations at $1.12 billion. The company also raised its adjusted EPS guidance for the fourth quarter from $2.30-$2.38 to $2.35-$2.40, above last year's figure of $2.26, a positive sign heading into the holiday season. Though the stock dipped modestly after its earnings report was posted, that may be more of a reflection of the run-up prior to the report rather than dissatisfaction with it. With adjusted EPS expected to grow 16%-18% this year, Big Lots is one of the few brick-and-mortar retailers that remain in good shape. ","

Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our third-quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at IR.Kroger.com. While there, we encourage you to visit the Events and Presentations page to find the full slide set outlining Restock Kroger as laid out in our annual investor conference on October 11. Restock Kroger will be the framework we will be using over the next few years to clearly communicate how we plan to serve America through food inspiration and uplift and as a result, create shareholder value. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kroger's chairman and chief executive officer, Rodney McMullen. Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third-quarter 2017 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman. I'd like to thank you for joining us at our 2017 investor conference in New York last month, where we outlined Restock Kroger, our plan to create shareholder value by redefining how America eats. Food retailing is more exciting than ever. More Americans identify as foodies, and customers have more food choices than ever before. In the past, we've defined our market as share among traditional stores. Today, we've redefined our market as a share of stomach. This sharpens our focus when we look at our industry and our customers. We see anyone who sells food as competitors, which doubled the size of our market to 1.5 trillion. If you're eating, we want to serve you that meal. The fact that Kroger is trusted by more than 60 million households is an incredible competitive advantage. Kroger has competed in an ever-changing retail landscape for 134 years because our touchstone has always been the customer. We place the customer at the center of everything we do and because of our relentless focus on serving customers, Kroger is uniquely positioned to be the partner they turn to for meals. Restock Kroger has four main drivers: redefine the grocery customer experience, expand partnerships to create customer value, develop talent, and live our purpose. These pillars combined will create shareholder value. Going forward, I plan to highlight an item or two each quarter that we've made headway on. This quarter I'd like to begin by talking about how we are creating a seamless environment where our customers can choose how they engage with us in store and online. Our efforts are all about making things easier for our customers and providing personalized, affordable, and exclusive options that fit their needs. Seamless will play a major role in redefining the grocery customer experience. Our hypothesis has always been that our customers will want to have options on how they engage with us. This hypothesis shaped our strategy and we've been executing that strategy by accelerating Kroger's digital and e-commerce efforts for the last several years. We know that our customers have already decided they love ClickList, which is why we continue to rapidly expand that offering. By year's end, we will be serving customers at more than 1,000 'click and collect' locations. Our third-quarter digital revenue growth was 109%, driven by ClickList. We also know that some customers desire home delivery. We've gone from 0 to more than 300 locations offering home delivery, an expansion of a little over a year by partnering with service providers including Shipt, Roadie, Uber, and others. We'll continue to build on our home delivery offering in 2018 with these partners, as well as Instacart, who we are developing a unique relationship with. We have initially launched a partnership with them in southern California. We'll continue to use our data and customer insights to make it really easy for our customers to navigate across the channel they choose when shopping with us and will continue leveraging our physical proximity to our customers as a competitive differentiator. To do all of this requires the investments we outlined in Restock Kroger. Everything we're seeing in our data and in customer behavior tells us Kroger's transition to seamless is working. Today, households that engage in our seamless offerings engaging digitally and with our physical stores spend more per week than households that do not. The future looks even more promising. We'll continue to add even more services, expand our available product selection and more effectively use our insights to create a personalized experience that every customer will love. Running in a seamless world also means optimizing space and ensuring our brick-and-mortar experience is curated to deliver exactly what customers are looking for. We firmly believe that customers of the future will continue to frequent physical stores with compelling offers and experiences. A very recent example of this is that Kroger had our best ever Black Friday results for general merchandise led by record sales at our Fred Meyer division. Another focused area on redefining the grocery customer experience is winning with our brands. It's no surprise that America's most beloved grocery store has some of America's most beloved brands, which as a portfolio we will continue to champion for growth. In fact, our brands as a stand-alone company would be in the top third of the Fortune 500. In the third quarter, our brands continue to deliver strong performance, making up 28.2% of unit sales and 25.6% of sales dollars excluding fuel and pharmacy. Simple Truth continues to resonate in a big way with our customers, with sales growing 19% in the third quarter. Another important Restock Kroger area is focused on accelerating cost of goods savings and sales leverage. We will continue to work on controlling costs to invest in areas that matter most to customers. For example, we are leveraging our relationship with suppliers to drive costs and inefficiencies out of our various businesses. These processes have successfully driven significant savings in cost of goods, which allow us to invest in price for our customers. At the same time, this helps our suppliers generate volume growth. Our use of data and science creates opportunities and efficiencies that both parties benefit from. Across the board, customers are recognizing our efforts to redefine the customer experience and they are rewarding us with their loyalty. This, in turn, creates value for our shareholders. That's exactly what Restock Kroger is designed to do. We will create shareholder value by generating incremental margin dollars and free cash flow over the next three years. As our business continues to improve, we remain committed to delivering on our 2017 earnings guidance. We are also confident we have the ability to grow identical supermarket sales and market share in 2018. Now, here is Mike to share more details on our third-quarter results and discuss our fourth-quarter and Fiscal 2017 and '18 guidance. Mike. Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our core business was strong in third quarter. We're very pleased with our ID sales exceeding 1% in the third quarter. We're especially happy to see the very strong performance in our fresh departments. The results in produce and meat were terrific, and we continue to see double-digit growth in natural foods. Our ID sales results were driven by both higher spend per unit and strong growth in the number of households. Total visits continued to grow throughout the quarter and our market share was up. Our business is gaining momentum and our customers are recognizing the investments we are making. We noted at our investor conference that over the next three years Restock Kroger will be fueled by $9 billion in capital investments, cost savings, and free cash flow. We recognize that in order to be there for customers today and more importantly, to be where they are going in the future, we need to make investments more aggressively and faster than ever before. We've already prioritized the way we invest capital by both reducing the amount we spend and optimizing our capital allocation process. We now look first for sales driving and cost savings opportunities through both brick-and-mortar and digital platforms. Second, we will continue to make sure our logistics and technology platforms keep pace with and scale to those demands that we've created through these investments. And finally, we will allocate capital for storing activity. This process has allowed us to use less free cash flow for capital investments. As Rodney said earlier, we are aggressively managing OG&A costs and implementing new programs to reduce our cost of goods sold. One example is our recent decision to require on-time and in-full delivery from suppliers. We're implementing penalties when scheduled deliveries are missed within a designated window. Over time, this will help keep costs down by ensuring more predictable operations but more importantly, it will ensure that we have the products on our shelves that our customers want and when they want them. We expect Restock Kroger to generate $400 million in incremental operating profit margin over the three years from 2018 to 2020. We also expect to generate more than $4 billion of free cash flow after dividends over the next three years. Our goal is to continue generating shareholder value even as we make strategic investments to grow our business. Fuel performance was also outstanding in the quarter. Our cents-per-gallon fuel margin was approximately 24.9 cents compared to 17.9 cents in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.46 versus $2.17 in the same quarter last year. This, along with our strong core business results, demonstrates the diversity of our earnings. The field performance in the quarter also created the opportunity for us to make an incremental $111 million contribution into our USC consolidated pension plan. Funding these obligations proactively over time demonstrates our ability to meet our commitment to protect employee pensions while simultaneously delivering value to shareholders. As you know, we announced last month our intention to explore strategic alternatives for our convenience-store business including a potential sale. This was a result of a review of assets that are potentially of more value outside the company than as part of Kroger. This process is ongoing and there's been a high level of interest. As we stressed last month, our convenience-store management and associates are an important part of our success. We value what they do and thank them for continuing to put our customer first every day as we conduct this evaluation. Over the last four quarters, we used cash to contribute an incremental $1.1 billion to company-sponsored pension plans, repurchase 59 million common shares for $1.7 billion, pay $446 million in dividends, and invest $2.9 billion in capital. Our financial strategy is to use our financial flexibility to drive growth while also returning capital to shareholders and maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating. We continually balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals. As of the end of the third quarter, our current share-repurchase authorization had approximately $590 million remaining and return on invested capital for third quarter on a rolling four-quarters basis was 12.31%. Now, I'm going to spend a lot more time talking about pensions this quarter than I normally would. This is driven by not only what we've done this quarter but also what we've been doing over the past several years. About a decade ago we identified a great amount of exposure on pension plans and recognized then we would need to begin addressing that exposure like we would any big endeavor, one step at a time. Our efforts began in earnest in 2011, when we negotiated and created the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan. The keys for us were capping prior service costs, negotiating a new benefit accrual going forward, consolidating four plans into one, ensuring both professional and more efficient management of the assets going forward. We agreed to fund the plan over five years but elected to fund it in January of 2012. This arrangement reduced Kroger's annual multi-employer pension expense and secured the pension benefits for tens of thousands of Kroger associates. Including this agreement, we have since made more than $2.3 billion in payments and funding commitments with two objectives in mind. One, to address the underfunding in the company-sponsored pension plan and 2, to address the liabilities of various troubled multi-employer pension plans. We have adopted this approach in a low-interest rate environment to provide greater stability for the pension benefits earned by thousands of Kroger associates and retirees and to manage this liability proactively or, frankly, to avoid kicking the can down the road. We have said for some time that we expect our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to grow. This is because we're bringing an off-balance-sheet item on to our balance sheet or funding an obligation already on our balance sheet. As a result, we are updating our target range for this ratio to 2.2 to 2.4 times. These obligations, whether recorded on or off Kroger's balance sheet, have generally been considered when our credit profile's been reviewed but since they weren't funded, did not get picked up in our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. Our current resolve of 2.57 times is above this range. We expect to use free cash flow and potential proceeds from the sale of assets to get us back in the range. Protecting associates' and retirees' pensions is one significant way that we take care of our associates. Another is hiring and job creation. Kroger is currently hiring to fill 14,000 part-time and seasonal jobs. This is in addition to the nearly 10,000 permanent jobs we've already created in 2017. Through Restock Kroger we plan to invest an incremental $500 million in human capital in wages, training, and development over the next three years. This will be in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities, and training. On the labor relations front, we recently ratified an agreement with the UFCW for store associates in Charleston, West Virginia, and we are currently negotiating an agreement with the Teamsters for the master agreement. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable healthcare, and retirement benefits for our associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient healthcare and pension costs which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates the importance of growing our business and growing it profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. Turning now for our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017 and all of 2017, we expect fuel margins to moderate in the fourth quarter, and we're already seeing that quarter-to-date. We expect fourth-quarter identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel to exceed 1.1%. We confirmed our 2017 net earnings guidance for 53 weeks of $1.74 to $1.79 per diluted share and our adjusted net earnings guidance range of $2.00 to $2.05 a share. Both our GAAP and adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance includes the effect of hurricanes. The low end of this range is $0.04 above what industry analyst consensus forecast had been, demonstrating Kroger's ability to deliver shareholder value in a dynamic transition year. Our LIFO expectation has been lowered to $60 million from $80 million and we expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions, and purchases of lease facilities to be approximately $3 billion for 2017. Before I turn it back to Rodney, I want to note that in the 8-K earlier today, we reconfirmed the early thoughts on 2018. Rodney. Thanks, Mike. We're pleased with the third-quarter results and the fourth quarter is off to a solid start. Our associates are providing friendly and fresh service to our customers in a seamless way. In addition, through Restock Kroger we outlined our investment thesis at the investor day last month and I'd like to share it with you again today because we feel like it really highlights strengths. As America's grocer, we are growing in a fragmented market. Kroger has more data than any of our competitors, leading to deep customer knowledge and unparalleled personalization. We have incredibly convenient locations and platforms for pickup and delivery within one to two miles of our customers. We have a leadership team that combines deep experience with creative new talent. We have the scale to win with more than 60 million households shopping with us annually. In fact, Kroger's been named America's most loved grocery store several times. We connect personally with our associates, customers, and communities to uplift and improve lives. We have a proven track record of consistently returning capital to shareholders through an increased dividend and share-buyback program, and with Restock Kroger in place, we are confident in our ability to continue winning with customers, growing our business, and creating shareholder value. Now, we look forward to your questions. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press * and then 1. To remove yourself from the question queue, you may press * and 2. If you are using a speakerphone, we do ask you please pick up the handset to ensure the best sound quality. So with these instructions in mind, once again that is * and then 1 to ask a question. And our first question today comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Hey, thanks very much. I'm just trying to understand gross margins a little bit better. So, Mike, you just said in the prepared remarks that you expect margins to moderate in the fourth quarter and obviously everyone was very surprised by that 30-basis-point up gross margins this quarter. So, I guess I'm wondering if you could just shed a little more light on what might have been transitory this quarter. What I talked about as far as moderation in margins in the fourth quarter, was we expect our fuel margins to moderate in fourth quarter and we've already been seeing that. What happened with gross margins this quarter, the 30 basis points without the fuel, modern health, and LIFO charge that we talked about in the earnings release, we have become significantly more diligent on lowering our cost of goods in negotiations with our vendors. Our sales mix was very strong in the quarter relative to more natural foods and more our brands, which helps drive our margin rate up, and those did offset continued price investments. Our inflation at cost is still above our inflation at retail, if you go back to the chart I used at the investor conference, but they are beginning to converge and both of them are now in positive territory. I don't want anybody to think we didn't invest in price in the quarter because we certainly did in a very big and it's really the factors I talked about. So, is it fair to say then this dynamic in terms of being better at lowering the cost of goods is something we should expect at least the next three quarters? And then if anyway you could just give what cost inflation was versus retail inflation? I won't get into the habit of revisiting that chart. They were both over 0, so we did have cost inflation as well as retail price inflation that got passed on but we didn't pass all of it on. I also won't get into the habit of predicting where gross margins may go on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We can never know exactly what negotiations or what benefits may fall under a particular quarter but we do feel good about the results we posted. OK, just one on the expenses because you did talk about multi-employer quite a bit. Any color on how to think about multi-employer expenses next year versus this year just directionally? As I sit here today, there are two components of multi-employer expenses. There's one that we make on a cents-per-hour basis. It's part of our contracts to third-party plans that we don't manage. We may be a trustee on those. So, those will be whatever the hours we work and the contractual rate per hour. My guess is that you would see some increase in that number. I think you should think about contributions to the UFCW plan that I talked about we created five years ago and as I sit here today, I would expect that to be slightly less next year than this year given the contribution we just made, plus while they are having a very nice year from on a return-on-asset basis. Great. Thanks very much. Thanks, Karen. Operator Our next question comes from Michael Lasser. Please go ahead with your question. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So, even as the rate of gross margin that you saw in this quarter continues, would you use that as an opportunity to accelerate and deepen your price investments, and what are you seeing on the competitive environment as far as pricing at this point? Well, one of the things that you've heard us say for a long time is we will not lose on price and we'll continue to use our data and insights to understand where we should be priced on a basket of goods and individual items. So, we will continue using that data to influence and cause us to invest in pricing going forward. As you know, at our investor day, Mike outlined looking over the next three years, we'll aggressively continue to invest in price and we will use the savings from all the things that Mike outlined to pay for those [inaudible] investments for our customers. Mike, do you want to add anything? No, you hit the nail on the head. We have been and will continue to invest in price and we have a lot of plans in place to figure out ways to pay for that. And my follow-up question is [inaudible] tax reform and your tax rate goes down significantly, how would you look to deploy that benefit to your P&L? Would you just let it flow to shareholders or would you look to subsidize investments you might make with that savings? First of all, we're very excited about where the tax reform is headed. We're especially excited about the House version because it starts almost immediately where the Senate is delayed a year. We believe it will also influence us to continue to invest in our business which will grow jobs and I think what will end up happening is you'll see us do a balance of everything together, some of it our shareholders will benefit from, some of it our associates will benefit from, and our customers will benefit from it as well, because we really view that all that together is what drives a sustainable business that continues improving over time and, as you know, that's been our strategy for a long period of time and would really look at this as an opportunity to continue to drive growing our business, creating jobs, being able to share some of that with our associates and customers as well. Thank you so much. Have a good holiday. Operator Our next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Let me start with you, Mike. I know it's harder to manage this balance than we think, right, between comps and margin improvement. How would you characterize the balance right now? Are you happy with the balance between the two? And then, I know you said you won't lose on price due to certain competitors out there. Has that message gotten through such that some selective irrationality has dissipated or is that still going on? For us, I felt really good about the balance for the quarter but I would broaden that a little broader than your example because I would also include cost controls. We're making some improvement on shrink and some other piece of elements as well. So, when I look at the overall balance, I felt good about what we were able to accomplish, at the same time focusing on investing in some entry-level rates for our associates in several markets as well. The other thing that I liked about the balance for the quarter as it set us up well going into the fourth quarter as well. On pricing, I remember years ago Joe Pichler told me, an economist, ""All short statements are wrong"" and if you tell me what you want me to find, I think I can probably find it on pricing across the market. So, we would not view that the market is any different today than it was two months ago, five months ago, or whatever. It's really, anymore it's almost store-specific. It's not even market-specific in many cases. I was in a competitor the other day and three miles apart milk price and egg prices were over $1 per unit different. Secondly, on ClickList, you haven't said how many you're going to next year. What's your thinking in terms of how fast you want to go? Obviously, with incremental customers, it's not that diluted. Does that incline you to go faster if the organization can handle it? And then is there anything differently you're going to do operationally next year with ClickList? I know at some point you may think about where the demand is and how you handle that long term, but do you do anything different operationally in terms of how you pick, how you consolidate orders or pretty much it is what it is for 2018? Well, for 2018 we haven't given a specific number and I can tell you internally we're actually still working on it. As you look at the second half of the year obviously in the first quarter and second quarter is, we have those lined up. We would continue to get ClickList in every store that we can do and if that makes sense. We use our insights to understand in some places it just wouldn't make sense. There are some stores where we would like to have it but we just don't have the physical space. So one of the things we're trying to do is find the physical space. Operationally, today we continue to see progress on our operational metrics as it matures and as we use technology to make it easier for our store teams. At the current volume, I don't see huge changes in approach but that's one of the things that we're so excited about, our online approach is, at a certain point it's by far the most effective way of doing it is in store part as the volume becomes high enough, it's very easy to transition that over to dark stores and just tie it into our existing infrastructure. So, we feel really good about where we are and we feel good about as the volume changes, we can adjust the model to continue to connect. Mike, would you want to ... No, I agree with you. We obviously announced our relationship with Instacart that we have in Southern California which will be a prime example of what Rodney said where on average smaller stores and smaller parking lots and this is a great solution for a market like that, where it's a service that customers want but the physical assets we have wouldn't support it. OK, thank you, guys. Thanks, John. Operator Our next question comes from Shane Higgins from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Yea, good morning. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the ClickList. You guys had over 500 stores, I believe, this time last year. Any color you can give us just in terms of how those stores have kind of ramped and performed over the last few quarters and just in terms of any contribution to the comp and how it's impacted margins? Thanks. It helps comps. From an expense standpoint, it's continuing to invest in the future and, as everybody's heard me talk about it before, everything that we have learned and seen on ClickList takes three to five years before we're really indifferent on a financial perspective of whether somebody comes into the store and shops or somebody shops on ClickList. And obviously, that's the labor that the customer provides on picking the groceries versus us picking it for them but over time we continue to grow the business and we get better operationally from an expense standpoint. So, if you look at the quarter and if you look at year-on-year, it continues to be incrementally more investment from a P&L standpoint. It helps identicals. All the maturity that we're seeing on some of the early locations continues to have it still comfortable that in a three- to five-year period for a store you're really indifferent and it just becomes one more offer for the customer, and that's really what we're focused on and we pay a lot of attention. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we think it's incredibly critical to provide a seamless experience because the customer does still continue to come inside our stores. This progression, does it looks similar to what you've seen at the Harris Teeter stores where, I believe, you guys have offered this prior to your acquisition of the company. They had offered it for a number of years. That's very, very much so and, as you know, when we merged with Harris Teeter and we saw their insights, it's what caused us to aggressively start doing ClickList, and the only changes we made was asking the Harris Teeter team, ""If you had to do it over again, what would you do differently?"" Those things we have done but the patterns that we're seeing would be very similar to what Harris Teeter saw before we merged and what Harris Teeter continues to see. Great. I just had a housekeeping question on cost inflation. Mike, I might have missed this. Did you actually give a number for the cost inflation during third quarter? About 50 basis points. 50? Yes, sir. 5-0. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks, Shane. Operator Our next question comes from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey, Rodney, can we just start with the IDs? Could you just kind of walk us through the cadence of the IDs through the quarter and what you're seeing so far in Q4. I mean, your commentary around a better number than the 1.1 suggested you're higher than that now but just your thoughts there would be good. If you look at it, during the quarter it was very balanced across the quarter, nothing that would jump out one way or the other. We had traffic growth throughout the quarter. If you look at the household growth and things like that, it was pretty consistent and we continue to see that so far in the fourth quarter, a nice, steady balance moving in the right direction. So, in Q4 so far, Rodney, are you above the 1.1? Is that where you got it that way? OK. And then, Mike, just a question on the leverage ratio. So, when you bring the [inaudible] underfunding on balance sheet, the rating agencies obviously already know all this information and they've thought about that when they looked at you in the past and determined ratings. So, does what you're doing all have any impact on the way that you're thinking about allocating cash flow over time? It really doesn't. As we have more opportunities and negotiate more opportunities, if I could get all of these union contracts, if I wouldn't want to do it in one fell swoop, it's, like I said in my prepared remarks, it's one step at a time on a big endeavor like this. I would prefer to bring them all on balance sheet, manage the assets myself, get rid of a lot of friction costs. In one of the funds we consolidated, it was unbelievable the management fees that we were paying because their assets were so low. And as you get a bigger pool of assets going after the same goal, you obviously get better fees. So, there are lots of ways that it's reduced our costs and, generally speaking, the rating agencies do get it and understand it. I'll think out loud just for a second and everybody in room just kind of looked at me like ""Uh oh,"" but we've actually talked ""Should we start talking about a leverage ratio closer to exactly how the rating agencies do it so there isn't this disconnect between the two"" and we just put everything out there the way we believe they look at it. They don't tell you everything and then it's not as volatile as it seems when we add something. So, that's something we're kicking around just to take some of what seems like a growth in our leverage when it's just moving it from one part to another. And lastly for you, Mike, how do you see the allocation of the proceeds from the c-store sales sort of playing out related to repo or debt reduction? OK. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Ed. Operator Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question. Good morning. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our question. So, I actually had a question on the pharmacy. So there's been a lot of speculation lately with a new player potentially entering the pharmacy space and others such as CVS discussing plans to offer next-day delivery. So just curious whether pharmacy delivery is something your customers are requesting and your ability to potentially offer this convenience down the road and just the competitive dynamics surrounding kind of this speculation. Well, in terms of delivery, in some places we already offer delivery if the customer request is enough. Going forward, it has become something that's more important. We will be able to leverage it on the infrastructure that we're putting in place for ClickList on delivery. For us, one of the things that we like is the pharmacy business continues to improve and grow up because we're able to help people eat healthier as well and our 8451 and our pharmacy teams and our health and wellness teams are really working hard on, how do we help our customers eat healthier on their terms because we know the flavor profiles people like. And we're actually doing some things now and testing with our associates, and once our associates give us feedback, then we will expand and provide that to the customer as well. So we really feel good about the opportunity going forward by leveraging all the insights that we have. OK. And then just switching gears to the hurricanes during the quarter, are you able to quantify the [Inaudible] that you saw on the quarter and any impact to earnings that you saw from the hurricanes? Well, the expense that we incurred did not penetrate our insurance deductible. So it was contained at less than the $26 million I spoke of last quarter. It was in the $20 million to $25 million range and when you think about where the hurricanes hit and where we have stores, while it certainly helped the Houston division sales, the overall effect on the total company, given we have 2,800 stores and 100 or so effected in Texas by the storm, was relatively negligible to the overall number. OK, great. thanks. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Hi. Thank you very much. Mike, you said you were significantly more diligent if I'm quoting you right, in lowering cost to the vendors and I have a couple questions about this. First, I'm just curious, can you provide some color on what this means in practical purposes? What have you done in terms of your negotiations with vendors that are working for you? And I'm talking about prices, not just really fill rates. And then second, in the food and home industry, the manufacturers have much higher margins than the grocers and usually, in any supply chain, those higher-margin players have the leverage. You and some of your competitors are doing things lately. You're pressing on prices. You're asking for better delivery times. You're demanding it, right? That kind of suggests your leverage is a little bit stronger than what I might have thought. Otherwise, I guess your vendors would just say, ""No, we won't pay these fees. We won't lower our prices."" So, forgive the long question, but does this imply that maybe because of more private label and whatever else you're doing to distinguish yourselves that sort of power tide is shifting a little bit in favor of the retailers, or is that too optimistic? We've never really tried to look at it as a power struggle and we really appreciate the partnerships we have with our CBG suppliers. Relative to the fine for the late trucks, it doesn't do us any good to have folks around our warehouse expecting trucks to show up, and the truck doesn't show up or that we have orders in for product from our stores and we get a truck from a supplier that doesn't have all the goods on it we expected it to have on it. And not only are we incurring the cost of the warehouse with those idle workers, it also winds up affecting sales when we can't fulfill the orders that our stores have asked for and then we can wind up with out-of-stocks or low stock inside the store. And it's really just trying to strengthen that relationship of ""If it's supposed to get here today and it's supposed to be a full truckload, well, get it to us today and make it a full truckload."" This isn't within minutes of a window. This is a relatively wide window at this point. And I would say the biggest thing on cost of goods, we've always at the category manager level done a really good job of negotiating the cost of goods. There have been times when they've made decisions historically that somewhere up the chain in the company we may have overturned a decision they made which causes them to think, ""Well, somebody doesn't have my back when I negotiate really diligently and get us a better cost of goods on a product."" I can tell you today the category manager negotiates a price or product in our store or not in our store. That decision stands there because they're the ones with all the data and information about how that decision's made. All those decisions are made. We don't just do this ""Give us the best price or you're out of the store."" It's all made with a powerful data of 8451 behind it to understand consumer preferences and substitutability and things like that. So, it's a pretty broad-based approach and I would say those two generally are the highlights. And we really do try to work with our partners on taking costs out of both of our systems and then giving that to the customer. We're very transparent in terms of the way we're negotiating and why we negotiate what we do and the data, as Mike mentioned, is incredibly important to understand how does a customer view each item and what's its substitutability across items, and that's how we use what we do, but what we do it in a very transparent way. OK, thank you. Thanks, Ken. Operator Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to talk about the fourth quarter and general merchandise, little off-topic here, but just wondering if I was going to go and buy a TV or something from Fred Meyer up in Seattle, can I get that delivered. In other words, can I buy it online and have it shipped to my home? I was on the website and seemed like that ability was there and I just wanted to see it is and I'm missing it. Just kind of wanted some clarity. Our 'ship to home' is an evolving process, Scott, and we said in our in our conference call in the prepared remarks we had a record Black Friday and Fred Meyer had a record Black Friday and when you talk about TVs, that's a record Black Friday relative to a few years ago where electronics would have been a huge part of their Black Friday. And it's not every customer wants things delivered to their house. There's still a joy and excitement of going out and shopping for things, and we'll continue to offer and over time offer more opportunities and options for our customers on how they want products delivered but when you think about this year's Black Friday being a record year, I think folks claiming brick and mortar's dead and everything's going to get shipped to home are a little bit ahead of themselves. The other thing, as we mentioned last month at the investor meeting, you have a certain amount of resources and we're doubling down on food and making sure that we're doing everything we can on food. We will start addressing things beyond just food but first of all, we just wanted to make sure that we got food positioned appropriately. This is a good transition to my next comment because obviously store traffic for general merchandise was down quite a bit last holiday. It could be down quite a bit this holiday if some of the early numbers are verified. So I guess you guys called out the one-to-one comp and I guess, from an analyst's perspective, and we just had Costco put up adjusting for the calendar a shift of 7. Your largest competitor, Wal-Mart, I think, told us that their food comps are best they've seen in years and above their 2.7 that they reported. So, I guess I'm just trying to understand, especially with the gross margins being up so much in the quarter, why your sales seem to be lagging in an economy that's just racing and how you guys would frame it. I mean, clearly, again some traditional supermarkets are doing OK but net-net on the on the entire economy, it doesn't look good at all and I was just wondering if you have any thoughts. Well, as we mentioned in our call, overall in identicals we felt good about the progress we continue to make. We continue to focus on improving that tonnage, improved more than the number. As you know, as customers switch to our own brands, the retail price for that item is less as well. So, there are some of those things that are within the numbers. Now, with that said, we are not satisfied with where our identicals are and we continue to push to improve our identicals from where we are and see a lot of exciting opportunities to do that. Rodney, do you worry, I know that CEO of HighView was talking about maybe these big stores don't work. They've stopped going into Minneapolis with their 90,000 to 105,000 and they're building actually two e-commerce fulfillment centers. Do you worry a little bit about the asset and that the center of the store is going to transition more and more online? And I'll yield. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks, Scott. Yeah, it's kind of fascinating so far. If you look at our big stores, they continue to perform very, very well and our customers tell us they like them. Now, one of the things that's incredibly important is what do you put inside of a store and then how long does it take to shop the store and things like that. And what we have found is actually the flexibility of the store actually allows you to change it a lot. So, if you look at how we use the inside of the space, we significantly allocate additional space for fresh departments today versus what we would have two or three or four years ago. You started out your question, ""Do you worry about?"" I worry about everything but what we're seeing is the customer continues to connect well with that format and what is really important for the customer is the ability to shop inside of a store when they want, the ability to pick up when they want, and in some cases get a delivery. So, it's really all those things together is what our customers are telling us and showing us. And certain parts of the store in the middle is declining but I can tell you pet and some of those categories continue to have great growth. So, you don't use the space the same as what you used to use either. Thanks very much. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Chris Prykull from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you provide any more details as to how space optimization at the initial stores is progressing and maybe specifically how do you think about the sales elasticity of promotions in center store relative to perishables today versus maybe three or four or five years ago, and does that factor into your space-optimization efforts and how you think about utilizing vendor allowances and price investments by category going forward? The space optimization so far continues to make good progress. If you look to a store that's been changed, if you talk to our store teams, they would give you a whole list of things that they were surprised about what was done and they would also tell you after they got used to it and the customer got used to it, they actually like the changes. And there are as many things that are operationally focused on helping to have better variety [inaudible] stocks and some of those things for our customers. The allowances that a vendor would give us would not be something that would cause us to affect space optimization but then obviously we look at profitability by the vendor, profitability by item and whether you carry an item and things like that would be things that you would certainly be in negotiations with. On pricing elasticity, it really depends. Every store would actually have different pricing elasticity. Every customer behaves differently and that's one of the reasons why we think the 8451 insights are so important and critical is being able to connect with that customer one on one versus a group. Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up to Scott's question. Can you give any further details as to how you envision your store footprint both the size of the box and maybe the number longer term, particularly given your greater focus on share of the stomach as opposed to traditional food at home as well as online? Does the look of a Kroger Store evolve over time? Well, the look of a Kroger Store always evolves over time and the other day I was in one of our marketplace stores. I think the store is four or five years old and we just took a lot of the work from space optimization and put it into the store. So, the store wasn't very old but we made a lot of changes to it. So going forward, I would totally expect that to continue to be the case. I believe when you look at going forward, you'll see a broader range of physical stores but customers, I think, will continue to have all the above because if you look at stores where we have a very developed ClickList, customers typically shop at more than one of our stores. Sometimes they'll shop at big stores, sometimes they'll shop at small stores and it really depends on their mission and they'll use ClickList as well. So, we would continue to believe that it's very important to have multiple site stores going forward. Great, that's helpful. And just one housekeeping, if I could. I may have missed it in the [inaudible] but as part of your Fiscal 2018 outlook, do you expect full-year FIFO operating margin ex-fuel to be up or down? Didn't go there. Got it. Thanks, guys. We have time for one more question. Operator And our final question comes from Chris Mandeville from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Hey, thanks for fitting me in. Rodney, just thinking about some of the newer initiatives that you referenced in the press release, programs like in-store dining, private label flowers, apparel. I know they're not needle-movers by any means but I'm wondering if you could kind of take us through your thought process on why you decided to allocate capital to these little areas as opposed to maybe partner up or acquire your way into some of these businesses with established brands. And then, I guess, inversely I'm sure the capital demand is quite different but why did you choose to partner on delivery when we know that controlling that relationship with the end customer is so important? Yea, for us on delivery, the way that we partnered, we still have the relationship with the customer and we decide which third party to deliver because the point that you made is the reason that we always want to make sure that the relationship stays with us versus a third party. In terms of some of the other things, why we did it on our own versus partnering with somebody, we would always, when we decide to do something, evaluate and look at whether we should partner with someone or not. A lot of times it's finding the right person to partner with and that's usually just as hard as anything else because you have to have somebody that really believes that two plus two will equal five or 10, or something and that you share accordingly and that's always hard to do. So, we're always open and we will seek to partner with somebody when they accelerate what we're doing. So, if you think about some of the delivery things, those relationships, the reason we did it is it accelerated what we were able to do. So, we're very open to third-party relationships but it really has to be something that works for both. And then just lastly, I know you weren't willing to necessarily go there at the Analyst Day but are you willing to disclose online sales in total at this point, I see the percentage gains, but they don't really tell us all that much. And then, Rodney, you used the phrase ""a unique relationship"" with Instacart. I'm not sure if I'm reading into that at all but did you mean anything by that in terms of you having a different relationship with them versus other retailers? In terms of our overall digital business at this point, we would not break out the dollars. It is becoming something that's a reasonable size and at some point in the future, we will be willing to break it out, but today we just don't think it's that helpful. In terms of the reason I said ""a unique relationship,"" it really was a relationship that we felt that worked for us and worked for Instacart allowed both us to grow our business. I don't know enough about their relationships with other retailers to be able to compare them, but for us, the thing that was really important was something that leveraged their experience and technology and people but leveraged our assets and we kept a relationship with the customer. So, that was what we did and it's unique in terms of we really view that it will help both of us continue to grow our business. All right, thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks, Chris. Before we end today's call, as you know, I always like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in. Our purpose for our Restock Kroger is what you make possible every day. By uplifting each other, our customers, and our communities, Kroger's Zero Hunger Zero Waste plan is our vision to end hunger in the communities we call home and eliminate waste across the company by 2025. Last week, the day before Thanksgiving, I had the good fortune to celebrate Friends Giving with our Roundy's team in Wisconsin. I also had the chance to personally visit a couple of local food pantries, plus a really cool innovative mobile market, and the mobile market is a former NASCAR trailer converted into a fresh grocery store that goes twice a day to underserved neighborhoods around Milwaukee, really cool stuff, really cool partnership. And that's just one example. As I have the opportunity and be with our team and seeing how much we do in just one division for so many people that are in need, it really takes my personal gratitude to a whole new level. I also happen to know that the Kroger Foundation just donated a brand new truck to Feeding America, Southwest Virginia Food Bank in our mid-Atlantic region. It actually came complete with a big, red bow for the holidays. I was equally impressed to learn that in only 24 hours of Giving Tuesday, our associates and customers helped us donate over 1 million meals through social media. The generosity of our associates and customers never ceases to amaze me and inspire me. It's just simply wonderful. This is what it really means to live our purpose, to feed that human spirit. Thank you for all you do each and every day. I wish you and your family a Merry Christmas and happy holidays. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, the conference call has now concluded. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Image source: Getty Images. At the very least, you should aim to have an emergency fund with three months' worth of living expenses. Amassing enough to cover six months of expenses would be even more ideal and would give you a dose of added protection. Fail to put some money in the bank, and you'll have no choice but to resort to credit card debt should you lose your job, fall ill, or encounter a whopper of a bill that your regular paycheck can't cover. And that could set the stage for a pretty bad year, financially speaking. We all know that it's important to save for retirement, and we all know that it's best to take steps to lower our taxes. But if you don't contribute to a retirement plan next year, you'll fail on both fronts. In 2018, you can put up to $18,500 into your 401(k) if you're under 50. If you're 50 or older, you get a $6,000 catch-up that raises this limit to $24,500. Don't have an employer-sponsored plan? No problem. You can still open an IRA and save for retirement that way. The annual contribution limits for next year are $5,500 for workers under 50, and $6,500 for those 50 and over. How much can you shave off your tax bill by contributing to either type of account? Well, it depends on your effective tax rate, but if that rate is 30%, and you set aside $5,000 for the year, you'll save yourself $1,500, just like that. Plus, the money you put into your account will get to grow on a tax-deferred basis, which means you won't pay taxes on your investment gains until the time comes to take withdrawals in retirement. Talk about a win-win. If you're socking away money for retirement, you're already off to a pretty good start. But if you're not investing that money wisely, you're doing it -- and yourself -- a disservice. A Wells Fargo study released last year found that 60% of Americans are investing too conservatively for retirement and are risking not having enough income to fund their golden years. If you've been avoiding stocks in your portfolio, it's time to change your strategy. Though it's true that bonds are a more stable investment than stocks, they'll also give you a much lower return over time. Check out the following table, which highlights the difference between a stock-focused retirement portfolio versus two safer approaches: Investment Style Average Annual Return Total Accumulated Over 30 Years* Aggressive: stocks 8% $680,000 Moderately aggressive: stocks and bonds 6% $474,000 Moderately conservative: mostly bonds 4% $336,000 Table by author. *Assumes a $500 monthly investment. As you can see, going heavy on bonds instead of stocks could cost you $344,000 in retirement income. And that's a lot of money to potentially give up. It's not a secret that credit card debt can wreak havoc on your finances, yet consumer debt recently reached an all-time high in the U.S. If you want to come out ahead financially in 2018, then the last thing you should do is charge up a storm on your credit card and carry that balance indefinitely. Not only will doing so cost you a boatload in interest charges, but it could also lower your credit score in the process. That means that when the time comes to borrow money responsibly, such as for a mortgage, you'll be less likely to get approved or less likely to snag the best rates out there. It's estimated that a good 39 million Americans can't actually afford their homes. Though it's natural to want the nicest house on the block with the best amenities available, think twice before you purchase a home you know you'll struggle to keep up with. As a general rule, your housing costs (including your property taxes and insurance) should never exceed 30% of your take-home pay. To further protect yourself, factor maintenance costs into that percentage so that you have more wiggle room in your budget for other things that inevitably creep up, whether it's healthcare expenses or auto repairs. Taking on too much house could put you in a position where you're struggling to keep up with your remaining bills, so resist the urge to buy that mini mansion, and adjust your expectations accordingly. A new year means a new chance to improve your financial picture. Avoid these money-crushing mistakes, and you'll be better positioned to come out ahead in 2018. ","

Tony Armstrong,12072017,MarketWatch,11302017,"Published: Dec 6, 2017 7:48 a.m. ET Stay cool. Gather evidence By This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. Standing in front of an ATM that just ate your cash deposit without crediting your account or issuing a receipt can leave you feeling helpless, and even hopeless. Just ask Linda Murray Bullard, who recently found herself in that situation. “A horrific experience!” says Murray Bullard, who owns a business consulting firm in Chattanooga, Tennessee. How common her experience is isn’t clear. The ATM Industry Association doesn’t have data that would show the scope of this issue, according to Michael Lee, the group’s chief executive, who says he hasn’t “heard of a single reported case of this happening.” The American Bankers Association didn’t respond to requests for comment when asked about such incidents. However, Murray Bullard certainly isn’t alone: Based on scores of online message board discussions on the topic, cash-hungry ATMs aren’t a completely unheard-of phenomenon. And considering that 68% of Americans use ATMs at least once a month, according to a 2014 Nielsen study, it’s worth knowing how to respond to this potentially frustrating situation. Although it may not come naturally to some people, the name of the game is keeping your cool. For Murray Bullard, that meant staying put and immediately reaching out to her bank. “When it chewed up my money, I refused to move before I contacted the bank and spoke to a live person,” she says. “The lady assured me it would be corrected the next business day and someone would call me as soon as it was corrected. They did just what she said, and my deposit was credited.” Shane Allen, media relations director of Personal Trainer Food, a Fort Worth, Texas-based company that helps consumers create healthy meal plans, found himself in a similar predicament a few months ago when he tried to deposit $800 at a Capital One

                                   cash machine. “The ATM took the cash and printed out a receipt saying there’d been an error, and that I should call a certain phone number,” Allen says. His bank assured him that it would look into the situation when he called and credited his account for the time being. “They warned me that they would investigate all the deposits that day and, if for some reason they determine the deposit was less, they’d take it out of my account,” Allen says. A month later, Allen received a letter in the mail saying that the bank had completed its investigation and determined that he did, in fact, deposit $800. “Overall, I think they handled it very well,” he says. Capital One didn’t immediately respond to a request for a comment. If an ATM eats your deposit, you should contact your bank immediately, says Kristopher Dahl, a spokesman for Wells Fargo.

                                   That will spur an examination of the incident. “I can’t share much information about the investigation process, but all transactions are logged, and we utilize our logs to research these transactions,” Dahl says, adding that those instances happen rarely. “If a problem with an ATM results in any account fees, we will also credit their account for those fees.” As well as eating cash, ATMs also swallow checks on occasion, as Natalie Nicole Gilbert can attest to. “If you must use an ATM and it goes awry, note the time of the failed deposit,” says Gilbert, a Los Angeles-based musician who recently tried depositing a check worth about $1,000. Because she didn’t usually use that particular account to make deposits of that size, the transaction “tripped a security feature that suspected potential fraud,” Gilbert says. As a result, her financial institution froze her funds while trying to verify that the check was valid. “It was particularly inconvenient, as I’d intended to pay my rent that month with that check, and the hold didn’t release for another week or more after my rent was due,” she says. Gilbert recommends that customers take smartphone pictures of the error screen on the ATM if one comes up during a botched transaction. She adds that people may want to copy the serial numbers on bills before inserting currency into a machine. The more evidence you can gather, the better. Although faulty ATMs can make you feel extremely powerless, the ball is very much in your court to fix the situation. Your first move should be to alert your bank or credit union, which will investigate before crediting your account. Tony Armstrong is a staff writer covering personal finance for NerdWallet.

,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump took aim at the third-largest U.S. bank on Friday, writing on Twitter that government fines and penalties against Wells Fargo & Co could be hiked amid an ongoing sales scandal. “Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!” Trump wrote. Reuters reported on Thursday that the new acting head of the U.S. consumer finance watchdog agency was reviewing whether Wells Fargo should pay tens of millions of dollars over alleged mortgage lending abuse, according to three sources familiar with the dispute. It was not clear whether Trump was reacting to the Reuters’ report. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo has been rocked by a sales scandal in which thousands of its employees enrolled perhaps millions of customers in products they did not want or need. Last year, the bank paid a record $100 million fine to the CFPB over an earlier phony accounts scandal. The White House referred questions about Trump’s tweet to a spokesman for Mick Mulvaney, the new interim head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). John Czwartacki, senior advisor at the CFPB, said the regulator would not comment on any pending enforcement matters, but added that “as a matter of principle, Acting Director Mulvaney shares the President’s firm commitment to punishing bad actors and protecting American consumers.” The Republican president has pledged to roll back rules put in place under his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama that put Wall Street on a tighter leash after the 2007-09 financial crisis. The financial industry is hoping regulatory agencies will adopt a less aggressive approach to fines under the Trump administration. Those hopes were raised when Mulvaney, Trump’s pick to lead the CFPB on a temporary basis, told reporters this week that he was reviewing more than 100 enforcement actions currently in the works, including litigation, cases that are being settled and investigations. Mulvaney said he would delay at least two enforcement actions, without naming them. “The notion that this administration is or will be tough on Wall Street doesn’t pass the laugh test, and that fact is evident in deeds, not tweets,” said Lisa Donner, the executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of groups advocating for tougher oversight of the financial system. Mulvaney is part of a changing of the guard, and change of approach, at key U.S. financial regulatory agencies, as Trump administration promises to unburden banks from red tape and crisis-era rules are slowly being implemented. The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the agency that  regulates many of the largest U.S. banks, wants to ease up on severance pay restrictions imposed on Wells Fargo in the wake of its sales scandal, according to a Reuters report. In addition, the Republican-controlled Congress in October killed a rule that allowed customers to band together to sue financial firms over disputes. Wells Fargo said in October that it would refund homebuyers who were wrongly charged fees to secure low mortgage rates, a black mark against a lender that already had been roiled by scandal over its treatment of customers. Richard Cordray, the Obama-era official who left as head of the CFPB last month, had approved the terms of a possible settlement with Wells Fargo over the fees, according to three sources familiar with the matter. That proposal envisioned a Wells Fargo payout of tens of millions of dollars but likely short of the record $100 million payout it made to the CFPB last year. Legal experts said it is highly unusual for presidents to weigh in on specific financial enforcement actions. Even regulatory chiefs typically do not comment on ongoing investigations, concerned that public remarks could compromise the case in some way. Trump’s talk of potentially higher fines appeared to have only a moderate impact on shares of Wells Fargo, which generates more than $20 billion in annual earnings. Its stock was up about 0.05 percent to $59.39 in afternoon trading, down from a session high of $59.89. Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk declined to comment on Trump’s tweet. ","

,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"DiNapoli oversees the New York State Common Retirement Fund, the third largest U.S. state pension fund with more than $200 billion in assets and a top 50 Wells Fargo shareholder with nearly 14 million shares. “The bank has not reassured investors that its pay practices encourage long-term, sustainable growth,” DiNapoli said in an emailed statement. Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk said the bank values input from shareholders and is reviewing the proposal. Wells Fargo’s scandal began in September 2016 when the bank settled with regulators over the creation of potentially up to 2.1 million fake accounts, a number the bank later revised to as high as potentially 3.5 million. Compensation incentives “contributed to problematic behavior,” in the creation of fake accounts, according to an internal report by Wells Fargo’s board of directors released on April 10. Other problems have since come to light in different areas of the bank, including auto insurance, residential mortgages, and foreign exchange trading. The proposal by DiNapoli requests that Wells Fargo’s board prepare a report disclosing detailed information about incentive-based pay throughout the bank. Should the board agree to produce such a report, DiNapoli would withdraw the proposal, according to a letter by his staff to Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan. Barring such an agreement, DiNapoli requested the proposal be included on the bank’s proxy statement to be voted on by shareholders at Wells Fargo’s annual meeting in the spring. DiNapoli submitted a similar proposal last year, but Wells Fargo got permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to leave it off the proxy, arguing it was similar to another shareholder proposal calling for a broader report on several matters, including “evidence that incentive systems are aligned with customers’ best interests.” ","

,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"The San Francisco-based bank said in October that it would refund homebuyers who were wrongly charged fees to secure low mortgage rates - a black mark against a lender which has already been roiled by scandal over its treatment of customers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) had been investigating the mortgage issue since early this year, said one current and two former officials. The agency accepted an internal review from Wells Fargo and set settlement terms in early November, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak about internal discussions. But that matter and roughly a dozen others are in question now that Mick Mulvaney, the agency chief tapped by President Donald Trump, has said he is reviewing the CFPB’s prior work. Richard Cordray, the former CFPB director who initiated the Wells Fargo action, approved the terms of a possible settlement before stepping down, said the sources. That proposal envisions a Wells Fargo payout of tens of millions of dollars but likely short of the record, $100 million payout the bank made to the CFPB last year over a phony accounts scandal, sources said. More than 100,000 borrowers paid the fee to lock in a fixed-rate loan between September 2013 and February 2017, the bank has said, adding it believes a “substantial number” of those charges were appropriate. A Wells Fargo spokesman on Thursday declined to comment on the CFPB actions but said the bank was committed to returning any fees that were wrongly levied. “Over the next few months we will be contacting other customers who paid those fees and will provide refunds,” said spokesman Tom Goyda. Mulvaney has pledged to examine enforcement work that Cordray had left unfinished, which includes the potential Wells Fargo sanctions. In an interview with the Washington Times newspaper last week, Mulvaney said he is reviewing 14 open enforcement matters that Cordray left on his desk. A CFPB official said that review should not taint any eventual settlements. “Acting Director Mulvaney made it clear to staff that any pause should not and will not impact any ongoing negotiations,” said John Czwartacki, an adviser to Mulvaney. Mulvaney has moved swiftly to change course at the CFPB, which was created during President Barack Obama’s administration and has forced financial services companies to pay out $12 billion in fines and consumer relief. No new staff will be hired and no new rules will be written for industry until a review of the agency is completed, Mulvaney has said. Before he took charge of the CFPB, Mulvaney had been one of its vocal critics and called the bureau a “joke.” Mulvaney is now in a legal fight with Leandra English, another senior CFPB official, over who should lead the agency until a permanent chief can be appointed. English has vowed to defend the bureau’s existing consumer protections while Mulvaney has pledged to have the agency step out of the way of business. A federal court has so far endorsed Mulvaney’s position at the top of the bureau, but English is continuing a legal fight. One of the CFPB’s major achievements was the $100 million fine it levied on Wells Fargo last year after it was revealed that staff were opening bank accounts without customer consent. In September, Republican staff for the U.S. House of  Representatives’ Financial Services Committee asked whether that settlement was too paltry. In a report titled “Did the CFPB let Wells Fargo ‘Beat the Rap’?” Republican staff wrote that the CFPB might have had room to seek a penalty of $10 billion or more against Wells Fargo. The committee’s policy director, Brian Johnson, joined Mulvaney last week as a senior adviser to the CFPB. ","

,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"NEW YORK, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo is predicting record US Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) fund issuance of US$125bn in 2018 with little in sight to derail 2017’s strong momentum. JP Morgan sees a smaller increase and Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank expect issuance to match 2017’s robust volume. With volume of US$110bn through December 8, 2017 has been the second largest year for CLO issuance behind just 2014 when US$123.6bn of  funds were created, according to Thomson Reuters LPC Collateral data. “We don’t see a lot of catalysts that might tip this over. The capital markets remain open, the Federal Reserve has been hiking rates and people have been getting used to the idea it will be hiking but at a pace that is not too aggressive,” said Collin Chan, a CLO strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. CLOs are the largest buyers of US leveraged loans and a strong market can help US companies to refinance their debt and cut their borrowing costs. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is forecasting US$110bn of US CLO issuance in 2018 as it expects conditions will mirror 2017, according to a November 10 report. After years of regulatory uncertainty, 2018 does not present any new looming rules that could impact volume. JP Morgan is forecasting US$115bn of new US CLOs next year and US$70bn of US CLO refinancings and resets. Deutsche Bank is forecasting US$110bn of US CLO issuance in 2018. Barclays is offering the most pessimistic view among its peers, suggesting US$90bn to US$100bn in 2018, down from 2017, and Morgan Stanley sees a slight decrease to US$100bn. Concerns that risk-retention regulations that force CLO managers to hold five percent of their fund would dampen volume in the US$491bn US market were shrugged off as new structures were raised to comply with the rule, bringing in additional investors and buttressing issuance, which has tempered the need for consolidation. “This market has been able to raise capital to solve for risk-retention compliance so that didn’t end up consolidating managers the way we thought it might,” Chan said. Bullish 2018 forecasts are a far cry from the end of last year when banks were predicting just US$50bn to US$70bn of volume in 2017, similar to the US$72.4bn of issuance in 2016. If realized, that US$50bn estimate would have put volume at the lowest level since 2011 when just US$13.2bn of deals was arranged, according to LPC Collateral data. But after a strong start to the year – the US$52.4bn of CLOs issued in the first six months of 2017 was 100% higher than at the same point a year earlier – banks increased their forecasts, with some analysts suggesting as much as US$95bn in volume. The market surpassed the US$95bn mark on November 1. (Reporting by Kristen Haunss; Editing by Tessa Walsh) ","

It has also given rewards from its credit card program to mortgage borrowers. It has to use such tactics to expand its business since it is barred by law from growing via acquisitions in the United States, as long as it holds more than 10 percent of insured deposits. Amazon is an important customer of JPMorgan’s credit card business, which processes many of its online payments and issues co-branded cards for the retailer. But he said that investment should pay off by satisfying increasing customer demand for mobile banking services. Banks believe they can save money with more digital processing of transactions. After questions about gender relations, Dimon, who has recently promoted women to make up half of the bank’s operating committee, said some employees have asked him how to respond to inappropriate behavior by clients. He said he advised them to “tell the client don’t touch me again...Be willing to fight. Be willing to fight back.” ","

,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The surprise victory by Democrats in Tuesday’s Alabama election for a U.S. senator is prompting fund managers to prepare for more losses by the Republican party in the 2018 mid-term Congressional elections. Fund managers from Federated Investors, Wells Fargo, James Funds and LPL Financial are among those that are moving into the shares of retailers, banks, industrials and technology firms that may benefit from strong global economic growth abroad and tax cuts for high income wage earners at home, even if the Democratic party makes gains in next year’s elections. “Tax reform was the big thing from an economic perspective, and if I’ve got it then I’ve got it. If this (next year’s election) makes it harder for Republicans to pass an immigration bill or trade restrictions then that’s even better” because it reduces threats to global economic growth, said Steven Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York, which has $363 billion in assets under management. “You are going to have more money in the pockets of both consumers and of corporations, and these companies are most exposed to where that money will be spent,” he said. Historically, the U.S. stock market has done well during periods when opposing political parties have control of the presidency and at least one house of Congress. This time, however, the more influential factor looks to be the strength of the global economy. In the U.S, the economy grew at its fastest pace in three years during the third quarter this year, while the economy of the eurozone is on pace for its largest expansion in a decade. In October, the International Monetary Fund raised its outlook for global economic growth to a rate of 3.7 percent in 2018, helping to push emerging market stocks up to six-year highs. “We haven’t had anything like this on a global growth scale since 2010,” said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, which has $560 billion in assets under management. “Against that backdrop, more gridlock in Washington is not a bad thing, because you won’t have any extreme moves one way or another.” Detrick expects cyclical value stocks, especially financials and industrials, to outpace the market in the year ahead as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates and corporations start to increase their capital expenditures. The move to invest in stocks that might benefit from gridlock in Washington D.C., if the Democrats regain at least one house in Congress next year, is a reversal from a year ago, when fund managers piled into infrastructure, defense and small-capitalization stocks in anticipation of Republican legislative victories in the 2016 elections. Dubbed the ‘Trump Trade’ last year, the move helped push the U.S. dollar up to multi-year highs and sent the broad S&P 500 index up more than 10 percent between November and March this year. Now, however, fund managers are looking at companies that can benefit even if Republicans are not able to legislate in Congress. He expects that Democrats will win at least at least one house of Congress in 2018, limiting the impact of Washington on the stock market until the presidential election in 2020. “It’s looking more and more like the tax plan will be the one legislative victory that Republicans will have, and there won’t be anything else out of Washington unless it is truly bi-partisan,” he said.

,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc said on Wednesday that it would launch a new streaming television service next year after buying startup Layer3 TV for an undisclosed amount. The moves come as competitors seek ways to provide content to win over customers in a saturated mobile market, and after the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier and No. 4 rival Sprint Corp ended merger talks last month. T-Mobile Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter said last week at an investor conference that the company would now focus on smaller, “tuck-in” acquisitions. T-Mobile plans to launch a subscription service with advertising next year using Layer3’s technology platform and relationships with content providers. The company will create a “variety of offers,” some low cost, its executives said on a conference call with reporters. While the industry has shifted to skinnier cable bundles, Denver-based Layer3 TV, founded in 2013, has focused more on traditional pay-TV packages, offering more than 275 high-definition channels and 25,000 on-demand titles in five U.S. cities. The company, started by industry veterans Jeff Binder and Dave Fellows, has marketed itself as a next-generation cable service, offering integration of online content with linear, improved customer service and its own proprietary network for higher quality video. While T-Mobile will not rule out original content, it will not be a focus to start, Chief Operating Officer Mike Sievert said. Sprint in November said it would offer unlimited data plan customers free subscriptions to the streaming service Hulu LLC, two months after T-Mobile introduced a similar offer with Netflix Inc. AT&T Inc, which is in the process of buying Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion, has already started bundling the premium channel HBO with wireless service. T-Mobile’s service will enter a crowded market for online television streaming that includes competitors such as AT&T’s DirecTV Now and Dish Network Corp’s Sling TV. The wireless carrier said it expected its 17,000 retail stores and more than 30 million smartphone shipments per year to help drive customer trials. “We believe the near-term revenue and profitability outlook will be more muted as T-Mobile scales the product and integrates it with their wireless customer base,” said Jennifer Fritzsche, analyst at Wells Fargo, in a research note. “But we would not underestimate T-Mobile longer-term in the TV space after the disruption they’ve caused in the traditional mobile ecosystem.” T-Mobile shares rose 0.5 percent to close at $63.83.

,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices rose in November as gasoline prices surged and the cost of other goods increased, leading to the largest annual gain in nearly six years. The fairly strong report from the Labor Department on Tuesday suggested a broad acceleration in wholesale price pressures, which could assuage concerns among some Federal Reserve officials over persistently low inflation. “This demand-led price push from higher commodity prices is a classic early warning signal that consumer goods will also see increasing inflationary pressures,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month, advancing by the same  margin for three straight months. In the 12 months through November, the PPI shot up 3.1 percent. That was the biggest gain since January 2012 and followed a 2.8 percent rise in October. Economists had forecast the PPI rising 0.3 percent last month and increasing 2.9 percent from a year ago. A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services also rose 0.4 percent last month. The so-called core PPI had increased by 0.2 percent for two straight months. It rose 2.4 percent in the 12 months through November, the largest gain since the series started in August 2014, after increasing 2.3 percent in October. The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies on the data, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. U.S. stock index futures were trading mostly higher. The broad rise in producer prices supports views that weak inflation readings experienced through the first half of the year probably were temporary. Some Fed officials worry that the factors that held down inflation early in the year could become more persistent. The Fed officials were due to gather for a two-day policy meeting starting later on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday, for a third time this year, with a robust labor market and strengthening economy expected to overshadow policymakers’ earlier concerns about tame inflation. The central bank tracks the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, which has undershot the Fed’s 2 percent target for nearly 5-1/2 years. “The pickup over the year will be welcomed by the Fed as an indication that inflation is gradually moving up,” said Sarah House, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. Inflation data on Wednesday is expected to show the consumer price index rising 0.4 percent in November after nudging up 0.1 percent in October, according to a Reuters survey. The core CPI is seen rising 0.2 percent for a second straight month. Last month, gasoline prices surged 15.8 percent, the biggest gain since August 2009, after dropping 4.6 percent in October. Gasoline accounted for two thirds of the 1.0 percent increase in the final demand goods index. There were also increases in the prices of light motor trucks, pharmaceutical preparations, beef, residential electricity and jet fuel. Wholesale food prices rose 0.3 percent in November after increasing 0.5 percent in October. Prices for services gained 0.2 percent last month after increasing 0.5 percent in October. Core goods climbed 0.3 percent in November, rising by the same margin for a third consecutive month. Prices for passenger cars accelerated 0.5 percent last month, the largest increase since December 2016, after being unchanged in October. The cost of healthcare services was unchanged last month after rising 0.3 percent in October. Those costs feed into the Fed’s preferred core PCE price index. ","

Alan Farley,12142017,Investopedia,12072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) stock is testing 2015 resistance despite a presidential tongue-lashing and government review that could yield tens of millions in fees and penalties as punishment for wrongly charged mortgages and a 2016 sales scandal. Bullish fundamentals have proved more potent than shady business dealings in the most recent ramp, with deregulation and yield-steepening rate hikes likely to increase 2018 profits. The stock has underperformed its commercial rivals since the scandal story broke in 2016, stuck in a multi-year trading range while competitors have lifted to bull market highs. However, Wells Fargo could play catch-up when penalties are issued and fresh apologies hit the newswires, telling investors and long-term market timers to consider this special situation play for their 2018 portfolios. (For more, see: Trump Says Fines Against Wells Fargo Could Be Increased.) WFC Long-Term Chart (1990 – 2017) A steep correction bottomed out at a split-adjusted $1.69 in 1990, giving way to an uptrend that gathered strong momentum into the 1993 peak at $7.25. The stock sold off into the fourth quarter of 1994 and took off in a fresh trend advance, adding points at a rapid pace into 1998, when it stalled in the low $20s in reaction to the Asian Contagion. High volatility levels took control into the new millennium while the stock held its ground, posting new highs A rising wedge pattern controlled price action into the second half of the decade, with contracting volatility into 2006, when the uptrend stalled in the mid-$30s. Bulls failed several breakout attempts into the second half of 2007, yielding a steep decline into September 2008, when a one-day short squeeze reached the mid-$40s. Those gains evaporated in a historic crash, dumping the stock to a 13-year low in the single digits in the first quarter of 2009. It took more than four years for the subsequent bounce to reach the 2008 high, ahead of a 2014 breakout that reached $58.76 in July 2015. It then rolled into a correction, dropping in cascading waves that found support in the low $40s. The stock turned sharply higher after the presidential election, returning to 2015 resistance in March 2017 and posting a higher low in September. It has acted well throughout the fourth quarter, completing a two-year cup and handle breakout pattern. (See also: How Wells Fargo Became One of the Biggest Banks in America.) WFC Short-Term Chart (2015 – 2017) Vertical selling impulses since 2014 have shaken out many shareholders, dropping on-balance volume (OBV) to a five-year low in October 2016. Bullish 2017 price action has failed to eliminate this steep deficit, keeping the indicator's long series of lower highs and lower lows intact. This predicts that Wells Fargo will turn lower a final time, carving a relatively narrow trading range that could build much stronger sponsorship. The failure of sidelined capital to respond to the next downturn could be devastating to bulls, given the strongly bearish OBV divergence, eventually breaking the cup and handle pattern and dropping the stock back into the $40s. Price action between $54 and $57 should be instructive in this regard, marking a natural price zone for funds and institutions to reload positions abandoned during the adverse news flow. Meanwhile, a breakout into the $60s that lacks volume support is likely to fizzle out quickly and generate extended sideways action at or just above the 2015 high. Accumulation should play catch-up at that time, or a failed breakout is likely, marking a major top that could also end the multi-year uptrend. A breakout above the red indicator line would signal the first sign of bullish control, whether the stock moves higher or lower from here.

Well Fargo has underperformed its rivals since it reported an epic 2016 sales scandal and has suffered from fresh self-inflicted wounds since that time.

Donna Fuscaldo,12142017,Investopedia,12072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) may have cornered the market in giving loyal customers a break with its Prime subscription service, but that doesn’t mean companies can’t take a page from the e-commerce giant, namely JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). Speaking during a Wells Fargo & Co webcast that was covered by Reuters this week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the financial services giant is going to get more into so-called “relationship pricing” in which the bank gives customers more at different levels and tiers, such as free stock trades for one example. Customers who use multiple products would get more perks for being a loyal client. “We may test different types of things,” Dimon said, according to Reuters. JPMorgan, as well as other financial institutions, already give their mortgage clients discounts if they conduct their banking with them as well and has in the past shared rewards from its credit cards with mortgage customers. (See also: JPMorgan Unleashes Smart Beta Fee Battle.) It's not surprising that JPMorgan would want to mimic Amazon and it's Prime subscription service, in which members get free two-day shipping, access to free streaming music and videos as well as discounts on products. It has been a boon to Amazon as was evident in its third annual Prime Day this past July. The shopping event in which products are deeply discounted for Prime member was its biggest sales day ever at the time. This past Black Friday has since set the new record. For the Prime event, the online retailer said sales increased more than 60% compared to last year’s Prime Day, with growth among small businesses even higher. What’s more, the company said more members joined Prime on July 11 than any other single day in the company’s history, with tens of millions of Prime members making a purchase during the event. That is up more than 50% compared to last year. This year’s Prime event ran for 30 hours and included more countries than in the past years. (See also: Amazon Prime Day Breaks Records.) In addition to taking a page from Amazon and rewarding loyalty, Dimon said during the webcast that he doesn't think the company will develop a new banking product that is as game-changing as the iPhone, despite the fact that the bank spends billions each year on new technology. He said the investments should result in meeting the demands of its customers for mobile banking services. ",JPMorgan Is Taking a Page From Amazon Prime  | Investopedia
Mark Kolakowski,12142017,Investopedia,12072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Despite legislation and regulatory initiatives designed to avert a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, an independent research arm of the U.S. Treasury Department warns that the financial system is still at great risk should one or more big banks fail, the Wall Street Journal reports. In particular, regulators in the U.S. may not be able to restructure, let alone wind down, more than one global systemically important bank (G-SIB) at a time, and do it swiftly enough to stabilize the U.S. financial system, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Financial Research (OFR) writes, per the Journal. The OFR report carries great credibility and weight, especially in light of the Treasury's critical role in stemming the 2008 crisis through measures such as the TARP program. Of the 30 G-SIBs identified worldwide, eight are based in the U.S., and include the ""big five"" of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Citigroup Inc. (C), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC). A lingering concern for the OFR is the danger posed by the big banks' portfolios of derivatives, which are valued in the trillions of dollars, and which were a major factor in the escalation of the 2008 crisis, the Journal says. Indeed, when Lehman Brothers failed in 2008, its counterparties​ terminated many of their derivatives contracts, thereby sending bigger shock waves through the financial system. The Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Bill not only set up the OFR, but also the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA), a process managed by the FDIC as an option to resolve bank failures without resorting to bankruptcy, as Lehman did. The OFR is concerned, per the Journal, that if Congress repeals the OLA provision, there might be a replay of the Lehman scenario, with the same dire consequences. While most banks hold their derivatives in entities that would be subject to FDIC oversight even without the OLA, the OFR report notes that Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley (MS) all have large derivatives positions in non-bank subsidiaries that are beyond the FDIC's purview. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body based in Basel, Switzerland, released its 2017 list of G-SIBs on November 21, based on analysis of data from year-end 2016. The list includes 30 institutions, eight of which are U.S.-based. The banks are divided into five ""buckets,"" based on the required levels of additional capital buffers, which reflect their relative importance to the global financial system, as judged by the FSB. There is no bank currently in bucket 5, the most systemically important classification. These are the eight U.S.-based banks among the G-SIBs, listed by bucket, per the FSB's November 21 report: JPMorgan Chase is the only member of bucket 4. Last year, Citigroup also was included. Bucket 3 has two other members, German-based Deutsche Bank AG (DB) and U.K.-based HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBC). The next iteration of the FSB report is scheduled for November 2018. Bank of New York Mellon provides about 80% of the clearing and settlement services for the $2 trillion U.S. repo market, and will become the sole provider in 2018, making it an even more critical financial choke point. (For more, see also: 12 Forces May Kill Stocks Despite Tax Reform Euphoria.) Additionally, BNY Mellon and State Street each have about $30 trillion of assets under custody and administration, the top two banks worldwide in this regard, combining for about 30% of the global total, per Forbes. The next two biggest are JPMorgan Chase (about $25 trillion) and Citigroup (about $18 trillion), bringing the total for this big four to a mind-boggling $103 trillion, or around half the worldwide figure, Forbes estimates. BNY Mellon and State Street provide much of the infrastructure for the fixed income markets, and thus can be said to reside on ""the epicenter of global finance,"" according to The Motley Fool. This is why, despite having smaller balance sheets than several regional banks, BNY Mellon and State Street are GSIBs while those regionals are not, The Motley Fool adds. Nonetheless, optimists point to the fact that bank profits have been healthy and growing. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley were among those institutions that beat third quarter earnings estimates comfortably, and seem on track for yet more gains, especially given the prospect of tax and regulatory reform favorable to the banks. Analysts have been raising their estimates for 2018 financial sector earnings steadily since the middle of 2017. (For more, see also: Bank Stocks Poised for More Gains in 2018: CFRA.) ""The system is far more resilient than it was when the financial crisis loomed a decade ago, but new vulnerabilities have emerged,"" the OFR states in another recent, related report quoted by the Journal. Indeed, even if U.S.-based banks remain solid, the financial system is a worldwide network, and a new crisis can be triggered anywhere around the globe.

 ,12142017,Investopedia,12072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A broker, also known as a brokerage, is a company that connects buyers and sellers of things like stocks and bonds. It is also often where an investor keeps assets. Before the middle of the twentieth century, access to stock and bond markets was restricted to the affluent who had enough money to invest and who could afford the services a human broker to place trades and act as an investment advisor. As recently as the mid-2000’s among more than 10,000 registered investment advisory firms (RIAs), the average account balance was $10,853,630 and the median account balance was $541,673. The individual with $2,000 or even $20,000 (in today’s dollars) to invest was often out of luck. In the 1970s and 1980s, a range of so-called discount brokerage firms sprang up, such as Charles Schwab, who were willing to take on a less affluent clientele. The discount brokerage business model was to accumulate a large number of small clients. The late 1990s saw the rise of the internet, and online brokerages such as E*Trade and FOREX.com were founded to seize the opportunity new technology offered. They extended the discount brokerage model by reducing commissions and minimum balances. They had far less overhead in terms of physical space and human brokers placing trades, so they could pass these savings on to the consumer. As Forbes said in October 1997, “It used to be big companies gaining the advantage through their volume production and other economies of scale, but now, small companies can use the web to trim costs shouldered by the giants. With the web, you don't need a store; you don't need as many salespeople. Such cost savings get passed on to the consumer in the form of lower prices, which in turn drive up sales.” With lower trading costs, the online brokerage account also brought with it the self-directed investor – the investor who conducts investment research on their own and then chooses which stocks and bonds to buy for their portfolio. Today, there are a wide array of traditional, discount and online self-directed brokerage platforms available, each with their own pros and cons. In addition, a new development over the past few years has been the advent of the robo-advisor. These are automated software platforms, often available as a mobile app, that take care of nearly all of your investment decisions at a very low cost. The first roboadvisor, Betterment, launched in 2008 on the heels of the Great Recession, with little fanfare. The past ten years, however, has seen an exponential growth in adoption and a flurry of both startups and existing brokerages adding a robo arm. Now there are around 100 such roboadvisors around the world, with combined assets under management expected to reach $20 trillion by the end of the decade. With all of these choices, then, let’s look at which type of brokerage is best suited for what type of investor. You should also read our complete guide to picking a stock broker. Some people prefer to have a human handle their finances. Human brokers and financial advisors have been around since the beginning of modern stock markets, and have carved out a space in today’s competitive landscape by catering to the more affluent investor (typically with $100,000 or more to invest) or those who crave the human interaction. The best financial advisors not only build and monitor investment portfolios, but hand out financial advice in all areas of their clients’ lives and provide auxiliary services such as insurance, estate planning, accounting services, and lines of credit, either themselves or via a referral network. Customers of these brokers can expect to pay around 1.00% a year or more of assets under management to your advisor, or up to $50 per trade for individual transactions. Many advisors claim that these fees are well worth the extra value that they bring, whether it be their ability to pick stocks appropriate for their clients’ portfolios, their access to unique products and offerings, or a comprehensive financial plan. Most advisors are available by phone or email and quite responsive. They also make a point to meet their clients in person at least once a year. If you value the human touch, the human advisor may provide better service than a roboadvisor. When comparing this set of brokerages, pay attention to independence. Ask if your advisor is compelled to sell a particular product or service (for example the one offered by their particular company), or are they able to offer you the best products regardless of which fund family it came from. Customers should use FINRA’s broker check tool to see if their broker has been subject to regulatory complaints or ethics violations. If they’re charging more than 1%, ask why and judge for yourself whether the extra cost is worth it. Professional certifications such as the CFP or CFA designation show that your broker has been trained and has passed a series of rigorous exams related to financial markets and planning. Online self-directed platforms include the likes of E*Trade, TD Ameritrade, and Robinhood, among many others. Today, most financial institutions and even many banks offer their customers a self-directed online brokerage account. For example Capital One, Citibank, or Wells Fargo all offer investing platforms. Almost twenty years into the 21st century, most of the discount brokerage space has consolidated into online investing. Here are our recommendations for the top online stock brokers. For the most part, these platforms leave it up to you to figure out which investments are the best, but they typically offer a suite of research and analysis tools, as well as expert recommendations and insights, to help you make informed decisions. You are then on your own to execute the trades to build your portfolio through their website or mobile app. These platforms charge a per-transaction commission, ranging from $4.95 to $9.95 per stock trade, and an extra $.50 to $1.00 per options contract. They let you trade on margin, create options strategies, and invest directly in mutual funds as well as individual stocks, foreign exchange (forex) and ETFs. See our picks for the top forex brokers. Robinhood, available only as a mobile app, is a new entrant to this space and offers free stock trading. This could be seen as a game changer, but Robinhood does not give you the suite of research, education, and analysis features that traditional online brokerages have. Still, growing competition in the space has driven online trading costs down from over $30 per trade in the late 1990s to as little as nothing on a platform like Robinhood. Online brokerages are best for the self-directed investor who knows about the markets, or knows how to conduct their own research to choose a portfolio best suited for their goals. If you’re only going to make a few trades a year, you may want to pay a little bit more per trade in order to get access to higher quality research and analysis, and if you’re a day trader, you’ll probably want to consider a site that hands out free trades to their most active users. Each online brokerage has its own strengths and weaknesses. Who you are and what you value will steer you to the one that’s best for you. For instance, some people may value the convenience of having all of their financial accounts under the same roof. Others may value interactive charting. Still others may value access to IPOs. Roboadvisors automate investing and use technology to manage your portfolio. Betterment was the first major roboadvisor that launched in 2008. Since then there has been a proliferation of both startups and existing financial companies offering this sort of algorithmic trading service. Unlike the trading algorithms that power the high-frequency trading (HFT) desks at hedge funds and banks, roboadvisors are likely to put your money to work using low-cost, indexed ETFs. In fact, it is the convergence of ultra-low fee exchange traded funds (ETFs) with low-cost technological solutions available on mobile platforms that make “robos” possible. You can now invest with as little as $1 on some platforms, with every last nickel invested, for as little as 0.15% per year in fees. Before the robos, if you had only a few hundred dollars, or even a few thousand dollars to invest, you’d have to go online to a self-directed platform. Now, with robos, you can put your $200 or $2,000 to work without having to conduct any research, pick any individual stocks, or worry about rebalancing your portfolio. Algo-based advisors place you in an efficient and diversified passive portfolio. Many of these platforms will even tax-optimize your portfolios, for example by tax-loss harvesting, a process by which an investor sells losing positions to offset the capital gains generated by winning positions. The algorithms themselves are a proprietary company secret. However, the open secret is that most of these algos are creating passive indexed strategies using low-cost ETFs and following some sort of mean-variance optimization strategy to keep things balanced as the markets rise and fall over time. Roboadvisors are therefore probably the best option for younger investors who are just getting started and have little to invest. Minimum balances are quite low, and robos such as WiseBanyan will let you in with as little as $1. These platforms are also good for people who are fans of passive investment strategies, since most often you’ll find your robo develops a portfolio of indexed ETFs on your behalf. Robos also shine for those long-term investors who simply are too busy (or unmotivated) to do their own research on which ETF has the best risk/return characteristics combined with their associated fees, costs, and tax implications. But robos are certainly not for everyone. If you are an active trader, you may find robos boring or unsophisticated. While robos are adapting to this by allowing for more customizability of portfolio choice (for example, most robos will now let you adjust your allocation weights away from their initial recommendation), it defeats the purpose of these products to start speculating on hot stocks or volatile companies within these platforms. If you are a sophisticated investor who needs margin, options trading and technical charts, a roboadvisor is probably not for you. Finally, a roboadvisor is not often going to give you personal advice (or reassurance if things appear to be going badly) over the phone. This may be changing, however; Betterment has just added a roster of financial planners to answer your calls, for example. If you choose a roboadvisor, the things to consider are primarily cost, reputation, and added services. Many robos now charge as little 0.15% per year and have no transaction costs for trades. While this segment is still young, pay attention to brand names that you can trust. Monitor the cost of extra services: some are free but others add an extra cost. For instance, tax-loss harvesting and regular account rebalancing have become a staple free services, but mortgage loans or insurance products or credit card offers may include an extra cost. [Ready to start investing? Use Investopedia's broker reviews to find brokers that fit your needs.] Which brokerage to choose is a matter of taste and it is a matter of constraint. You may really want a human advisor, but only have $100 to invest each month – so you’ll end up with a robo or self-directed. At the end of the day, your finances are your own. Whether you choose your own investments or outsource decision making to an algorithm or a human advisor, make the choice that is right for you. If you make a choice and it doesn’t feel right anymore, or if your circumstances change in a meaningful way – you should always feel that you can switch to a new broker or platform without any guilt or regret. After all, it is your money, not theirs. ",What Type of Brokerage Account Is Right for You? | Investopedia
Jeff Cox,12142017,CNBC,12072017,"President Donald Trump rejected the notion Friday that Wells Fargo would skate on penalties associated with claims of mortgage lending abuse. Reports circulated earlier this week that Mick Mulvaney, interim head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was reviewing prior settlements the agency had made in enforcement actions. Among them was a payout in the tens of millions of dollars regarding a practice in which Wells Fargo was charging borrowers fees to secure low mortgage rates. The practice reportedly affected more than 100,000 borrowers, and the bank has conceded that a ""substantial number"" of those customers were charged inappropriately. But Trump asserted in a tweet that the CFPB will not be letting Wells Fargo off the hook and said the penalties actually could increase. Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped The development comes as Mulvaney has promised substantial changes at the bureau, which he once called a ""joke."" He has vowed to examine open cases under his predecessor, Richard Cordray, who resigned last month. For its part, Wells Fargo has pledge to reimburse customers for any wrongful charges. The bank did not respond to a request for comment on Trump's tweet. ",Trump: Wells Fargo levies in mortgage cases 'will not be dropped'
Ryan Browne,12142017,CNBC,12072017,"The total market capitalization of all digital currencies has surpassed $500 billion dollars for the first time. As both Ethereum and Litecoin soared to new record highs Tuesday, the combined market value of cryptocurrencies hit an all-time high of $506 billion at about 7:40 a.m. ET Wednesday, according to Coinmarketcap data. That figure is worked out by multiplying the prices of cryptocurrencies by the total volume of those digital tokens in circulation. The market has seen unprecedented interest from investors as of late, and is now worth more than the market cap of billionaire Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway, which is currently valued at around $491 billion. The figure is also higher than the combined value of U.S. banks Citigroup and Wells Fargo, which are currently worth $201 billion and $297 billion respectively. Charles Hayter, chief executive of digital asset comparison site Crypto Compare, said his service was ""straining at the seams"" trying to cope with increased demand. ""We are entering unchartered territory with huge risks, regulatory and technologically,"" Hayter said in an email to CNBC. ""There are clear comparisons to the internet bubble. We are straining at the seams spinning up servers to cope with traffic at over 1 million users per day. There is a lot of fear and greed, but that aside there is a redefining the concept of value in the virtual world with new mechanisms for value exchange."" Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was given recognition by Wall Street for the first time Sunday after Cboe launched the first futures contracts for the asset.

 ,12142017,CNBC,12072017,"WHEN: Today, Thursday, December 7 WHERE:  CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" Following is the unofficial transcript of a CNBC EXCLUSIVE interview with Avenue Capital Chairman and CEO Marc Lasry and CNBC's Scott Wapner today at the Wells Fargo Investment Thought Leadership Forum. The interview aired Thursday, December 7 on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" (M-F 9:00AM – 11:00AM.) Following is a link to video from the interview on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/12/07/marc-lasry-stock-market-rally-could-continue-for-another-6-months-1-year.html. All references must be sourced to CNBC. MELISSA LEE: WELCOME BACK TO ""SQUAWK ON THE STREET."" LET'S SEND IT OVER TO SCOTT WAPNER AT THE WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT THOUGHT LEADERSHIP FORUM IN NEW YORK CITY SITTING DOWN WITH A SPECIAL GUEST. HI, SCOTT. SCOTT WAPNER: HEY THERE MELISSA. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT'S RIGHT. WE ARE JOINED BY RIGHT NOW MARC LASRY, CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF AVENUE CAPITAL. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. MARC LASRY: ALWAYS A PLEASURE. WAPNER: ESPECIALLY WITH THE MARKETS WHERE THEY ARE. AND IT'S FUNNY, YOU WERE ON CNBC ALMOST A YEAR AGO TO THE DAY, OK, DECEMBER 9th, 2016, YOU SAID OF THE RALLY AND DOW 20,000, ""IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE ON A SUGAR HIGH. THE QUESTION IS, HOW LONG DOES THAT CONTINUE?"" OKAY, DOW 24,000. WHAT ARE WE ON NOW – ARE WE POUNDING RED BULLLS? LASRY: NO, WE'RE ACTUALLY – I THINK PART OF IT IS ALL THE NEWS HAS BEEN POSITIVE. RIGHT? WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE ECONOMY, THE ECONOMY'S DOING WELL. SO EVERYBODY'S TALKING ALL THAT POSITIVE NEWS AND JUST IS CONTINUING TO BUY EQUITIES. SO LOOK, I THINK IT COULD CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR BECAUSE EVERYTHING'S GOOD. WAPNER: HOWARD BARKS HAS BEEN SPEAKING THE LAST COUPLE DAYS. HE WAS AT THIS CONFERENCE EARLIER TODAY. HE WAS AT ANOTHER YESTERDAY. HE SAID THE EASY MONEY HAS BEEN MADE. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? LASRY: THE EASY MONEY HAS ALWAYS BEEN MADE. RIGHT? IT'S – I THINK WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MARKET EVERY DAY, YOU NEVER THINK IT'S EASY. YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE MONEY EVERY SINGLE DAY. I THINK MY VIEW IS IT'S JUST ALWAYS HARD. SO WHAT WE TRY TO FIND IS SITUATIONS WHERE YOU GET OVERPAID FOR THAT RISK. WAPNER: WHAT DO YOU THINK THE IMPACT OF THE TAX PACKAGE IS GOING TO BE, ASSUMING IT PASSES? LASRY: WELL, I THINK IT'LL PASS. I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S GREAT FOR CORPORATIONS. IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY BAD FOR INDIVIDUALS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'VE GOT THIS HUGE TRANSFER OF WEALTH FROM INDIVIDUALS TO CORPORATIONS. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO END UP HURTING THE ECONOMY LATER ON. WAPNER: ARE YOU AS CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTIONS, THE SO-CALLED SALT AS SO MANY OF YOUR COLLEAGUES SEEM TO BE? LARRY FINK ON THE STAGE JUST A SHORT TIME AGO WAS LAMENTING THE EFFECTS OF THAT, THAT IT'S GOING TO HAVE A REAL IMPACT ON DYNAMIC CITIES, NEW YORK, AND STATES LIKE NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE. LASRY: OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT. EVERYBODY'S AN ECONOMIC ANIMAL. SO IF ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY PAYS 39%, SO LET'S JUST MAKE IT 40. NOW IF YOU'RE IN NEW YORK CITY AND NEW YORK STATE YOU'RE PAYING 54, AN EXTRA 20% MORE FOR THE LUXURY OF LIVING IN NEW YORK, YOU KNOW, THAT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT. THE SAME THING IN CALIFORNIA. SO OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT THE QUESTION IS, WILL PEOPLE WANT TO LEAVE NEW YORK TO GO TO FLORIDA AND OTHER STATES? WAPNER: DO YOU THINK THEY WILL? LASRY: I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WILL. BECAUSE IT JUST ECONOMICALLY – IT JUST COSTS YOU TOO MUCH MONEY. WAPNER: SO IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT THAT WERE IN, I SAID DOW 24,000. NEW HIGHS ALL THE TIME. WHERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY THEN FOR A GUY LIKE YOU? LASRY: WELL, I THINK FOR US, IT'S NOT IN THE EQUITY MARKETS. RIGHT? IT'S GOING TO BE IN SITUATIONS WHERE YOU'RE GETTING OVERPAID. SO FOR US IT'S GOING TO BE IN ASIA RIGHT NOW WHERE WE CAN DO DIRECT LENDING, WE'RE MAKING 15, 20% ON THOSE LOANS. IT CAN BE IN AVIATION, WHERE WE'RE BUYING END OF LIFE PLANES AND YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE 20% PLUS ON THAT. IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE ENERGY SECTOR. IT'S TRYING TO FIND AREAS WHERE OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOT COMPETING AND WHERE THE LIQUIDITY OR THE DEMAND FOR LIQUIDITY IS NOT AS HIGH BUT THE DEMAND FOR CAPITAL IS VERY HIGH. WAPNER: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF EQUITY THOUGH, THE ENVIRONMENT IS SUCH THAT DISTRESSED OPPORTUNITIES ARE LIMITED. AREN'T THEY? THERE ISN'T THAT MUCH DISTRESS OUT THERE. LASRY: THERE ISN'T THAT MUCH DISTRESS HERE IN THE U.S. IT'S MORE FOR SPECIAL SITUATIONS. BUT WHAT THERE IS IS THERE'S A REAL NEED FOR CAPITAL. SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE INVESTING IS MORE IN SPECIAL SITUATIONS AS OPPOSED TO DISTRESS. WAPNER: OK, SO THE AREA THAT I'D THINK THAT YOU ARE TAKING A LOOK AT IS THE ONE THAT WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME, RELATIVE TO AMAZON, AND THAT IS RETAIL. ARE YOU CURRENTLY ACTIVE IN RETAIL EITHER ON THE DEBT OR THE EQUITY SIDE? LASRY: SO, WE'RE ACTIVE ON THE DEBT SIDE. SO NEIMAN MARCUS WOULD BE ONE WHERE WE ACTUALLY OWN THE BONDS. YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN J. C. PENNEY. AND A COUPLE OTHERS. SO IT'S AN AREA WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT IT PRETTY HARD, ESPECIALLY ON THE DEBT SIDE. AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FIND AFTER THE HOLIDAYS, DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH BRICK AND MORTAR, I THINK THERE WILL BE MORE OPPORTUNITIES ON THE DEBT SIDE FOR FIRMS LIKE OURS. WAPNER: OK – SO WE'VE SEEN A JUMP IN RETAIL STOCKS. YOU THINK THE SAME THING THAT COULD UNWIND RETAIL STOCKS IS THE SEASONAL BOOST MAYBE THEY'VE GOTTEN— LASRY: IT IS. WAPNER: -- IS GOING TO CREATE GREATER OPPORTUNITY ON THE DEBT SIDE, AS WELL, DEBT'S GONNA TO BECOME CHEAPER. LASRY: I THINK SO. OR AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING. AND IF THAT IS, THEN WE'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. IF NOT, THEN IT'S FINE. YOU KNOW, REALLY, WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THINGS AT A PRICE WHERE WE THINK WE CAN'T GET HURT, WHERE IF THERE'S GONNA BE A LIQUIDATION, WE'RE GONNA GET OUR MONEY OUT. WAPNER: YOU MENTIONED J.C. PENNEY. ARE YOU CURRENTLY TAKING A LOOK ONCE AGAIN AT JC PENNY, WHICH YOU'VE OWNED ON THE DEBT SIDE BEFORE? LASRY: YES WE HAVE. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT IT PRETTY HARD AGAIN. THE BONDS ARE DOWN TO ABOUT 70 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. SO YOU'RE GENERATING SORT OF A DOUBLE DIGIT YIELD, WHICH IN THIS ENVIRONMENT IS GOOD. BUT WE'D LIKE TO GET INVOLVED IN THOSE BONDS, YOU KNOW, HOPEFULLY, IF THEY GET DOWN TO THE 50, 60, 70 LEVEL. WAPNER: LET ME SWITCH GEARS AND ASK YOU ABOUT HARVEY WEINSTEIN. LASRY: SURE. WAPNER: YOU WERE ON THE BOARD OF THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY FOR A YEAR OR SO. LASRY: YES. WAPNER: YOU WERE NAMED YESTERDAY IN A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST HARVEY WEINSTEIN, THE BOARD AND OTHER OF HIS COMPANIES. WHAT DID YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WERE ON THE BOARD? LASRY: DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING. I JOINED THE BOARD. AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT, WHICH WAS A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE EVERYBODY ELSE, WE HAD A BOARD CALL, I THEN RESIGNED THE FOLLOWING DAY. SO LOOK, I UNDERSTAND AND I THINK WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING JUST WASN'T – WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG. BUT AS FAR AS FOR ME, I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF IT. WAPNER: YEAH. HOW COULDN'T YOU HAVE KNOWN AS A BOARD? I THINK PEOPLE WOULD HEAR THAT ANSWER AND SAY, IF SEEMINGLY THERE WAS THIS REPUTATION OF THIS GUY FOR 30 YEARS IN HOLLYWOOD. YOU KNOW, BEN AFFLECK TELLS THE ""TODAY"" SHOW EVERYBODY KNEW THAT HE WAS A SLEEZE AND KIND OF A BULLY. HOW DIDN'T THE BOARD KNOW? LASRY: WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IF EVERYBODY KNEW, WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL ME? NOBODY CALLED, NOBODY SENT ME EMAILS, NOBODY SAID ""HEY, BY THE WAY, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT."" SO IT'S REALLY NICE THAT EVERYBODY SAYS THAT, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, A LOT OF BOARD MEMBERS JUST DIDN'T KNOW. AND EVERYBODY CAN SAY TODAY IT WAS AN OPEN SECRET. IF IT WAS SO OPEN, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF SOMEBODY HAD CALLED OR SOMEBODY HAD SAID ANYTHING. WAPNER: HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM AT ALL RECENTLY? LASRY: NO, NOT AT ALL. WAPNER: YEAH. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT BITCOIN. WE'LL SWITCH GEARS BACK TO THE MARKET. 15,000. THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU? LASRY: YOU KNOW, THE ONLY THING I'M UPSET ABOUT IS WHY DIDN'T I BUY IT WHEN IT WAS AT 300 OR 500? YOU KNOW, IN THE BACK OF MY MIND, I'M LIKE WHY DIDN'T I BUY THAT THING. I WANTED TO BUY IT WHEN IT HIT 9,000, 10,000. I WAS LIKE YOU KNOW, I'LL JUST WAIT FOR IT TO TAKE A LITTLE DIP. AND IT HASN'T TAKEN A DIP. AND LOOK, I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. I JUST SORT OF LOOKED AT IT AND SAID IT SEEMS LIKE A NEW CURRENCY IS BEING CREATED, AND THEREFORE IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO TRY TO PARTICIPATE IN IT. BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANY ANALYSIS WHY IT MAKES SENSE OR NOT. WAPNER: RIGHT. I MEAN – AMID THE COMMENTARY ON BOTH SIDES, WHETHER IT'S REAL OR IT'S A FRAUD AS JAMIE DIMON HAS NOW FAMOUSLY SAID, YOU DON'T HAVE AN OPINION ONE WAY -- DO YOU THINK IT'S REAL? LASRY: I THINK IT'S REAL. I THINK THE REASON YOU'RE SEEING THIS HUGE RUN-UP IN IT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS IS JUST THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE NOW ARE STARTING TO BUY IT. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT, WHEREAS BEFORE IT MAY HAVE BEEN MORE TECHIES, NOW WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IT'S COMING TO THE MAINSTREAM, AND AS IT COMES INTO THE MAINSTREAM, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO GET INVOLVED IN IT. I DO THINK IT'S REAL. AND I THINK WHEN NOVOGRATZ SAYS IT'S GOT A POSSIBILITY OF BEING WORTH 20,000 OR 40,000, I CAN SEE THAT AS IT BECOME MORE MAINSTREAM. WAPNER: LET ME ASK YOU – WRAP IT UP BY ASKING YOU TO REACT TO SOMETHING LARRY FINK SAID ON THE STAGE, THAT I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING. AS YOU SORT OF LOOK AHEAD TO WHAT THE MARKETS ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR, HE SAID WE'VE NEVER HAD A TIME WHERE THE FED HAS BEEN ON THIS AGGRESSIVE TIGHTENING PATH, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME UNLOADING THE BALANCE SHEET, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME DOING SUCH A SIZABLE FISCAL STIMULUS. AND HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE IMPACT OF ALL THAT IS GOING TO BE. DO YOU? LASRY: I DON'T. I DO THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING IS CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS HIGH. PEOPLE ARE SPENDING MONEY. SO, I THINK THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL AND BECAUSE OF THAT, YOU'LL FIND THAT THE MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO DO WELL. AND THAT'S WHY RATES ARE GOING TO MOVE UP, RIGHT? SO IF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS HIGH, THE ENVIRONMENT IS GOOD, THE MARKET WILL GO UP. WAPNER: APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. LASRY: THANK YOU. WAPNER: IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AS ALWAYS.

 ,12142017,CNBC,12072017,"WHEN: Today, Thursday, December 7 WHERE:  CNBC's ""Fast Money Halftime Report"" Following is the unofficial transcript of a CNBC EXCLUSIVE interview with Omega Advisors Chairman And CEO Leon Cooperman and CNBC's Scott Wapner today at the Wells Fargo Investment Thought Leadership Forum. The interview aired Thursday, December 7 on CNBC's ""Fast Money Halftime Report"" (M-F 12:00PM – 1:00PM.)

All references must be sourced to CNBC. SCOTT WAPNER: ALL RIGHT, GUYS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO ""THE HALFTIME REPORT."" I'M SCOTT WAPNER. WE ARE LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY FROM THE WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT THOUGHT LEADERSHIP FORUM. AND WE ARE JOINED TODAY BY SEVERAL SPECIAL GUESTS THROUGHOUT THIS HOUR. OUR FIRST IS HEDGE FUND LEGEND, LEON COOPERMAN, OF OMEGA ADVISORS. OUR OWN JIM LAVENTHAL IS HERE WITH US WELL. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE LEE WITH US. JIM, GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE AS WELL. JIM LAVENTHAL: THANKS SCOTT. THANKS LEE FOR JOINING US. WAPNER: LEE, LET'S CATCH UP WITH YOU ON WHERE YOU THINK WE ARE NOW IN THE MARKET. FROM YOUR LAST APPEARANCE, NOT THAT LONG AGO, WE CONTINUE TO MOVE HIGHER. THERE'S CONSIDERABLE TALK ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACT OF TAX REFORM IS GOING TO BE ON THE STOCK MARKET. IF WE WERE FAIRLY VALUED FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF TIMES, FEW TIMES YOU'VE BEEN ON THE NETWORK, WHERE ARE WE TODAY WITH THE DOW NORTH OF 24,000? LEON COOPERMAN: WELL, YOU KNOW, FAIR VALUE RISES BECAUSE THE MARKET HAS A CAPITAL MARKET LINE AND PROBABLY GOES UP 6% A YEAR. I WOULD SAY I VIEW THE MARKET AS REASONABLY FULLY VALUED. I DON'T THINK IT'S OVERVALUED. WAPNER: YOU DON'T THINK IT'S OVERVALUED YET? COOPERMAN: NO. I DON'T THINK IT'S OVERVALUED. THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOU DISCOUNTING THE EARNINGS WITH? THE TEN YEAR GOVERNMENT IS 2.3%, THE FED FUNDS RATE IS 1%. THOSE ARE VERY, VERY UNCOMPETITIVE INTEREST RATE LEVELS FOR THE STOCK MARKET. AND SO IF RATES STAY DOWN HERE, I THINK THE MARKET IS OKAY. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS I THINK THE MARKET IS REASONABLY FULLY VALUED WITH THE CONDITIONS THAT WOULD LEAD TO A BIG DECLINE DON'T SEEM TO BE PRESENT. AS I'VE OFTEN SAID ON THE PROGRAM, THE CONDITIONS ARE, NUMBER ONE, THE MARKET SMELLING AN ONGOING RECESSION. IF ANYTHING, THE ECONOMY IS GAINING A LITTLE BIT OF MOMENTUM, NOT DECLINING MOMENTUM. SECONDLY WOULD BE A HOSTILE FED. IF ANYTHING, I THINK THE FED HAS BEEN TOO SLOW ADJUSTING POLICY. THEY'RE FAR FROM HOSTILE. THIRD WOULD BE EUPHORIC VALUATIONS. AND I DON'T SEE EUPHORIC VALUATIONS. AND FOURTH WOULD BE SOME UNFORESEEN GEOPOLITICAL EVENT WHICH I CAN'T FORECAST. WAPNER: SO, WHAT ABOUT THIS ROTATION THAT WE'VE BEEN WITNESSING IN THE MARKET, PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS? COOPERMAN: HEALTHY. HEALTHY. WAPNER: YOU DON'T THINK IT'S A SIGN OF SOMETHING BIGGER? THIS MOVE OUT OF THESE HIGH GROWTH, HIGH FLYING TECHNOLOGY STOCKS INTO OTHER AREAS OF THE MARKET? COOPERMAN: THEY'RE MOVING OTHER THINGS THAT WERE UP 30, 40, 50% TO GO INTO THINGS THAT HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING, WHERE COMPANIES ARE DOING REASONABLY WELL. I DON'T SEE WHERE THAT'S UNHEALTHY. THE BROADER THE MARKET, THE BETTER OFF WE ARE. WAPNER: IS IT MORE LASTING, DO YOU THINK? IS THAT TREND RESETTING ITSELF IN A DIFFERENT WAY? COOPERMAN: I WOULD EXPECT – OUTPERFORM GROWTH AS LONG AS WE REMAIN AN EXPANDING ECONOMY. BUT WE DON'T LOOK AT THE WORLD THAT WAY, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. WE LOOK AT THE WORLD ONE STOCK AT A TIME, BOTTOM UP. AND WE'RE FINDING – AS MUCH AS I FIND THE S&P TO BE NOT EXCITING, YOU KNOW, FULLY VALUED, I'M FINDING A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL STOCKS THAT SEEM TO BE VERY ATTRACTIVE RELATIVE TO THE S&P. WAPNER: NOW, WE HAD CARL ICAHN ON LAST WEEK, WHO SAID YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT SMELLS A LITTLE LIKE EUPHORIA. WE DISCUSSED HIS FIRST ACTIVIST CAMPAIGN OF THE ENTIRE YEAR AND THE FACT, AT LEAST HE SAID, WAS SOMEWHAT REPRESENTATIVE OF IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND VALUE IN THE MARKET, GIVEN THE GAINS THAT WE'VE HAD. YOU'RE DIFFERENT KINDS OF INVESTORS – BUT COOPERMAN: NO, NO, NO, NO. HE'S— WAPNER: -- HOW ABOUT THE NOTION. VALUE IS HARDER TO FIND, IS IT NOT? WAPNER: OF COURSE. BY DEFINITION THE MARKET IS UP YOU KNOW, FROM 700 IN THE S&P TO 2600. BUT LET ME JUST SAY, CARL IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. I HAVE A WORLD OF RESPECT FOR HIM. I THINK HE CLOSED DOWN HIS FUND THE END OF 2008, BECAUSE HE SAW LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES AND HE DIDN'T WANT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF RUNNING OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY. WE'VE BASICALLY HAD A SEVEN OR EIGHT-YEAR BULL RUN, ONE OF THE LONGEST IN HISTORY. SO CLEARLY THE CONSERVATISM HE EXPRESSED IN 08 WAS WRONG. OK. HE HAD A VERY NEGATIVE VIEW OF HIGH YIELD A YEAR AGO. A VERY INCORRECT VIEW. HE'S BRILLIANT. HE'S BRILLIANT. I LOVE WHEN YOU GET ON WITH HIM AND YOU WANT HIM TO TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT AND HE SAYS NO, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. THE GUY IS A MASTER. WE FIND THINGS TO DO. AND AGAIN, I'LL GO BACK TO WHAT I SAID A MOMENT AGO, IF YOU HAVE NO RECESSION AND THE ECONOMY IS GROWING AND PROFITS ARE GROWING AND THE FED IS MOVING GRADUALLY TOWARDS A TIGHTENING REGIME, WE JUST FIND THINGS TO DO. WAPNER: SO, LET ME ASK YOU THIS, EARLIER THIS MORNING LARRY FINK ON THE STAGE IN WHICH YOU SAT JUST A SHORT TIME AGO. COOPERMAN: A LITTLE AFTER HIM. WAPNER: SAID WE HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THE SORT OF ENVIRONMENT WERE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON WHERE THE FED IS AGGRESSIVELY TIGHTENING, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ROLLING OFF THE BALANCE SHEET, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME INTRODUCING A LARGE AMOUNT OF FISCAL STIMULUS, AND HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE IMPACT OF ALL THAT IS GOING TO BE. COOPERMAN: NEITHER DO I. I MEAN, IF YOU ASK ME ABOUT MY MARKET VIEW, I CAN SAY I CAN SEE AMARKET NEXT YEAR UP 10% TO DOWN 15%, WHICH STRIKES ME AS YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE BOAT WITH EVERYBODY ELSE, AT THE BEGINNING OF 2017, YOU KNOW, BLOOMBERG PUTS AN EXHIBIT ON THEIR TERMINAL OF THE LEADING STRATEGISTS AND WHAT THE FORECAST IS. THE AVERAGE EXPECTATION FOR THE S&P 500 THIS YEAR WAS 2,350. HERE WE'RE NOW 2,625 WHEREVER WE ARE AND EVERYBODY IS STILL BULLISH, AND NOW WE'RE LOOKING FOR 2,800. BECAUSE NOBODY HAS A DOWN MARKET. NOBODY HAD A DOWN MARKET IN 2008. A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON. YOU JUST MENTIONED, A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON. I THINK THE TAX PACKAGE MAKES LONG-TERM SENSE. SHORT TERM, I THINK IT'S DANGEROUS. WE HAVE A REASONABLY RAPIDLY GROWING ECONOMY, AND WE HAVE TIGHTENING BY THE FED, WE HAVE BALANCING BY THE FED. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED AN ADDITIONAL FISCAL STIMULUS INJECTED INTO THE ECONOMY. WAPNER: BY DANGEROUS, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT COULD BE THE FALL OUT OF IT? COOPERMAN: WELL, YOU COULD SEE A RAPID ESCALATION IN INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES, WHICH THE MARKET IS NOT PREPARED FOR. WAPNER: DO YOU THINK THE FED COULD BE FORCED TO TIGHTEN RATES FASTER THAN THE MARKET THINKS? COOPERMAN: THAT'S A RISK. THERE'S A LOT OF RISKS. THERE'S A NORTH KOREA RISK. THERE'S A RISK THAT THAT THE FED BECOMES LESS HOSPITABLE. I THINK WHAT I SAID ON YOUR PROGRAM A YEAR AGO IS I THINK WE'RE HEADING TO NORMALIZATION. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS WE'VE BEEN IN A VERY ABNORMAL ENVIRONMENT THE LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS. EVEN TODAY, $11 TRILLION OF SOVEREIGN DEBT HAS A NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE. A YEAR AGO IF YOU BOUGHT A HOME IN DENMARK, YOU GOT A CHECK EVERY MONTH FOR TAKING OUT A MORTGAGE WITH A NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE. KIND OF CRAZY, RIGHT? DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. SO WE'RE HEADING TOWARD NORMALIZATION. NORMALIZATION TO ME IS A HALF OF ONE PERCENT GROWTH IN THE LABOR FORCE, ONE HALF PERCENT GROWTH IN PRODUCTIVITY. THAT DEFINES REAL GROWTH, THAT 2%. ADD ON ANOTHER 2% FOR INFLATION, THAT'S 4%. IN A 4% NOMINALLY GROWING WORLD, I THINK THE FED FUNDS RATE OUGHT TO BE 2% OR MORE AND THE TEN-YEAR GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO BE 4%. IT'S GONNA TAKE THE FED FUNDS RATE LESS THAN A YEAR TO GET TO 4% -- TO 2%, EXCUSE ME, AND IT'S GONNA TAKE ABOUT TWO, TWO AND A HALF YEARS TO GET TO 4% IN THE TEN-YEAR GOVERNMENT. IN THAT WORLD THE MARKET MULTIPLE SHOULD BE 17. THAT'S MY OPINION, I KNOW PEOPLE COULD ARGUE MORE OR LESS. 17 TIMES 150, WHICH IS POST TAX PACKAGE EARNINGS, YOU'RE 25.50 OR 26.25. WE'RE FAIR VALUED. KEEP IN MIND, MARKETS DON'T PEAK AT FAIR VALUATION, THEY PEAK AT OVERVALUATION. SO I CAN SEE WE'D GO UP 10%, AT WHICH POINT WE'D BE OVERVALUED. WAPNER: YEP. JIM. LAVENTHAL: WELL, LEE, THANKS FOR JOINING US. AND I FEEL A LITTLE KINDRED SPIRIT WITH YOU BECAUSE I'M A VALUE INVESTOR. AND LOOK, LET'S FACE IT, THE LAST TEN YEARS HAVE NOT BEEN KIND TO VALUE VERSUS GROWTH INVESTORS. IT'S BEEN ABOUT AN ANNUAL 1.5% OUTPERFORMANCE. DOES VALUE NEED TO BE REDEFINED? BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE RUSSELL 1000 VALUE, THEIR MAIN METRIC IS PRICE TO BOOK. AND IF YOU JUST GO ON PRICE TO BOOK, YOU GET INTO SOME CRUMMY AREAS. SOME REAL VALUE TRAPS. COOPERMAN: THE BOOK VALUE IS – THE BOOK VALUE IS – THE VALUE OF A BOOK IS A FUNCTION OF THE RETURN ON BOOK. IF RETURN ON BOOK IS RISING, IT SHOULD THEORETICALLY PAY A HIGHER MULTIPLE, SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LEVERAGE THAT COMPANIES ARE EMPLOYING. LAVENTHAL: AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT GOOD WILL AS WELL, AS SOMETIMES BOOK VALUE IS OVERSTATED. COOPERMAN: I DON'T REALLY PLAY THAT GAME. MY LARGEST POSITION HAS BEEN GOOGLE. GOOGLE IS GROWTH BUT IT'S NOT OVERVALUED. IT'S 20 TIMES ESTIMATED EARNINGS WITH A FORTRESSED BALANCE SHEET AND GROWING ITS MARKET SHARE. FACEBOOK IS A LARGE POSITION FOR ME. IT'S 17 TIMES EARNINGS, GROWING MUCH MORE THAN 17%. SO I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS INDIVIDUALLY. AND I DON'T BELIEVE -- A CERTAIN PART OF THE MARKET IS EFFICIENT, BUT WHAT KEEPS ME COMING BACK – I OWNED 5 MILLION SHARES OF TIME INC. ON NOVEMBER 9th OF THIS YEAR, TIME INC. STOCK SOLD AT $10. THREE – LESS THAN THREE WEEKS LATER, MEREDEITH BOUGHT IT AT $18.5 IN CASH. IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO TELL ME, TIME WAS EFFICIENTLY PRICED AT 10, NO. THAT'S WHAT KEEPS ME COMING BACK AND PLAYING THE GAME. TO ME – WAPNER: THAT'S – I KNOW YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT OF A GOLFER. THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF HITTING ONE RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE. IT MAKES YOU WANT TO COME BACK NEXT TIME. COOPERMAN: EXACTLY. AND I WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW, WHAT I CONSIDER VALUE COULD BE A GROWTH STOCK THAT IS A VALUE STOCK. LAVENTHAL: WELL, LET'S TAKE YOUR DEFINITION, GOOGLE BEING A GREAT EXAMPLE BECAUSE THE GROWTH RATE VERSUS THE PRICE OF EARNINGS MULTIPLE MAKES IT VERY TASTY FOR A VALUE INVESTOR. COOPERMAN: THAT'S THE METRIC I LOOK AT. LAVENTHAL: PRICE EARNINGS TO GROWTH. COOPERMAN: PRICE EARNINGS TO GROWTH. LAVENTHAL: IF YOU LOOK GOING INTO 2018, I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY VALUE SHOULD OUTPERFORM GROWTH THIS YEAR. CAN YOU TELL US WHY? COOPERMAN: WHAT I SAY IS WHAT I MIGHT CONSIDER A VALUE STOCK, SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT CONSIDER A GROWTH STOCK. LAVENTHAL: WELL LET'S USE YOUR DEFINITION. I LIKE YOUR DEFINITION. WAPNER: GOOGLE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE, ALL RIGHT. YOU LOOK AT IT AS A VALUE STOCK. IT IS A GROWTH STOCK IN TERMS OF THE BASKET THAT IT'S IN WITHIN THE NASDAQ THE WAY PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT. BUT YOU AS HAVING LARGE POSITIONS IN BOTH GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK, AND GOING BACK TO THE ROTATION QUESTION, AREN'T RETHINKING IN ANY WAY THOSE POSITIONS, IF YOU THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A MORE MEANINGFUL ROTATION OUT OF SOME OF THOSE AREAS INTO MORE UNDERVALUED OR OUT OF FAVORED PLACES HEADING INTO THE NEW YEAR? COOPERMAN: YEAH, I WOULD SAY THAT THINK THAT -- LOOK, I THINK I SAID THIS ON THE LAST PROGRAM AND PEOPLE LAUGHED ABOUT IT. BUT IF EVERY STOCK YOU OWN IS ON A NEW HIGH LIST, YOU'RE A MOMENTUM PLAYER. IF YOU'RE ON THE NEW LOW LIST, YOU'RE OUT OF BUSINESS. SO I AM LOOKING FOR A COMBINATION OF THINGS THAT ARE WORKING AND THINGS THAT ARE OUT OF FAVOR. WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND ON THE PROGRAM TODAY IS NOT WHAT'S WORKING WITH ONE EXCEPTION. I WOULD WORK WITH OUT OF FAVOR. SO AMC NETWORKS, BASICALLY 7.5 TIMES EARNINGS. SO LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, THE DOLAN FAMILY EARNS 17% OF THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE COMPANY. EVERY QUARTER, SIGNIFICANT BUYBACK OF STOCK. EVERY QUARTER. NOW IF YOU'RE DEALING WITH INTELLIGENT MANAGEMENT, INTELLIGENT MANAGEMENT UNDERSTANDS THAT THEY SHRINK THE CAP AND THEY'RE NOT SELLING THEIR STOCK, IF THEY'RE BUYING BACK STOCK AT INAPPROPRIATE PRICES, THEY'RE SCREWING THEMSELVES. SO I PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THAT, OK. AND THIS STOCK IS TRADING AT SEVEN TIMES EARNINGS IN A 17 MULTIPLE MARKET, LARGE FREE CASH FLOW. SURE VIEWERSHIP IS DECLINING A LITTLE BIT BUT THE MARKET IS WAY OVER DISCOUNT TO WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. SHIRE PHARMACEUTICAL, THEIR STOCK IS SELLING AT NINE TIMES EARNINGS. BASICALLY SHIRE HAS 20% OF THEIR EARNINGS EXPOSED TO A HEMOPHILIA FRANCHISE. --- IS COMING IN, CREATING SOME UNCERTAINTY. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A COMPANY CRUSHER. YOU KNOW, EVERY COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION. ONE THAT – I'M COMFORTED BY WARREN BUFFETT WHO OWNS 10% OF THE COMPANY, WE WERE THERE BEFORE HIM, OK. BUT UNITED AIRLINES. UNITED AIRLINES IS LIKE SIX TIMES WHAT WE THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA EARN. THEY BOUGHT BACK A THIRD OF THE COMPANY IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WITH STOCK REPURCHASE. THEY'RE BUYING BACK 10% OF THE COMPANY ANNUALLY. THE INDUSTRY IS LESS COMPETITIVE VERSUS CONCENTRATED. THERE'S THINGS THAT YOU COULD BE DOING, YOU KNOW. WAPNER: DO YOU – LET'S GO BACK TO SORT OF THE BIGGER MARKET PICTURE. DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH BECAUSE OF THE MORE RECENT RUN-UP THAT WE'VE PULLED FORWARD A SIZEABLE NUMBER OF GAINS INTO THIS YEAR? COOPERMAN: I THINK THE MARKET IS DISCOUNTED MORE IN THE FUTURE THAN I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT. LET ME BE HONEST WITH YOU. THE MARKET HAS DONE BETTER THIS YEAR THAN I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AND I THINK IT'S DISCOUNTING SOME OF THE RETURN NEXT YEAR. I THINK THE FED BY ITS POLICIES HAS FORCED PEOPLE OUT OF THE RISK CURVE. PEOPLE ARE GETTING FATIGUED. THEY CAN'T SURVIVE ON 1% MONEY MARKET RATES, THEY CAN'T SURVIVE ON 2% TEN-YEAR GOVERNMENTS. YOU KNOW, SO THEY'RE LOOKING TO TAKE ON MORE RISK. AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT THE WISE MAN DOES IN THE BEGINNING, THE FOOL DOES IN THE END. NOW WE'RE NOT THERE YET. THE MARKET IS NOT EXPLOITED. AS YOU KNOW, I LOVE JOHN TEMPLETON'S COMMENTARY. WAPNER: YES WE DO. SO WE HAVEN'T REACHED EUPHORIA. COOPERMAN: I DON'T SEE EUPHORIA. I DON'T SEE IT IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR BEHAVIOR. I DON'T SEE IT IN TERMS OF OVERALL MARKET VALUATION. THE ONLY WAY CURRENT LEVELS WOULD BE EUPHORIC IS IF THE FUNDAMENTALS DETERIORATED BEYOND ANYTHING WE ANTICIPATE. IN OTHER WORDS, I'D BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT IF WE'RE HEADING TO A RECESSION, MY FORECAST IS IN TROUBLE. IF THE FED HIKES FIVE, SIX TIMES NEXT YEAR, I'M IN TROUBLE. BUT THAT'S NOT – WAPNER: WHAT HAPPENS IF THE YIELD CURVE INVERTS? WHICH THAT'S SOMETHING SOME PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT. COOPERMAN: I THINK THAT'S A MORE TECHNICAL PHENOMENON. YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON IN THE WORLD I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I THINK MONETARY POLICY IS BEING RUN BY ACADEMICS. YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHY A TEN-YEAR BOND IS YIELD 38 BASIS POINTS IN GERMANY. THE ONLY EXPLANATION I CAN THINK OF IS INFLATION IS VERY LOW AND BASICALLY, IT'S A SHORTAGE OF LOW RISK AND NO-RISK ASSETS AND PEOPLE -- THERE'S A CERTAIN BUYER POPULATION THAT WANTS NO RISK AND THEY'RE BUYING NO-RISK ASSETS. LAVENTHAL: SO, ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE YIELD CURVE INVERSION IF IT HAPPENS IS A SYMPTOM, NOT A CAUSE? THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK TO WHAT THE UNDERLYING REASON IS? COOPERMAN: ABSOLUTELY. LAVENTHAL: BUT JUST A YIELD CURVE INVERTING WOULDN'T MAKE IT A – WAPNER: YOU WOULDN'T SAY IT WOULD PORTEND A CALAMITY OR CATASTROPHE? COOPERMAN: NOT AT ALL. WAPNER: PEOPLE SEE INVERTED YIELD CURVE AND THEY START THINKING OBVIOUSLY RECESSION. COOPERMAN: NO. – AND ALL THIS. IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE. IF LIFE WAS THAT SIMPLE, THE JOB WOULD BE A LOT EASIER. WAPNER: BUT YOU DO THINK WE'VE PULLED -- IS NEXT YEARS GOING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT? COOPERMAN: WELL AS I SAID, I WOULDN'T WANT TO MAKE A STAND-ALONE IN CONCRETE FORECAST. I THINK IF YOU SAID TO ME YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE ME A NUMBER, I'D SAY WE'LL BE UP 6% OR 7%. BUT THE MARKET COULD BE UP 10 OR DOWN 15. WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW FUNDAMENTALS UNFOLD. I LIKE WHAT I OWN. I THINK IT WILL OUTPERFORM WHATEVER THE MARKET DOES NEXT YEAR. OK. AND THAT'S NOT BEEN THE CASE FOR THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS. THE S&P HAS GOTTEN TO BE A TOUGH INDEX AS THEY KEEP REMAKING IT AND PUTTING IN NEW COMPONENTS IN THE INDEX. WAPNER: IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'D AGREE WITH HOWARD MARKS. I MEAN, THE EASY MONEY HAS BEEN MADE, HE'S BEEN SAYING THE LAST COUPLE— COOPERMAN: IT WASN'T EASY WHEN I WAS MAKING IT. IT WAS VERY HARD. ABOUT 14% THIS YEAR, BELIEVE ME, IT WASN'T EASY. IT'S 70-HOUR WORK WEEKS AND A LOT OF AGGRAVATION. WAPNER: BUT YOU GET THE POINT, RIGHT? THE S&P HAS QUADRUPLED OFF OF THE BOTTOM AND THAT'S SORT OF THE POINT HE'S MAKING. IT'S GOING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT TO MAKE MONEY. COOPERMAN: WELL, YOU HAVE INTEREST RATES GOING UP, THEY'VE BEEN GOING DOWN. YOU HAVE INFLATION LIKELY TO GO UP, IT'S BEEN GOING DOWN, OK. I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE FUNDAMENTALS – WE'RE GOING TO MOVE AWAY FROM QUANTITATIVE EASING. SO YEAH, THINGS ARE MOVING A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. THE QUESTION IS THE PACE THAT THEY'RE MOVING. WAPNER: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND COME PACK AND I'M GOING ASK YOU ABOUT BITCOIN. COOPERMAN: I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. WAPNER: WELL, YOU BETTER LEARN QUICK BECAUSE IT'S JUST EXPLODED THAT TRADE IN AND OF ITSELF CONTINUES TO WOW INVESTORS. WE'RE GONNA COME RIGHT BACK HERE AT THE WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT THOUGHT LEADERSHIP FORUM WITH MORE FROM OMEGA'S LEON COOPERMAN AND WE'LL DO THAT IN A COUPLE MINUTES BACK HERE ON HALFTIME. WAPNER: WE ARE BACK LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY. THIS IS ""THE HALFTIME REPORT."" LEON COOPERMAN IS STILL WITH US TODAY. JOE TERRANOVA HAS JOINED US NOW AS WELL. I ALLUDED TO THE FACT I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT BITCOIN AND JUST GIVEN WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IT, NOW TODAY IT GOES THROUGH 19,000 FOR THE FIRST TIME, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS PHENOMENON? AND THAT'S A PRETTY DECENT WORD TO USE. COOPERMAN: JOE GAVE ME THE ANSWERS. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND BITCOIN, THAT MEANS YOU'RE OLD. BLOCK CHAIN TECHNOLOGY IS INTERESTING. I DON'T GET IT. FROM 1,000 TO 15,000 IN A YEAR. THOUGH I LISTENED, MELISSA LEE HAD MIKE NOVOGRATZ, AN OLD PARTNER OF MINE FROM GOLDMAN SACHS ON, AND I'VE GOT TO GIVE THE MAN CREDIT. HE WAS THERE EARLY, HE ARTICULATED HIS VIEW AND SAID THAT HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE 40,000 SOMETIME IN 2018. ALL I CAN TELL YOU, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE 40,000 OF MY MONEY. WAPNER: YOU HAVE NO MONEY IN BITCOIN AT ALL? COOPERMAN: NO MONEY AT ALL. WAPNER: HAVE YOU PUT ANY OF YOUR ANALYSTS ON IT-- COOPERMAN: NO. WAPNER: AND SAID FIND OUT WHAT EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT? COOPERMAN: I KIND OF FEEL LIKE WAS IT JAMIE DIMON WHO SAID HE'D FIRE ANYBODY THAT WAS— WAPNER: HE CALLED IT A FRAUD. I WONDER— HE'S SPEAKING LATER TODAY, BY THE WAY. I WONDER IF HE'LL DOUBLE DOWN ON THAT OR SOFTEN HIS FEEL. COOPERMAN: WHENEVER HE SPEAKS YOU SHOULD LISTEN. BECAUSE, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BITCOIN BUT HE'S A MAN WORTH LISTENING TO. HE'S GOT A GOOD FEEL FOR THE ECONOMY AND A VERY INTELLIGENT GUY. WAPNER: WELL LET ME ASK YOU THIS WAY. WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE BITCOIN WITH A STRAIGHT LINE UP, THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE – IF THERE'S A SIGN OF EUPHORIA, IS THAT IT OR IS IT IT'S OWN INDIVIDUAL THING? COOPERMAN: THERE'S EUPHORIA IN BITCOIN. THERE'S EUPHORIA IN A SENSE IN BONDS AT 38 BASIS POINTS, BUT THE BROAD MARKET, I DON'T THINK IS EVIDENCE OF EUPHORIA. YOU KNOW, I WENT THROUGH NUMBERS IN THE CONFERENCE, I SPOKE THIS MORNING AT THE WELLS FARGO CONFERENCE, AND THEY ASKED ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY BUBBLE, WHETHER IT'S COMPARABLE TO 2000. IN 2000, CISCO WAS LIKE 100 TIMES FREE CASH FLOW. IT'S 11 OR 12 TIMES FREE CASH FLOW. ORACLE THE SAME THING. 20 TIMES EARNINGS FOR GOOGLE, 70 TIMES EARNINGS FOR FACEBOOK. THAT'S NOT EUPHORIC. RELATIVE TO GROWTH RATES, THAT'S LOW, THAT'S LOW. YOU KNOW, THE MAIN THREAT TO THESE COMPANIES, THEY'RE GAINING MARKET SHARE AND STRENGTH EVERY DAY, IS GOVERNMENT. WAPNER: YOU DON'T OWN AMAZON, RIGHT? COOPERMAN: I DO OWN AMAZON. WAPNER: YOU DO OWN AMAZON. COOPERMAN: IF I LISTENED TO MY ANALYST JOHN WOLF, I'D BE UP NOT 14% THIS YEAR, I'D BE UP 24%. BUT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A RELUCTANCE TO PLAY IN THE SUPER HIGH MULTIPLE AREA WHERE YOU'RE DISCOUNTING THE FUTURE. BUT AMAZON IS A CLASS COMPANY THAT IS GAINING STRENGTH. YOU KNOW, THEY'VE OUTEXECUTED EVERYBODY. THE MAJOR RISK TO AMAZON, I GUESS I COULD SAY THIS WITH TEN OTHER PEOPLE AT DINNER, I WAS HOSTED BY THE PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE IN MID-JULY AND TWICE HE ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT AMAZON WAS A MONOPOLY. WAPNER: THE PRESIDENT ASKED YOU? COOPERMAN: YEAH, EXACTLY. AND I SAID, NO, MR. PRESIDENT, I THINK THEY HAVE OUTEXECUTED PEOPLE, THEY'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB, ET CETERA. A LOT OF THE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS ARE LOOKING AT GOOGLE AND LOOKING AT FACEBOOK, YOU KNOW. AND THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO STICK THEIR BEAK INTO THIS THING AND THAT'S THE RISK. BUT I DON'T THINK THESE ARE EXPENSIVE STOCKS GIVEN THEIR GROWTH RATES. WAPNER: DID OTHER PEOPLE AT THE TABLE WITH THE PRESIDENT ALL PINE ON THE TOPIC AS WELL? WHAT WAS THE PREVAILING THOUGHT? IF THE PRESIDENT IS SEEKING OUT ADVICE FROM PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND OTHERS AT THE TABLE. COOPERMAN: I CHANGED THE SUBJECT VERY QUICKLY. HE DID SAY TO ME, LEE, I GUESS I CAN SAY THIS, HE SAID TO ME, LEE, YOU HAVE A FABULOUS REPUTATION. DO YOU THINK YOUR OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA CREATED YOUR S.E.C. PROBLEMS. SO SOMEBODY BRIEFED HIM. I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T KNOW, BUT, MR. PRESIDENT, THE S.E.C. TREATED ME VERY UNFAIRLY BUT I'M GETTING ON WITH MY LIFE. LET ME CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR VICTORY. I THINK PERSONALLY IF HILLARY CLINTON HAD WON, WE'D BE IN A RECESSION TODAY. YOU REPRESENT EXTRA INNINGS TO BOTH THE ECONOMY AND THE STOCK MARKET. AND THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS WORK VERY HARD TO UNIFY THE COUNTRY. THERE'S TOO MUCH DIVISIVENESS. HIS RESPONSE WAS I HEAR YOU. NOT REALLY LIKELY TO HAPPEN, TOO MUCH ANGER. WELL, WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE, YOU KNOW. WAPNER: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT THAT HE DOES CITE THE RECORD STOCK MARKET ALL THE TIME? COOPERMAN: I LIKEN THAT TO THE FACT THAT THE STOCK MARKET IS LOOKING AT ECONOMIC GROWTH, INFLATION, CORPORATE PROFITS, INTEREST RATES, RATHER THAN WHETHER THE UNITED STATES PRESTIGE AROUND THE WORLD IS GOING UP OR GOING DOWN. WE'RE CAPITALISTS. IT'S LIKE A DRUG COMPANY HAS A FAULTY DRUG, KILLS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE, PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT TEN PEOPLE KILLED, THEY TALK ABOUT THE EARNINGS PER SHARE IMPACT. SO THE MARKET IS FINANCIALLY ORIENTED. IT SAYS I CANT MAKE ANY MONEY IN BONDS SO I'M GONNA BUY MY FAVORITE STOCK. WAPNER: GIVEN THAT IT'S A YEAR ALMOST UNDER THE PRESIDENT, TO WHAT CREDIT OR HOW MUCH CREDIT DOES HE DESERVE FOR WHERE WE ARE AT 24,000 PLUS. COOPERMAN: I THINK A LOT. I THINK HE'S UNLEASHED ANIMAL SPIRITS TO A DEGREE. THE WAY I SEE IT AND I COULD BE DEAD WRONG, THE INTELLIGENT PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP A YEAR AGO SAID I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET WHEN I GET HILLARY. I DON'T WANT IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO GET WITH DONALD TRUMP, I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES. I'M SURPRISED, BUT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE STILL THAT WAY. OK. AND I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO HAPPEN, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE HE FINISHES OUT HIS FIRST TERM AND ELLECTS TO RUN AGAIN WHO THE DEMOCRATS RUN AGAINST HIM. I WOULD VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP AHEAD OF ELIZABETH WARREN OR BERNIE SANDERS. THE DEMOCRAT HAS BECOME A LEFTWARD LEANING PARTY IN THIS COUNTRY. I'M CENTERIST. I'M A REGISTERED INDEPENDENT. BI VOTE THE ISSUES. BUT YOU KNOW, UNLESS -- WE HAVE TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. THAT'S MY CENTRAL VIEW. THAT'S WHAT I THINK I'M ALL ABOUT. I'M ALL ABOUT GIVING EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, GIVING AN EDUCATION TO YOUNGSTERS, GIVING MY MONEY BACK TO SOCIETY. BUT WE – THIS DIVISIVENESS IS UNHEALTHY. BUT I BELIEVE WE'RE BETTER OFF WITH TRUMP LEADERSHIP THAN A BERNIE SANDERS OR ELIZABETH WARREN ADMINISTRATION. TERRANOVA: SO THE MARKET CLEARLY LIKES THE LIFTING OF REGULATION. IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARD TO SEE WHAT REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN LIFTED. BUT YOU WOULD AGREE THE MARKET LIKES IT. COOPERMAN: ABSOLUTELY. TERRANOVA: SECONDARILY NOW, YOU'VE GOT THIS TAX BILL. WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY SURE IF IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT WE HAD EXPECTED IT TO BE. COOPERMAN: 23, 22, 20, 19. TAXES ARE GOING DOWN FOR BUSINESS, THAT'S POSITIVE. IT'S A LITTLE DANGEROUS NEAR TERM BECAUSE WE HAVE A REGIME OF FED TIGHTENING, WE HAVE AN ECONOMY GROWING VERY NICELY, WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM Q.E. AND WE'RE INJECTING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FISCAL STIMULUS, SO YOU RUN THE RISK. THERE'S A RISK THERE, SO OVER THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS WE'RE MOVING THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WAPNER: BUT IS THAT THE END OF THE ROAD? IS THERE AN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL? WAS THAT JUST A DREAM? IS THIS – COOPERMAN: NO, I THINK HE'LL TRY TO DELIVER ON WHAT HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO DELIVER. HE'S TAKING -- LOOK, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD A FOOT ON THE THROAT OF THE ECONOMY. BUSINESS WERE CONFUSED, THEY DIDNT WANT TO INVEST. BUSINESSMEN ARE MORE FAVORABLY DISPOSED WITH CURRENT POLICIES, THEY HAVE VISIBILITY. THAT'S A POSITIVE THING, OKAY. I THINK REDUCED TAXES HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT AS A POSITIVE. WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE THE BIGGEST RISK I THINK FRANKLY IS IF WE DON'T GET CONSTRUCTIVE LEGISLATION THROUGH AND DON'T GET THE ECONOMY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A MIDTERM ELECTION WHERE THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO LOSE HOUSE. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY NEGATIVE. THAT'S ONE OF MY TENTATIVE THINGS ABOUT THE MARKET. WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A 12-MONTH AHEAD CAST A STONE FORECAST. I'VE GOT TO COME TO WORK EVERY DAY AND STUDY IT. I DO SAY THERE'S VALUE IN THE MARKET. THERE'S VALUE IN THE MARKET. THE MARKET IS NOT PRICED FOR EUPHORIA AT ALL. BITCOIN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. SO, I'M MORE HUMBLE. WHEN I MISS SOMETHING COMPLETELY, EVEN THOUGH IT'S UP NINEFOLD, ME DISMISSING IT IS NOT RELEVANT. BRING A GUY ON THE SHOW THAT MADE $200 MILLION ON BITCOIN AND SAID HE'S CHANGED HIS MIND, HE'S NEGATIVE. THAT'S THE GUY I LISTEN TO. WAPNER: IT'S NICE OF YOU TO CITE MELISSA AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE ON THAT SHOW ABOUT BITCOIN. COOPERMAN: HE SAYS 40,000. WHAT THE HELL DO I KNOW? IF I WAS SO SMART, I'D OWN IT. WAPNER: IT SEEMS LIKE ITS GETTING THERE QUICK. WE'LL TAKE A QUICK BREAK, WE'LL STEP AWAY. JOE'S GONNA STAY WITH US. WE THANK LEE COOPERMAN FOR SPENDING THIS WITH US, AS ALWAYS.

 ,12142017,CNBC,12072017,"Kristi Mitchem, Wells Fargo Asset Management; David Kelly, JPMorgan Funds; and Scott Minerd, Guggenheim Partners discuss the Federal Reserve deciding to raise rates and forecasting three more in 2018 following the Federal Open Market Committee's December meeting. With CNBC's Steve Liesman. ",Fed raises rates and GDP outlook
 ,12142017,CNBC,12072017,"JPMorgan Chase & Co expects to offer more price discounts to its banking customers who buy multiple products, similar to the way Amazon.com gives extras to its Prime subscribers, chief executive Jamie Dimon said on Thursday.""You are going to see more relationship pricing,"" Dimon said on a Wells Fargo & Co webcast for its clients. ""We give you more if you are at different levels and tiers,"" he said - for example, some free stock trades. ""We may test different types of things.""Like others in the banking industry, JPMorgan gives discounts on mortgages to clients with money at the bank. It has also given rewards from its credit card program to mortgage borrowers.It has to use such tactics to expand its business since it is barred by law from growing via acquisitions in the United States, as long as it holds more than 10 percent of insured deposits.Earlier this year Dimon quoted Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos as saying ""your margin is my opportunity"" to show how the bank can try to take competitors' customers with better deals.Amazon is an important customer of JPMorgan's credit card business, which processes many of its online payments and issues co-branded cards for the retailer.Addressing other topics in response to wide-ranging questions, Dimon also said he doubts JPMorgan will come up with a new breakthrough banking product analogous to Apple'siPhone, despite spending billions of dollars annually on new technology. But he said that investment should pay off by satisfying increasing customer demand for mobile banking services. Banks believe they can save money with more digital processing of transactions.After questions about gender relations, Dimon, who has recently promoted women to make up half of the bank's operating committee, said some employees have asked him how to respond to inappropriate behavior by clients.He said he advised them to ""tell the client don't touch me again...Be willing to fight. Be willing to fight back."" ",JPMorgan's Dimon: Amazon inspired us to offer banking discounts
Thomas Franck,12142017,CNBC,12072017,"Leuthold Group equity strategist Doug Ramsey shared his thoughts on the historic bull market and which areas in technology he finds most compelling in an exclusive interview with CNBC PRO's 
 Mike Santoli. ""Our primary tactical product is overweight equities, despite our concerns on valuations,"" explained Ramsey. ""I've got to say it's acting very youthful. I mean, we've joked that at a time when the bull would normally maybe need a mortician, this is one that could need a pediatrician in terms of some of the internal measures of momentum and breadth."" Ramsey is chief investment officer and a portfolio manager at The Leuthold Group. Before joining the Leuthold team, he was chief investment officer of Treis Capital, where he managed equity portfolios and published equity research. The strategist oversees Leuthold's Major Trend Index, which evaluates the underlying health of the financial markets. As a part of his interview, Ramsey also revealed some of the most compelling stock areas he's looking into. ""You'd think at this time of the cycle that maybe hey it's time to rotate into some health care or some consumer staples or even utilities. But instead what's been ranking up near the top of our quantitative industry group work for quite some time has been technology and pretty high beta technology,"" he said. ""We've had a great run with semiconductor equipment stocks this year. We own the airlines, we're in banks — so it's a lot of pretty high beta groups that we currently own."" Reflecting Ramsey's take on stocks, technology remains an outperformer this year, leading the S&P 500 to a 19 percent climb. But within the last three months, tech has given away to financials as hopes for tax cuts buoyed banks and telecom companies. Airlines United Continental, Delta and American Airlines are up 9 percent, 11 percent, and 11 percent, respectively, over the past month.

Jessica Dickler,12142017,CNBC,12072017,"At a time of transition at the Federal Reserve as well as fiscal policy in Washington, the move to raise the funds rate Wednesday will inevitably impact some of the terms by which you borrow money and access credit. With the Fed's increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate, its fifth since December 2015, ""the cumulative effect on existing borrowers is mounting,"" said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com's chief financial analyst. If you're concerned about what that will mean for your own bank account, mortgage loan or credit card, here's a breakdown of what could happen. Most credit cards these days have a variable rate, which means there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark rate. ""If you are carrying any sort of balance, you will immediately feel the effects of [a quarter-point rate hike] and pay more interest,"" said Kimberly Palmer, a personal finance expert with NerdWallet. Currently, the average household with revolving credit card debt pays $904 in interest a year, according to NerdWallet. Tacking on a 25-basis-point increase will cost credit card users roughly $1.46 billion in extra finance charges in 2018, according to a separate WalletHub analysis. Factoring in the four previous rate hikes, credit card users will pay about $7.4 billion more in 2018 than they would have otherwise, WalletHub said. However, there's still time to consider a zero-interest balance transfer offer and make aggressive steps toward paying down your high-interest debt once and for all. The economy, the Fed and inflation all have some influence over long-term fixed mortgage rates, which generally are pegged to yields on U.S. Treasury notes, so there's already been a creep up from record-low levels well before the Fed made any official move. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now about 4.08 percent — up slightly from the record low of 3.5 percent in December 2012. With interest rates rising, adjustable-rate mortgages will certainly be heading higher, too, and those with an ARM ""are sitting ducks for getting another increase,"" McBride said. One option to consider is refinancing. ""With fixed rates still near the 4 percent mark, there's no sense in holding on to an adjustable rate,"" he said. Many homeowners with adjustable-rate home equity lines of credit, which are pegged to the prime rate, also will be affected. But unlike an adjustable-rate mortgage, these loans reset immediately rather than once a year. For example, a rate increase of 25 basis points would cause borrowers with a $50,000 home equity line of credit to see a $10 to $11 increase in their next monthly payment, according to Mike Kinane, senior vice president of consumer lending at TD Bank. While that's not a big change, those worried about the escalation of rates can often convert the balance into a fixed-rate option at any time, Kinane said For those planning on purchasing a new car in the next few months, this change likely will not have any material effect on what rate you get. A quarter-point difference on a $25,000 loan is $3 a month, according to McBride. ""Nobody is going to have to downsize from the SUV to the compact because of rates going up,"" he said. What will affect what kind of car you can afford is checking that your credit is in good shape, negotiating the price of your vehicle and shopping around to secure the best rate on your financing. ""Don't lose sleep over interest rates,"" he said. Currently, the average five-year new car loan rate is 4.29 percent and the average four-year used car loan rate is 4.91 percent. Stashing some cash in a savings account has yielded not very much, aside from peace of mind, and that's not likely to change. The average interest rate on a savings account is about 0.09 percent right now, according to Bankrate, and even with the Fed rate increase, banks may not pass on any of that increase to their customers, which means interest on deposits will remain near rock bottom. Banks' terms allow them to be slower to raise rates on savings products than they are on loans and credit cards. To get a better rate, ""check online savings accounts, community banks or credit unions; often you can pick up more than a full percentage point that way,"" McBride said. ""That's easy money."" An account paying 1.10 percent in interest earns about $275 more per year than an account with a rate of 0.01 percent on savings of $25,000, according to NerdWallet. Federal student loan rates are fixed, so most borrowers won't be affected immediately by a rate hike. If you have a private loan, those loans may be fixed or have a variable rate tied to the Libor, the prime rate or T-bill rates — which means that as the Fed raises rates, borrowers will likely pay more in interest, although how much more will vary by the benchmark. ""Anticipated changes in Fed interest rates are usually already 'baked in' to the Libor rates,"" said Kevin Walker, head of education loans at LendingTree. ""This means that if the market believes rates will generally trend higher, Libor will rise in a commensurate fashion."" Rising rates will also have an impact on fixed-rate loans, including fixed-rate student loans, over time. ""Fixed rates available for new student loans will increase as underlying rates increase,"" Walker said. ""However, once a fixed-rate loan is originated, the rate won't rise."" While most borrowers have federal student loans, many others have a mix of federal and private loans, and nearly a quarter, or 24 percent, of student-loan borrowers  don't know the difference between fixed- and variable-rate loans, according to Credible.com, an online marketplace for lenders that offer student loan refinancing. That makes this a particularly good time to identify the loans you've got and see if refinancing into a fixed rate makes sense.

Harriet Lefton of TipRanks,12142017,CNBC,12072017,"TipRanks has identified top analysts and the five stocks they prefer this holiday season. The company uses a natural language processing algorithm to rank analysts based on two factors: Here are the five stocks that the top-ranked analysts say are well worth tracking this holiday season. 1) Amazon (AMZN) E-commerce giant Amazon is already raking in the holiday sales. The company accounted for 45 to 50 percent of online sales during Black Friday, according to GBH Insights. In just 24 hours, Amazon made sales of over $1 billion. Amazon also revealed that orders made from mobile devices on Thanksgiving were up 50 percent compared with this time last year. Top Wells Fargo analyst Ken Sena just raised his Amazon price target to $1,525 from $1,430. His new price target — the Street's highest yet — is 30 percent above the current share price. In his Dec. 1 report, Sena highlights Amazon's ""record-breaking"" early holiday sales data as a key reason to be bullish on the stock. Overall, this strong buy stock has one of the best outlooks on the Street. In the last three months, top analysts published 29 buy ratings and just one hold rating. These analysts have an average price target on the stock of $1,277, which is about 10 percent higher than the current share price. 2) Costco (COST) Warehouse club Costco has a particularly strong setup right now. Shares are spiking after Costco reported net sales of $11.26 billion for the month of November, up 13 percent from the same period last year. Following the news, JP Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers raised his estimates to reflect the November sales beat. He raised his price target to $200 from $190 (6 percent upside potential) on Dec. 4 and says the company can ""comp the comp."" Costco has a key advantage over other struggling brick-and-mortar stores. A huge 75 percent of its profits come from membership fees rather than product sales. And on the fourth-quarter earnings call, CFO Richard Galanti revealed that the company still enjoys a very high renewal rate: ""In terms of renewal rates, at year end, business members renewed at 94 percent, Gold Star members at 89.3 percent,"" said Galanti. ""These are numbers for the U.S. and Canada combined, which is over 80 percent of our company."" The stock has a moderate buy analyst consensus. However, the top-ranked analysts have a consensus of strong buy. These top analysts have 7 buy ratings on COST versus two hold ratings and a $186 average analyst price target. 3) Apple (AAPL) On the back of Apple's iPhone X launch, top Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley is very bullish about this holiday season. Walkley reveals that his recent ""survey work"" suggests strong holiday sales for Apple, especially if iPhone X supply improves for the 256GB models. He reiterated his buy rating on the stock with a $195 price target (13 percent upside potential) on Nov. 20. ""Following solid September quarter iPhone sales consistent with seasonal trends, we estimate Apple captured 72 percent of industry profits, up from 68 percent in the June quarter, and we anticipate much stronger share during the lucrative December quarter. We believe strong sales and mix of the iPhone X will sustain strong gross margin dollars given the high price points and likely improving manufacturing efficiencies,"" says Walkley. He sees the iPhone installed user base as exceeding an impressive 635 million exiting 2017. Apple has scored 23 buy ratings and six hold ratings in the last three months. At $188, the average analyst price target indicates upside potential of close to 10 percent. Interestingly, the individual price targets vary considerably from just $152 on the low to $235 on the high. 4) Starbucks (SBUX) Starbucks is making headlines this holiday season with a range of festive initiatives. On Nov. 28, Starbucks came out with a second limited-edition holiday mug. The coffee chain is also brewing up a range of special Christmas drinks, from toasted white chocolate in North America to Christmas panettone latte in China. After hosting a call with Starbucks CFO Scott Maw, Morgan Stanley analyst John Glass raised his price target on Starbucks to $67 from $62 last month (17 percent upside potential). He cited the company's plan to meet or exceed its new long-term targets. Note that Glass has a very strong track record on Starbucks. Across his nine stock ratings he boasts an 89 percent success rate and 19 percent average return. In the last three months the stock has received 10 buy ratings and two hold ratings from the Street's best analysts. These top analysts believe Starbucks can spike to $62, which is 8 percent above the current share price. 5) Skechers USA (SKX) Shoe brand Skechers USA looks set to end the year on a high note with strong retail sales. Top Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser has just boosted his price target to $46 from $38 (26 percent upside potential). Following positive Black Friday store checks, Poser met with management who confirmed that industry trends are improving. Poser is now predicting revenue for the fourth quarter of $885 million, up almost 16 percent from the same period last year. According to Poser, both the kids business and the international business are performing ""exceptionally well with no slowdown in sight."" Skechers is investing heavily in China, and this move is paying off with sales on the recent Chinese shopping bonanza Singles Day exceeding expectations. ""Feedback from retailers and our meeting with management at Fashion Footwear Association of New York leaves us very confident that global momentum is improving across most all merchandise categories,"" Poser concludes in his Dec. 4 report. On Skechers specifically, Poser has an impressive 72 percent success rate and 38 percent average return across 41 stock ratings. In the last three months, Skechers has received five consecutive analyst buy ratings. These analysts have an average price target on the stock of $38 (7 percent upside potential).

Hailey Lee,12142017,CNBC,12072017,"Despite bitcoin's immense gain in popularity, Wall Street's top economists and market strategists remain unconvinced. Eighty percent of respondents to the December CNBC Fed Survey said the current valuation of bitcoin is a bubble. Only 2 percent of respondents said the valuation is based on fundamentals, and 17 percent responded that they don't know or are unsure. In 2017 alone, bitcoin's price has jumped more than 1,000 percent, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index. After launching on Sunday evening on the Cboe Futures Exchange, bitcoin futures surged nearly 20 percent, to $18,545, on their first full day of trading, according to the January futures contract. ""We remain cautious on current domestic equity valuations even though we see very few areas that look cheap, and see a speculative quality to assets overall at this point (see Bitcoin…),"" wrote John Roberts, director of research at Hilliard Lyons. Wall Street also does not seem convinced of bitcoin's role as a currency. Of the 44 economists, fund managers and strategists surveyed last week, 66 percent said bitcoin does not qualify under the definition of a currency, while 17 percent said it does. Unlike bitcoin, when it comes to the stock market, market participants are not resoundingly alarmed about valuations. Sixty-six percent said they do not believe valuations are at a level where the Fed needs to raise rates to cool the market, compared with 24 percent who said the Fed should hike rates to cool the market. Wall Street is also not convinced the Fed is worried about stock market valuations. Five percent said Fed members are ""very concerned"" about valuations versus 20 percent who said Fed members are ""not at all concerned."" A 68 percent majority said the average Fed member is ""somewhat concerned."" The survey forecasts the S&P 500 to reach 2,775 on average by the end of 2018 and 2,862 by the end of 2019.

Eric Volkman,12142017,Fool,12072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For anyone who has even a glancing acquaintance with the finance sector, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) need little introduction. Berkshire, of course, is the vehicle of ace investor Warren Buffett, while Wells Fargo is one of the ""big four"" U.S. banks with a nationwide footprint. This, then, is a battle of familiar financials. Which of the pair is the superior investment? Image source: Getty Images. To be blunt, now isn't the best time to have such a heavy stake in Wells Fargo. Over the past year, the company's stock has risen by only 7% -- well under the 25%-plus increases of the other three in the big four. Some of this has to do with lingering investor mistrust following the ugly accounts scandal at the bank last year (plus a clutch of subsequent controversies). Compounding this, Wells Fargo's fundamentals haven't improved as much as many of its peers'. These banks have benefited from being at a favorable point on the economic cycle, and gradually rising interest rates. Wells Fargo's third quarter is a good example -- in contrast to the same quarter for the rest of the big four, total revenue slumped on a year-over-year basis (by 2% to $21.9 billion), while net profit declined by almost 20% to $4.6 billion. Both results fell short of analyst expectations. Berkshire, meanwhile, has also had its hiccups during the year. There was the company's failed bid for utility Oncor Electric Delivery, for example. Subsequent to that, its $15 billion commitment to another big portfolio holding, food conglomerate Kraft Heinz, to acquire consumer goods megalith Unilever came to nought. But those negatives were more than offset by numerous positives for the company. Most spectacularly, it cashed out on a whopping 700 million common shares of Bank of America, the culmination of a financing deal it inked with the bank in 2011. These days, Bank of America is in far better shape than it was back then, hence its share price appreciation of over 200% from then to now. When Berkshire pulled the trigger on those warrants, it booked an immediate paper profit of $12 billion. All in all, Berkshire continues to do well with its portfolio. Between the end of the company's fiscal 2016 and the conclusion of its Q3 2017, the total market value of its equity holdings increased from $129 billion to almost $190 billion. Wells Fargo certainly isn't the flavor of the moment for bank investors, but we should keep in mind that it's still very profitable and has a commanding lead in the all-important mortgage segment. It certainly has some value as an investment, although I'm concerned that it doesn't seem to be stemming the flow of scandal. This suggests deeper problems in management and corporate culture that might take some time to correct. Berkshire, meanwhile, is largely a reflection of its leader. Buffett is a straightforward, meat-and-potatoes value investor with a long history of solid profitability. That alone would make me more confident in Berkshire stock. But of course the main reason is the company's sustained overperformance. Wells Fargo might eventually put the recent scandalous past behind it and kick up some meaningful growth. I don't see enough signs of this happening yet, though, so Berkshire is my pick in this contest. ","

Image source: The Motley Fool. Operator Good morning, and welcome to the Third-Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call for Dell Technologies Inc. I'd like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or part, without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. As a reminder, the company is also simulcasting this call at investors.delltechnologies.com. A replay of this webcast will be available at the same location for one year. Following prepared remarks we will conduct a question-and-answer session. If you have a question, simply press * then 1 on your telephone keypad anytime during the presentation. I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin thanks Thanks, Regina. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. With me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Sweet; and our Vice Chairman, products and operations, Jeff Clark. Jeff has primary responsibility for client solutions group and infrastructure solutions group segments, in addition to leading our supply chain function. Also joining us from Europe for Q&A is our treasurer, Tyler Johnson. We posted our third-quarter press release and web deck on our website, where this call is also being webcast. Q3 financial results will be filed on Form 10-Q on Tuesday, December 12. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. Consistent with prior periods, our Q3 non-GAAP operating income includes approximately $2.5 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are non-cash and relate to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. As a reminder, due to the EMC merger and, to a lesser extent, the Dell go-private transaction, there will continue to be significant bridging items between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the next few years, although the impact will decline in each subsequent quarter. Please refer to the web deck as well as our SEC filings for more details on our total non-GAAP adjustments. Please note that our third-quarter Fiscal 2017 historical results include only a portion of EMC's results, and unless otherwise specified, all growth percentages refer to fiscal year-over-year change, which may not be comparable due to the merger. Beginning in Q4, we will get to fully comparable year-over-year quarterly results. During this call, we will generally refer -- or we will generally reference non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA on a continuing-operations basis. A reconciliation of these measures to its most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found on Form 10-Q and in the supplemental material of our web deck. Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in the cautionary statement section in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now I'll turn it over to Tom. Thanks, Rob. Overall, I was pleased with the third-quarter results and the momentum we're seeing in the business. We continue to see growth on the top line, and we're seeing increasing customer acceptance of our broad solutions portfolio. We also had solid cash flow generation and improved profitability. GAAP revenue for the third quarter was $19.6 billion, with a GAAP operating loss of approximately $530 million. Non-GAAP revenue was $19.9 billion with strong results from client, servers, and VMware. Overall, we were generally pleased with the balance of top-line growth and better profitability. As we've highlighted over the last few quarters, we are working to improve our storage business velocity. And while we have begun to see some progress, we believe this will be a gradual recovery over the coming quarters as we ramp go-to-market resources and introduce new and innovative product features. Gross margin was $6.4 billion or 32.2% of revenue, which was a 110-basis-point improvement over the second quarter, driven by pricing discipline and improved overall cost of goods sold. OpEx was $4.4 billion or 22.3% of revenue, which was down 90 basis points sequentially as we continue to drive OpEx discipline across the business as we focus on optimizing our cost structure. Operating income was $2 billion or 10% of revenue, up 210 basis points from the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 24% sequentially to $2.3 billion or 11.6% of non-GAAP revenue. Please see Slide 19 in the web deck for more details on our EBITDA adjustments. Now let me give you our summary view of the financial performance of the business segments, and then I will turn it over to Jeff, who will go into more detail on the segment operational highlights. Revenue for the infrastructure solutions group was $7.5 billion, up 2% quarter on quarter. The sequential increase was driven by servers and networking, with revenue of $3.9 billion, up 32% year over year. Servers delivered its second consecutive quarter of record revenue with double-digit growth from both PowerEdge and cloud servers on strong demand. We delivered solid unit performance while also seeing expansion of server ASPs. Our storage revenue was $3.7 billion and was roughly flat quarter on quarter, as growth in all-flash and newer solutions like hyperconverged infrastructure was offset by softness in traditional storage. Operating income for ISG was $678 million or 9% of revenue, which is a 320-basis-point increase over the prior quarter, driven by better profitability for servers and storage as well as OpEx discipline. ISG operating income is moving in the right direction, but we still have more work to do to improve the overall profitability profile of the business. We are working on balancing velocity and profitability within servers and building momentum in storage and data protection going forward. Revenue for the client solutions group was $10 billion, up 8%. Commercial revenue grew 8% due to strength in commercial notebooks, workstations, displays, and attached services. Consumer revenue was up 10%, driven by growth in notebooks and the benefits of our investments in gaming and our consumer and small-business key country expansion program. CSG operating income was up 6% to $672 million, which was 6.7% of revenue as the team continues to execute on profitable growth despite ongoing challenges from the component costs and competitive environments. Going forward, we're focused on continuing to drive profitable growth, especially in commercial client. VMware had another strong quarter as revenue from the VMware segment was up 2% sequentially to approximately $2 billion and operating income was $639 million, or 32.7% of revenue. Standalone VMware reported a strong Q3, which included the enterprise agreement with DXC Technology announced on VMware's Q2 earnings call. Its growth rate for license revenue plus the sequential change in total unearned license revenue was up double digits year over year. License bookings for NSX grew over 100% year over year in Q3. The DXC enterprise agreement included a large commitment to NSX, underscoring the strategic importance of NSX to customers. VSAN license bookings were once again up over 150% year over year. I also want to congratulate VMware for being named to the Fortune Future 50 list of companies best-positioned for breakout growth. VMware ranked No. 6 in the leaders category, which is a testament to the company's forward-looking and innovative company culture. Revenue from our other businesses, which includes SecureWorks, RSA, Pivotal, and Boomi, was $475 million. Pivotal again delivered strong top-line results. The team has also seen nice momentum across its platform partner ecosystem, having recently announced over 100 global and regional system integrators and consultancies as part of its Pivotal Ready Partner Program. Additionally, in November, Pivotal and Accenture announced that they formed a new business group, the Accenture Pivotal Business Group, to help enterprises accelerate cloud migration and software innovation. SecureWorks released its stand-alone earnings yesterday, where it reported approximately 10% revenue growth to $118 million and continued gross margin expansion. RSA had solid orders growth in the quarter. Customers are embracing our RSA security solutions, as evidenced by the positive year-to-date growth for all of its four product suites. Before I jump to the balance sheet, I want to mention the flexible consumption models that we offer customers. We continue to see strong demand for these solutions as we remain focused on providing customers with flexibility and building a larger recurring revenue stream for Dell Technologies. We saw a lower level of these frameworks in Q3 versus last quarter as the multiyear strategic nature of these offerings resulted in variability quarter to quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. In Q3, cash from operations was $1.6 billion, predominantly due to improved profitability and working capital benefits. Our cash and investments balance was $18 billion, up approximately $2.7 billion versus the prior quarter, and includes debt proceeds from VMware's recent debt issuance. Also, as a reminder, you will see our cash balance grow as we position our balance sheet for approximately $3 billion of debt maturities coming due in the first half of Fiscal '19. As we did last quarter, we discussed our debt consistent with how we discussed it with the rating agencies, which is total debt including subsidiary debt, total debt excluding subsidiary debt, and total core debt, which excludes subsidiary debt, DFS-related debt, and the margin loan. For additional detail on what's included or excluded in these balances, please see Slide 7 of the web deck. During Q3, we paid down $1.7 billion in debt, including $1.2 billion from VMware's repayment of legacy intercompany notes as well as approximately $500 million from cash on the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $52.5 billion in total debt, up $2.6 billion from the prior quarter. Our total debt balance increased as a result of VMware's $4 billion bond issuance mentioned above as well as an increase of approximately $300 million in structured financing debt that funds Dell Financial Services. During the quarter, we repriced $14.2 billion of term loan debt and revolving credit facility and also took the opportunity to reposition the tranches. The combined effect of these resulted in approximately $60 million of annualized interest rate savings and enhanced liquidity management. Our core debt ended the quarter at $40.3 billion, down from $40.5 billion at the end of Q2 and $48.8 billion as of September 2016, which is when we closed the EMC transaction. Since closing the transaction, we've paid down $9.7 billion of gross debt excluding DFS-related debt and remain fully committed to paying down debt and delevering the balance sheet. In Q3, DFS originations were approximately $1.6 billion, up 48%, and financing receivables now stand at another record high of $7 billion, up 28%, driving an increase of DFS-related debt by approximately $300 million in the quarter. Demand for DFS remains strong and continues to grow across our business segments as customers respond to our innovative financing offerings. As we see the financing receivable balance grow so will our DFS-related debt as we continue to fund the business. Jumping to our DVMT share-repurchase program. We recently completed our latest $300 million program, which was announced in August and was solely funded through a Class A stock purchase agreement with VMware. To date, we have repurchased approximately 23.4 million shares of Class V Common Stock. This includes 16.8 million shares under the Class V group repurchase program. We are generally pleased with our continued cash flow generation and remain focused on balance sheet management and debt repayment. Let me now turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the operational highlights of CSG and ISG. Thanks, Tom, and hello, everyone. It's great to be here to discuss CSG, ISG, and our supply chain. As Rob mentioned, I now lead a combined products and operations organization, the only one of its kind. As one product and operations organization, we will be able to drive a more holistic set of integrated, innovative solutions for our customers from the edge to the core to the cloud. I've been in the new ISG part of my role for a little less than three months. I thought it might be helpful if I share some of my initial observations. First, our strategy to be the essential infrastructure provider is resonating well with our customers who are looking to us to transform and digitize their environments. Second, our portfolio is second to none across the breadth of the IT spectrum, from the edge to the core to the cloud. Third, we have more complexity in our offerings than is needed and simplification is required. And lastly, we need to continue to enhance feature functionality and add new capabilities to our storage and data protection offerings, sharpen our engineering and product execution focus to ensure we're meeting customers' needs and expectations, and execute to our go-to-market initiatives. Now let me provide some third-quarter highlights for ISG and CSG. As Tom mentioned, ISG's revenue for the third quarter was $7.5 billion and operating income was $678 million. Both saw positive growth from the prior quarter. As a reminder, due to the fact that the EMC transaction closed during Q3 last year, I'll be making reference to demand data where appropriate to facilitate a more meaningful year-over-year discussion. ISG demand continues to grow trajectory in Q3, with orders up in high single digits on a year-over-year basis. Server revenue and unit growth were strong for both PowerEdge and cloud servers. We are seeing higher memory and storage content in servers as customers look for more computing power to run big data and software-defined solutions. We have effectively managed pricing to mitigate ongoing memory cost inflation, resulting in higher selling prices. Additionally, we've also seen higher ASPs as we ramp our 14th generation of PowerEdge servers, demonstrating we are capturing the value of our industry-leading R&D capabilities and innovation. In calendar Q3, the overall x86 server industry grew in both units and revenue. We outgrew the market in units and revenue for both the mainstream and hyperscale markets, and we are a worldwide leader for servers based on both units and revenue. Looking at revenue share, we gained 250 basis points of share on a year-over-year basis for total x86 revenue and 400 basis points of share in mainstream revenue. Moving to storage. Orders declined in the mid-single digits with solid growth in our newer storage solutions. Our market-leading hyperconverged portfolio continues to grow triple digits with strength in VxRail. Demand for Isilon scale-out NAS and our all-flash arrays continue to grow in double digits. As discussed on last quarter's earnings call, we have implemented actions to improve storage growth, particularly in the midrange, and expect benefits of these actions to materialize through the next year. We increased our go-to-market capacity by adding storage specialists, and we are ensuring our sales compensation plan spurs the appropriate behavior to drive long-term strength in our results. In addition, we continue to evaluate our portfolio and are focused on developing world-class products to solve our customers' needs. For example, in our midrange portfolio, we recently introduced two Dell EMC SC all-flash appliances, along with key application upgrades -- excuse me, along with key software upgrades for our Dell EMC Unity that include in-line data deduplication, synchronous file replication, and the ability to perform online data-in-place storage controller upgrades. The Dell EMC SC all-flash products will be available this month, and the Unity upgrades will be available later this quarter. At the same time, we introduced our Future-Proof Storage Loyalty Program, offering storage customers investment protection and multiple cost-saving benefits. The early feedback from customers and partners has been very positive. We continue to drive hard against our operational improvements in ISG, targeting our go-to-market, product portfolio, and cost-out initiatives. Moving on to CSG. We had another strong quarter as we maintained our focus on profitable growth, balancing velocity and share gain with margin improvement. CSG revenue in Q3 was $10 billion, which was up 8%, while operating income was $672 million, up 6%. The overall PC market moved back to positive year-over-year unit growth in calendar Q3 2017 according to IDC. Dell outperformed the worldwide market growing units 1% in calendar Q3 and delivering above-market growth in desktops and in the commercial segment. We increased our global PC share on a year over year basis for the 19th consecutive quarter. We continue to be the leading provider of workstations worldwide. In calendar Q3, Dell outgrew the industry for workstation units and had a positive year-over-year growth in every region. Our investments in gaming were evident at PAX West, where we announced a new mainstream gaming laptop and gaming desktop featuring a new clear panel with polar blue LED lighting and Alienware 34-inch curved gaming display. These new products demonstrate our commitment to deliver world-class gaming products for every player at every level in the marketplace. We are also seeing success in CSG SMP and attached services. Displays were a highlight in Q3, and Dell continues to be the No. 1 display provider in the world. We saw higher attach rates for our premium client-service offerings, ProSupport Plus, for both commercial and consumer clients. During Q3, we announced a new top-tier Premium Support Plus to deliver the most comprehensive support service available for consumer and gaming PCs. Powered by Dell's exclusive SupportAssist technology, it's the first and only consumer service to proactively find issues, predict problems before they start, and automatically remove viruses and optimize performance of consumer PCs. Dell continued investment in innovation -- Dell's continued investment in innovation is helping Dell drive growth across CSG. We expect to continue to take share while maintaining our focus on balancing growth and profitability. From a global operations standpoint, we've made good progress over the past 14 months integrating our supply chain, reducing cycle times and inventory, and we continue to look for areas of improvement, working closely with the various teams on multiple working capital initiatives. It's been an unprecedented year of inflationary memory pricing, and we believe memory will continue to be a slowly moderating headwind through the first half of next year. Overall, we have a number of areas that we are working to improve, including storage sales velocity, storage product performance and positioning, and ramping up sales productivity, but I want to be clear that we've also made significant progress over the last year. We're a leader in servers, storage, displays, workstations, and gaming. We continue to see strong demand for hyperconverged infrastructure and software-defined data center solutions, and the client business continues to gain profitable share. I believe we offer a more holistic view and set of solutions for our customers, allowing us a higher level of innovation and integration across the edge, the core to the cloud, and it's unmatched in the industry. I like our hand, and I'm optimistic about our future. With that, let me turn it back over to Tom. Thanks, Jeff. In closing, I echo Jeff's sentiments that it's an exciting time to be part of Dell Technologies. We have made good progress across the family of businesses, including strong velocity in client, servers, and hyperconverged infrastructure; growth from VMware and our other businesses; and steady expansion of our DFS portfolio. We also recognize that there's still work to do to improve our storage and data protection business and to improve the overall profitability of the ISG business. I'm generally pleased with the overall state of the business 14 months into the integration and believe we're tracking in the right direction. We are the best-positioned company to win in today's IT environment and meet customers' needs in their digital transformation journey. We are gaining broader acceptance as the only provider that has the flexibility and portfolio breadth that can offer a single integrated set of solutions. This was on display in New York in October when we unveiled a new IoT strategy, division, and solutions to accelerate IoT adoption for customers. The new Dell Technologies IoT division, led by VMware CTO Ray O'Farrell, is designed to help customers navigate and implement flexible architectures and provide tailored solutions and services across our entire family of businesses. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on growing faster than the market and gaining share and consolidating markets, generating strong cash flow to enable additional delevering of the balance sheet, balancing cost actions with investments to position the company for long-term success and bringing the full capabilities of Dell Technologies to our customers in a comprehensive and seamless experience. Finally, let me remind you that when we report our results for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, we will be comparing those results against our first full quarter as a combined company. In addition, note that Q4 of Fiscal 2017, our previous Q4, was a 14-week quarter as compared to this year's 13-week fourth quarter, so year-over-year growth rates need to consider this. With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Thanks, Tom. Let's go to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question with one follow-up, if you have one. Regina, can you please introduce the first question? Operator Our first question will come from the line of Frank Jarman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks, guys, and congrats on the quarter. Great. I guess I wanted to start off just seeing if you could give us an update on the memory and input costs that you're continuing to see. There's been some market discussion about NAND prices potentially peaking over the next few months. So just as you guys work through your negotiations with the supply chain, what are you guys seeing in terms of availability? And how should we think about your ability to push on some of those costs as we move further into 2018? Thank you. Sure. Frank, Jeff Clarke here. A couple of things. One, I suspect, given the basis of the question, you've seen what we've gone through, which is the longest inflationary period that I can recall in memory in a decade plus, and that's a by-product of two things. One, there hasn't been any new DRAM capacity being brought online, and then the consumption of DRAM is at the highest rates we've seen. And in fact, our own server group, we've seen our memory density that we ship per server go up tremendously on a year-over-year basis and sequentially as well, so putting tremendous pressure on supply. As a result, our outlook is, DRAM pricing, while moderating in its inflation, it still continues to go up through the first half of next year. And we think NAND is moderately inflationary as well through the first half of next year. We see all-flash arrays just driving tremendous demand for more NAND and are pressuring the capacity that's available. Does that help? Yes, that's super helpful. And then, I guess, just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask a question about tax reform since it looks like you guys have been focused on it with the BUILD Coalition announcement that was made last week. And, I guess, specifically, I wanted to better understand how you're thinking about the 7.5% proposed tax on il-liquid repatriated -- or unrepatriated foreign earnings. Do you know what that taxable foreign earnings amount would be for you? Look, I'm not going to get into -- it's Tom, by the way, Frank. So I'm not going to get into specifics about where the proposed legislation is right now. Clearly, as we have been -- we are a supporter of tax reform. We do believe that the U.S. system, which hasn't been reformed in over 30 years, does need some updating, and we're big fans of territorial tax and those types of policy changes that they're contemplating. Obviously, there are some headwinds in that tax proposed legislation that we're looking at and that we're making sure that our voice is heard, whether that's around the repatriation, which we're generally -- we've sort of reconciled ourself to the fact that repatriation is going to be part of this and also things like the interest deductibility, which is a potential -- is a headwind for us that we're talking to our representatives about how we might -- how they should think through some of the impacts given that it's effectively an antigrowth strategy as you think about how that has funded job growth and capital growth -- or company growth here in the U.S. So again, I'm not going to get into specifics about what are specific aspects of the bills and how we would navigate through that. I will tell you that we'll see where this lands at the end of the day, and then we'll take the appropriate actions to ensure that we're best-positioned as we can to do more. Got it. I guess, just so I understand, if I were to look at your 10-K, it looks like the undistributed book earnings from your foreign subs was about $79 billion at the end of last year. We shouldn't be applying a 7.5% tax rate to that basis, should we? No. Look, I mean, I think that's a -- there's other factors that you have to think your way through in -- from that number. So I don't think that's the appropriate calculation you should be doing at this point. OK, great. Thanks very much, guys. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harlib with Barclays. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. My question is on margins, both, I feel, very solid in CSG and ISG. And I'm wondering if you could just talk about the margin profile in both of those businesses. You're well above your 4% to 5% prior target in CSG. In ISG, we have had DRAM continue to increase recently, and your mix seems like it'll be negative, with storage lagging the growth in server business, which is a lower-margin business. So if you can go through that in terms of the margins. Hey, Jeff, it's Tom. Let me do that, and then Jeff can add some color commentary, if he'd like. But look, I think, overall, there's a couple of things affecting our margins as you look at it quarter to quarter. Clearly, as Jeff highlighted, component costs have been inflationary on us, and so that's been a bit of a headwind clearly. I think, as you step back and think about it, though, what -- it's pretty consistent with what we've talked about in the prior quarters, which is that we have been adjusting our pricing to ensure that we are capturing the increased input costs coming from the component cost increases. So as we look quarter on quarter, we have seen the effect -- our pricing effectiveness, and the stickiness of that pricing effectiveness has been helpful for us. We also have been helped by things like mix, in the sense of the mix of the business has been helpful for us. And so we've also been helped -- and we've had a little bit of FX as well from -- as you look at what's happened with currency across the globe. So those three have been helpful. Against -- and then on the downside of that, we've also had continued impact on -- of component costs, which has been a bit of a headwind for us in Q3. So particularly on the ISG side, as it relates to your comment around, ""Well, geez, given the fact that storage is soft and you drove servers,"" we got a pretty good boost on server velocity and the related pricing actions that we've done out of that. And then mix within the configurations and within the families has been helpful. So because of that, I mean, you've seen our ISG margins, they roughly went up -- were up almost 200 basis points. And then the CSG margins quarter on quarter were obviously less than that in terms of absolute movement but still moving in the right direction. OK, great. And just -- yes, go ahead. Jeff, I had a couple of other thoughts to build on what Tom said. One would be, I mentioned earlier that our average server going out the door is going out with more DRAM and going out with more NAND, bigger SSD, and that's a direct result of us selling higher up in the value stack. We're selling higher-value workloads. We are selling higher-value solutions and then extracting value for that. Our 14G servers that we just launched are selling at a premium to their predecessors. So we are seeing our ability to sell the value of our product in the marketplace, and servers continue to, I think, perform quite well. The other part is, I think, the global supply chain that we have and its size. We have DRAM. So as much as I've said DRAM is going up in costs, we have it, and we're getting value for having it. And whether that's in our PC business, on our server business, I think that is something customers are coming to us for, knowing we have supply. And they're obviously paying for it, so we're seeing our margins continue to improve and our prices improve there. And then Tom mentioned the element of mix in the PC business. That's very true. If you look at our relative performance of commercial PCs to consumer PCs, that's a strong contributor to margin improvement in the PC business. Great. That's very helpful. My follow-up just would be, any general commentary you can provide on the 4Q outlook given this is the first full pro forma quarter with respect to revenues, margins in each of the segments? Jeff, it's Tom. Look, you know we don't do forward guidance, right? So let me just start with that comment. I would tell you that if you looked at historical seasonal patterns, you would expect to see roughly a 6% to 7% sequential bump in revenue if you -- if history were to be consistent with what we're seeing this quarter. So that's something you should think about. And then remember that, seasonally, we turn down in Q1 after that, right, in terms of just the nature of how the systems flow. So look, I mean, absent that, I would tell you that the only other thing I would put in your thinking is, we've talked about it and we talked a lot about this on the Q2 call, around these flexible consumption models. And we had a fairly healthy dose of flexible consumption models in Q2. In Q3, they were less. And remember, these were models where we're typically offering the customer more flexibility and, therefore, deferring the revenue. And therefore, while I'm getting -- in some cases, getting the cash upfront, I'm not recognizing the revenue upfront. Now we put -- we'll have to see how Q4 plays out in terms of those flexible consumption models, but seasonally, it's a pretty big quarter for us and -- from a revenue perspective so we'll have to watch that dynamic in mix as we go through the quarter. Also, remember, and I said it in my talking points, that last year was a 14-week quarter for Q4 and this week will be a 13-week quarter. So just keep that in mind, too, as you think about the year-over-year compares. Great. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Eller with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question.You talked a little bit about expectations for memory in 2018. But I wondered if you could provide some more color around your kind of whole basket of inputs, so maybe panels, displays, and kind of maybe the whole basket for 2018. Yes. We see the other commodity sets showing slight signs of deflation, not enough to offset the inflation of the memory devices. But if I was to look at batteries, LCDs, metal, printed circuit boards, discrete components, we see a slight deflationary marketplace for us next year that's helping us offset what's happening in DRAM and NAND. Great. And then can you talk maybe also about the ability to take out non-commodity-related costs? Well, we clearly are doing that across a vast number of synergy activities in the organization. I can speak specifically to the product and supply chain side, and I'm sure Tom will jump in on the rest of the portfolio -- or the business. We have a plan. We're executing to that plan. I mean, quite honestly, we're on that plan. We have applied our Dell pricing terms across the broader purchase of our entire portfolio, which you would have expected us to do. Last year, we had that done certainly on Day 1. We're reaping benefits of that throughout this year. We've seen tremendous efficiency on the supply chain, particularly through cycle-time improvement, lead-time improvement to our customer base, and managing our working capital initiatives through our facilities, most notably in the form of inventory. So I think we're well along the path of managing our other costs outside the commodity and the supply chain and the product side. Yes. That's fair, Jeff. On the overall cost synergy, we obviously have put that $2 billion target out there. We also had told you that we had made some incremental investments back into the go-to-market in the business that we're going to probably delay the full cycle of how those cost synergies would flow through. I think we've been pretty upfront about that. We remain on track on our cost activities even with considering the investments that we've been making, and we'll continue to evaluate the business. So the goal here is to drive the right level of profitability across the combined entity. We'll do that through pulling various levers to ensure that we, over time, deliver the right EBITDA generation that we're targeting. But I'll also tell you that we're also in this for the long term, right? So we are making appropriate investments to position the company as we think about where we want to be in the three- to five-year range as well. OK, Tom. And then some -- a lot of times, I do get questions from investors around maybe the amount of incremental investments that have been invested back into the business. Is there any way you can kind of scale that for us or help us understand maybe when that $2 billion target might be achieved? Well, look, I mean, I'm -- I think we've told you that the incremental investments have been in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But we haven't quantified it specifically, and I don't really want to go there. The dynamic that you have, though, obviously, is that from -- the business continues to evolve and the environment continues to evolve, and so we're continuously looking for cost-out opportunities and efficiency opportunities such as part of the DNA of the company. And so what we had said earlier in the year, that we will probably delay it a year or so in terms of realization of those synergies as we move forward given the investments back into the business. So I still think that's a reasonable position to be in. Yes. Thanks, David. Just a reminder to everyone as we move forward, one question and one follow-up so we can get to as many people as possible. So Regina, next question. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Egan with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the margin question. I appreciate all the qualitative stuff that you've given us. But I was wondering, out of the 320-basis-point sequential improvement in ISG margins, if you could help us out understanding how much of that was servers and networking and how much of that was storage, because you pointed out that you had better profitability for both. Yes. Look, I'm not going to get down to that level of detail. I mean, we did see benefit from both the velocity in servers and the price expansion, I'll say, in servers given the configuration mix that we're seeing in the business. So I would tell you that servers -- and then we got better pricing and better mix in storage even as we drove -- even as volume wasn't quite where we wanted it. And then we've got -- Jeff highlighted it, the fact that we are loading a heavier mix of memory and NAND on some of these products, and therefore, that's helping us as well. I also would point out -- remember that as you look at that, we also got benefit from OpEx, right? So -- in the quarter. So I think the team did a reasonable job in managing OpEx, and very, very -- generally pretty pleased with what we saw in terms of profitability expansion. It's not where we want it yet. So I want to be really clear about that. Yes, we made some progress. We had a lighter mix of flexible consumption models in the quarter, so therefore, I didn't defer as much revenue and profitability as perhaps that you saw in Q2. That's going to vary quarter by quarter. So you've got to keep that in mind. But I think, overall, I'm pleased with the progress this quarter, but clearly, more work to do. Yes, just a reminder. When we've talked about this before, there does tend to be a bit of a lag effect on pricing, particularly with our larger customers, where we've committed to a certain level of pricing. This impacts ISG more so than CSG. So as we get a couple of quarters into some of these prices, we tend to be able to catch up a little bit better. And you saw acceleration of a couple of our premium products. Our XtremIO X2 grew quarter over quarter. Our all-flash array business across the portfolio grew. They generally carry higher margins. And 14G went from -- we're not going to give the percentage, but 14G increased pretty significantly as we went to the 14th generation of servers. OK. And then for my follow-up, maybe, as a good way to break down the 320, maybe I -- if Rob would let me just do sort of a two-parter. Go ahead. Why don't we let -- Tyler, why don't you take that question since this is right down your power alley? Yes, Thomas. And hopefully, you guys can hear me OK. So first, just as a reminder, right, when you're looking at that cash balance, that's also including the VMware cash. So remember, the Dell Technologies ex VMware, which is how I think about it when I'm looking at debt pay-down, is a smaller number, right? So it's, call it a little over $6 billion, $6.3 billion. The geography of that cash obviously moves around kind of depending on what's happening in the business and different intercompany flows. But I think, at any given time, we have probably 35% to 45% of that sitting in the U.S. And just like we said, right, we try to keep the balance as low, taking into account -- look, we do have places where maybe the cash is restricted or tied up. We've got investments on the books and that type of thing, but the focus is going to be taking that excess and paying down cash -- paying down debt. And just like Tom mentioned in the talking points, we're going to probably conserve cash. You asked about Q4. Seasonally, Q4 tends to be a stronger cash quarter, so that would be my expectation. But then that's followed by Q1, which typically tends to be a weaker cash quarter as we pay out things like certain tax payments and bonus and compensation, that type of thing, right? So I've got to prepare for that. And we've got those two maturities. The one in April is a little bit smaller. And look, that June maturity, I mean, look, my expectation is that's going to be funded through a combination of cash currently on the balance sheet, cash flow generation between now and then, and I do have the untapped revolvers. So if I need to depend on that to fund a portion of that, I have that available. And now, keep in mind, if I do that, that's purely temporary. So we use that to kind of fund some of these inter-quarter gaps typically, and so if I did that, it would only be for a short period of time. I mean, I -- my expectation is -- once again, we've got about $5.5 billion worth of debt coming due when I include the amortization payments for next year on the term loan, and I'm looking to pay that down with cash over time. Great. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Phipps with Citi. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks. Tyler, just following up on the last question. The next two maturities just happen to be investment grade -- or non-investment-grade bonds. And is there -- is that just when you're thinking about paying down things in cash? Or is it just that they happen to be non-investment-grade bonds that you're paying down and maybe thinking about, in the future, paying down other non-investment-grade bonds and maybe refinancing some of the investment-grade bonds? And how's Dell thinking about that as they go forward? Well, I mean, obviously, I would love to be able to pay down the most expensive debt first, but as you know, it's not all prepayables. So look, I think we'll pay things down as they come due. If it makes sense for whatever reason or there's a good opportunity to refinance, I mean, I'm not saying that's off the table. I mean, it's always a consideration as I'm trying to optimize the balance sheet and capital structure. And we'll pick a part of the term loans, right, I mean, because that's the stuff that's prepayable and easy to take out. I've got -- the A1 is gone now, so that's nice to see that's no longer in my capital structure. I've got the A3, which is due at the end of the year, so that's embedded in that $5.5 billion number I threw out earlier. And then we've got the A2 and the term loan B down the line. So look, I think we'll continue to do what we're doing, deleveraging. Take -- paying down debt will be the focus. But I don't want to say that refinancing opportunities are not existing or something I wouldn't consider. Sure. And just as a tag on to that, then I want to ask another one for Tyler, the Dell -- the 5, 7, 8%... Only two, guys. Pick one. I will then -- Tyler, just tell me about the -- we have a generally richer mix for servers and storage in the fourth quarter now that we look at the new Dell. Let me take that. That's more of a Tom question than a Tyler question, although Tyler is welcome to jump in on that, but, look... I have questions on that myself. That's all I did. Look, I -- again, we don't get into projecting future results. But I would tell you, if you just look at the dynamics of the business right now, clearly, we are seeing extraordinarily strong server velocity and demand for lots of reasons, right? More compute-centric solutions being driven, ASPs are up, as Jeff mentioned in his talking points, because of the richer mix, the pricing actions, the component cost inputs that have gone up. So as we think about Q4, if you look at seasonally, historically, this would be an extraordinarily strong storage quarter. And we do think that we'll see some of those old seasonal patterns hold. The question is, is how strong are servers going to be? And so we expect -- we'll have to see how that plays out. But historical seasonal patterns would tell you that storage should be -- this is typically the strongest quarter of the year from a storage perspective. And you do see, at times, end-of-the-year budget flush from some of the corporate customers as they're finishing their projects in their budget cycles, and therefore, you should -- we'll have to see how that plays on the server activity as well. But to be really clear, we're not slowing down servers. Our job is to speed up storage. Yes. So I mean our -- I told Jeff to go fast on both. Now that's not really very helpful from Jeff's perspective, which is what he's trying to do anyway. But our job is to get this business where we want it. We've got work to do on storage, as we all have talked about. And I'm pretty happy with server performance, and we just want to keep going on that. Thank you. That's my question and follow-up. Thank you. Thanks, Dave. I'd like to give you another one, but, you know... Operator Your next question comes from the line of Adam Willinger with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hey, thanks for taking the question. So I had another question on the flexible consumption model. So I guess, first, do you think that the lower proportion of these deals in the third quarter versus second quarter is like an anomaly to kind of longer-term trends? And then do you have any visibility into how these types of deals are trending in fourth quarter? Yes. Look, I do think that you shouldn't read anything into the fact that Q3 was a little bit softer than Q2 in terms of flexible consumption models. I think these things are going to vary. They're complex. They're multiyear. They take time to negotiate with -- and they're typically the larger customers -- they're global customers that are negotiating these types of arrangements. And so I think we are going to see some variability. I think all things being equal, it's entirely conceivable that we'll see an uptick in flexible consumption models in Q4 just given natural end-of-year sort of activity both from a customer and from a Dell Technologies perspective. But we'll have to see how that plays out. OK. And then still kind of on that topic, I think you touched on it briefly in one of the prior questions, but the presence of these kind of flexible consumption models, does it impact kind of how you recognize margin for the business, both kind of on a short term and over the life of the relationship? And I'm trying to think about if it's still fair to kind of think about incremental margin for storage in kind of the 50% area. Well, look, I mean, we like these flexible consumption models. They do have the effect, as you guys all know, of deferring recognition of revenue and amortizing that revenue and associated margin over a contract cycle that might be two to five years depending upon the term of the agreement. So, historically, what we have seen is, over time, these tend to be -- over the course of the contract period, they tend to be a better -- they tend to have a better profitability profile, but it ramps. So it starts a little lower and ramps over the course of the contract. So on an all-in basis, margin dollars generally have shown to be higher over the entire length of the contract, but it does change the timing pattern and pattern of when those are recognized. And so remember, we like these constructs in the context of building a more intimate customer relationship, ensuring that we are a more strategic partner for these customers and builds sort of a -- more of an as-a-service or a stream or recurring revenue stream that's helpful for us. And we've got the flexibility, being privately controlled, to do these types of structures and not be as focused on short-term quarter-to-quarter profitability, although, clearly, we're all trying to -- we are trying to drive the profitability of the business, but we do have some incremental flexibility here. OK. Thanks so much. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Thank you very much for taking my question. Jeff, can you talk a bit about the competitive landscape on the storage side, both in terms of some of the newer technologies as well as what you're seeing in sort of legacy? Sure, Shannon. Well, I think, a couple of things. When I look at the marketplace and as I'm learning through my first three months, it's a big market that we get confused, that we think is shrinking. This -- external storage market grew last quarter. It's a $24 billion market. It's a big opportunity. We have a big, big opportunity with our 30% share to grow in this market, and that's what we need to do. Clearly, the competition is NetApp and Pure, most notably. What I see about them is they have extreme focus and they have clarity in their product line. And I think they're reaping a benefit from that. If you -- some of my remarks are about pivoting our organization to that. I think we mentioned last quarter that we're going to invest in more sales specialist capacity. We hired more sales specialists in Q3. We're going to hire more sales specialists in Q4. We're going to build out that investment -- Tom actually talked about investments. One of the areas we consciously have decided to do is build out more capacity for more coverage in the mid-market commercial segment, and that's not at the exclusion of the enterprise segment either. We're building out more sales capacity in the enterprise. We're moving sales leadership between the organizations so we could get more storage knowledge base in our commercial organization. We're making adjustments and continuing to tweak our sales compensation toward a -- more biased toward storage. We just made two significant updates to the product portfolio. We added deduplication in Unity, and we added all-flash offers to our SC product line in the midrange. Our XtremIO, which is, I think, a very differentiated asset in the marketplace, particularly against the two competitors that I mentioned earlier, with its in-line data services and its performance attributes, is a great product. Another thing we just launched in the last, I think it's a week or 10 days, is a new customer loyalty program, which, if you compare it against the competitive landscape, is absolutely unmatched. Our competitors basically guarantee their product or program for 30 days. We guarantee ours for three years. It's got seven key components in it. Basically, it's an investment protection with a set of guarantees for our customers that, quite honestly, the industry analysts and our customers have responded quite well to, which I think is upping our competitive nature. So I think we're in a big market. It's a big opportunity. We clearly have lost share. It's undeniable. The public results are out. We're not satisfied with that. We're investing in sales capacity and coverage and expertise. We continue to add to the product portfolio and its competitiveness. We needed deduplication in Unity. We needed all-flash in the SC. We need to continue to drive the performance advantage we have in XtremIO. We now have a set of loyalty programs that, again, I believe, puts us in a position to walk into customers and say, ""There is no risk picking us or pulling out the competition. Here's our guarantee behind it."" I hope that answers your question. I'm happy to -- if I didn't, to go into more detail. No, I think that does. I just -- I'm curious, versus prior leadership in ISG, any changes that you see in terms of how you're going to approach the -- maybe the integration between the two businesses? Clearly, you're investing in certain areas. It sounds like a lot of that maybe was already under way. So I'm just curious how you're working with the EMC assets. Well, Dell family of assets -- we try not to refer to them as EMC assets. It's the Dell family of assets. I'm absolutely going to integrate, top to bottom, one team. You may be aware of some of the more siloed orientation of the previous organization. That's not going to be the case going forward. We're going to look at the storage portfolio. We're going to make decisions across the portfolio in the best interest of our customers. When I look at the high-end storage stack, the midrange storage stack, the low end across data protection and ACI, we are going to work more seamlessly across the organization and build the right number of products positioned appropriately in the marketplace. I mentioned in my remarks that we have a bit of complexity in the portfolio. We're going to make it clearer for our sales force and clearer for our customers which one -- what products to buy for what applications or environments. That's something we can do and we will do, and it's going to be across the entire portfolio. I don't know if that answers your question. Jeff, that's a multi-quarter journey, right? So... Given the cycle time of product development, given commitments we've made to customers, we will work through this. But complexity doesn't mean less products. Complexity can mean the number of offers per product, how many countries we offer our product in. Interestingly, we treat the 180th country the same way we treat the largest country in the world. It's not clear to me the 180th country in the world needs all of the entire storage breadth of our portfolio, and we can make that less complex, easier for our sales and marketing teams to communicate and much easier for our customers to buy. So you'll see us work on that over the next handful of quarters. Great. Thank you so much. It's nice to talk. All right. Great. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Shannon. Thanks to everyone for joining. Quick reminder. In early January, we will be at CES with a full suite of consumer and gaming products and invite anyone that's out there to reach out to us. We'd be happy to speak with you. Come by our show. So thanks, and have a great holiday season, everyone. Operator This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

We'll take a few minutes to summarize the results of the second quarter then afterwards open for questions about results. I'm now going to turn the call over to Terry to discuss our results. Terry Handley, President and Chief Executive Officer -- Thank you, Bill, and good morning everyone. As most of you have already seen, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.28 compared to $1.44 a year ago. The quarter started off with strong sales during the month of August. Unfortunately, we were unable to maintain that pace throughout the remainder of the quarter as we experienced softer traffic in the back half of the period which adversely impacted sales. Year to date, diluted earnings per share were $2.75 compared to $3.14 in the same period last year. In the fuel category, our retail pricing strategy allowed us to achieve an increase in same-store gallons sold of 1.9%, which continues to outpace miles driven reported by the United States Department of Transportation and our publicly traded peers. Total gallons sold for the quarter rose 5.7% to 562 million. The average retail price of fuel during this period was $2.33 a gallon compared to $2.10 last year. During the quarter we experienced an increase in wholesale fuel cost volatility, primarily due to the hurricane activity. As a result, the average fuel margin in the quarter was $0.197 per gallon. Year to date, the fuel margin was $0.195 per gallon, which is at the high end of our annual guidance. The second-quarter margin benefited from the sale of renewable fuel credits, commonly known as RINS. During the quarter, we sold 17.3 million RINS for $14.5 million. RINS are currently trading around $0.90. For comparison purposes going forward, last year in the third quarter the average RIN sold for approximately $0.89. Same-store gallons sold year to date were up 1.8%, which is the top of our annual guidance. [Audio gap] total gallons sold for the year up 5.6% to 1.1 billion. Due to the higher fuel margin in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago and increased gallons sold, gross profit dollars in the fuel category grew 11.7% to $110.7 million. Total sales in the grocery and other merchandise category were up 5% to $572.2 million in the second quarter. Same-store sales were up 2.5% during the quarter, which was toward the lower end of our guidance due to slower traffic in October that we believe was attributable to multiple adverse weather patterns throughout the month. However, we continue to outpace market data in our operating region. The average margin in the quarter was 32%, consistent with a year ago in the same period and at the top end of our annual guidance. As a result, gross profit for the quarter in the category was up nearly 5% to $183 million. For the year, same-store sales were up 2.8%, with total sales up 5.3% to $1.2 billion. The average margin year to date was 31.9%. We're pleased with the gains in the category in light of the current environment that we are currently experiencing, and we remain optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities as we benefit from the continued roll-out of major remodels, replacement stores, and new-store openings. In the prepared food and fountain category, total sales were up 5.5% to $262 million for the quarter. Same-store sales were up 2.1%, which fell below our annual guidance. After starting the quarter off strong in the month of August, this category was the most affected in the back half of the quarter, especially in October with the previously mentioned adverse weather patterns that drove negative same-store customer account for the month. We recognize that our customers continue to be value-conscious, and we have seen how well the fuel-saver program has resonated with them over the years. Beginning December 1, we kicked off a ""Pizza-to-Pump"" promotion. The program offers a $0.10 per-gallon coupon on up to 20 gallons of fuel for the purchase of any large pizza. We have offered this promotion in the past in select areas of a market with great success. As retail fuel prices have risen recently we believe this offer will lessen the strain on our consumers. The average margin for the second quarter was 61.3%, down 160 basis points from a year ago, primarily due to an increase in sales and higher input costs. The average cost of cheese has locked in at our Ankeny distribution center through December 2017 at $1.86 per pound. The market has recently been favorable for a cheese pricing, giving us the opportunity to enter into a new forward-buy of cheese. We are currently locked in for nearly all of our cheese through December 2018, at a price of approximately $1.87 per pound. In the quarter, prepared-food gross profit dollars rose 2.7% to $160.5 million. Year to date, same-store sales were up 2.9% with an average margin of 61.9%. Based on our year-to-date results we have revised our annual same-store sales guidance range down from 4% to 6% to 2% to 4%. We are encouraged about our long-term growth outlook in this area as we continue to benefit from the roll-out of our growth programs, new-store openings, and the implementation of price optimization, as well as the new digital engagement platform. At the six-month mark, operating expenses were up 9.7%. For the quarter, operating expenses increased 9.4% to $322.9 million. Approximately 60% of this increase was due to a rise in wages and payroll taxes primarily related to operating more stores compared to a year ago in the same period. In addition, we experienced a combined increase of $4.1 million in credit card fees and fuel expense primarily due to increased retail fuel prices in the quarter. This had a 140 basis-point adverse impact to the quarterly operating increase. We continue to make gains in controlling our operating expenses.Store-level operating expenses for open stores not impacted by any of the growth programs were up approximately 3.7% in the second quarter. Without the impact from the increase of store manager salaries stemming from the proposed change by the Department of Labor a year ago, store-level expenses would have been up approximately 2.7%. The unchanged numbers include the adverse impacts of the higher credit card fees mentioned previously. Operating expenses will continue to be an area of focus throughout the year. I would now like to turn the call over to Bill to discuss the financial statements. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- On the income statement, total revenue in the quarter was up over 12% to $2.2 billion, primarily due to an 11% increase in the retail price of fuel from the second quarter last year and increased sales gains mentioned previously, as well as increased number of stores in operation this quarter compared to the same period a year ago. Depreciation was up 11.3 %. We expect depreciation increase in the second half of the year, as we accelerate the number of new-store openings. Year-to-date total revenues up 9.2%. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 36.9%, up 80 basis points primarily due to a decrease in favorable permanent differences and the change in the Illinois state tax rate that went into effect during the first quarter. Recently we received a number of inquiries regarding the potential impact to Casey's with the new tax reform bill. There are many aspects to this reform and the provisions are still being debated and reconciled between the Senate and House. However, as it stands currently, taking into account all the changes in the new tax law, we anticipate it will have a significant one-time favorable impact on earnings per share when it becomes effective as Casey's will reset our deferred tax liability at the new lower tax rate. Going forward in future years, the company will benefit from the substantially lower corporate effective tax rate. Our balance sheet continues to be strong. At October 31, cash and cash equivalents were $285.2 million, up from $76.7 million at the end of the fiscal year, primarily due to the additional debt we secured for future growth offset by share repurchases. Long-term debt net of [Inaudible] maturities was $1.3 billion. At the six-month mark, we generated $242 million in cash flow from operations, and capital expenditures were $271.6 million compared to $209.2 million a year ago in the same period. We expect capital expenditures to increase as new-store construction accelerates, we close on additional acquisitions, and we complete more major remodels during the second half of our fiscal year. Lastly, I would like to give you an update on the progress of the share-repurchase program. As a reminder, the program authorized purchases of up to $300 million of common stock over the course of two years. As the press release indicated, during the second fiscal quarter we repurchased over 510,000 shares for approximately $55 million. Since the start of the program, we have repurchased nearly 1.7 million shares. We continue to believe a share-repurchase program is an important tool in providing shareholder value. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Terry to talk about our unit growth and an update on our growth programs. Terry? Terry Handley, President and Chief Executive Officer -- Thanks, Bill. This quarter we opened 10 new store constructions and completed 13 replacement stores. We acquired 11 stores and have 16 additional acquisitions stores under agreement to purchase. We also completed 17 major remodels in the quarter. In addition to all this activity, we currently have 66 new stores, 18 replacement stores, and 14 major remodels under construction. Currently, we have 134 sites under agreement for new builds. We are also encouraged by the increase in acquisition activity. We believe this is in part related to the continued challenges in the economic environment in our marketing territory. Our store count at the end of this quarter was 2,003. Given our strong balance sheet and expanded geography, we're positioned very well for future growth. We are also excited to celebrate the milestone of opening of our 2,000th store, in Russellville, Kentucky. Growth programs continue to be a key part of our long-term strategy. In the first six months, we converted 65 locations to a 24-hour format and 75 stores to the pizza-delivery format. In addition to these conversions, we have also completed 28 major remodels. For the fiscal year, we are planning to complete 75 major remodels. Currently, we have a total of 1,062 stores that are open 24 hours, 655 stores that deliver pizza, and 492 stores that have been remodeled. In addition to these programs, we were encouraged by the performance of our online ordering program. Total downloads of the mobile app have now exceeded 1 million. The amount of pizza orders completed online has climbed to 16% and the basket bring of an online order continues to be around 20% higher compared to a telephonic order. At this time I would like to update you on the progress of our price-optimization and digital-engagement programs mentioned in our previous earnings call. Since that time, we've engaged separate consultants for each program. Each consultant is currently going through an assessment phase, which will clarify our present state and provide a road map and timeline associated with the development and integration of each program. This assessment phase will be completed in January. We will update all of you in more detail at our earnings call in March. We believe that these programs will give us the opportunity to widen our customer base with better insight to our customer needs and buying habits. We will also have an opportunity to take advantage of differences in market conditions related to pricing of certain products, allowing us the ability to drive incremental growth profit dollars. In closing, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities. The steps we have taken over the past year has put the company in a position to have consistent and sustained unit growth over the next several years at higher levels than we have experienced in the past. We will look to augment our new-store construction activity with acquisitions in both new and existing markets. Keep in mind that we will always have return on invested capital as a top priority. As we look ahead to the remaining part of the fiscal year and into Fiscal 2019 and beyond, we feel we have the opportunity to drive significant long-term shareholder value. We will now take your questions. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time if you have a question please press the * and the No. 1 key on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered and you want to remove yourself from the queue, please press the # key. And our first question comes from the line of Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Shane Higgins -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst -- Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Hey guys, just wanted to circle back on the prepared foods. Obviously, you guys were running pretty strong in August and then, you called out October, I guess was weather? Could you just help us kind of understand kind of how the cadence, traffic, and average ticket was throughout the quarter and how you guys are doing thus far in the third quarter? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Yeah, absolutely, Shane, I'll go ahead and field that question, and you're exactly right. In the last earnings call, we certainly called out the month of August at that time, and we certainly were performing what we consider to be relatively strong in the month of August. At that time gallons were certainly trending above the current guidance at that time and as you may recall, Shane, that we did make some comments that both prepared food and grocery and general merchandise were trending toward the higher end of the range. And so as you move through the quarter, the month of October really was kind of the call-out as far as, kind of the downward trend there. As we alluded to, we had negative customer account on a same-store basis in the month of October. One of the comments there that Terry made had to do with adverse weather patterns, and so in the month of August, excuse me, in the month of October throughout the majority of our area, we experienced on the weekends significant thunderstorm activity and rainstorms. That may not sound like a severe weather pattern but when roughly about half to 60% of our pizza sales run through the weekends and you have customers that just don't get out and about because of the weather patterns that will affect a short-term basis and that's what we're referring to there. Really, October was the month that really was kind of the anomaly in the quarter when we look at it. Does that answer all your questions, Shane? Shane Higgins -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst -- So does that indicate that, I mean obviously you guys brought your guidance down a little bit for the for the full-year call, but it seems to imply that comps are at least stabilizing and maybe getting slightly better for the remainder of the year. I know you guys talked about the promotion that you guys just launched. Did November's trends give you guys some additional confidence that you guys can hit even the midpoint of the new range in the back half? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Yea, and I think the latter part of your question is, kind of this quarter quarter-date here in Q3, kind of where we're trending at, I think that might answer your question, so with respect to the fuel gallons, we are trending ahead of our guidance, quarter to date. With respect to grocery and general merchandise and prepared foods, we would be in line with how we finished the second-quarter results. And, again, we just kicked off that pizza-to-pump promotion that Terry mentioned just about a week ago. Shane Higgins -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst -- OK, great. And then just on the margins. Obviously, margins were down a bit in the prepared foods. You guys did reaffirm the margin guidance for the year. Can you just give us some color as to some of the puts and takes for this quarter and as we look into the back half? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Sure, coming into the fiscal year, one of the gray areas or the unknowns was the back half of the fiscal year, because at that point time we were only locked in on our cheese through December 2017 and so, as we mentioned, we were fortunate that the pricing environment became favorable and we were able to lock in our cheese costs for the back half of the year. So that gives us some confidence to keep that guidance still intact on the margin side of the equation. Shane Higgins -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst -- Any changes to call out in terms of the competitive environment from any the pizza chains or any of your other prepared-food competitors? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- I don't think there's any changes that we would call out relative to what we've already called out in the past two quarters. We haven't seen necessarily any type of an acceleration in that competitive landscape. Obviously it still remains competitive but kind of stable competitive if you wanna call it that. Shane Higgins -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst -- Just one housekeeping. On your inventories were up about 16%, is that a reflection of the unit growth that you guys have for the back half of the year? Can you just help me understand the uptick in the inventories? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Yea, there are really two things there. One would be the cigarettes, we had a price increase in cigarettes and so you saw a significant rise there, and also with the rising fuel, you would see that in the inventory category, as well. Shane Higgins -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst -- Got it. All right. That's it for me. I'll get back in the queue, thanks. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- You bet. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Gilligan of Barclays. Your line is open. Ryan Gilligan -- Barclays -- Analyst -- Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Hi Ryan, how you doing? Ryan Gilligan -- Barclays -- Analyst -- Good, thanks. On the digital-engagement and price-optimization projects, have you had enough time to size the opportunities yet and when do you think these initiatives can start to roll out? Terry Handley, President and Chief Executive Officer -- Yea, Ryan, this is Terry. I think we're, we had our first roll-up meeting with the digital team actually just yesterday and the price optimization, first meeting with those folks in terms of the role-up first assessment will be here later in the month so we're not ready to share with you exactly what we have planned. We want to see actually through some future discussion here what the work plan will actually look like and certainly as we've indicated in the call here so far is that we're looking at the end January to have an understanding of where we're going forward and what tools or platforms may be required to us off to the right start and we will certainly bring you more clarity on that in the Q3 call. Ryan Gilligan -- Barclays -- Analyst -- And how should we think about the cadence of unit growth for the rest of the year? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Those 66 stores that we have under construction, roughly about two-thirds of those that we anticipate closing in the fourth quarter, and so a third obviously coming here in Q3. As far as the acquisitions I would say most of it, that's kind of right on the bubble. I would push those ones that we have under agreement into the fourth quarter so definitely there will be an acceleration in the back half of the year. So we fully anticipate to be somewhere close to opening roughly 80 new-store constructions and at least as of the information we presented, we're going to have about 30 new acquisitions rolling through. Ryan Gilligan -- Barclays -- Analyst -- Do you anticipate tax reform potentially changing your appetite for doing larger deals? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Well we always have an appetite to look any type of acquisition, and certainly whether that's small or large, certainly the tax reform as it sits now stands to be a benefit to us, and so we'll have to evaluate how the final bill rolls up from House and Senate. But certainly that is a possibility. I would say this, Ryan, along the M&A front: We definitely have seen an uptick in M&A activity that's indicative by what we were report, obviously. Right now we have 14 acquired stores and 16 under agreement, that alone probably combined for last two fiscal years together, and certainly we are seen many more people willing to have conversations about selling their business. We believe certainly a reflection of the environment that we have we been talking about and that they are pretty much feeling the type of strain that we are on a slower pace, so we're encouraged by that area. Ryan Gilligan -- Barclays -- Analyst -- That makes sense and just quickly, the credit card fees for the quarter? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- The credit card fees were $31.6 million. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Bonnie Herzog -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst -- I just wanted to circle back on your prepared-food margins in the guidance that you did maintain. I just really want to understand your ability to hit these targets, just thinking in context of the stepped-up promos on your pizza business that you mentioned. So I just want to understand what kind of impact that could have on your margins and maybe any other initiatives that you might have in the works in the last couple of quarters for the year that could possibly negatively impact margins. Just trying to think through that. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Just a couple thoughts around the prepared-food margin for you, Bonnie, as I mentioned, we are locked into cheese for the remaining part of this fiscal year so we're encouraged by that and that will stabilize probably the biggest variable when it comes to be prepared-food margin. The other side of the equation, one of things that affected us in the second quarter, was the weather patterns that happened to hit just about every week in the month of October. We obviously have production planners that we were scheduled to meet the demands of our customers, and obviously we have a high demand on the weekends and so when an activity like that happens on a repeat basis, we we tend to have product that in our warmers that we end up staling, so there was a little bit of an anomaly coming through there, so we think that we have opportunity to to accelerate from that point on. Also keep in mind we are locked in on our coffee, as well, well into the summer. And with respect to your question on the pizza-to-pump promotion, that actually is a coupon for fuel and so that will run through the cost of goods sold in the fuel category not the prepared-food margin category. Bonnie Herzog -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst -- So, you're still feeling pretty darn confident that the margins will be, you'll achieve them, obviously, based on what you just mentioned. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Based on the information we know of today, we didn't see a reason to change that. Some of the other categories we also maintained. Obviously the unit growth right now, the low side of that's 90, and if you go through the math that we just talked about you were tracking it around 110 and maybe a little higher than that units for this year, so that's one that looks like we're pushing toward the higher edge of that guidance. The same holds true on the fuel gallon guidance, as well. Bonnie Herzog -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst -- I imagine you're on the upper end of your margin and guidance there, closer to 20 CPG. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Obviously by what we reported we are certainly on the upper end there, as well as the same-store gallon movement. And, as we mentioned, at least through this conference call, we are trending above the same-store gallon guidance currently. Bonnie Herzog -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst -- Then I wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more color on some of the key merchandise categories. I might've missed it, but if you could drill down a little bit on package beverages and you did mention, of course, the cig price increase that occurred and how your tobacco business performed, and did that in any way have any impact on some of the softer traffic you mentioned? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Well, I will say this: We think it's the weather that is causing more of the softer traffic right there, and when we have a slower traffic pattern, whether that is lower single digits or even negative, it does permeate across all lines of our business. and so I would say the takeaway there in the month of October we would have reported higher results throughout every line of our business if it hadn't been for those somewhat of anomalies there. So drilling down to your question with respect to the grocery and general merchandise category, you may have picked up that we made a comment that we believe we're gaining market share within this category. Part of the reason that we believe that is now we obviously get market data similar to what you do with IRI, Nielsen Data, also what we call supplier-shipment data, and so we are trending above all of that in the cigarette category, which obviously dominates the grocery and general merchandise category. One of the things to point out more specifically, you probably heard us in the past conference calls talk about the beer category and how promotional that's been? Here in the second quarter, I think we started late in the second quarter, we went off of a lot of promotion activity and so we definitely have seen a margin uptick in the beer category. Our liquor sales are doing exceptionally well. We continue to look for opportunities to add more liquor to our stores. That seems to be a trend, especially in some of the younger consumers that we have. Look for us to continue to increase the liquor offerings that we have. Bonnie Herzog -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst -- OK. Just one final question on the traffic, which, again, you just mentioned, that you really think a lot of it had to do with the the weak weather but then I'm trying to understand with you know your stores and the locations, it's pretty widely spread. So curious if you could give us a sense of maybe the traffic patterns across your portfolio. I'm just wondering if you didn't see any pockets of traffic growth in some areas where maybe weather was better. Just trying to really get an understanding of what happened and if you're seeing signs of improvement. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- So the magnitude of the weather, and it seems odd to talk about rain, but when heavy rain falls on the weekend it can impact us, especially if it is a broad, sweeping weather pattern. For us, the three states that would be impactful the most, as you might know, are Iowa, Missouri, and Illinois, and that's where the weather patterns hit, that represents about 75% of our store base. Typically in the winter months those storms that we get will be probably more isolated to the northern part of our region. This one just happened to be a little bit further sweeping. Bonnie Herzog -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst -- And you're already feeling better about the traffic patterns so far in this next quarter? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Yea, definitely the traffic patterns are moving upward from the month of October. Operator Our next question is from the line of Ryan Domyancic of William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan Domyancic -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst -- Hey, Bill, good morning and thank you for taking my question. So not to get into the traffic again, but you talked about the negative traffic attacking the prepared-food side, but gallon growth, which I assume is a pretty good proxy to traffic, has been on the high end of the guidance range for the past two quarters. So I guess can you help us understand and reconcile why gallon growth has been meeting expectations but there's some issues inside the store with that prepared-food comp? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Yeah, there's probably a lot of things going on in the gallon area. Obviously in our market area there is really no alternative for public transportation so customers continue to have to go to and from work, we continue to add stores in key locations, which I think is taking market share for us. Obviously we have a fuel-saver program that's different than some of our peers that's also helping out, but we noticed that same type of what would appear to be a disconnect in central gallon movement with respect to the transition or conversion inside, and that's kind of one of the beauties of the pizza-to-pump promotion. One of the thoughts, Ryan, in order to redeem that coupon, a customer will have to go inside the store. So they buy a large pizza and get that coupon, they'll redeem that coupon at some future date, but to do so, as I just mentioned, they're forced to come into the store. So we're trying to create more touch points with consumer inside the store to convert into some type of additional sales above and beyond just the fuel, so that's one of the thought processes behind that promotion. Ryan Domyancic -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst -- All right, that's helpful. And then results to date demonstrates that you've made progress in [Inaudible] the OPEX growth in the past two quarters, but the OPEX guide was reiterated. If you have the managers' salary increases in December, are there any other costs that are going to be backfilling kind of that costs that you're lapping that would cause the OPEX growth to maintain its current trajectory instead of slow down? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- One of the things to think about, and I think Bonnie or somebody else might have asked the question about the cadence of new store roll-outs. And so obviously as we add more stores into the mix that will obviously add more operating expenses, and so that's one of things -- we did discuss whether or not we should move that guidance down, obviously we were trending to the low end of that guidance. Once we cycle over that Department of Labor, that will be one of those things that we might actually be slightly below but probably a little bit cautious from our perspective. especially after having reduced the prepared-food same-store guidance now for two quarters in a row. Just trying to take maybe a little bit of a conservative approach there. Ryan Domyancic -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst -- That makes sense. Very helpful, thank you for your time today. Operator Thank you and our next question is from the line of Irene Nattel of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Irene Nattel -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst -- Thanks and good morning, everyone. Just thinking about your commentary around the value-conscious consumers -- wondering what promotional activity you might have planned incrementally either in-store or above and beyond just that pizza-and-a-pump linkage to really get at that because with farm income once again having been depressed for this year, that behavior is unlikely to change as we you know get into after even after F '19. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- Yeah, I'll tell you this: We have a series of promotional activities throughout the remainder of this fiscal year. As we get into the latter part you'll start a frame up and think about Fiscal '19. We tend not to talk about what those are in advance -- we don't want to give our competitors any type of forewarning of what we might promote coming up. But definitely your comments ring very true here, certainly there is a value-conscious customer, we don't think that's going to change in the near term, and so we are looking for ways to bring about some value propositions for the consumer at the same time trying to drive him inside of our stores. So that's kind of what the promotional activity's about. Now to Terry's comments earlier, as well, I think when we look at the digital-engagement side of that and start kicking that off as we head into Fiscal '19 I think that'll give us some really keen insight on our consumer behavior and buying habits that we then can at that point individual promotions specific to a customer rather than just a blanket promotion that would go throughout the entire corporate territory. Irene Nattel -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst -- Absolutely and, again, presumably this a lot of these initiatives really are geared to strengthen your most loyal customers but at the same time drive your top line through more effective promotions? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- Yes. Yes, that's exactly right . Irene Nattel -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst -- OK. I'm just on the OPEX side, I guess the last fella that was asking questions sort of was trying to get at this, but the programs that you've implemented to date, have the results been better than you anticipated? In other words, I guess I'm really trying to get at is the OPEX gains, are they bigger than you expected? Could the size of that pie be larger than what you've already disclosed? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- I would characterize it this way, Irene: The ones that we have rolled out are performing as expected, but we had we have several that we just rolled out here in the last fiscal quarter that really are not part of the results that we've reported. I'd be happy to walk through some of those. The one that we first did it was changing the automatic raise of $0.25 an hour after 90 days, and we did that and that that resulted in Q1 and Q2, that's performing as expected. Also, we have taken a more a tactical approach in our advertising spend. You might recall that we did increase advertising pretty significantly in Fiscal 2017, so right now advertising spend is down and tracking to where we we believe it was expected to track at. Several things that are just out that I think will have an impact in the back half of the year. We did, as I mentioned in last call, we did establish a kind of 3% merit increase kind of target, as you might recall. We've been tracking prior to this at about 4% to 5% merit increase, which may not seem like a lot but in a 1% to 2% movement is a pretty big number. Now that one takes a course of time really to see that benefit. It is tracking right where we think it is but, keep in mind. not everybody has the same anniversary date in the company, so it takes at least a full year to kind of cycle through that to see that full benefit. We just implemented here recently what I'll call -- I'm going to characterize as an increased focus on clocking in, clocking out, primarily focused on the clocking-in side of it, and that's simply put is, we'll have hourly employees that might be scheduled, say, 9 to 5, well they come in at 8:45, clock in, and everybody thinks they're a hard worker. At the end of the day, we're paying them unscheduled labor hours, so there's a little more keen focus there and not allowing them to check in anytime sooner than when they're scheduled. So that just got kicked off the ground, so you're not seeing that in the fiscal quarter. Also, we made a change in the shift differential hours here in the second quarter . We used to have a shift differential that would pay people through 8 a.m. We pulled back several hours and that will be a benefit moving forward here into fiscal Q3, for us. And then one of the things that I know store operations has done a great job of, is taking a look at our budgeted hours and obviously when you're having maybe a slower pace of revenue in customer traffic, there might be opportunities to pull back some of the hours, and so we are tracking, that's probably the biggest reason you're seeing that unchanged store base come down. So there's a number of things like that and we can continue to look at the budget-hours calculator, as well, so just a few nuggets for you there. Irene Nattel -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst -- That's really helpful, thank you. And one final question, if I may, on the proposed tax reform. A lot of what I hear says on a blended basis it would likely come in around 25%, so I guess that my question is twofold, No. 1) based on your sort of state mix is it the right level? And, No. 2) is it really as simple as taking your tax rate down from, let's call it that 35 to 36 rate level, to the 25ish level or is there something else we need to take into, keep in mind? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- To answer your first part, when you adjust for all the potential changes, and granted these changes could move here, but when you adjust for different things, some give and takes in the tax reform, that blended rate is basically what you just mentioned. Our effective tax rate right now is around 37% and I think it has the opportunity to be somewhere that, I'm gonna give you a range of 22 to 27%. I don't know when it's going to be in effect whether it's going to be 1/1/19 or how they kind of reconcile that. Then the one-time effect, as I mentioned in my opening comments, the reset of the deferred tax liabilities; think about that. That's a pretty good number that's well over a $100 million of a reset that will hit the income statement on a one-time basis. Irene Nattel -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst -- Very helpful. Thank you. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- You're welcome. Operator Thank you, our next question on the line is Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Your line is open Daniel Imbro -- Stephens -- Yes, thanks guys, this is actually Daniel Imbro on for Ben. Thanks for taking our questions. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- You bet. Daniel Imbro -- Stephens -- So I know it's been discussed but I did want to start on the prepared-food guidance. Given we're halfway through the year, the implied range for prepared-food comps in the back half looks to be pretty wide. Is that an indication of the volatility you guys are seeing in your markets or kind of any color there on why back-half implications are still pretty wide range would be great. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- Well, yea, it's still a pretty wide range predominantly because of the Pizza-at-the-Pump promotion. Obviously there's an opportunity to accelerate from where we're at. So we decided to keep it at a relatively large range at this point time. Daniel Imbro -- Stephens -- OK, great. Kind of shifting gears a little bit here, with the OPEX being well -controlled can you talk about the employee reaction to some of your labor management decreased wages increases, have there been any kind of meaningful change in turnover or employee retention with those changes? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- No, we haven't seen anything. That's a great question because it's a common question we get and one we were concerned about. Right now we haven't seen any type of significant or larger spread concern over some of the changes we've made that's something that we're going to continue to monitor, especially when we start reducing hours. Obviously that creates a strain on store operations and certainly don't want to cause any adverse or unintended consequences like additional turnover from reduced hours at the store that puts pressure maybe a managerial staff person. A great question. Daniel Imbro -- Stephens -- Great. Then one last one for me if I could, kind of a clarifier, I think you called out credit card fees, if I heard you right, were 140 bps of the OPEX growth in the quarter? Your OPEX growth guidance of 9 to 11, are you assuming any contribution of that from credit card fees if we see gasoline prices continue to rise? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- Well that's a great question. Obviously, if fuel prices rise significant in the back half of the year, that would be one area that you will see spike up and so keep in mind that credit card fee, that $4.1 million that we referenced, that would be a combination of credit card fees and our own fuel expense to run our fleet. So it's twofold there. Daniel Imbro -- Stephens -- Ok, thanks and best of luck. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- You bet. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kelly Bania of BMO Capital. Your line is open. Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital -- Analyst -- Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Just curious on the prepared-food comps. It sounds like the beginning of the quarter was maybe tracking over 5 and possibly flat to negative in October. I guess the weather is a big factor there but it just seems like a pretty big swing for weather so just curious if there's anything else that you think is going on? Any comparisons, any other market conditions, or just how much analysis went into kind of looking at that and how that compares to historical weather pattern? And then also if you look at kind of the trends within grocery versus prepared food, are you seeing any different or the same signs of price sensitivity or trade up or trade down or does it depend on the category? Just trying to get a understanding of really where your consumer's mindset is. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- Yeah, I'll try to get all of those answers. If I miss one, Kelly, please circle back with me on that. But with respect to the prepared-food comps you're correct, I mean we were trending certainly north of 5 in the month of August for prepared food and fountain, and so it really started really kind of the back half of September, and moved right into almost the entire month of October. So the analytics that we did, we started looking at weekdays, weekend days, things of that nature, understanding to the best of our knowledge whether there's any other factors that are impacting us. We felt there were no other incremental factors that were impacting us either in September or October that we didn't already see in the month of August, and so, as I mentioned, 50% to 60% of all of our pizza sales happen on the weekends. Take it a step further, about 45% of all our inside sales happen on the weekends. So when you have weather patterns or any other events for that matter that would affect traffic on those periods of time, it will have a significantly higher impact, adverse impact, especially in a short period of time. So when you look at that you're talking about almost a 200% increase in precipitation, significant across those three major states that we talked about And so, when we look at thee data that's kind of how it rolls up. And so the back half of the question you have to reiterate for me, Kelly. Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital -- Analyst -- Just curious if within the prepared-food category versus the grocery category are you seeing the same trends in terms of price sensitivity, trade up, trade down? I think you also mentioned you raised some cigarette prices, I think some of the prepared food price increases are falling off, just I think in November, so just curious about how you feel about those kind of signs and prices and your consumer willingness to accept those? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- Yeah, no you're right, we did have a price increase that fell off in November. We chose not to have that type of price increase moving forward because that value-conscious commentary we gave. You know, with respect to some of the trends that we are seeing are like, for instance, cigarettes, we definitely continue to see a continued move toward more pack purchasing, albeit it's been slow and gradual over the last 12 to 18 months, but people continue gravitate to packs more than cartons and more to a value brand then a premium brand. And those are signs that certainly the consumer is continuing to be strained. Now the basket bring inside the store, excluding fuel, is relatively consistent to where it was in the past three quarters so that we have some stabilization there, so I think that's encouraging. Farm income, there is some reports out there from the USDA that they expect an upward movement in farm income as we head into Calendar '18. Things don't turn around overnight but those are all positive signs for us. Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital -- Analyst -- I'm sorry, did you mention where quarter to date the comps are? Because I think you had a very warm November last year and I don't know if I missed that, so just curious with all those dynamics how you're cycling that. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- A good memory, Kelly. Yeah we had, actually the first half of November last year was unseasonably warm and so there was a little bit of pressure. You might recall we made some comments about November last year -- that was our strongest prepared-food comp month of the year. I think it may have been the strongest grocery and general-merchandise month of the year, as well. A lot of it had to do with the very unseasonably hot weather. The first part of November. Now the back half of November last year actually changed and we actually saw in the back after November this year some very unseasonably warm weather, so we definitely saw a pickup in the back half of November, and certainly so far in December, the weather patterns seem to be favorable. You asked a question about quarter-to-date numbers? I think you did? The commentary we gave for a quarter to date -- in the fuel category we're trending above our guidance; in the grocery and general merchandise and prepared-food category we are trending very similar quarter to date what we finished in the second quarter. Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital -- Analyst -- OK, so you're expecting continued improvement, I guess, in the prepared-foods category as you cycle those comparisons, would that be fair? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- Yeah, that would be fair. Obviously, with the Pizza-to-Pump promotion, we anticipate certainly a benefit there not only in the prepared-food category but also on the gallon movement. In addition, I will point out that we look at a potential tailwind going forward here for Q4, you might recall that we had some adverse impacts from some deep discount promotions that we ran in the fourth quarter that did not resonate with the customer, so we will be countering against some lighter numbers as we head into the back half of the year. Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital -- Analyst -- And can you help us understand what you meant that you've tested this Pizza-to-Pump promotion -- what kind of results? What you learned from that? What we can expect in terms of elasticity from that and how that impacts your fuel margins? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- So the last time we did this was, so I think it was back in the state of Indiana back in 2014, and the reason we did it back then, obviously we saw behavior in the state of Indiana that we wanted to change, and so we wanted to get more presence and impact in our prepared-food category and increase that brand recognition. So we ran that for a short period of time with great success. Comps were probably two to three times higher than the unchained store base in the state of Indiana. The more positive takeaway from that program back in 2014, is after we shut it off, those comps continued to be relatively robust, so there wasn't a drop-off. So I think it did what it was intended to do. So now we're in a situation where we're trying to maybe change consumer behavior or play upon some of the value-conscious thought processes of our consumer, and so we decided at this point, let's try to do this corporatewide, understanding we're not going to have maybe as big of an impact because obviously we we have a strong brand recognition but the idea is to shift the consumer behavior to think about that value proposition to leverage several pieces of our business together -- that would be the pizza category as well fuel category. Especially as we see retail fuel prices rise, we see how the fuel-saver programs have resonated over the years with our consumers. We feel we have an opportunity to kind of leverage both aspects of that, and, as I mentioned in one of the earlier answers to the questions, one of the nice things about the program, in order to redeem the coupon it does push the customer inside the store, which gives us more opportunities to do a selective-sale proposition. At this point, it would be hard for me to gauge what the impact might be on the fuel margin side. A lot of it has to do with the redemption of the coupon. if I recall back in 2014, we roughly had about a 50% redemption rate of that coupon. That's very helpful and then just one more? I just wanted to ask about the performance of new stores, how that's tracking relative to your expectation and how many of the smaller stores you opened so far and how that's going? Yea, well, the stores are trending as expected for us. We monitor that relatively closely, looking at not only movement of revenue ramp-up in all three of our major categories, but also cash-flow ramp up. And so we haven't seen any discernible change that would would give us pause in that program. With respect, I think you're asking about the small format, 3,600-square-foot facility, This last fiscal year I think we're doing about a third of our stores with that smaller footprint, continuing to look for opportunities, We obviously continue to always tweak that store design to make sure that we're trying to meet the needs of the customer. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ben Brownlow of Raymond James. Ben Brownlow -- Raymond James -- Analyst -- Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. You mentioned the fuel pricing strategy earlier on. I'm just trying to get my hands a little bit better around the conversion issues. Have you changed that fuel pricing strategy at all over the past few months and aside from the promotion-linked coupons that you plan on running? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- I wouldn't say we changed it over the last few months, I would probably characterize it as an increased focus on the movement of our competitors and an increased focus on the movement of wholesale gas. I mentioned in the last conference call we did that I had a great opportunity to hire a young man from Murphy to come in and be our director of fuels and so we definitely, he has brought certainly a sharper light on that area. I wouldn't say, however, that has changed the strategy at this point, it's just a continued focus on that area. Gallon movement is probably also related to some things I mentioned in the previous answers. I would say this, though, that when when Terry talks about price optimization, fuel is part of that program and so that's something that we are are looking at to refine to see if there's an opportunity. Ben Brownlow -- Raymond James -- Analyst -- OK, so that's helpful and so, in effect you're being more active, around, as opposed to following, you're being a little bit more active in some of those markets on on trying to lead price? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- I'm not sure I'd call it lead price, but certainly make sure that we are as responsive as we should be to the changing issues within the fuel category by demographic. Ben Brownlow -- Raymond James -- Analyst -- That's helpful. And on the tax reform, just given that the industry is historically pass-through expense savings, and kind of thinking of tax as obviously an expense, how do you see that playing out over a quarter, even 12 months? Do you see that being passed through to the consumer in lower prices? And also how should we think about the impact to the cash stacks, just given [Inaudible] that one-time kind of reset in the deferred tax expense, but that's been keeping your cash stacks around 17% to 20% over the past few years, so how should we think about that given the reform? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- Well, I'll probably defer the first cash tax question until we know exactly how the bill's going to play out, so that might be a follow-up question, Ben, in the March conference call. But with respect to to speak to your other questions, we've never had this type of broad, sweeping tax change, at least in my time with the company. I can't sit here and tell you whether we pass through or not. Really right now I believe it will probably not be completely passed through to the consumer and be retained at the corporate levels. Especially when you think about, at least our market area, Ben, you think about our market area and the kind of the economic environment that we're in. A lot of people are, have a slower pace in their operation and there may be a likelihood for them to retain that as opposed to pass it on, but I guess that the competitive landscape will have to play out here as we move forward, but that's a great question. Operator Thank you, and as a reminder, if you have a question at this time, please press the ^ key and the No. 1 key in your touchtone telephone. And the next question is from the line of Anthony Lebiedzinski of Sidoti and Company. Your line is open. Anthony Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti -- Analyst -- Yes, good morning and thank you for taking the questions. All right so I was just looking again at the prepared-food and fountain category. When [Inaudible] in that segment, was there any notable divergence between that, or was it consistent? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- I gotta apologize. You cut out several times there so I didn't quite hear your question. Anthony Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti -- Analyst -- I'll repeat it, so just looking at the prepared-food and fountain category, if I were to look at just the pizza sales versus the other products within that category, was it consistent or was there some divergence between, for sales performance there? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- I would say that if you look at all three categories rolled out there was definitely a more adverse impact on the pizza line than the other categories and those other categories, by way of reference, would be your bakery and your fountain category. Anthony Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti -- Analyst -- Great, thank you for that. And also you mentioned before that your liquor sales are doing well and I think there's plans to expand that, so do you mean to have more stores offering liquor or [Inaudible] just offering within your store [Inaudible] how many of your stories actually sell liquor nowadays? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- The answer there would be looking to add more stores with that product line as opposed to changing the product mix inside the existing stores. We have roughly about 1,100, a little less than 1,100 stores, that sell liquor, 872, I'm told. Sorry. And so opportunities there, I guess you know that'll be a state-by-state basis but there are hundreds and hundreds of opportunities we think we'd like to put liquor in. Anthony Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti -- Analyst -- Switching gears, so to just looking at the number of RINS actually sold ithe quarter, on a year-over-year basis, was down 17.3 versus 17.8. Can you say whether this was some timing issue or something else going on? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- No, it wasn't a timing issue, probably just the movement of fuel at that particular time. I don't necessarily see that was a huge difference there but nothing nothing to point out at this time. Anthony Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti -- Analyst -- Got it, got it, OK, and just say the housekeeping question, as far as store closing plans or anything for Q3 and Q4 that we should think about when we update our models? William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and CFO -- Well we wouldn't be able to give you any, I guess, forward-looking comments on stores to close, but we are always looking at opportunities to close stores that are underperforming or we might have a replacement store that we might close one or two stores, but I would anticipate the run rate to be similar to last year. Anthony Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti -- Analyst -- OK. All right. Thank you. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- You bet. Operator Thank you, and that concludes our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Walljasper for any closing remarks. William J. Walljasper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -- I'd just like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. Great questions. I wish all of you and your families a great holiday season. Thanks. Duration: 59 minutes William J.

    Casey's General Stores (CASY) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript -- The Motley Fool

  "
"Matthew Frankel, CFP",12142017,Fool,12072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wouldn't it be nice if you could invest $1,000 in a stock and watch it grow into a six-figure sum -- or even more -- over the years? Several stocks have done just that for their investors. Here are three good examples. Company Recent Stock Price $1,000 Invested in IPO (Approximate) Welltower (NYSE:WELL) $66.29 $909,950 Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) $294,146 $23,767,800 Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) $1,157.55 $588,990 Data source: TD Ameritrade and author's own calculations. Prices as of 12/7/17. To be clear, this is just a sampling of the many stocks in the market that turned a small amount of early investors' money into a six-figure sum (or more). I chose these because they are three very different companies that took investors on three very different paths to wealth. Here's a little bit about each one and where they could be heading in the future. Image source: Getty Images. In a nutshell, Welltower invests in healthcare properties and has shifted its focus primarily to senior housing facilities over the past several years to capitalize on demographic trends and the current industry environment. Specifically, most of Welltower's properties now derive their income from private-pay revenue sources, which are generally more stable than those reliant on government reimbursements and are operated as partnerships with some of the best senior housing operators in the business. Furthermore, the U.S. population is aging rapidly, which should create a steady rise in senior housing demand. In fact, the 85-and-older age group -- senior housing's primary demographic -- is expected to roughly double in size over the next 20 years. Since its IPO in the early 1970s, Welltower has generated 15.6% average annualized total returns for its investors -- a remarkable level of performance to sustain for nearly five decades. Assuming reinvestment of dividends, a $1,000 investment in Welltower's IPO would be worth more than $900,000 today. To be fair, when Warren Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway in 1964, the company didn't bear any resemblance to its current state. Instead of a collection of subsidiary businesses and a massive portfolio of stocks, Berkshire Hathaway was a struggling textile company. Today, Berkshire has more than 60 subsidiaries and a portfolio of stocks valued at $189 billion as of this writing. Among Berkshire's wholly owned subsidiaries are companies such as GEICO, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom, and The Pampered Chef, just to name a few, and the stock portfolio includes large positions in companies like Apple, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Coca-Cola. An investment in Amazon.com's IPO would have produced the lowest overall return of the three, but it would have also done so in a much shorter period of time. Since going public just over 20 years ago, Amazon stock is up 59,000% (split-adjusted). Over the past two decades, Amazon has transformed itself from a simple online bookstore into an e-commerce powerhouse. And the company isn't done growing yet. Its recent acquisition of Whole Foods and its exploration of entering the pharmaceutical industry show that the company has no intentions of reaching ""maturity"" anytime soon. To be fair, many tech companies went public around the same time, and Amazon is certainly the exception, not the rule. However, those with the foresight (or luck) to have chosen Amazon as their dot-com investment would be sitting on about $589,000 for every $1,000 they invested. A similar argument could be made for Amazon, although it's certainly possible that the company could grow to several times its current size and produce strong returns for investors. Welltower, on the other hand, is a different story. Assuming a 5% annualized dividend rate, it's not outside the realm of possibilities for Welltower's stock price to grow at a 10% clip going forward. Sure, this would be a better-than-average performance as far as stocks go, but it isn't entirely impossible. ","
      
    3 Stocks That Turned $1,000 Into $500,000 or More -- The Motley Fool

  "
"Brian Stoffel, Jason Hall, and John Bromels",12142017,Fool,12072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. While the dramatic advance of bitcoin over the past year has gotten all of the attention lately, we can't ignore stocks, which have been on a remarkable run. The nine-year bull market on the Nasdaq has returned 440% for investors, and 27% this year alone. That might make you feel like you've missed the boat on growth stocks, but three of our Motley Fool investors don't think that's necessarily the case. They've identified three top growth stocks for you to consider buying this December. Read on to learn why Axon Enterprises (NASDAQ:AAXN), Apache (NYSE:APA), and BofI Holding (NYSE:AX) are all top picks for this month. Image source: Getty Images. Brian Stoffel (Axon Enterprises): You're probably more aware of Axon Enterprises under its previous name, TASER International. The decision to use a new moniker wasn't because the company's stun guns were falling out of favor -- rather, it was to highlight its pursuit of an even more lucrative opportunity: body cameras and video storage on Evidence.com. In order to invest in Axon, it's important to understand its three moving parts: Let's tackle the first. If Axon can get police departments to use Evidence.com, the switching costs will become very high. The price of migrating all that data, the headaches of retraining employees, and the danger of losing potentially life-altering footage, are all onerous. The goal, then, is getting departments to sign on, and Axon decided, in April, to give away the cameras and a one-year subscription to Evidence.com for free to any law-enforcement officer who requested it. The move obviously has the short-term consequence of limiting profitability and eating up cash. That's why the weapons segment is so important. Last quarter, sales jumped 12% as the company pivoted to five-year service agreements. Currently, Axon has $94 million in cash and investments on hand. As long as Axon can turn the corner and start earning outsized subscription revenue from its weapons giveaway before running into a cash crunch, this growth stock could be a huge winner for investors. John Bromels (Apache Corporation) Oil and gas industry stocks have been rough investments ever since energy prices slumped in 2014. One stock that's been beaten up by Mr. Market is Apache Corporation, with shares currently trading in the low $40s. I think the stock is undervalued for several reasons, but there are even more reasons to buy Apache this December, in anticipation of growth. Apache has made several savvy moves in 2017, including selling off its underperforming Canadian assets and investing heavily in its monster Alpine High play in West Texas, which should lead to major production growth. But the stock is currently trading below its year-ago level, which means that the market isn't giving the company credit for these moves. For the past few years, Apache's share price has moved in tandem with the price of West Texas Intermediate crude. (Note, in the chart below, the left-hand price column shows Apache's share price, while the right-hand column shows the WTI spot price.) APA data by YCharts. As you can see, something changed in the middle of 2017. WTI Crude prices have jumped, while Apache's share price has continued to languish. That presents an opportunity to pick up Apache shares on the cheap before the market catches on, and it's a great choice for your portfolio this December. Jason Hall (BofI Holding): So far this year, many of America's biggest bank stocks have seen double-digit gains, while one of the fastest-growing banks out there has seen its stock price fall almost 6%: BOFI data by YCharts. Even beleaguered Wells Fargo, which has struggled with falling profits following its ""fake accounts"" scandal, has seen its stock price climb almost 7%, while BofI's stock price has sputtered, even after banking quarter after quarter after quarter of industry-beating earnings, loan portfolios, and deposit growth. So what gives? In short, it continues to be the shorts. At latest count, more than one-third of BofI's shares were held short after a multi-year attack on the bank including accusations of illegal activity, risky banking practices, and a litany of other allegations that have largely been disproven. But at the same time, there remains some risk: The company is dealing with a lawsuit filed by a former employee (though it should be noted he was not given whistleblower status) and a second lawsuit filed by a small pension fund. I think the risk of damages from either lawsuit is factored in the stock price. Trading at less than two times book value and 12.6 times earnings, BofI is incredibly cheap, considering its track record and future prospects for earnings growth. Despite the risks of such a heavily shorted stock, BofI is reasonably safe, incredibly cheap, and has wonderful prospects for many years of growth to come. ","
      
    3 Top Growth Stocks to Buy in December -- The Motley Fool

  "
Rick Munarriz,12142017,Fool,12072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. One of this year's biggest winners is Square (NYSE:SQ). The transactions field leveler has nearly tripled in 2017, up 181% through Monday's close. Despite its spectacular run this year, Square stock has actually retreated by 23% since hitting all-time highs late last month. Square's big run in 2017 means that it won't take anyone by surprise in 2018, and it would be a surprise if returns cool off in the year ahead. Cowen analyst George Mihalos initiated coverage of Square on Monday with a neutral rating and a $36 price target, arguing that the shares are fairly valued at this point. This doesn't mean that the party's over. In fact, this could just be the start of something even bigger. Image source: Square. The catalyst for Square's push to new highs last month was the move to allow some users of the Square Cash app to buy and sell bitcoins. With more cryptocurrency marketplaces sprouting and now even a futures market available, it's easy to see why that sizzle has gone, but let's not dismiss everything that Square has accomplished this year. Revenue growth has decelerated every year since 2013, but things are starting to stabilize. Square boosted its full-year adjusted revenue guidance last month from between $925 million and $935 million to between $963 million and $966 million, growth of 40.3% at the midpoint. Analysts are targeting an increase of 32% in 2018. Square hasn't necessarily been an earnings-driven story in the past, but that's starting to change at this phase of its life cycle. Square has beaten Wall Street's profit targets by at least 40% in each of the past four quarters. It also boosted its adjusted earnings guidance last time out. Square now sees a profit per share of $0.24 to $0.25 for all of 2017, and analysts see an 84% surge in the year ahead. Square is starting to put it all together on the bottom line, and even Timothy Willi at Wells Fargo -- who initiated coverage of the stock with a neutral rating last month -- sees compounded earnings growth of 50% through 2020. Lukewarm and even bearish analyst calls have come with an alarming frequency in recent weeks, and the lack of optimism centers largely on valuation concerns and last month's bitcoin-fueled rally. The stock has outpaced its fundamentals in 2017, but one can argue that it was the other way around in 2016, with only modest stock gains despite headier adjusted revenue growth of 52%. Square did kiss the baron of baristas goodbye in 2016, but it was more of a profit-slurping albatross than a platform validator at that point. Square is looking good heading into 2018. It remains the mobile point-of-sale platform of choice for many small- and mid-size merchants. Competitors big and small will be gunning for Square, but it's hard to argue with the growing gross payment volume that it's processing with every passing quarter. Square went public at $9 in late 2015, and it has now moved higher in each of its first three years on the market. The stock isn't going to nearly triple again in 2018, but momentum and improving fundamentals should help stretch its winning streak to four years of gains. ","
      
    Will 2018 Be Square, Inc.'s Best Year Yet? -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP, Sean O'Reilly, and Reuben Gregg Brewer",12142017,Fool,12072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. To be a successful growth stock investor, it's important to look beyond the trendiest growth stocks that are constantly in the headlines. With that in mind, here's why our investors believe BofI Holding (NYSE:AX), iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT), and A.O. Smith (NYSE:AOS) are three under-the-radar growth stocks that all long-term investors should take a closer look at. Matt Frankel (BofI Holding): In many ways, BofI Holding operates like a traditional savings and loan. The bulk of the company's business involves taking in deposits in the form of checking accounts, savings accounts, and CDs, and lending out money to qualified customers. However, there's one big difference between BofI and most other banks -- the bank has no physical branches whatsoever. Image source: Getty Images. This gives it a major cost advantage over its peers and allows BofI to run one of the most efficient banking operations in the business. BofI consistently earns fantastic returns on equity and assets and runs at an unheard-of efficiency ratio. Over the past five years, BofI, which stands for ""Bank of Internet,"" has grown tremendously. Assets, net interest income, and earnings have all more than tripled. At the same time, the bank's credit quality has improved and the bank has successfully transitioned from a CD-oriented institution to a more traditional checking and savings-based model. Despite the tremendous growth, BofI could still have lots of room to grow. For one thing, with about $8.5 billion in assets, BofI is still rather small as far as banks go. For context, this is less than 0.5% of the assets of the largest U.S. banks. Plus, BofI has several untapped revenue streams it plans to capitalize on, such as auto lending and unsecured personal lending. And with a valuation on par with institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, I think it's fair to say that the market isn't pricing in the bank's vast growth potential. Sean O'Reilly (iRobot): One of the staples of any sci-fi story is robots. And the company helping make everyday robotics a reality, and managing to put up some substantial growth numbers while it does so, is iRobot. The company is the current market leader in the emerging consumer robot industry. Its Roomba robotic vacuum is one of the most popular consumer robots on the planet. iRobot has a long history of robust growth. Its third-quarter results, released Oct. 18, were true to form. Revenue for the quarter jumped 22% year over year, not bad for a technology hardware manufacturer. The company is also global, selling its products in the U.S., Japan, and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). Demand for its products continues to grow in the U.S. and EMEA regions. On the Q3 conference call, management projected 40%-45% growth in the United States. EPS estimates for the full year were ratcheted up as well. Management initially said it expected full-year 2017 EPS to come in between $1.35 and $1.70. That has been upped to a range of $1.65-$2.00. iRobot's growth is set to continue chugging along for years to come. As its CEO noted as part of the Q3 release, robotic vacuum cleaners have penetrated less than 10% of U.S. households. The figure is far lower abroad. And that's to say nothing of its mopping and pool-cleaning robotic offerings. With a long history of growth and profitability and a long runway of growth ahead, iRobot is a must-consider growth stock. Reuben Gregg Brewer (A.O. Smith): A.O. Smith took advantage of the huge opportunity in China, getting an early start in this massive developing nation. Sales in China grew at a compound annual rate of 22% over the 10 years through 2016. And the uptrend isn't over just yet. China makes up roughly 95% of A.O. Smith's foreign business, which accounts for around 35% of total revenue. Those growth numbers may surprise you, since the company's main product is the lowly water heater. While you and I may take hot water for granted, it's far less common in emerging markets. And as the people in these countries step up the socioeconomic ladder, they're happy to spend the money needed to get this modern-world privilege into their homes. A.O. Smith is there to help satisfy their demand. But the China story is old news; the next big thing is India. The game plan is to take the lessons learned from China and apply them to the next big Asian opportunity. The company's core markets are in North America, which are mature. But I expect continued expansion in China and an acceleration in India to keep A.O. Smith on the growth path and allow it to continue raising its dividend, which has been increased for 24 years in a row at this point -- posting an annualized growth rate of 15% over the past decade. Successful investors look past the sexy headlines to find unique opportunities; A.O. Smith's boring water heaters fit that bill. ","

                                   was trading near highs of the day, up 0.7%, after a tweet from the president saying fines could be ""substantially increased."" President Trump was pushing back against a report from Reuters, citing three sources, which said that fines pursued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are being reviewed by Interim Director Mick Mulvaney. Under the CFPB's prior director, the report said Wells Fargo had agreed to pay tens of millions of dollars in fines over alleged mortgage lending abuse. ""Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating,"" the president tweeted. Have breaking news sent to your inbox. Subscribe to MarketWatch's free Bulletin emails. Sign up here.
