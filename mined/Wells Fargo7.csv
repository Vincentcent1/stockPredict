,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo’s phony account scandal has spurred a top U.S. bank regulator to count sales practices as a chief risk to the country’s banking system and to embark on a wide-sweeping review of large and mid-sized institutions. In a half-yearly report on threats to banks, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Thursday said it now counts “governance over sales practices as a key risk issue.” This is the first time the OCC has deemed sales practices a key threat, putting them on the same level as hacking, low reserves, and a gathering storm of credit risk from significant growth in loans and deteriorating lending standards. On a call with reporters, Comptroller Thomas Curry said the review continues, but declined to provide details and said he could not give a public assessment on individual banks or the sector as a whole. The office is currently looking at how the banks it has selected for review - large and midsized banks - handle their sales practices and then will expand its work in the near future based on the findings, he said. While he would not give a timeline for the review, Curry said OCC staff have an “internal goalpost.” The OCC said it expects to continue to see mergers and acquisitions among banks, which could pose risks to banks’ ability to manage information systems and platforms and controls. It said that banks should “consider the strategic implications of a lower interest rate environment for a longer time period,” “A persistent low and flat interest rate environment continues to pressure some banks and asset managers to reach for yield by extending asset duration, taking additional credit risk, and looking for new revenue channels,” it said. OCC examiners, meanwhile, have found that banks are weak in preparing for losses on loans and leases, and are not giving enough consideration to strong loan growth, concentrations of credit, increasing risk appetite and lower underwriting standards.

,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - After a late-year rally fueled by the U.S. election pushed stocks to surprising new peaks, investors are wary that the market could be primed for a spill to start 2017. The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX is set to post a roughly 10 percent price gain for 2016 and around 12 percent on a total return basis, including reinvested dividends. That tops the single-digit increase expected by market participants polled by Reuters a year ago, with more than half of the advance coming after Donald Trump's Nov. 8 presidential victory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was on pace to rise more than 13 percent for 2016, with a total return above 16 percent. From here, though, investors expect the S&P 500 to rise by mid-single-digits in 2017, according to a Reuters poll earlier this month. Reflecting the renewed bullishness for equities, U.S.-based stock funds pulled in $11.8 billion in the week ended Dec. 28, data from Lipper showed on Thursday, marking a sharp reversal from most of the year. But investors see several warning signs for 2017, including stocks at traditionally expensive valuations; investors registering particularly bullish sentiment; and the Federal Reserve primed to raise interest rates several times this year. Meanwhile, a market lifted in part by hopes for Trump’s policy agenda could be deflated should any of those hopes be dented once he begins in office. The S&P has rallied by more than 5 percent since Election Day, while the Dow has climbed by more than 8 percent. “If anything, we head into the new year with the likelihood we will probably see some near-term weakness in equities primarily because of the move we’ve seen higher,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. “You will see some winning trades being taken off the table and, in general, a reset.” January has proven to be a difficult month for equities in recent years, with the S&P 500 falling at least 3 percent in each January of 2014, 2015 and 2016. The beginning of 2016 was marked by the worst 10-day start ever for the S&P, plagued by worries about a rout in commodities, a China slowdown and a potentially over-aggressive Fed after it hiked interest rates for the first time since 2008. A year later, a test for the market could come as soon as next week. Investors may have been holding off on selling their winners until 2017 with hopes that any profits will be taxed at a lower rate under a Trump administration. “A lot of people have postponed selling gains this year, expecting that they are going to have lower tax brackets next year,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “So we might see a weaker open to the year as investors take some of those gains that they have waited to do.” Trump takes office on Jan. 20, so investors will begin to assess how easily the new administration will be able to fulfill its reflationary policies that were anticipated in the wake of the election and that helped drive the end-of-year rally. “There was a tinge more enthusiasm not only because Trump won, and that is perceived as less headwinds for business, but also because the Republicans were able to hold onto the Senate, which was unexpected,” said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. “But it’s not like all these deals are rubber-stamp deals. They are going to have to be refined, debated, you don’t know what the magnitude is, and they have to be implemented.” ","

,01052017,Reuters,12292016,路透纽约12月30日 - 2016年末股市在美国大选推动下意外创新高后，投资者担心2017年初市场将出现下跌。 标准普尔500指数.SPX2016年将收高约10%，包括股息再投资的整体回报约为12%。这高于2015年底路透调查中市场人士预计的个位数百分比涨幅，而且超过一半涨幅是在11月8日特朗普赢得美国大选后录得的。 道琼工业指数.DJI2016年涨幅将超过13%，整体回报超过了16%。 不过本月稍早的路透调查显示，此后投资者预计标准普尔500指数2017年涨幅约在5%左右。 路透旗下基金分析公司理柏(Lipper)周四公布的数据显示，美国股票型基金在12月28日止当周流入118亿美元，而2016年大部分时间股市都缺乏这种热情。 但投资者认为2017年浮现几个警讯，包括股票估值位于传统上高昂的水准，投资者人气格外偏多，以及美联储今年可能数度升息。 在此同时，外界对特朗普政策议题的期待，为推升市场的部份原因；一旦特朗普就任，市场对他的期待若是落空，行情可能就会回落。标普指数自美国大选结果出炉以来涨逾5%，道琼指数则攀升逾8%。 “时序迈入新的一年，股票短期可能有些疲弱，主因股市此前已然上涨，”Global Markets Advisory集团资深市场策略师PeterKenny指出。 **考量减税因素** 近年来，1月份对股市而言都不太好过，标普500指数在2014年、2015年及2016年这三年的1月份跌幅至少都在3%以上。2016年伊始，标普指数经历有史以来最糟的10天，因市场担忧商品价格遭打压、中国经济放缓，以及美联储继2008年首度升息后可能过度积极加息。 现在又到了年初，市场最早可能下一周就会迎来大考。在2017年来临之前，投资者可能一直没有抛出手头的获利股，他们期待特朗普政府上台后能降低相关税负。 “2016年很多人没有逢高抛售，期待2017年能享受更低的税率，”Kingsview Asset Management的投资组合经理Paul Nolte称，“所以我们可能会看到新年开局股市偏弱，因为早有打算的投资者会锁定部分获利。” 特朗普1月20日将走马上任，投资者会开始评估新政府如何落实通货再膨胀政策。美国大选之后，人们对这些政策的憧憬在一定程度上推动了2016年末的股市反弹。 Wells Fargo Investment Institute的资深全球股票策略师Scott Wren称，“市场有些偏乐观的意味，这不仅仅是因为特朗普当选以及外界认为特朗普当选会对商业有利，而且还因为共和党能够紧紧控制参议院，这是始料未及的。” “但并不是所有的这些政策像盖个章一般轻易，这些政府必须要修改、讨论，你也不知道力度会有多大，此外政策还得落实。”(完) ,"

James Garrett Baldwin,01052017,Investopedia,12292016,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Shares of Intel Corp. (INTC) gained 0.91 percent Jan. 3, after the stock was named the top pick for 2017 by Wells Fargo (WFC) analyst David Wong. In a statement, Wong reiterated an Outperform rating on the stock and set a price target of $50.00 per share. That figure represents potential upside of 36.6 percent from Tuesday’s closing price of $36.60. According to TipRanks.com, Wong is a five-star analyst with a success rate of 73.2 percent and an average return of 23.2 percent. Wong bolstered the price target due to increased optimism in several key growth areas, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence and data center services. The analyst expects that the company’s restructuring efforts launched in 2016 will also provide a boost to its revenue. (See also: Intel Gears Up for Its Third Wave of Layoffs.) The company has rebounded despite concerns about stagnating demand in the PC desktop market. (See also: Intel Poised for Major Breakout.) Shares of Intel Corp. finished 2016 up 5.37 percent. That performance lagged the S&P 500’s return of 9.54 percent over the year. According to TipRanks.com, Intel stock is rated a consensus Moderate Buy. Among the 27 analysts, 17 rate the stock a Buy, while eight analysts rate it a Hold. The consensus price target is $39.82 per share, a figure that represents 8.79 percent upside from the stock’s closing price on Tuesday. Despite the optimism on Wall Street, Intel does have one major problem to address in the months ahead. In December, Northland Capital Markets issued a report to clients suggesting that Apple Inc. (AAPL) could drop Intel’s chips in its iPhone device and stick with one supplier, Qualcomm (QCOM). “There have been several reports over the past month that have compared the speeds associated with both the Intel and Qualcomm modems in their respective iPhone models, with INTC coming up short,” wrote Northland analyst Tom Sepenzis. “While Apple will certainly keep a second source if possible, it isn’t going to do so for too long if it has to handicap half of its devices. This should give Qualcomm a path towards recapturing all of Apple over the next two years if Intel doesn’t find an answer.” (See also: Report: Apple May Drop Intel Chips.)

Elizabeth Gurdus,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"President-elect Donald Trump will have to start developing his policies once he steps into office to keep the markets rallying at postelection levels, Wells Fargo's chief economist, John Silvia, told CNBC on Friday. ""Since the election, I think Trump has had his first date with the American public and the markets. Now the first date's over, everybody's happy. Now we're on to the second date,"" Silvia told ""Squawk on the Street."" ""And the second date really starts to tell what [you can] actually produce in terms of tax cuts and infrastructure spending,"" he said. Silvia said some of the biggest hindrances that may arise include a strong dollar, which could hurt U.S. exporters and impact the trade deficit, which some on Trump's team have vowed to reduce. That could put a drag on economic growth despite good consumer and business sentiment, he said. Populism could also tarnish some of the benefits on the corporate side, Silvia said. ""Mergers and acquisitions, infrastructure spending, tax cuts, they're all going to face this populist framework for making a limit, perhaps, on how extensive[ly] any of these changes"" can be implemented, the economist said. Appearing in the same interview, JPMorgan strategist Samantha Azzarello said the year-end rally is effectively giving Trump the benefit of the doubt as investors look ahead to the new year, despite the potential risks. ""I think the market's pricing in the best-case scenario with respect to a Trump presidency. And geopolitical risk is back on the table, we know this, and I think the market has great expectations for 2017 and I'm not sure if they're going to come through,"" she said. Azzarello said if investors are banking on the United States remaining strong as Trump steps into office and possibly seeing inflation, they would be well-served to go after sectors and areas in the market that have done well over the course of the postelection rally. ""I think you have to come back to the fact that the U.S. expansion is going to continue, and if you think it's going to continue, you have a bias to cyclicals over defensives. We have a bias to equity over fixed income, if we are in this reflation scenario,"" the strategist said. ""I would just add that the Trump trade is really just a hyperactive, accelerated version of the reflation trade ... we're just getting the extra boost"" from prospects for business deregulation, Azzarello said. New investment strategies for 2017 could also include adding international exposure, she said. ""We actually have a bias to emerging markets,"" Azzarello said. ""We think they're coming out of the bottom of their recessions and their earnings are starting to recover. Now, there's headwinds, obviously, from the dollar and if the Fed starts to move quicker, but the domestic story in EM is really there.""

Patti Domm,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"This is the year inflation worries could begin to simmer for the first time in ages. After years of worrying about deflation, the stock market could catch a whiff of inflation later in the year. In its 2017 outlook, Charles Schwab pulled inflation to its ""front burner"" list of concerns for stocks and pushed deflation to its ""back burner."" Others feel the same. ""In the second half of the year, we think there's going to be some headwinds in the market with people worrying about wage inflation in 2018, and the Fed being behind the curve. It's not necessarily that they're going to be realities, but I think at the end of the year, people are going to be worried about inflationary pressures, largely coming from wages,"" said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Steven Wieting, global chief strategist at Citi Private Bank, expects President-elect Donald Trump's plans for fiscal stimulus and tax cuts to boost GDP by more than a full percent this year. But those programs should also bring some inflation. ""While they may succeed in postponing the timing of the next cyclical downturn in the U.S. and world economy, this could come at a cost of a more severe downturn later on. One major risk of fiscal stimulus so late into an economic cycle is inflation,"" Wieting wrote in his 2017 outlook. Just like anything, too much inflation would not be good. But the lack of it has been a concern, and after years of little price traction, strategists see it picking up to a still comfortable pace. ""I don't think inflation is going to be a crushing inflation,"" said Wieting in an interview. ""But consumers in the United States don't get wage adjustments for inflation."" Service sector prices could be the biggest driver of inflation because that is the most labor intensive part of the economy, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. ""I think we could see headline inflation by the end of this year running the high 2s and the core could be well over 2 percent as well,"" said Stanley. He expects wage growth of about 3 percent by the end of next year. ""If the Trump administration is able to successfully shepherd through a lot of things they are advocating that would be positive for growth. You could see a boost to growth without it being terribly inflationary ... I'm more hawkish on inflation than most. It's not because of the fiscal side, it's because I think the Fed has already fallen behind the curve,"" Stanley said. That inflation target is even before considering potential effects from the still-unknown variables likely to be generated by Trump's planned trade policies. Wieting does not expect to see protectionist moves from the Trump administration but he said trade is the biggest risk to his forecast. He and others expect the Fed to raise interest rates faster if inflation moves up too quickly. For now, it is still sluggish — under the 2 percent targeted by the U.S. central bank, for a fifth year now. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditure price index, showed core inflation at just 1.6 percent in November. Less than half of Fed officials expect inflation to reach 1.9 to 2 percent this year, and the rest have a lower forecast. But many economists have been forecasting that inflation could finally break above the Fed's 2 percent target in 2017. Jefferies economists say inflation is accelerating primarily because commodities prices are again rising and commodities-based goods prices are going higher. They expect consumer price index inflation to surpass the central bank's 2 percent target in the first quarter and approach 3 percent by the end of the year. They see PCE at about 2.5 percent at year-end. Schwab strategists said the return of inflation could help to lift sales for global companies and boost business confidence and spending. A rising dollar could keep inflation in check, they said, and as long as it does not rise too much, stock valuations seem reasonable. They expect the Fed to raise rates twice this year as inflation picks up. Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, actually included in his inflation forecast what many economists have left as unknowns — the potential impact of tariffs on inflation. So far, it's unclear what Trump will do about taxing goods at the border, but the president-elect has said companies that go overseas to manufacture should pay an expensive tax on goods shipped back into the U.S. On Thursday, Toyota was the latest company to be warned by Trump on Twitter to build cars in the U.S., not Mexico or pay a huge tax. ""In our outlook for this year, we did assume that the Trump administration applies tariffs to both Mexico and China.Some of our improvement in inflation, firming in inflation in our forecast for 2017 is a result of imposition of trade restricting policies. Even aside from that, there's good reason to expect inflation would continue to firm. It would come from different sources,"" said Gapen. He said he expects inflation this year to come domestically from increases in wages, services sector prices and higher shelter costs. Congress has also separately suggested a border tax, which would act similar to a valued-added tax. The tax could be 15 to 20 percent depending on what level the corporate tax rate is cut to, from its current 35 percent. The border-adjusted tax would tax all incoming goods and services, but not exports out of the U.S. It's unclear what will happen with the proposal, but congressional leaders have said it's an important part of the corporate tax overhaul. Gapen estimates 2.4 percent for core PCE inflation by the fourth quarter of the year, and 2.3 percent on headline. Of that, 0.2 percent is due to his estimates of a 7 percent tariff on Mexican goods and a 15 percent tariff on Chinese imports. But if there is a border tax, he said the inflation hit could be much greater and difficult to forecast. Gapen said the inflationary impact of the increase in oil prices should be greatest in the first quarter since crude bottomed last February. Proponents of the border tax expect a rising dollar to offset the impact of higher costs of goods to consumers. But critics are doubtful the dollar would rise enough to offset it. In the minutes of its last meeting released Wednesday, the Fed noted that it expects fiscal stimulus but the impact on the economy is unclear. However, many central bank officials said there could be an upside risk to their forecasts. But they also noted it could potentially be inflationary or cause the dollar to rise. ",2017 is the year inflation makes a comeback—and Donald Trump could play a role
Turney Duff,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"At the opening bell of 2016, the markets looked like an overmatched boxer entering the ring. Taking crushing blows to the head on the first day of trading, stocks got pummeled, creating a nosebleed for the first month. In June, Britain shocked the world with its vote to leave the EU — creating global losses of about $2 trillion in one day. But the markets started punching back. In a year dominated by political headlines, it was also filled with highlights, lowlights and surprises like the Pokemon Go phenomenon, the delightful end to the Chicago Cubs World Series curse, a widespread Zika virus debate and the continued cyber security threats with a billion Yahoo accounts being hacked. It was a decent year for M&A activity. The Bayer and Monsanto deal for $66 billion created a combined company that controls one-fourth of the global supply of seeds and pesticides. And the biggest deal of the year, which received negative commentary from every political candidate, was the AT&T and Time Warner deal, worth $85.4 billion. And no year is complete with a major scandal. Wells Fargo took the spotlight in September, with a scandal that resulted in CEO John Stumpf stepping down. The firm was accused of opening as many as 1.5 million deposit accounts and 565,000 credit cards without customer's permission in order to meet sales goals. The Federal Reserve and President-elect Donald Trump exchanged a few punches … then the Fed did what everyone expected and raised rates in December amid a firming labor market and slowly rising inflation. It's your move Donald… And oil was taken out of intensive care unit and is now considered stable. And as the year went on the markets started to resemble a heavyweight champion defending its title. Stocks hit record highs in August and then again in December, with the Dow flirting with 20,000 like a Kardashian at a New Year's Eve party. But before we embark on 2017, all the hopes, dreams and greed it may bring, let's hand out the best, worst and ""I can't even"" awards for 2016. Leaving a dinner party early is typically considered poor form — some might actually call it rude. But Carl Icahn was like the honey badger when he excused himself from Trump's victory party to go home and drop a cool billion buying up equities. While the rest of the market was freaking out about a possible Trump win, Icahn was making money. (And we all know how that ended, with the Dow up about 10 percent since Election Day.) But wait, there's more: Icahn said he actually would've dropped MORE money if he could've. ""I thought it was absurd that the market, the S&P was down 100 points on Trump getting elected. I tried to put a lot more to work, but I couldn't,"" he said. A billion dollar buy will not only win you this award, but perhaps, inspire Jay-Z to write a new anthem. Oh, Twitter had so much promise to battle Facebook for social media world domination when it first came out. Then, they seemed to take a Rip Van Winkle-sized nap while other social media blew past them. Just this week — THIS WEEK! — CEO Jack Dorsey said he's been ""thinking a lot about"" an edit button for tweets. If this were a relationship and your boyfriend said he was ""thinking a lot about"" marrying you but not actually doing it, you know what I'd say? Ditch him! You know what? We're changing this award to the I-CAN'T-EVEN AWARD because seriously, Jack. I CAN'T EVEN. Trump may be on Twitter and your parents are on Facebook but the kids? Ask any 13-year-old – they're on Snapchat. Last month, the company filed paperwork for an IPO estimated as much as $25 billion. It's generating headlines like ""Is Snapchat the next Apple?"" and ""Snapchat IPO could take money away from Facebook."" And, unlike some OTHER social media we know, they're not resting on their laurels – they're branching out into actual products. I've gotta admit, those Snapchat specs are kinda cool. (Do the kids say cool anymore?!) Theranos, founded by 19-year-old Stanford dropout Elizabeth Holmes, boasted it was a ""revolutionary blood-testing start-up,"" which claimed it could run all kinds of lab tests on just a few drops of blood taken from the tip of the finger with a quick pinprick – not the prolonged, sometimes nauseating draw of blood from the arm via a needle. The company's valuation soared into the billions, and so did Elizabeth Holmes' net worth. Then came a whistleblower, who raised concerns that Theranos was doctoring researching, and a growing number of lawsuits from patients who claimed they'd had heart attacks and other health problems after faulty results from the Theranos blood test. The house of cards came crashing down, along with the company's valuation – and Holmes' net worth. The company is laying off much of its staff and Holmes is banned from owning a lab for two years. Just when you thought you were having the worst year ever, news broke that hedge-fund billionaire Bill Ackman, whose firm Pershing Square was already losing a lot of money this year, was ending 2016 with a 9-figure divorce. Lawyers for both Ackman and his wife, Karen Ann Herskovitz, have reached a quick settlement. There are a few details that need to be worked out like how to split the $90 million penthouse, bought for fun, at the new One57, which Ackman has described as ""the Mona Lisa of apartments,"" or the $35 million apartment at the Beresford off Central Park. They also have a waterfront estate in Bridgehampton bought in 2011 for $22 million and the $23.5 million mansion nearby. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries showed the world that the most dysfunctional family can still actually get into a room and make a decision. (Enforcing it? Eh not so much, but let's stick to the positives.) After decades of infighting, the cartel, which accounts for a third of global oil supply, agreed to cut output. If he handles the economy anything like he handles babies, we are totally screwed. The relationship between the stars of Sesame Street has always been a mystery. Why do they bicker so much? Why do they like each other? They've shown us that even though two people have totally different characteristics, they can still be good friends. And if that doesn't describe Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, I don't know what does! Putin has called Trump ""brilliant"" and praised his personality while Trump has express admiration for Putin in the past for his ""very strong control"" over Russia. Trump tweet Who doesn't like a good magic trick? Well, except when it comes to making your money disappear. On March 21, Valeant announced it had discovered accounting irregularities, blaming the mistake on lack of corporate oversight. I think we can all agree that using the word ""mistake"" is very generous for a company warning it might potentially default on its $30 billion debt obligations. I hate it when that happens. Share prices of VRX have fallen — oh, just a tad — from its mid-2015 high of $335 down to $14. Dude, if that's the benchmark for ""mistake,"" then I haven't made nearly as many of them as I'd thought! How they missed this terrifying flaw in QA, I'll never know. But somehow, Samsung released a phone that had the potential to overheat and spontaneously burst into flames. The risk was so great, the phone was banned on planes and Samsung ultimately had to recall millions of the phones and issue replacements. After some of THOSE phones caught fire, Samsung had to do a complete recall and permanently cease production of the phone. Oh, and just to lock in the title of company having the worst year ever, Samsung had to recall some of its washing machines as well after several of them spontaneously exploded, causing injuries such as a broken jaw and injured shoulder. Wow. Can you hear me now? For the first time in 19 years the Supreme Court weighed in on Wall Street insider trading laws. And in an 8-0 ruling, the court sided with Attorney General Preet Bharara that, in certain circumstances,  traders and investors can be indicted, tried and convicted of insider trading even if prosecutors can't prove the person providing the tip received ""a personal benefit"" in exchange for the information. It used to be called the ""Most Hated Man in America"" award but Martin Shkreli (the drug-company CEO who jacked up prices of life-saving drugs and then was a jerk about it) won it with such gusto last year, we decided to name the whole friggin' award after him. And — everyone act surprised — he won again this year! You, sir, are in a league of your own. Seriously. Just stop it. ","Wall Street Awards—The best, worst and 'I can't even' of 2016—commentary"
Stephanie Landsman,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"When the Nasdaq was hitting all-time records during the dot-com bubble, Ned Riley alerted investors to brace for steep declines. But now, the veteran stock market strategist says there's nothing to fear as technology stocks jump to new highs. In fact, Riley believes tech will be the big winner next year, especially as revenue picks up from the overseas markets and delivers a tremendous boost to profits. ""I look at 2017 as an exciting year,"" said Riley, who runs research firm Riley Asset Management, Thursday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""Secular growth for this sector is particularly strong for the next three to five years."" Riley points out he doesn't detect the ""irrational exuberance"" that characterized the tech bubble in 1999 and 2000. He says financial prospects for companies are clearly improving, not fading. ""Earnings are starting to turn up again. It looks like we'll have a plus year in 2017. It may not replicate the same kind of recoveries we've seen from cyclical lows. But still I think something on the order of 5 to 8 percent seems reasonable for the S&P 500,"" said Riley. The Nasdaq surpassed the 5,500 level for the first time ever on Tuesday, before losing some momentum to close at 5,487.44. But that was still a record close for the index, which is up more than 8 percent this year. ""As far as the market itself is concerned, the valuation may be on the high end, but people seem to ignore the fact that when you look at the price-earnings ratio to the inflation rate, which is running at about 2 percent, it doesn't seem that unreasonable relative to history,"" he said.

Jeff Brown,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"The Dow Jones industrial average has finally hit 20,000, and if it closes above that mark on Wednesday, it will surely be a market milestone. But if the long wait for Dow 20,000 already tired you out, don't feel bad. Dow 20,000 is not quite like running a four-minute mile or breaking the sound barrier. It's little more than an imaginary line. As a practical matter, Dow 20,001 will make investors richer than Dow 20,000, but surely won't get as much attention. Big round numbers are easier to remember and visualize than the ones marking records leading up to them, just as the 20-foot pole vault seems easier to imagine than 19 feet, 11½ inches. ""Hitting 20,000 is significant only in terms of its emotional and psychological impact on us,"" said Jeremy Torgerson, CEO of NVest Advisors in Brownsville, Texas. ""We humans love round numbers. ""Remember New Year's Day 2000, as a recent example,"" he added. ""That new year was somehow more meaningful than January 2, 2001, or January 1, 1999."" The Dow's climb up over time can't make any claim to being a natural law of market evolution. It's purely a human invention,created by The Wall Street Journal in 1896, and its makeup changes from time to time based on choices by editors at S&P Dow Jones Indices. ""The fact that people even monitor the Dow is an artifact of history,"" said Robert Johnson, president of the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. It is the only price-weighted market index, a methodology that more heavily emphasizes moves by higher priced stocks than their lower priced counterparts — without sound logic, in Johnson's opinion. ""People still refer to how many points the Dow is up or down, even though a 100-point move is roughly half a percent today and it was approximately 5 percent at the time of the 1987 crash,"" Johnson said. If the Dow were a typical average, prices of the 30 stocks would be added up and divided by 30. But instead the calculation uses a much smaller divisor — currently 0.14602128057775. The divisor has been adjusted over the decades to account for stock splits, spin-offs, mergers and stock dividends, to assure that numbers from before and after yield apples-to-apples comparisons. What really matters to investors is percentage gains, not the number of points the Dow adds over time. So going from 1,000 to 2,000 doubled investors' money, as did 5,000 to 10,000 and 10,000 to 20,000. Investors may also be interested in how the Dow behaves after passing a big milestone. Unfortunately, there's no pattern dependable enough to bet on. ""Back in 1999, we hit 10,000 and the market continued to run another 1,000 points, but in January 2000, the market went from 11,900 down to 9,600,"" recalled Michael Darvish, senior financial advisor with Regal Securities in New York. ""There is no specific pattern. ""It depends on the economic conditions,"" he added. ""We are on a Trump high right now. Last January, we had a sell-off, and I would not be surprised if we get another one this year as investors want to take some money off the table."" An investor who wanted to bet on gains in the Dow could buy the 30 stocks, buy a fund that holds large-capitalization stocks including those in the Dow or make a pure play with SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA), an exchange-traded fund that owns the 30 Dow stocks. But unless you own DIA, chances are your own results are different from the Dow's. The other big-name stock index ETF, the Standard & Poor's 500 (SPY), contains 500 stocks versus the Dow's 30, but tends to move about the same as the Dow over time, since it also is composed of large-cap issues. But if you own foreign stocks, or small-company stocks, or shares in specific sectors, the Dow 20,000 may not matter much to you. ""What matters is not where the Dow is, or how round that number is, but how one's own portfolio of investments is doing,"" said Michal Strahilevitz, behavioral economist at Duke University's Center for Advanced Hindsight. ""For the wisest of investors, that will include a diverse range of index funds and such and not just a fund that tracks the Dow."" Investors may be cheered by a milestone. ""It is significant because, from a momentum perspective, once people see Dow 20,000 then they can be convinced that Dow 25,000 is possible,"" said Ted Jenkin, CEO of Oxygen Financial in Alpharetta, Georgia. But they should not use the Dow milestone as an excuse to alter their long-term plan. ""That is the best advice for anyone, no matter what the Dow has done, is doing or will do,"" Strahilevitz said. ""Timing the market based on anything is a fool's strategy. ""It fails at least as often as it works.""

Smaller sell-offs come when investors decide to nail down profits after a big run and move to cash or some other holding. Deeper declines are often triggered by worries about corporate earnings or the health of the economy. Erik Davidson, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank, worries that the U.S. is quickly approaching another milestone that could dampen market performance: $20 trillion in government debt. He calculates that, while the Dow has produced a total return, including reinvested dividends, of 153 percent since the start of the 21st century, the debt has gone up 253 percent. ""While we will likely be seeing many Dow 20,000 hats, I sincerely doubt that we will see a single Debt $20 Trillion hat,"" Davidson said.

To figure out bank stocks, it helps to come up with ways to organize them. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. You can slice and dice bank stocks a number of different ways. In the past, I've done so based on their size, type, how much capital they have, and whether they're considered too big to fail. All of these are good ways to organize the bank industry in your head. There's another way that's also worth considering: looking at which bank stocks are on the S&P 500. S&P 500 serves as a screen of the biggest and most profitable banks in the United States. You can get a sense for this by examining the S&P 500's selection criteria. To make the list, a company must, among other things: By using the S&P 500 as a screen for bank stocks, you all but eliminate the risk of investing in a new, untried bank that has yet to prove its mettle through different stages of a credit cycle. So, which bank stocks have made the cut and are included on the world's leading large-cap index? Here are the 21 bank stocks on the S&P 500: Name Total Assets (Millions) Return on Equity (TTM)* Bank of America $2,195,314 6.37% BB&T $222,622 9.09% Bank of New York Mellon $374,114 9.40% Citigroup $1,818,117 7.02% Citizens Financial $147,015 5.00% Comerica $74,124 5.61% Capital One $345,061 8.12% Fifth Third Bancorp $143,279 12.24% Goldman Sachs $879,987 7.68% Huntington Bancshares $100,765 9.40% JPMorgan Chase $2,521,029 10.47% KeyCorp $135,805 6.97% Morgan Stanley $813,891 7.61% M&T Bank $126,841 8.71% People's United $40,692 5.76% PNC Financial $369,348 8.60% SunTrust Banks $205,091 8.32% State Street $256,140 11.33% U.S. Bancorp $454,134 14.26% Wells Fargo $1,942,124 12.78% Zions Bancorp $61,039 6.39% *TTM = trailing 12 months. Data source: Finviz.com and YCharts.com. As you can see, the bank stocks on the S&P 500 come in different shapes and sizes, though, of course, they're all big. The smallest on the list, People's United, nevertheless has a $41 billion balance sheet. You have the nation's four megabanks, all of which have close to or over $2 trillion worth of assets on their balance sheets: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). You have the stand-alone investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Although these are formally bank holding companies, getting charters during the financial crisis in order to have access to the Federal Reserve's discount window, they're focused almost exclusively on investment banking. You have the nation's two biggest custodial banks, Bank of New York Mellon (what I consider to be the most interesting bank in America), and State Street, which serve large institutional customers. You have a smattering of regional banks, including BB&T, Citizens Financial, Comerica, Fifth Third, Huntington Bancshares, KeyCorp, M&T Bank, People's United, PNC Financial, SunTrust Banks, U.S. Bancorp, and Zions. And you have Capital One, a monoline credit card company that's only recently transformed into a regional bank. Inclusion on the S&P 500 is just one of many things investors should consider when selecting a bank stock for their portfolio. After all, stocks are both added to and subtracted from the index on a regular basis. Prior to the financial crisis, Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual, National City Corp., and Merrill Lynch were all members of the widely followed index. These banks have since either gone belly-up or were acquired by other banks at discounts to their pre-crisis share prices. Moreover, even banks that have remained on the list have dealt their shareholders serious losses. Bank of America and Citigroup come immediately to mind. Bank of America's stock is still down roughly 60% since its pre-crisis high; Citigroup's shares are off 90%. But for every Bank of America and Citigroup, there's a Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, shares of which have gone on to new highs even in the wake of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. In short, while using the S&P 500 to identify good banks stocks to invest in certainly isn't a panacea, it can be used as an initial screen for beginning investors who are thinking about investing in the sector.

Warren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. Image source: The Motley Fool. The average bank stock owned by Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) trades for 2.6 times tangible book value. That's a third higher than the average blue-chip bank stock on the KBW Bank Index, which trades for 2.0 times tangible book value. One way to explain this is that Warren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has an eye for great bank stocks. He's piled Berkshire's money into the most profitable banks in the country, including Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), and M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB).

Data source: CNBC's Berkshire Hathaway's Portfolio Tracker and YCharts.com. Yet, Buffett's ability to identify great bank stocks is only part of the explanation. Indeed, after he invests in a bank, the bank itself may benefit from its association with the Oracle of Omaha. A textbook example was Wells Fargo's decision in the lead-up to the financial crisis to avoid the most toxic corners of the subprime mortgage market and, by doing so, temporarily relinquishing market share. As Wells Fargo's chairman and CEO wrote in 2008: Our company maintained its credit risk discipline reasonably well during the years of excessive risk taking in our industry. Unlike many of our competitors, we did not make option adjustable-rate mortgages.... We did not make negative-amortization ARMs. We offered in only a very few instances, below certain credit scores, stated-income mortgages and low- and no-documentation mortgages. Because of our prudent lending to customers with less than prime credit and our decision not to make negative amortization loans, we estimate we lost between two and four percent in mortgage origination market share from 2004 to 2006. That translates into losing between $60 billion and $120 billion in mortgage originations in 2006 alone. We're glad we did. It's clear now that this was the right thing to do, but investors at the time didn't have the benefit of hindsight and were therefore pushing banks to take on more risk at the worst possible time. In 2006, for example, two years before the financial crisis struck with full force, analysts and investors gave JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon an enormous amount of flak after it throttled production of derivatives tied to subprime mortgages -- the same derivatives that later drove so many of JPMorgan Chase's peers to the brink of bankruptcy. JPMorgan Chase wasn't a Berkshire holding, though Buffett has always spoken highly of Dimon and is a personal investor in the New York-based bank. It's impossible to say with complete certainty whether Buffett's stamp of approval is what allows the likes of Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, and M&T Bank to focus on maximizing long-term returns or whether Buffett just picks banks that otherwise do so. But it's certainly consistent with the fact that the bank stocks in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio tend to trade for substantial premiums to other bank stocks. ","

Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. The Conference Board earlier this week released its monthly consumer confidence index, which measures how optimistic U.S. consumers are at a specific point in time. The updated data showed that consumer confidence is at its highest level in more than a decade, which is very good news for banks. The index came in at 113.7 in December (1985=100), up from 109.4 in November. The current level, fueled by the outcome of the presidential election, marks a 13-year high. ""The post-election surge in optimism for the economy, jobs and income prospects, as well as for stock prices which reached a 13-year high, was most pronounced among older consumers,"" said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board. ""Looking ahead to 2017, consumers' continued optimism will depend on whether or not their expectations are realized."" Digging into the numbers a little more deeply, consumers' opinions improved on a number of fronts. Their outlook for the labor market improved markedly, with the proportion expecting more jobs in the months ahead increasing from 16.1% of those surveyed to 21%. And those expecting business conditions to improve over the next six months grew from 16.4% in November to 23.6% in December. The only downside was that consumers' assessment of current conditions declined slightly. Those saying business conditions are ""good"" decreased slightly from 29.7% to 29.2%, while those saying business conditions are ""bad"" increased from 15.2% to 17.3%, notes The Conference Board's press release. It probably goes without saying that higher consumer confidence is good for banks such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and thereby their stock prices. At the same time, however, the precise reasons for this may not be as clear. The first is simply that higher consumer confidence should translate into higher loan demand. It's worth keeping in mind that banks are in the business of selling money -- making loans, that is. And the more demand there is for money, the more banks can sell of it, which thereby drives their top lines. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon touched on this generally at a recent industry conference: We see a fairly healthy consumer. And so if you look at macroeconomic data, home prices, the consumer balance sheet, debt service ratios, the number of people working, wages going up, et cetera, we see that pretty healthy. We see a mirror of that inside JPMorgan. So we're reporting quarter after quarter of credit card sales, deposits, new household accounts. All those types things are doing quite well, and we expect that to continue. Related to this, and also mentioned by Dimon, when consumers feel more confident, they tend to spend more money. And because banks generate revenue from interchange fees every time a consumer uses a debit or credit card issued by that bank, higher consumer spending almost necessarily translates into higher revenue for banks. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan spoke about this at the same conference. He noted that spending on credit and debit cards was up by around 6% for the year as of November. ""It's very solid,"" Moynihan said. ""The Cyber Monday, Friday, and all of the stuff, the spending was up year over year. So consumers continue to spend money."" The same trend helps JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, which, together with Bank of America, are among the biggest card companies in the United States. Finally, a rise in consumer confidence, assuming it continues to translate into spending, should yield higher inflation. It's here where banks could really benefit, as the one thing keeping the Federal Reserve from more rapidly raising the fed funds rate, an important short-term interest rate benchmark, has been lackluster inflation. The significance of higher rates can't be overstated. If short- and long-term rates increase by 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point, JPMorgan Chase would earn $2.8 billion in added net interest revenue a year. The same figure for Bank of America is $5.3 billion. And while Wells Fargo isn't clear in its disclosures around interest rate sensitivity, it too would see a surge in its earnings. In short, assuming consumer confidence continues in the right direction, banks and their stocks could see further gains from here. ","

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",01052017,Fool,12292016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. I've written many times before about Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), and how if I could only own one stock, it would probably be the one. However, Berkshire has soared 22% in 2016, and thus, is naturally less attractive than it was at this time last year. With that in mind, let's take a look at Berkshire as compared to another stock I have my eye on right now, General Electric (NYSE:GE). Which stock could lead your portfolio down the right path? Image source: Getty Images. Aside from having Warren Buffett, the greatest long-term investor of all time, at the helm, there are plenty of good reasons to like Berkshire over the long run, no matter who is at the CEO's desk. The main reason I've said that if I could only own one stock, it would be Berkshire, is that it is a diversified collection of investments all by itself. In addition to its core business of insurance, which is made up of companies such as GEICO, General Re, and National Indemnity Company, Berkshire has dozens of other subsidiaries, many of which are household names. Just to name a few, Berkshire Hathaway owns: In addition to the collection of businesses and stock investments, another reason to love Berkshire is its flexible, solid balance sheet, which currently has about $85 billion in cash, just waiting to be put to work on more attractive investments as opportunities arise. Finally, Berkshire Hathaway should be a big beneficiary of the Donald Trump presidency, as Trump's anti-regulation platform and potential to create a rising-rate environment should help several of Berkshire's businesses and investments -- particularly the insurance subsidiaries and the big bank holdings in the stock portfolio. From a valuation standpoint, I mentioned how Berkshire's share price has risen by nearly 22% in 2016. However, the stock is still cheaply valued, in a historical context. As of this writing, Berkshire trades for just under 1.5 times its book value. This is well over the threshold of 1.2 times book value Buffett likes to see in order to implement share buybacks, but it is still quite low in a historical context. In fact, before the financial crisis, it wasn't uncommon for Berkshire's price-to-book-value ratio to exceed 1.7. BRK.B data by YCharts. General Electric has been a beneficiary of the post-election ""Trump rally"" like most of the market, but unlike Berkshire, GE hasn't had a great 2016. In fact, the stock gained just over 1% for the year. Not only does GE pay a handsome 3% dividend and trade for a reasonable 19 times forward earnings (Berkshire's forward P/E is 20.4), but I think it has the potential to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Trump's presidency -- even more so than Berkshire. Specifically, President-elect Trump's plan to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure over the next decade could greatly benefit many of GE's businesses. Just to name a few examples, GE makes energy grid systems; water treatment systems; power-generation equipment such as gas, steam, and wind turbines; and locomotives -- all of which could see demand rise dramatically over the next few years. Many of these product divisions could be greatly helped by Trump's pro-energy agenda as well. Another potential boost for GE shareholders could come in the form of Trump's proposed repatriation tax holiday. General Electric has more than $100 billion in cash stashed overseas, and Trump has proposed to allow companies to repatriate foreign profits at a one-time discounted tax rate of 10%. This alone could save GE tens of billions of dollars. It's tough to say. On one hand, Berkshire Hathaway is one of my largest stock holdings, and one that I'll probably continue to add to as time goes on. Furthermore, if we had done this comparison before the election, it would have been no contest. However, I think the Trump presidency could be a huge positive catalyst for General Electric if Trump follows through with his promises. So, while I still think Berkshire is one of the best long-term stocks you can buy, and is almost an all-in-one investment portfolio by itself, things just got a lot more interesting for General Electric investors, and I may consider adding it to my portfolio in the new year.

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), the conglomerate led by billionaire Warren Buffett, has done quite well in 2016 -- up about 26% with just over a week to go in the year. Much of the company's gain has taken place in the last six weeks or so, and since Buffett was an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter, the reason is somewhat ironic: the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president. Image source: Disney/ABC via Flickr. There are a few reasons Berkshire Hathaway stock has risen by 16% since the election. For starters, Trump's pro-growth policies could be great news for many of Berkshire's subsidiary businesses. Manufacturers like Precision Castparts could see a rise in orders, railroads like BNSF could have more goods to transport, and consumer-goods companies like Fruit of the Loom could benefit from more disposable income in consumers' pockets. BRK.B data by YCharts. However, Berkshire's insurance subsidiaries could turn out to be big winners under a Trump presidency, for multiple reasons. First, Trump's anti-regulation platform could save money on compliance expenses and make it generally easier for insurers like GEICO and the rest of Berkshire's insurance companies to do business. In addition, consider the general business model of insurers. Insurance companies don't necessarily try to profit from collecting premiums. Instead, the goal is to invest the premium income collected and generate income until it's paid out for claims. Trump's policies could cause interest rates to rise significantly in the coming years, meaning that Berkshire could earn billions more on its reserves. As of the third quarter, the company has about $85 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet, so this could translate to a serious boost. Finally, don't forget about Berkshire's stock portfolio, a lot of which is invested in the financial industry -- by far, the best-performing sector since the election. Like insurance companies, banks stand to benefit from lower regulation and higher interest rates, and Berkshire has huge investments in Wells Fargo, American Express, and Bank of America, as well as significant investments in several other companies in that sector. This is the billion-dollar question for Berkshire Hathaway and its investors. While I'm not predicting the direction of the overall stock market, I do think banks and insurance companies will have more room to run if Trump rolls back regulations on their industries, invests in infrastructure, and slashes taxes. The same logic can be applied to the rest of Berkshire's financial stocks as well as its insurance subsidiaries. If Trump follows through on his promises, Berkshire's rally could be just getting started. As an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter, Warren Buffett is strongly in favor of higher taxes on the rich, among other left-leaning policies. However, from a purely business standpoint, it doesn't get much better for Berkshire's subsidiaries and stock investments than Donald Trump's pro-growth, anti-regulation platform. Whether Trump actually follows through with his plans, and whether they work, remains to be seen, but for now, it's fair to say that Berkshire Hathaway and its investors were big winners in 2016 as a result of the election.

With President-elect Trump set to take office in a few short weeks and the Federal Reserve expected to introduce multiple rate hikes that should strengthen the greenback against many foreign currencies, this year promises to be a particularly interesting -- and perhaps challenging -- one from an investing standpoint. Keeping this theme of a rapidly evolving marketplace firmly in mind, our contributors think that AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), Winnebago Industries (NYSE:WGO), BOFI Holdings (NYSE:AX), Sunoco Logistics Partners (NYSE:SXL), and Sherwin-Williams Co. (NYSE:SHW) could all turn out to be top stocks in 2017. Read on to find out why. Image Source: Getty Images. George Budwell (AbbVie): Despite its top-selling anti-inflammatory drug Humira going off patent in the U.S. last month, AbbVie's shares still managed to end the year on a high note, rallying by 8.7% for the full year. That's an encouraging sign that the market may indeed be willing to look past both the uncertainty over AbbVie's ability to defend Humira's market share for the foreseeable future, and management's rather liberal use of debt-financing to broaden the drugmaker's product portfolio and clinical pipeline over the past year. Why is the market warming up to AbbVie right now? The reasons are twofold. First off, AbbVie has continued to earn its stripes as a dividend aristocrat by raising its payout like clockwork, resulting in a top flight yield of 4% at current levels. Secondly, this drugmaker has never failed to deliver industry-leading levels of top line growth since becoming an independent entity in 2013. This year, for example, AbbVie's top line is forecast to grow by nearly 10%, thanks in part to new product launches and label expansions for key growth drivers like the blood cancer drug Imbruvica. In all, AbbVie appears primed to continue its upward trend this month, and should turn in another strong year in 2017. Steve Symington (PayPal Holdings): Shares of PayPal jumped more than 10% the day after its latest quarterly report in late October, and with good reason. Quarterly revenue climbed 21% year over year on a constant-currency basis to $2.67 billion -- slightly better than Wall Street had hoped -- driven by a 25% increase in total payment volume and 24% growth in total transactions processed. PayPal also increased its active customer accounts 11% to 192 million, while payments per active account jumped 13%. On the bottom line, PayPal grew adjusted net income 13%, to $425 million, while adjusted net income per share grew 14% to $0.35, or roughly in line with expectations. But most encouraging was the fact Paypal also told investors it expects adjusted operating margin to be stable or higher over the next three years. This helps to allay fears that its recently expanded partnerships with both MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) -- which will both yield financial volume incentives for the company and significantly expand its point-of-sale presence to millions of contactless-enabled merchant locations around the world -- might negatively affect its margin profile past the short term. So with PayPal stock having all but given up its post-earnings pop, I think this is a great opportunity for long-term investors to consider opening or adding to a position this January. Dan Caplinger (Winnebago Industries): Most investors wouldn't think of the market for recreational vehicles as having particularly strong growth prospects, but lately the RV market has been extremely strong. A host of younger buyers have flocked to Winnebago Industries and other sellers of RVs, focusing on smaller entry-level motorhomes, travel trailers, and other towable products to help them enjoy vacations in a more familiar environment without having to pay the rising costs of hotels and other accommodations. Winnebago in particular has gone through a transformation lately. Its acquisition of Grand Design helped increase its presence in the towable RV market, and organic growth has also been extremely strong as the company increases its internal efficiency and takes advantage of greater demand. Backlogs have been strong, and despite rising competition from other players in the industry, Winnebago's name recognition gives it some advantages over its rivals that it aims to capitalize on in 2017 and beyond. For a stock with growth opportunities, Winnebago stock is relatively inexpensive, with an earnings multiple of less than 20. If things continue to go as well in the recreational vehicle industry as they have lately, then Winnebago should be a big winner in seeing its fundamental business keep growing at a healthy and accelerating pace over the next year. Jamal Carnette, CFA (BOFI Holdings): Although I loathe to play politics with my portfolio, in the event there are tangible, clear benefits to a well-run company I find it foolish (small f) not to incorporate this into your investment thesis. While President-elect Donald Trump made a routine of bashing banks in the Republican primary, after winning the nomination he's been decidedly less truculent; and post-election he's been outright bullish on banks, bringing on many Wall Street veterans for his cabinet. With Republicans in charge of both the executive and legislative branches, it stands to reason banks overall will benefit from a gutting of the regulatory regime. Only time will tell if repealing major parts of Dodd-Frank are in the best interest of the US economy, but in the short run it has produced a near-mania run in financials. In less than two months, XLF and BOFI are up 18% and 51%, respectively: XLF data by YCharts. While BOFI benefits from a repeal of Dodd Frank directly in the form of lower compliance costs, the bigger effects appear indirect as investors become more bullish on banks as regulations are scaled back and valuations increase across the board. However, the biggest boost to BOFI's fortunes will be macroeconomic. In response to Donald Trump's proposed policies, the yield curve has become drastically steeper, particularly at the key five and seven year maturities. Considering the business model of a traditional bank is to pay interest at the lower end of the yield curve and lend at longer maturities, a steepening yield curve should lead to earnings expansion. Data source: US Department of the Treasury. Figures in percentage. Of course, Bank of Internet is not without risks. For one, the company trades at a price to tangible book value of 2.5 times, rather expensive versus competitors like Wells Fargo with a valuation of 1.9 times. However, the non-conventional model of eschewing branches allows the company to grow its deposit base by offering higher rates to consumers. Look for the company to continue to grow deposits and benefit from decreased regulation and a steepening yield curve. Matt DiLallo (Sunoco Logistics Partners): Oil pipeline MLP Sunoco Logistics Partners is on the cusp of a dramatic transformation. The company recently sealed a deal to merge with natural gas pipeline sibling Energy Transfer Partners (NYSE:ETP) in a transaction that will create a diversified energy infrastructure giant. The deal will expand Sunoco's strategic footprint, diversify its asset base, and integrate its complementary portfolio. Meanwhile, the merger will significantly strengthen Energy Transfer's financials and balance sheet. Finally, the transaction will lower costs through an expected $200 million in commercial synergies and cost savings. That transaction, however, is only one of the many catalysts on the horizon for Sunoco and Energy Transfer next year. The two companies expect to finally complete their controversial Dakota Access Pipeline shortly after Donald Trump takes office, which will enable them to start collecting cash flow from the $3.8 billion project. In addition to that, they have several other projects nearing completion as they put the finishing touches on a recent growth spurt fueled by more than $15 billion of expansion capital. As these projects come online, their steady fee-based cash flows should support double-digit distribution growth for the combined entity over the near-term. These initiatives put Sunoco Logistics in a position to have a big year in 2017. Because of that, January could be the best time to invest in Sunoco Logistics to capture these catalysts before they come to fruition. Neha Chamaria (Sherwin-Williams Co.): Sherwin-Williams might not appear cheap at 23 times trailing earnings, but there are valid reasons why the market is willing to pay a premium for the stock. The paint maker is on solid footing right now as it aims to take its enviable brand image a step further by merging with Valspar amid strong U.S. construction and housing markets. While the merger still awaits regulatory approval, the companies refuted regulatory setback rumors some days ago and expect to close the deal in the first quarter of 2017. As the merged entity will be the largest paint company in the world, its growth prospects are tremendous. Sherwin-Williams is building up its cash reserves to acquire Valspar, which is why it suspended share repurchases in 2016. However, the company continues to pay solid dividends, and I expect it to announce another hike within the next couple of months. Meanwhile, management is committed to boosting margins in 2017 by cutting operating expenses even as input costs pose a challenge. Prices of titanium dioxide (TiO2) -- a key pigment used in paints -- are rising, but Sherwin-Williams plans to pass on the costs by increasing paint prices in January. Higher prices and lower costs should boost Sherwin-Williams' margins further in 2017 even as it rides the strength in the housing markets. Overall, Sherwin-Williams is ending 2016 on a solid note from an operational and growth point of view, making it a must-watch stock for 2017. ","

                                    is the latest credit card company to stop allowing new credit card applicants to do so with the help of a cosigner. (For those with existing accounts, there will be no change, but as of December 2016, this practice won't be allowed for new applicants, a spokesman for Discover said.) Many other banks and card issuers had already discontinued the practice, making the ability to sign up with a cosigner rare. A cosigner can help someone with a lower credit score be approved for a card; both the cosigner and the applicant become equally responsible for paying the account’s bill. Failing to pay the bill can also hurt both parties’ credit.

Discover didn't provide much detail on why the company is no longer allowing cosigners (a spokesman said only that “there are operational and infrastructure constraints with joint accounts” and declined to elaborate). A possible reason: If a credit-card bill isn't paid, having multiple account holders to track down may be harder for banks and card issuers than having just one, said Matt Schulz, a senior industry analyst for CreditCards.com. The company still allows authorized users on its accounts, as do Chase, Citi and American Express. Unlike a cosigner, an authorized user of an account isn't liable for paying his or her bill; that responsibility falls to the primary account holder.

                                    still allow cosigners. Discontinuing the practice of allowing cosigners isn’t good news for consumers in many cases, credit card experts have said. Allowing authorized users does provide some of the conveniences that allowing a cosigner does, since it gives another person the ability to spend on the same credit account. However, while opening one’s own account alone or with a cosigner helps an individual build credit, an authorized user doesn’t build as much, Ethan Dornhelm, the senior director of scores and analytics at Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) previously told MarketWatch. “Adding someone won’t hurt,” he said, “it’s just not likely to make nearly as substantive a difference.” (Plus, not every card issuer reports authorized users’ activity to credit bureaus, according to Discover’s website. And those that do may not report it in exactly the same way.) Ditching cosigners may also be detrimental for couples attempting to split all finances equally, since the “authorized user” relationship (which many couples turn to instead) gives one party more power and responsibility, said Sean McQuay, a credit card expert at the personal-finance company NerdWallet. “The authorized user is more of a parent/child relationship,” he said; even if one partner allows the other to be an authorized user, one person is still the primary account holder, which can be “detrimental to building confidence and management skills” for the other party, McQuay said. Plus, as an authorized user, a partner in theory would be able to run up a credit card bill and then accept no responsibility for paying it since his or her credit score would remain unaffected, Schulz said. On the other hand, parents or others who would rather not be cosigners on accounts may view the discontinued practice as a good thing, Schulz said; cosigners are taking the risk that the applicant they are cosigning for will pay his or her bill responsibly, as to not damage the co-signer’s credit. Eliminating the option of cosigners may take away that risk and responsibility. There are other ways for those with thin credit histories to build credit, McQuay and Schulz said. The Credit CARD Act, which U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law in 2009, made it more difficult for consumers under age 21 to get credit cards; they either needed a cosigner or proof of income. Secured credit cards are a good option instead of cosigned accounts because they work similarly to debit cards, requiring an initial deposit and not allowing the user to go over that limit. But unlike debit cards, use is reported to credit reporting agencies and allows the user to build credit. This should be a short-term option, though, Schulz said; credit utilization ratio, or the amount of one’s available credit that is used, also is a component of credit scoring. Because the utilization of secured cards tends to be high, consumers should strive to use them for about nine months to a year and then upgrade to a traditional credit card with more desirable terms, he said. In addition to Bank of America and U.S. Bank, there may also be local banks or credit unions that still offer the option of a cosigner, McQuay said, so consumers may benefit from looking there. Most important, consumers should pay their bills (whether they are for a secured credit card or not) on time and in full. “The key to credit is to only spend money you have. In essence, treat your credit cards just like cash or a debit card,” Sandra Bernardo, the credit agency Experian’s manager of consumer education previously told MarketWatch.

Read: Coach, Michael Kors, Kate Spade go deep on holiday weekend discounts The stock is currently trading at 7.9 times enterprise value/EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), said Boruchow, compared with average takeout multiples of 11 times EBITDA for the sector in the last 10 years. Don’t miss: Kate Spade keeps promos in check at full-price stores, but loses the battle at outlets The closest comparables are accessory brands Tumi, which was bought for 15 times EBITDA this year by Samsonite, and Tory Burch, valued at 18 times EBITDA in February 2015 following insider sales, he said. An 11-times-EBITDA valuation would imply a $23-a-share price, or a 35% premium to Wednesday’s share price following the 16% move, Boruchow said. “We’d view this as very reasonable with an upside bias.” Mizuho Securities analyst Betty Chen agreed that Kate Spade is an attractive target that brings a lot to the table. “We believe the growth profile coupled with the brand’s unique appeal to millennials and broad-based success across categories ranging from handbags to apparel and jewelry could be attractive to many buyers, including Coach, which was rumored to be evaluating the company in recent weeks,” Chen wrote.

                                    up against record levels and prompting a massive rally over the past 60 days or so on the heels of the 2016 presidential election. Of course, optimism is a funny thing. There is a biological imperative in optimism that helps push us toward the future rather than live in the past and despair, but being overly hopeful leaves us open to being unrealistic about our chances of future success. This “optimism bias” is a common cause of pain among traders, especially those who take risky bets without acknowledging the true odds of recording a big loss. In other words, then, all those animal spirits may come into 2017 like a lion and wind up leaving like a lamb. But for now, optimism is strong across various segments of the market and the U.S. economy. Here are nine areas where hopes are running high as we enter the new year: Investors: According to a recent Wells Fargo/Gallup poll, individual investor optimism hit a nine-year high in November and marked the third straight quarter of improving sentiment. Furthermore, the surge to a reading of 96 was up 17 points from a reading of 79 in the prior quarter, and was a hair away from pre-financial crisis levels. Family finances: Americans are more optimistic about how their family finances will fare in 2017 compared with a similar survey five years ago, according to a recent New York Life survey of 1,800 adults ages 30 or older,. Specifically, 43% are optimistic about the new year vs. just 31% of those surveyed in 2011 about their hopes for the following 12 months. Also, 34% planned to spend more on big purchases like home improvements or appliances — double the reading of just 17% who planned to increase spending going into 2012. Jobs: The Employer Associations of America released its 2017 National Business Trends Survey recently, and it showed 48% of employers plan on increasing staffing — and that’s after 32% hired more than they expected to in 2016. Looking forward, 89% expect overall business results to be the same or better in 2017 compared with 2016, which is bolstering their staffing plans. Consumers: The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index rose to 113.7 in December, topping estimates and hitting the highest level since August 2001. That would be impressive enough if it didn’t come on the heels of previously strong data, including an upward revision to November numbers. Manufacturing: The latest manufacturing report from the Institute for Supply Management showed continued expansion in the sector. But of particular note was a big surge in purchases, with the report showing the new orders index hit 60.2% — a big increase of 7.2 percentage points from November. That, coupled with positive forward-looking comments, seems to show a rosy outlook for manufacturers in the new year. Materials: The American Chemistry Council’s Chemical Activity Barometer just ended the year with a year-over-year increase of 4.4% — the strongest pace of expansion since 2010. All four core categories for the index improved in December, which is notable given that “the chemical industry has been found to consistently lead the U.S. economy’s business cycle given its early position in the supply chain,” according to the ACC. Housing: The National Association of Home Builders said builder confidence in December surged to an 11-year high. Furthermore, the reading of 70 obliterated forecasts of just 63 for the optimism index. At the same time, prospective home buyers were getting more optimistic as more people entered the market looking for a house, according to the NAHB. Small businesses: The National Federation of Independent Businesses’ Small Business Optimism Index climbed to 98.4 after Election Day, only the third time it’s been above the long-term average since 2007. Most tellingly, the biggest surge in optimism was recorded in the reading of those business owners who “expect the economy to improve” — followed closely by the category of those who “expect higher real sales volume” in the future. Small businesses, again: The Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index poll showed the highest rate of optimism in eight years in 2016’s fourth quarter. It wasn’t a small bump, either: The overall index surged from a reading of 68 in the third quarter to 80 in the latest reading. The details show 58% of small-business owners surveyed expect revenue to increase in the next 12 months, 35% plan to increase capital spending and 36% expect to hire new workers.

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Blockchain, cognitive computing and cloud are some of the technologies that will shape the finance industry the most in the digital age, banking and technology chief executives told a financial conference on Monday. IBM Corp’s president and chief executive Ginni Rometty said that cognitive computing, or computer systems that can mimic the way the human brain works, will be the “ultimate way” finance firms will become more competitive in the future.  “I think the advantage is going to go to who has the best insights,” Rometty told delegates. Over the past few years financial institutions have been struggling to take advantage of vast amounts of data that they store, which is held unevenly across their numerous databases. “We all have mounds and mounds of data, but getting data to produce insight, that is the holy grail”, Cathy Bessant, chief operations and technology officer at Bank of America  Corp, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Fintech Ideas Festival. Financial institutions have also been ramping up investment into developing blockchain technology, the distributed data-base system that first emerged as the software underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin. “Blockchain is so profound it will do for trusted transactions what the internet did for information,” IBM’s Rometty said, describing it as one of the most transformative technologies for finance. Biometrics and cloud computing were also among the technologies cited as having the most impact for the sector. Tim Sloan, chief executive of Wells Fargo & Co, said the bank was moving away from passwords and adopting technology such as voice recognition to identify customers. He also called for greater adoption of cloud technology to “test projects through, much more quickly.” Sloan took over as chief executive of Wells Fargo in October, in the wake of a $185 million regulatory settlement between the bank, regulatory authorities and a Los Angeles prosecutor over its staff opening as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge “Innovation plays a very important role for me as the new CEO of Wells Fargo as we rebuild trust in the company,” Sloan said. While expanded use of digital technologies in finance presents opportunities, executives said it increases the threat of cyber security risk. “The idea of having up to 50 billion connected devices in the next few years is exciting. I also think it’s scary. The scary part of it is the cyber security,” said Ajay Banga, president and chief executive of MasterCard Inc..   (Editing by Jacqueline Wong) ","

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo’s phony account scandal has spurred a top U.S. bank regulator to count sales practices as a chief risk to the country’s banking system and to embark on a wide-sweeping review of large and mid-sized institutions. In a half-yearly report on threats to banks, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Thursday said it now counts “governance over sales practices as a key risk issue.” This is the first time the OCC has deemed sales practices a key threat, putting them on the same level as hacking, low reserves, and a gathering storm of credit risk from significant growth in loans and deteriorating lending standards. On a call with reporters, Comptroller Thomas Curry said the review continues, but declined to provide details and said he could not give a public assessment on individual banks or the sector as a whole. The office is currently looking at how the banks it has selected for review - large and midsized banks - handle their sales practices and then will expand its work in the near future based on the findings, he said. While he would not give a timeline for the review, Curry said OCC staff have an “internal goalpost.” The OCC said it expects to continue to see mergers and acquisitions among banks, which could pose risks to banks’ ability to manage information systems and platforms and controls. It said that banks should “consider the strategic implications of a lower interest rate environment for a longer time period,” “A persistent low and flat interest rate environment continues to pressure some banks and asset managers to reach for yield by extending asset duration, taking additional credit risk, and looking for new revenue channels,” it said. OCC examiners, meanwhile, have found that banks are weak in preparing for losses on loans and leases, and are not giving enough consideration to strong loan growth, concentrations of credit, increasing risk appetite and lower underwriting standards.

Colonial, based in Montgomery, Alabama, went into FDIC receivership in August 2009 after struggling from losses tied to mortgage securities and an aggressive foray into Florida. Three years later, the FDIC sued the 11 banks, stating that they violated federal securities law by selling $388 million in toxic debt to Colonial in 2007. It said the lawsuit was timely because it had three years from the start of the receivership to sue. A lower court judge threw out the case, accepting the banks’ argument that the clock ran out in 2010, three years after Colonial bought its securities. But in the reversal, the appeals court found that the U.S. Congress intended that an “extender statute” giving the FDIC more time to pursue some legal claims covered the Colonial case. ","

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"(Reuters) - ClubCorp Holdings Inc MYCC.N, one of the largest owners and operators of private golf and country clubs in the United States, said on Thursday it was exploring strategic alternatives after Reuters reported the company was in a process to sell itself. ClubCorp is in the early stages of an auction process that has attracted the interest of potential buyers that include private equity firms, people familiar with the matter said earlier on Thursday. ClubCorp said it has formed a committee made up of independent board directors to carry out the review of its options. KSL Capital, a private equity firm, bought ClubCorp for $1.8 billion in October 2006 and took it public in 2013. ClubCorp shares were trading up 13 percent at $17 in afternoon trading in New York on Thursday, giving the company a market capitalization of around $1.1 billion. ClubCorp, founded in 1957, operates more than 200 properties, including golf and country clubs, business clubs and sports clubs across the U.S., Mexico and China. It is a serial acquirer in the golf course industry, buying 12 new clubs in 2015 and 2016. It looks to buy locally-owned golf courses and then refurbish them by adding or improving amenities such as up-scale dining and event rooms. “It is obvious to us that ClubCorp’s reinvention capital expenditures are transformative in nature and are in no shape or form ‘maintenance,’” the letter wrote. FrontFour also suggested ClubCorp, which owns the land for a large number of its properties, consider converting its real estate into a real estate investment trust (REIT). REIT structures help reduce the tax burden on rental income and can benefit shareholders through the significant distribution of profit as dividend.

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"A number of bank stock analysts have worked through broad tax proposals by Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump and estimate that a new tax law could increase Citigroup earnings per share only half as much as some rivals. At the same time, Citigroup may have to slash $4 billion or more of the value of an unusually large income tax asset that the bank holds as a result of losses it suffered during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. “If the U.S. cuts corporate tax rates, they will still benefit, just benefit less,” said Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg. The differences between Citigroup and its competitors highlight how corporations have different interests in the details of a new tax law, such as how foreign income is treated and how bank business customers might be favored less than individuals. The blueprint for tax reform put forward by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives calls for reducing the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has proposed 15 percent. Banks are expected to benefit more from corporate tax cuts than other industries as they tend to pay more taxes as a result of receiving fewer investment credits and deductions, such as those available for oil and gas exploration. Tax cuts could be the icing on the cake for banks as they look forward to higher profits in the coming year. They are already benefiting from higher U.S. interest rates, and lighter regulation under the Trump administration could allow Wall Street banks to re-enter risky but potentially profitable trading business. Citigroup reports the following Wednesday, Jan. 18. The New York-based bank earns about half of its profits overseas, where corporate tax rates are mostly lower than the United States, so it stands to benefit less from lower U.S. tax rates than its rivals with more domestic business, analysts said. A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment on the matter. Goldberg estimates Citigroup will get an 11 percent lift to earnings per share this year due to tax cuts, much less than the 21.4 percent gain he is projecting for JPMorgan. Citigroup executives disclosed a few days after the Nov. 8 election that the bank could have to write down the value of deferred tax assets by $4 billion to $12 billion depending on how the tax law changed and when. The tax assets would be less useful offsetting future taxes if corporate rates were lower. “There’s nothing they can do other than explain it,” said Fred Cannon, global director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Cannon estimates Citigroup annual earnings per share could be 9.6 percent better with tax changes, about half as much as the 18.9 percent improvement he sees for JPMorgan. More profits left after taxes should make more capital available for additional dividends and share repurchases that could help lift bank stock prices. Analyst Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley said in a research note on Friday that the most pressing question she is getting from clients is how lower taxes will impact banks. Graseck has estimated that lower taxes would boost Citigroup earnings per share by 7 percent, Wells Fargo by 19 percent and JPMorgan by 22 percent. John McDonald of Bernstein Research estimates a 10 percent lift for Citigroup, compared with a 13 percent boost for JPMorgan and 19 percent for Wells Fargo. The differences in the analysts’ estimates underscore how much uncertainty there is about tax reform. The estimates vary with different assumptions about the tax rate that ultimately comes out of Washington, as well as a possible shift in how foreign income is taxed and when the changes would take effect. A tax overhaul in 1986 took more than two years, Cannon noted. Cannon based his estimates on a 25 percent cut in the corporate tax rate, arguing that concerns about funding the federal budget and tax cuts for individuals will temper the corporate rate reduction proposed by Republicans and Trump. The more the rate is cut, the less Citigroup would benefit compared with competitors, generally. But the degree of its relative benefits could change, too, if congress also shifts how foreign income is taxed, which Republicans have proposed. How the final U.S. rate compares with rates in particular countries where Citigroup does more or less business than other banks would then come into play, said Cannon. “The devil is in the details,” said Goldberg. “There is a lot of uncertainty how this plays out.” ","

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Is your money vice too many movies? A costly dry cleaning habit? Too much wine? It is time to look at the year-end spending summary available from your bank or credit card issuer - or a tracking service like Mint.com - to get a reality check that could help you make better choices in 2017. For Barak Kassar, a 50-year-old businessman in San Francisco, it was Uber that broke the bank in 2016. He plans on trimming off at least $200 this year. “I have taken a few rides out of laziness, when taking a bike or public transport would be far less expensive,” Kassar said. For Lyn Alden, a 29-year-old financial analyst based in Atlantic City, New Jersey, it was Chipotle, where she had spent more than $1,000 in a year. “It’s amazing how a simple work lunch habit that flies under the radar can add up to such a large sum,” Alden said. Most financial institutions have revelatory spending information available on-demand throughout the year, which can be downloaded and sliced and diced at will. But that can be a lot to ask. Here’s how to get the most out of those once-a-year pie charts: 1. Make yourself look Just saying you want to spend less on a particular category tends to lead to failure. People are notoriously bad at estimating their spending, according to Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, known as the Money Coach (askthemoneycoach.com/). In more than a decade of coaching clients, Khalfani-Cox has yet to find one who can correctly guess their monthly spending. “If they say they spend $5,000 a month, I automatically assume it is $6,000,” she said. On most spending-tracking services, users can customize their views and make their categories as specific as they need, but the important thing is to look at the big picture and compare categories, said Kimmie Greene, a consumer financial expert with Mint, a unit of Intuit Inc. Those pie charts will make it apparent where efforts to reduce spending would make sense, and when it would not impact the bottom line so much. “Is there one big thing that could divert your debt? Do you want to cut the cable cord? Do you want to get rid of your car?” Greene said. “If you just say you’re never going to eat lunch out again, that’s just not so realistic.” 2. Pluck the low-hanging fruit The easiest way to save money is not necessarily cutting that morning coffee: It is simply paying your bills on time and not overdrafting your bank account. Mint.com has found the average person spends $75 a month in credit card fees - $900 a year - which includes late fees, finance charges and yearly service fees. Add to that $48 a month in bank fees for things like overdrafts, ATM fees, low balance charges and the like. “Most of the people who missed a credit card payment actually have the money, but life got the better of them for one reason or another,” Greene said. Some services like Mint will push out notices to users when a fee is paid, but sometimes it is only when it is all added up in a yearly tally that it gets their attention. “They say, “Oh wow, I didn’t realize my bank took $996 of my money last year,” Greene said. “It’s like the $35 notice pops up, but it doesn’t hit home.” Wells Fargo’s pilot phone consultation program reached over 10,000 people in the last year. The consultant looks up the customer’s bank records and has an extensive conversation about goals and habits and try to help come up with small tasks to try. “We publish lots of information, we give them things to read and give them tools, but helping people form the daily habits, that’s what we’re really focused on right now,” said Brett Pitts, head of digital at Wells Fargo. 3. Reduce your tax burden Your spending report has the added bonus of being a tax preparation aid. Use the information to look for any tax-deductible spending, advised Khalfani-Cox. In particular, look for charitable deductions you might have forgotten about and medical expenses. “About seven out of 10 people do not itemize, and that’s a huge mistake,” Khalfani-Cox said. ","

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"NEW YORK, Jan 12 (IFR) - US banks are facing wider secondary market spreads as they prepare to unleash a deluge of bond issuance after reporting fourth-quarter earnings from Friday. Deals are expected to come thick and fast as banks strive to meet the Federal Reserve’s 2019 deadline for Total Loss Absorbing Capacity requirements. But market participants do not expect much competing supply, and reckon that banks should be able to shrug off widening in their secondary bonds over the past few days. “They will start wider given their secondaries are wider, but their pricing power is pretty robust,” one DCM banker told IFR. “Even though they do multi-billion dollar deals, I wouldn’t expect a big impact.” Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo could kick off proceedings as early as Friday, when they report earnings before the market opens. Morgan Stanley reports on Tuesday, after Monday’s US holiday, followed by Citigroup and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday and Bank of New York Mellon on Thursday. State Street will be the last of the eight largest US banks to report earnings on January 25. Citigroup already printed a US$5.25bn deal last week, including a fixed-to-floating rate 11-year non-call 10 tranche. That bond was trading 7bp wider than reoffer on Thursday, according to MarketAxess data. US dollar bank bonds - mostly issued by Yankee banks so far this year - have widened by an average of 2bp since the start of the year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Bonds with 10-year maturities have been among the worst performers - and that could also impact pricing on new deals from US money center banks, one syndicate banker said. A recent 10-year issue sold by Lloyds, for example, is trading 9bp wide of reoffer at T+149bp, while a 10-year trade issued by Sumitomo Mitsui is 15bp wide of reoffer at T+125bp, according to MarketAxess. “That is probably a result of oversupply, but also because of where the deals priced. The 5/10s curve was very flat,” one syndicate banker told IFR. Banks are widely expected to use callable structures in their upcoming issuance. The call options, added in deals since last August, allow them to retire the debt early before it loses TLAC treatment. “The majority of TLAC issuance will be in the callable structure,” said one bank investor. Fixed-to-floating coupons like the one used by Citigroup last week are ideal for callable bonds because they negate interest-rate risk and make it easier for issuers to swap their interest payments to floating rate, said a banker. “It puts more of a hammer on the call date, it takes interest-rate risk out of it, and it fixes the hedge accounting issues [with swapping to floating rate],” he said. Banks tend to swap fixed-rate liabilities back to floating rate, but some auditors have not been comfortable with letting them do that past the date of the call option. The coming issuance is expected to be in holding company format, which counts towards TLAC. Debt issued through bank operating companies does not. The eight largest US banks have US$113bn of holding company debt maturing in 2017 across all currencies, according to research firm CreditSights. The firm expects those banks to print US$150bn-US$165bn of new holdco debt in 2017, compared to US$181.5bn last year. Bank issuance started off shakily in 2016, overshadowed by concerns around whether senior debt would count towards TLAC. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley were the only global US banks to print deals last January, according to IFR data. BNY Mellon, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and BAML followed in February.

,01122017,Reuters,01052017,"HUD said it expects its case against the bank will be heard in federal court, where a judge could potentially order the bank to pay damages, attorneys fees or other equitable relief. A Bank of America spokesperson did not have any immediate comment. This is not the first time that Bank of America has faced allegations of discrimination. The city accused the banks of steering those borrowers into higher-cost loans that they could not afford. The banks are seeking to quash the lawsuit, arguing that the kind of monetary recovery being sought by Miami is not covered by federal law. A ruling on that case is due by the end of June. The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to deny or discriminate against people based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or disability when it comes to issuing mortgages or mortgage modifications. HUD’s case on Friday against Bank of America was prompted by a complaint filed by the National Fair Housing Alliance. The alliance raised concerns about possible discrimination, after it conducted a series of “tests” in February 2013 through January 2014 to compare how bank employees treated female Hispanic versus non-Hispanic female prospective borrowers in a Charleston-based branch of the bank. The Hispanic borrowers were offered less favorable lending terms compared with the non-Hispanic borrowers and the bank was less prompt in helping connect the Hispanic borrowers with the loan officer, the testing found. For instance, one non-Hispanic borrower received an estimate with lower closing costs and monthly payments, as well as an offer by the bank to pay $2,000 of her closing costs. The Hispanic borrower, by contrast, would have faced higher monthly payments and did not receive a similar offer for the bank to cover her closing costs. ","

The total sum of money owed exceeds $1 billion when dated to 2011, according to the FDIC, which said it may revise its complaint. (See also: Are Your Bank Deposits Insured?) The FDIC claims that the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank ignored instructions on how to account for its exposure to counterparties​. Bank of America insists that it has regularly updated the FDIC on its calculations and said that the matter should have been resolved through continued discussions rather than litigation. In a statement, Bank of America – the second biggest U.S. lender – said it complied with FDIC rules. ""The amount in question, derived from a technical disagreement about a calculation from several years ago regarding a rule that has had changing provisions over time, comprises a fraction of what we annually pay to the FDIC,"" the bank said in a statement.

 ,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"Wells Fargo is completely restructuring how it pays tellers and other bank branch employees after a scandal over its aggressive sales practices. Employees will no longer get incentives for opening accounts or meeting sales goals. They will instead receive part of their overall salary based on how the products they sell are used. Accounts that are used frequently will help an employee's pay, while idle accounts will not be a factor. A component will be based on independently measured customer service scores for branch locations. And employees will receive more of their overall compensation as a base salary, not incentives and bonuses. The change was considered a priority for the CEO and the head of Wells Fargo's community bank division, both of whom took those jobs after the scandal emerged.

Ari Levy,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan, who replaced John Stumpf in October after a sales scandal at the San Francisco bank, is ready to embrace technology. And he wants his customers to know it. At the FinTech Ideas Festival on Monday in his bank's hometown, Sloan took the stage to offer his predictions on the five technological things that will change banking. While some of this is obvious to anyone following technology, it's still instructive to hear the leader of one of the country's largest banks discuss the transition to the mobile and digital era. Sloan's view of the future: 1) APIs –  Application programming interfaces are the tools developers use to allow third parties to connect to their technology. In the modern world, tech is interconnected rather than siloed. Companies want consumers to be able to reach them from anywhere, whether on a computer or mobile device, and whether in a social media app or through a financial aggregating service. Wells Fargo  has been opening up APIs to enable consumers and commercial customers to bank the ways they want to bank. 2) Artificial intelligence – Personalization in banking requires the use of sophisticated software to understand as much as possible about the customer in order to serve up recommendations and offers at the right time. Wells Fargo has a startup accelerator investing in young companies focusing on technology such as interactions through natural language and the use of predictive tools. 3) Voice and biometrics – It's time to ""move away from passwords so that that the body becomes your password,"" Sloan said. Voice and other forms of physical authentication are safer and more secure than plain text -- an attacker can't steal somebody's voice like a password written on a piece of paper. They also enable remote banking. Sloan gave the example of a consumer visiting a coffee shop, putting in an order, sitting down and applying for a credit card by taking a picture of a driver's license and quickly filling out a form. By the time the order is up, the customer can use a brand new Wells Fargo credit card to pay. 4) Payments – Digital wallets are everywhere. Wells Fargo is building them for the various mobile operating systems, and they're all created to enable plenty of customer feedback. 5) Cloud – Like every industry, banking must get used to developing and deploying services faster, while taking better advantage of all the data that devices are spitting out. It all has to be done ""much more quickly than we have historically,"" Sloan said. ",Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan: How tech is changing banking
Rebecca Ungarino,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"The market will experience heightened volatility and uncertainty ahead, and investors will have to position themselves accordingly, in a time the Wells Fargo Investment Institute characterizes in a new report as the ""age of discontent."" Households across the country have felt economic recovery to very different and uneven degrees post-financial crisis, according to the report, which attributes such ""discontent"" for market participants to frustration across economic classes, along with increased political uncertainty on the horizon. ""By many measures, this has been a dividend recovery with a distinct set of winners and losers,"" according to the report written by a team led by Tracie McMillion, head of global asset allocation at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The stark differences in economic recovery might be found in the employed versus the unemployed, savers versus consumers, and small business versus large corporations. What's more is economic growth is not improving quickly enough for many, the report added, citing wage and real income stagnation as forces ""fueling protectionism and geopolitical unrest."" And as a new presidential administration ushers in a fresh set of policies, investors will more so begin translating political uncertainty into investing decisions, said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist at the Well Fargo Investment Institute, which the market must contend with over the coming years. New policies like auditing the Federal Reserve may begin affecting markets in a more direct way, and Samana said investors may not make ""favorable or rational economic decisions, but those based more on political outcomes."" So what are investors to do? As investors face more uncertainty going forward in the wake of a new presidential administration ushering in different economic policies, Samana said investors are wise to look at two strategies in particular. ""For most investors, the best way to tackle those two things is to one, stay well-diversified, and two, to make sure that you don't get too carried away with short-term market movements, and to rebalance and come back to what would be a more neutral stance,"" he said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" In terms of staying ""neutral,"" Samana recommends investors trimming their holdings. ""We had been overweight large caps, think S&P 500-type stocks. We just took those back to neutral with the thinking the valuations weren't as attractive,"" Samana said, as he and his firm had reallocated that capital and put it into long-term fixed income, a class which he had previously been underweight, but he now sees as a reliable neutral holding ""in a well-diversified portfolio.""

Wilfred Frost,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"There's a big difference coming into the fourth quarter of 2016 earnings for banks compared with the prior three — both share prices and sentiment have improved drastically for the sector, so there's more room for disappointment than there was for all of 2016. Before the election, the average valuation for the big five banks with both investment and commercial businesses was 1 times price to tangible book — or the banks' market price in relation to the value reported on their balance sheets. That same measure now stands at 1.3 times. Over the coming quarters, banks need to deliver stronger earnings to justify that higher multiple, and Friday is the first major test of investors' elevated enthusiasm toward the sector. On that note, the key things to watch are: Given the extraordinary change in sentiment since the presidential election, there will be a disproportionate focus on management commentary, not least in terms of what they expect from a Donald Trump presidency in terms of deregulation and tax changes, but also more broadly because most banks will be announcing their 2017 guidance. (Next week from World Economic Forum in Davos, CNBC will broadcast interviews with the CEOs JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup.) Broadly speaking, the analyst community remains positive on banks, though they expect more steady share price appreciation based on earnings growth, as opposed to the huge gains due to multiple expansion that investors saw in November and early December. But there now appears to be preference for commercial banks based on the fact that markets have already seen rates improve over investment banks, which stand to benefit from deregulation and tax changes that are yet to arrive. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo kick off earnings on Friday, with Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup following next week.

Evelyn Cheng,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"Banks will need to prove in their quarterly results that they've justified their stocks' massive post-election gains. ""The market has rewarded the stocks very well in the fourth quarter,"" said Ken Leon, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. ""The question is, can they really catch up with the euphoria of having a Trump administration?"" The fourth-quarter reporting season kicks off in earnest Friday with results from BlackRock, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs report early next week after Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The bank stocks are a key part of the U.S. market's rally to record highs. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) has shot up more than 24 percent since the election, while the broader financials sector is up 17 percent as the top performer in the S&P 500 over that time. As a result, expectations are generally elevated. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said in a Wednesday note that most of the large banks it covers should beat consensus earnings estimates. That's despite a history of fourth-quarter numbers disappointing, Goldberg said. ""I don't think there's a lot of room for shortfall, assuming we don't get a surprise,"" said Devin Ryan, analyst at JMP Securities. ""We're going to be focusing more on incremental comments from management that suggest the backdrop is changing."" Investors may not hear as much optimism on potential political changes as they would like. While the bank stocks have rallied early this year to highs not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, not many expect the complete repeal of the post-crisis Dodd-Frank legislation as Trump has promised. ""They're probably going to be slower than maybe the market has anticipated. We don't view financial regulation as a top priority for the new administration,"" said Shannon Stemm, financial services analyst at Edward Jones.

Patti Domm,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"This is the year inflation worries could begin to simmer for the first time in ages. After years of worrying about deflation, the stock market could catch a whiff of inflation later in the year. In its 2017 outlook, Charles Schwab pulled inflation to its ""front burner"" list of concerns for stocks and pushed deflation to its ""back burner."" Others feel the same. ""In the second half of the year, we think there's going to be some headwinds in the market with people worrying about wage inflation in 2018, and the Fed being behind the curve. It's not necessarily that they're going to be realities, but I think at the end of the year, people are going to be worried about inflationary pressures, largely coming from wages,"" said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Steven Wieting, global chief strategist at Citi Private Bank, expects President-elect Donald Trump's plans for fiscal stimulus and tax cuts to boost GDP by more than a full percent this year. But those programs should also bring some inflation. ""While they may succeed in postponing the timing of the next cyclical downturn in the U.S. and world economy, this could come at a cost of a more severe downturn later on. One major risk of fiscal stimulus so late into an economic cycle is inflation,"" Wieting wrote in his 2017 outlook. Just like anything, too much inflation would not be good. But the lack of it has been a concern, and after years of little price traction, strategists see it picking up to a still comfortable pace. ""I don't think inflation is going to be a crushing inflation,"" said Wieting in an interview. ""But consumers in the United States don't get wage adjustments for inflation."" Service sector prices could be the biggest driver of inflation because that is the most labor intensive part of the economy, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. ""I think we could see headline inflation by the end of this year running the high 2s and the core could be well over 2 percent as well,"" said Stanley. He expects wage growth of about 3 percent by the end of next year. ""If the Trump administration is able to successfully shepherd through a lot of things they are advocating that would be positive for growth. You could see a boost to growth without it being terribly inflationary ... I'm more hawkish on inflation than most. It's not because of the fiscal side, it's because I think the Fed has already fallen behind the curve,"" Stanley said. That inflation target is even before considering potential effects from the still-unknown variables likely to be generated by Trump's planned trade policies. Wieting does not expect to see protectionist moves from the Trump administration but he said trade is the biggest risk to his forecast. He and others expect the Fed to raise interest rates faster if inflation moves up too quickly. For now, it is still sluggish — under the 2 percent targeted by the U.S. central bank, for a fifth year now. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditure price index, showed core inflation at just 1.6 percent in November. Less than half of Fed officials expect inflation to reach 1.9 to 2 percent this year, and the rest have a lower forecast. But many economists have been forecasting that inflation could finally break above the Fed's 2 percent target in 2017. Jefferies economists say inflation is accelerating primarily because commodities prices are again rising and commodities-based goods prices are going higher. They expect consumer price index inflation to surpass the central bank's 2 percent target in the first quarter and approach 3 percent by the end of the year. They see PCE at about 2.5 percent at year-end. Schwab strategists said the return of inflation could help to lift sales for global companies and boost business confidence and spending. A rising dollar could keep inflation in check, they said, and as long as it does not rise too much, stock valuations seem reasonable. They expect the Fed to raise rates twice this year as inflation picks up. Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, actually included in his inflation forecast what many economists have left as unknowns — the potential impact of tariffs on inflation. So far, it's unclear what Trump will do about taxing goods at the border, but the president-elect has said companies that go overseas to manufacture should pay an expensive tax on goods shipped back into the U.S. On Thursday, Toyota was the latest company to be warned by Trump on Twitter to build cars in the U.S., not Mexico or pay a huge tax. ""In our outlook for this year, we did assume that the Trump administration applies tariffs to both Mexico and China.Some of our improvement in inflation, firming in inflation in our forecast for 2017 is a result of imposition of trade restricting policies. Even aside from that, there's good reason to expect inflation would continue to firm. It would come from different sources,"" said Gapen. He said he expects inflation this year to come domestically from increases in wages, services sector prices and higher shelter costs. Congress has also separately suggested a border tax, which would act similar to a valued-added tax. The tax could be 15 to 20 percent depending on what level the corporate tax rate is cut to, from its current 35 percent. The border-adjusted tax would tax all incoming goods and services, but not exports out of the U.S. It's unclear what will happen with the proposal, but congressional leaders have said it's an important part of the corporate tax overhaul. Gapen estimates 2.4 percent for core PCE inflation by the fourth quarter of the year, and 2.3 percent on headline. Of that, 0.2 percent is due to his estimates of a 7 percent tariff on Mexican goods and a 15 percent tariff on Chinese imports. But if there is a border tax, he said the inflation hit could be much greater and difficult to forecast. Gapen said the inflationary impact of the increase in oil prices should be greatest in the first quarter since crude bottomed last February. Proponents of the border tax expect a rising dollar to offset the impact of higher costs of goods to consumers. But critics are doubtful the dollar would rise enough to offset it. In the minutes of its last meeting released Wednesday, the Fed noted that it expects fiscal stimulus but the impact on the economy is unclear. However, many central bank officials said there could be an upside risk to their forecasts. But they also noted it could potentially be inflationary or cause the dollar to rise. ",2017 is the year inflation makes a comeback—and Donald Trump could play a role
Seema Mody,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"President-elect Donald Trump says he will push China hard on trade — and many are wondering how Beijing will push back. A number of Beijing watchers say leaders there are already brainstorming ways to reply if Trump does in fact push forward with trade agreements that make life harder for Chinese companies that export into the United States. ""China will try to have a disproportionate response. If the U.S. action is 'X,' China's reaction will be '2X,'"" said James Keith, who leads the Asia practice of geopolitical consulting firm McLarty Associates and is the former deputy assistant Secretary of State for China. Keith, who was also former director for China on the National Security Council, said the most practical response would be slapping a tariff on U.S. exports to China, which would likely hurt large multinational corporations that rely on trade with the world's second largest economy. ""China will attempt to educate the new administration the cost of a trade war,"" said Keith. Experts at think tank Capital Economics agree that imposing a similar tax or tariff on companies that rely on trade or business with China is a plausible scenario. ""U.S. companies would find their products and operations in China subject to tighter regulation that hampered their capacity to do business there,"" wrote Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, in a research note to clients in mid-November. A trade war would most likely have a negative effect on China's economy, thereby pushing policymakers there to open the floodgates with easy money or other stimulus. Williams forecasts that Beijing's leadership team would try to offset any weakness in its economy that stemmed from a drop in export demand by loosening its monetary or fiscal policy. ""Stimulus is one thing China's government does well,"" wrote Williams. Wells Fargo points out that this could help China accelerate its push to become a consumption-based economy. ""Instead of trying to duke it out on the trade front with the U.S., they [China] may try to become less dependent on growth and demand from its biggest trading partner, and try to invest in domestic growth,"" said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Wall Street is most fearful of a Chinese yuan that weakens significantly against the U.S. dollar. The last two times the People's Bank of China has allowed the yuan to fall significantly against the dollar, global stocks responded violently. Beginning in 2016, however Beijing has done the exact opposite — defending the currency in order to counter the rally in the U.S. dollar. Last week, the offshore Chinese yuan that trades in Hong Kong posted a record two-day surge, easing concerns that another one-off devaluation may take place in 2017. Some traders say that Beijing is attempting to shield itself from the ""currency manipulator"" label that the president-elect often throws China's way. Despite last week's move, however, currency strategists still see the yuan gradually depreciating against the dollar in 2017, by around 5-6 percent. North Square Blue Oak, a China policy investment bank, told CNBC that the biggest uncertainty for the yuan is whether the incoming U.S. administration will follow through on its previous rhetoric, in particular its talk of implementing tariffs on Chinese imports, spending heavily on U.S. infrastructure, and slashing U.S. corporate taxes. Duncan Wrigley, chief strategist at North Square Blue Oak, also sees Trump's handling of Taiwan being a key focal point for investors. ""There is the black swan of escalating Sino-U.S. military confrontation"" that stems from Trump's ""casual attitude toward the long-standing U.S. one-China policy,"" he said.

Giovanny Moreano,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"Seth Masters, who oversees $80 billion in assets at Bernstein Private Wealth Management, predicts U.S. market returns will be much more difficult to achieve in the years ahead. ""After now about six or seven years of a very healthy equity market recovery, U.S. stocks are no longer cheap,"" Masters said. ""Profit margins at U.S. companies remain at very elevated levels. It's hard to see how you get huge earnings growth or much more valuation expansion here in the U.S."" In contrast, Masters believes investors will need to turn their attention overseas for opportunities where better valuations and higher-growth potential still exists. ""It's going to be a little tougher to get good returns and manage risk in the years ahead. It was easier when the dollar was strong just to stay here at home. When you have stronger equity returns outside the U.S., but possibly weaker currencies, you need to have pretty nuanced strategies to take advantage of that,"" he said. Masters famously predicted in 2012 that the Dow Jones industrial average would rise to 20,000 by 2018, a forecast that caused a stir because the blue-chip benchmark was around only 12,500 at the time.

Abigail Stevenson,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"It's never a good thing for the stock market to go in hot into earnings season, Jim Cramer says. ""We want things cool. There is too much heat. That is why I'm hoping we get some more down days this week, just in case the earnings aren't as perfect as they need to be after this historic run,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Looking at the overall context of the market, Cramer wasn't impressed. In fact, he thinks that is the major reason why the Dow failed to hit 20,000 again. The banks have led the rally, especially Bank of America, which has jumped to $22 from $17 since the election, and Goldman Sachs, which has gained 46.5 percent in the past three months. ""The issue with these stocks, so vital to the next leg of the rally, is that they need interest rates to go higher if they are going to keep rising, and interest rates seem to have peaked for the moment,"" Cramer said. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America all report on Friday and Goldman reports next week, and the backdrop right now is sub-par for Cramer. It would be better if the stocks sold off ahead of their quarters, he said. The second problem Cramer found was in healthcare. The group has bounced since the election, but investors don't know when Donald Trump could tweet about drug prices. As the market heads into the important JPMorgan health care conference this week, Cramer suspects that the event has been more muted because of worries over pricing. Many pharma companies also have a large amount of overseas currency exposure, which could hurt earnings when compared to the strengthening dollar. Cramer also worried about the price of crude at $52, as it could prevent oil stocks from going higher. If anything, he expects them to move lower. Thus, investors may not be able to count on the oil patch to do the heavy lifting in the market. The final worry on Cramer's list was technology, especially Apple, which was anointed as a top pick by Morgan Stanley because of the impending iPhone 8 and the possibility of repatriation relief. ""I much prefer downbeat talk that keeps expectations low,"" Cramer said. That is why moving into earnings season, Cramer is hoping for more downgrades and negativity in the stock market in general. More sell ratings could create much-needed pessimism to cool stocks down. After all, when everyone is bullish, that means there's no one left to buy. More negativity could help sustain the move.

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Over the last two months of 2016, the stock portfolio of Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) did extremely well, as many were big beneficiaries of the ""Trump rally."" However, there are still some bargains to be found among the Oracle of Omaha's stock holdings. Here are two in particular that look like good buys right now. Image source: The Motley Fool. Berkshire has several bank stocks in its portfolio, and since banking was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the ""Trump rally,"" Berkshire's stock portfolio appreciated by several billion dollars because of these investments. However, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), its largest bank holding, dramatically underperformed in 2016. Just look at how its performance last year compared with three other major Buffett bank stocks: WFC data by YCharts If you follow the financial news (or even the regular news for that matter), you know that there is one big reason for this. In early September, it was revealed that Wells Fargo employees had opened millions of fake accounts for customers, in response to aggressive sales goals. Several years ago, I wrote an article on how Wells Fargo was the master of cross-selling its products to existing customers. As it turns out, there was a not-so-good reason for that. In response to the scandal, Wells Fargo got rid of sales goals for its branch employees, changed its CEO, and has taken prudent steps to put the mess behind it. While Buffett was obviously disappointed, he announced soon after the news broke that he had no intention of selling any of his Wells Fargo stock. Buffett called the bank's incentive system a ""terrible mistake,"" but referred to Wells Fargo as an ""incredible institution."" As my colleague John Maxfield wrote, Wells Fargo has experienced a considerable drop in new accounts. However, I believe the scandal may not have as much of a long-lasting effect on the bank's performance as many critics think it will. Besides, Wells Fargo churns out the best profitability metrics of any of the ""big four"" banks on a consistent basis -- one of its key advantages -- and there's no reason to believe it won't continue to do so. WFC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts Finally, the Trump presidency should greatly help the banking sector, in terms of profit margins, volume of business, and lower regulations. Because of this, Wells Fargo is on my radar as we head into 2017, as it may be worth a look before it catches back up to the rest of its sector. Buffett has been aggressively and continuously accumulating a stake in oil refiner Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) over the past couple years, and in fact, Berkshire Hathaway is now the company's largest shareholder. Although the stock has risen quite a bit lately in the wake of the election, it could still be a great time to join Buffett in his investment. Phillips 66 is a diverse company. In addition to its massive refining business, the company also has large marketing and chemicals businesses. This diversification sets up the company to make money no matter what oil prices are doing. The company has spent considerable capital on several assets under construction, and we should see these investments start to translate into an increase in earnings during 2017. Another reason I love Phillips 66 going into 2017 is its potential to benefit from the incoming Trump administration during the coming years. Trump has pledged to help oil and gas companies by getting rid of excessive regulation and encouraging more drilling. An increase in production volume could be a positive catalyst for several aspects of Phillips 66's business. Finally, Phillips 66 has done a great job of returning capital to shareholders, a quality Buffett loves to see in his stocks. The company has bought back shares aggressively -- more than 10 million through the first three quarters of 2016, and a total of $7.2 billion in buyback spending since 2012. The stock also pays a strong 2.9% dividend yield, which it has increased in every year since its split from ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). PSX Dividend data by YCharts ","
      
    2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in January -- The Motley Fool

Kristine Harjes,01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. From celebrity deaths to shocking political news, people found plenty to complain about in 2016. Me, though? I actually had a really good year. I met some incredible people, had unbelievable adventures, and learned a ton. In the financial realm, I saved responsibly (even given the crazy-high D.C. cost of living) and added quality companies to my stock portfolio. Indeed, I'd say I pretty fully met my 2016 resolution to diversify. My next challenge -- and my resolution for 2017 -- is to take a smarter approach to finding stocks to buy by creating a watchlist. Going into 2016, my portfolio was overweight in healthcare and largely packed with higher-risk growth stocks. I resolved to achieve more balance by finding stocks outside of healthcare and established, dividend-paying stocks. Overall, I think I did pretty well. Over the course of the year, in addition to adding to prior holdings, I opened positions in the following stocks: I'd give myself a B rating for following my 2016 resolution. I did diversify pretty nicely, but I'm still missing exposure to financials -- particularly since I talked a big game this time last year about getting exposure to this industry. While I did purchase Wells Fargo, I never found a replacement financials stock after I sold off my position. As I write this, healthcare is still the sector with the most representation in my holdings -- but it was narrowly trailed by consumer goods until two late-year healthcare pops reinflated that section of my portfolio. In any case, with the exception of the gaping hole of financials, the various sectors are much more evenly represented than they were going into the year. And in hindsight, this resolution was pretty wise, as my non-healthcare buys buffered the stinging biotech losses I suffered in 2016. (The broader industry, as measured by the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: IBB), sank 19%.) In the past, my buying went something like this: I'd like to improve upon this process by forcing myself to be patient. I want to do my research ahead of time and come up with a list of companies that I like, along with the prices at which I'd buy in. Now, let me be very clear that I'm in no way using this list to try and time the market. I simply think I should have my research already done on a sizable list of intriguing companies before a buying opportunity presents itself. In particular, I'm looking to fill this list out with blue-chip Fool favorites like Coca-Cola, Procter and Gamble, General Motors, Chevron, Verizon Communications, and Microsoft. I know relatively little about the inner workings of these businesses, but I owe it to myself to do some research and figure out what I think is an attractive price for each of them. While I'm at it, I'm going to summarize my buy thesis for each, as well as some areas to watch. This organized, systematic approach takes some of the emotion out of investing, which is a huge advantage. When a stock hits my target price, and assuming nothing has changed about the business, I'll know I want to pick up shares for great reasons, rather than being temporarily excited about a company I just researched. Who knows what 2017 will bring, but I feel confident that building a watchlist will be the best financial move I can make. ","
      
    A Smart Approach to Portfolio Diversification: My 2017 Financial Resolution -- The Motley Fool

John Ballard,01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The mobile payment landscape is getting bigger. Major technology companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, along with big banks and credit card issuers, are jockeying for position in a fast growing market. As mobile payments adoption expands, the services that are easy to access and easy to use are in the best position to lead the race. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been leading the race for over ten years. Two competitors that could give PayPal a run for its money is a new peer to peer (P2P) payment service, ClearXchange, and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) own mobile payment service Apple Pay. Image source: Getty Images. ClearXchange is owned by Bank of America, BB&T, Capital One Financial, JP Morgan Chase, PNC Financial Services Group, U.S. Bancorp, and Wells Fargo. Some of the top banks in the world are already in the ClearXchange network and reach over 250 million people. It is the banks' response to the popularity and growth of PayPal's P2P payment service, Venmo, which is growing rapidly and is on pace to process about $20 billion in annual transaction volume over the next four quarters. ClearXchange offers a very straightforward and convenient service. All you need to send someone money is an email address or mobile phone number. The money is sent directly from the senders' bank account to the recipients'. Even if someone holds a bank account not included in the ClearXchange network, they can still sign up to receive payments. On top of the convenience of transferring money directly in and out of bank accounts, the service is fee free. However, Venmo is also free for all transaction types except credit cards. While the ability to directly transfer money to and from bank accounts is attractive, it's not clear whether ClearXchange differentiates itself enough to persuade Venmo's core users, millennials, to use it. One reason for the growth of Venmo is that it is not associated or owned by traditional financial institutions, an aspect that appeals to a younger generation. Both PayPal and Venmo users can still send money or pay for goods even if there is insufficient funds in their account balance, making these services as easy and convenient to use as ClearXchange. Perhaps a more significant elephant to battle against is Apple Pay. Since Apple Pay's launch in 2014, Apple has been quietly signing up banks and credit unions worldwide to allow credit and debit cards to be enrolled in Apple Pay. Recently, Apple added support for 17 more credit unions and banks bringing the total to over 1,600 worldwide. Although Apple doesn't disclose specific numbers, the service seems to be enjoying growing adoption. In 2016, CEO Tim Cook reported that 75% of all contactless payments in the U.S. were through Apple Pay.  Apple Pay transactions increased nearly 500% year over year in the most recent quarter. More transactions were completed in September 2016 than the entire fiscal 2015. Apple's major partners reported that Apple Pay has the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet, and management expects two-thirds of the top 100 retailers to support Apple Pay in 2017. Apple Pay was launched for the Safari web browser for the first time in September 2016, opening up another avenue for users to engage with the service. This success is not surprising. Apple is one of the most recognized brands in the world and has sold over one billion iPhones since the launch of the original in 2007, giving Apple a huge installed base. Of course, some of these purchases are upgrades for existing users, and some people may not even use an iPhone anymore. One analyst estimates the total installed base of Apple's iPhone is around 400 million. By comparison, PayPal had 192 million active customer accounts at the end of September 2016. Whatever the exact number for Apple's installed base, it's reasonable to assume Apple has a potential customer base that rivals PayPal's. The important distinction for Apple is its control over both hardware and software. Since Apple designs the hardware and software, it can control access to hardware components and software functionality inside an iPhone. Because of this closed system, only Apple can program software to access the Near Field Communication (NFC) chip inside iPhones and Apple Watches. The NFC chip in an iPhone 6 or later model connects wirelessly to a NFC chip reader in a retail store, for example, to share payment data. The NFC chip enables Apple Watch users to simply turn the crown or wave their wrist in the air, wait for a beep, and, voila, payment sent. Third-party app developers, such as PayPal, do not have the luxury of allowing its users to wave their wrists in the air to send payment. Although Apple does not disclose specific operating metrics for Apple Pay, the statistics CEO Tim Cook discloses on conference calls are enough to assume Apple's total payment volume (TPV) is growing along with the mobile payments industry. The good news for PayPal is that its own TPV has been growing consistently at 20% or more since the launch of Apple Pay. The parallel growth of these two services along with the continued growth of credit card issuers, Visa and MasterCard, highlights the size of the opportunity for all payment solutions. PayPal management puts the company's addressable market at $100 trillion. Over the last four quarters, PayPal's TPV is $336 billion, so there is a very long runway of growth, not only for PayPal, but its competitors as well. ","

John Maxfield,01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Bank of America's headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. In a recent interview on Bloomberg TV, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan brought up an interesting point that current and prospective investors in its stock should know. In response to David Weston's question about whether Bank of America will once again be a buyer of other banks, Moynihan noted that: It is actually illegal for us to buy another depositary institution in the United States. Not a lot of people know that. If you don't follow bank stocks you may find this perplexing. Why in the world would it be ""illegal"" for Bank of America to buy another bank? The answer lies in the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. The purpose of this legislation was to deregulate the bank industry by allowing federally chartered banks to branch across interstate lines. Prior to the 1980s, banks could operate only within a single state. The rationale for this dates back to the earliest days of the republic, when citizens and policymakers were concerned that the moneyed interests in New York would monopolize the bank industry, and therefore control who has access to credit. This began to change in the 1970s and 1980s, as state-chartered banks lobbied their legislatures for the right to open branches in neighboring states. The Riegle-Neal Act was the culmination of this trend. But even though the Riegle-Neal Act opened up the ability for federally charted banks to operate across interstate lines, it nevertheless imposed a ceiling on how large banks could get. It did so by restricting banks with more than 10% of the nation's deposits from acquiring other depositary institutions. To Moynihan's point, this is why it's illegal for Bank of America to acquire other banks, as it already controls just under 11% of domestic deposits in the United States. Data source: FDIC's Statistics on Depository Institutions. Chart by author. On one hand, this isn't a good thing. After all, one of the most effective ways for a bank to grow is through prudently priced acquisitions. It's one of the main reasons that M&T Bank has produced Warren Buffett-like returns over the past three decades. On the other hand, Bank of America has demonstrated in the past that it lacks the institutional discipline that's required to make prudent acquisitions. Instead of waiting for a down cycle, when banks can be bought for large discounts to their book values, Bank of America has tended to pay substantial premiums for its acquisitions, as it did with its purchases of FleetBoston Financial and Chicago's LaSalle Bank. Either way, though, it's probably safe to say that Bank of America wouldn't be in the market for an acquisition anytime soon anyhow, as it's been more focused on retreating and retrenching over the past six years as opposed to growing.

Image source: The Motley Fool. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), the conglomerate headed by Warren Buffett, delivered great returns for investors in 2016, even when compared with Berkshire's own stellar track record of performance. BRK.A data by YCharts. If you look a little closer at the chart, you'll notice that the majority of Berkshire's gains took place in the latter part of the year -- specifically, after Donald Trump was elected president. Being that Buffett was an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter, the cause of the increase is quite ironic, but there are a few reasons Berkshire was a big beneficiary of the ""Trump rally."" For one thing, many of Berkshire's businesses should benefit tremendously if Trump sticks to his plan of lowering regulation on businesses. Specifically, Berkshire's insurance operations, such as GEICO, could find it much easier to do business. Additionally, Trump's pro-growth policies are expected to cause a rise in interest rates, and since insurance businesses make most of their profits from investments, this could translate into billions of dollars in additional profit for Berkshire. After all, the company has about $85 billion in cash on its balance sheet, so even a small increase in rates could be big news. Furthermore, several other Berkshire businesses could be helped by Trump's plan to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure over the next decade. Just to name a few examples, BNSF Railway, Acme Brick, and Benjamin Moore (paints) could see revenue climb faster than expected. Finally, many of the factors that could help Berkshire's subsidiaries also can (and already have) boost the company's massive stock portfolio. For instance, Berkshire has large positions in several bank stocks, such as Wells Fargo and Bank of America, and the entire banking sector could be in a much-better environment to profit under Trump. The bottom line is that while the Donald Trump presidency won't necessarily help all of Berkshire's subsidiaries and stock investments (to name one example, Trump's trade policies could potentially hurt Berkshire's Apple investment), it should certainly help more of them than it hurts. If President-elect Trump actually follows through with his promises, Berkshire's strong performance could continue in the years ahead. ","

                                    still allow cosigners. Discontinuing the practice of allowing cosigners isn’t good news for consumers in many cases, credit card experts have said. Allowing authorized users does provide some of the conveniences that allowing a cosigner does, since it gives another person the ability to spend on the same credit account. However, while opening one’s own account alone or with a cosigner helps an individual build credit, an authorized user doesn’t build as much, Ethan Dornhelm, the senior director of scores and analytics at Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) previously told MarketWatch. “Adding someone won’t hurt,” he said, “it’s just not likely to make nearly as substantive a difference.” (Plus, not every card issuer reports authorized users’ activity to credit bureaus, according to Discover’s website. And those that do may not report it in exactly the same way.) Ditching cosigners may also be detrimental for couples attempting to split all finances equally, since the “authorized user” relationship (which many couples turn to instead) gives one party more power and responsibility, said Sean McQuay, a credit card expert at the personal-finance company NerdWallet. “The authorized user is more of a parent/child relationship,” he said; even if one partner allows the other to be an authorized user, one person is still the primary account holder, which can be “detrimental to building confidence and management skills” for the other party, McQuay said. Plus, as an authorized user, a partner in theory would be able to run up a credit card bill and then accept no responsibility for paying it since his or her credit score would remain unaffected, Schulz said. On the other hand, parents or others who would rather not be cosigners on accounts may view the discontinued practice as a good thing, Schulz said; cosigners are taking the risk that the applicant they are cosigning for will pay his or her bill responsibly, as to not damage the co-signer’s credit. Eliminating the option of cosigners may take away that risk and responsibility. There are other ways for those with thin credit histories to build credit, McQuay and Schulz said. The Credit CARD Act, which U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law in 2009, made it more difficult for consumers under age 21 to get credit cards; they either needed a cosigner or proof of income. Secured credit cards are a good option instead of cosigned accounts because they work similarly to debit cards, requiring an initial deposit and not allowing the user to go over that limit. But unlike debit cards, use is reported to credit reporting agencies and allows the user to build credit. This should be a short-term option, though, Schulz said; credit utilization ratio, or the amount of one’s available credit that is used, also is a component of credit scoring. Because the utilization of secured cards tends to be high, consumers should strive to use them for about nine months to a year and then upgrade to a traditional credit card with more desirable terms, he said. In addition to Bank of America and U.S. Bank, there may also be local banks or credit unions that still offer the option of a cosigner, McQuay said, so consumers may benefit from looking there. Most important, consumers should pay their bills (whether they are for a secured credit card or not) on time and in full. “The key to credit is to only spend money you have. In essence, treat your credit cards just like cash or a debit card,” Sandra Bernardo, the credit agency Experian’s manager of consumer education previously told MarketWatch.

Lisa Schwartz,01122017,MarketWatch,01052017,"Published: Jan 6, 2017 8:25 a.m. ET Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan Chase, BlackRock and Vanguard are among the institutions that own portions of Trump businesses’ securitized debt By The debts of President-elect Donald Trump and his businesses are scattered across Wall Street banks, mutual funds and other financial institutions, broadening the tangle of interests that pose potential conflicts for the incoming president’s administration. Hundreds of millions of dollars of debt attached to Trump’s properties, some of them backed by Trump’s personal guarantee, were packaged into securities and sold to investors over the past five years, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of legal and property documents. Trump has previously disclosed that his businesses owe at least $315 million to 10 companies. According to the Journal’s analysis, Trump businesses’ debts are held by more than 150 institutions. They bought the debt after it was sliced up and repackaged into bonds—a process known as securitization, which has been used for more than $1 billion of debt connected to Trump’s companies. As a result, a broader array of financial institutions now are in a potentially powerful position over the incoming president. If the Trump businesses were to default on their debts, the giant financial institutions that serve as so-called special servicers of these loan pools would have the power to foreclose on some of Trump’s marquee properties or seek the tens of millions of dollars that Trump personally guaranteed on the loans.

                                    up against record levels and prompting a massive rally over the past 60 days or so on the heels of the 2016 presidential election. Of course, optimism is a funny thing. There is a biological imperative in optimism that helps push us toward the future rather than live in the past and despair, but being overly hopeful leaves us open to being unrealistic about our chances of future success. This “optimism bias” is a common cause of pain among traders, especially those who take risky bets without acknowledging the true odds of recording a big loss. In other words, then, all those animal spirits may come into 2017 like a lion and wind up leaving like a lamb. But for now, optimism is strong across various segments of the market and the U.S. economy. Here are nine areas where hopes are running high as we enter the new year: Investors: According to a recent Wells Fargo/Gallup poll, individual investor optimism hit a nine-year high in November and marked the third straight quarter of improving sentiment. Furthermore, the surge to a reading of 96 was up 17 points from a reading of 79 in the prior quarter, and was a hair away from pre-financial crisis levels. Family finances: Americans are more optimistic about how their family finances will fare in 2017 compared with a similar survey five years ago, according to a recent New York Life survey of 1,800 adults ages 30 or older,. Specifically, 43% are optimistic about the new year vs. just 31% of those surveyed in 2011 about their hopes for the following 12 months. Also, 34% planned to spend more on big purchases like home improvements or appliances — double the reading of just 17% who planned to increase spending going into 2012. Jobs: The Employer Associations of America released its 2017 National Business Trends Survey recently, and it showed 48% of employers plan on increasing staffing — and that’s after 32% hired more than they expected to in 2016. Looking forward, 89% expect overall business results to be the same or better in 2017 compared with 2016, which is bolstering their staffing plans. Consumers: The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index rose to 113.7 in December, topping estimates and hitting the highest level since August 2001. That would be impressive enough if it didn’t come on the heels of previously strong data, including an upward revision to November numbers. Manufacturing: The latest manufacturing report from the Institute for Supply Management showed continued expansion in the sector. But of particular note was a big surge in purchases, with the report showing the new orders index hit 60.2% — a big increase of 7.2 percentage points from November. That, coupled with positive forward-looking comments, seems to show a rosy outlook for manufacturers in the new year. Materials: The American Chemistry Council’s Chemical Activity Barometer just ended the year with a year-over-year increase of 4.4% — the strongest pace of expansion since 2010. All four core categories for the index improved in December, which is notable given that “the chemical industry has been found to consistently lead the U.S. economy’s business cycle given its early position in the supply chain,” according to the ACC. Housing: The National Association of Home Builders said builder confidence in December surged to an 11-year high. Furthermore, the reading of 70 obliterated forecasts of just 63 for the optimism index. At the same time, prospective home buyers were getting more optimistic as more people entered the market looking for a house, according to the NAHB. Small businesses: The National Federation of Independent Businesses’ Small Business Optimism Index climbed to 98.4 after Election Day, only the third time it’s been above the long-term average since 2007. Most tellingly, the biggest surge in optimism was recorded in the reading of those business owners who “expect the economy to improve” — followed closely by the category of those who “expect higher real sales volume” in the future. Small businesses, again: The Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index poll showed the highest rate of optimism in eight years in 2016’s fourth quarter. It wasn’t a small bump, either: The overall index surged from a reading of 68 in the third quarter to 80 in the latest reading. The details show 58% of small-business owners surveyed expect revenue to increase in the next 12 months, 35% plan to increase capital spending and 36% expect to hire new workers.

Dana Mattioli,01122017,MarketWatch,01052017,"Published: Jan 10, 2017 2:27 p.m. ET By Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. reached deals to sell $2.1 billion in assets, the struggling drug company's biggest moves yet to refocus around its consumer offerings and pare its heavy debt load. The Canadian company agreed to sell three skin-care brands, including its CeraVe line, to French cosmetics giant L'Oréal SA for $1.3 billion. It also said it would sell its Dendreon cancer business to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower for $820 million. The asset sales are part of Valeant Chief Executive Joseph Papa's efforts to sharpen the company's focus on its key franchises in skin drugs, stomach treatments, eye care and consumer health while selling noncore assets to pay down its roughly $30 billion in debt. Later Tuesday, Mr. Papa will speak at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, where analysts and investors are anticipating updates on his vision for Valeant. The former Perrigo Co. CEO joined Valeant in May to help restore battered investor confidence. Valeant's stock has collapsed since late 2015, when an accounting issue raised questions about its earnings and spurred a crisis of confidence in management. The company's backers have consistently argued the stock market has ignored the value of the underlying businesses, while its detractors have focused on the company's debt and slumping earnings. The stock rose around 5.1% to $16.13 early Tuesday afternoon, but it is still down 82% over the past 12 months and is well below the all-time highs above $260 set in August 2015. Valeant's deal announcements eased concerns that the company would have to sell assets at fire-sale prices. It purchased CeraVe in 2008 for $95 million and bought Dendreon out of bankruptcy in 2015 for about $500 million. ""Some good news finally,"" Evercore analyst Umer Raffat headlined his note on the sales, saying the reduced revenue would mostly be offset by the lower debt payments. In a Tuesday note, Wells Fargo & Co. analyst David Maris noted that the proceeds from the sales wouldn't fully cover the $3.8 billion in debt Valeant has coming due by the end of 2018. Valeant has put a number of assets on the auction block but has struggled to strike deals at acceptable prices. It came close but ultimately failed to seal a deal to sell stomach-drug maker Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. to Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. for $10 billion. It is also exploring a sale of its Bausch & Lomb surgical equipment business, which could fetch $2.5 billion, people familiar with the matter have said. Dendreon is known for prostate-cancer treatment Provenge. The acquisition was Valeant's first big transaction after losing a hostile bid in 2014 for Botox maker Allergan, which went instead to Actavis PLC for about $67 billion. Valeant wasn't a big player in cancer treatments, and Provenge proved a disappointing fit. Provenge had $300 million in sales the year before the acquisition; it isn't clear what revenue has been more recently. The CeraVe brand includes cleansers, moisturizers and healing ointments. The other brands -- AcneFree and Ambi -- encompass a range of acne treatments. L'Oréal, one of the world's leading cosmetics suppliers, said the three have combined revenue of around $168 million a year. For L'Oréal, the deal will expand its U.S. presence and add to its offerings that cross between skin treatments and beauty products. Skin care is now the beauty industry's largest category, accounting for a quarter of the market, but growth has begun to cool in recent years. --Nick Kostov contributed to this article.

,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"“We’ve accomplished a lot over the past few months but we still have a lot of work to do ... to rebuild trust with our customers, team members, and other key stakeholders,” CEO Tim Sloan said during a call with analysts. The San Francisco-based bank has been dealing with multiple lawsuits and a sharp drop in account openings after it settled with the Los Angeles City Attorney, the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in September over charges that its employees created as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ consent. Chief Executive Sloan - who took over after John Stumpf resigned in the wake of the scandal - said he was pleased with the progress the bank has made in customer remediation, as well as its ongoing review of sales practices across the company. Wells Fargo’s net income applicable to shareholders fell 6.4 percent to $4.87 billion, or 96 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $5.20 billion, or $1.00 per share, a year earlier. It said it has made $3.2 million of refunds for potentially unauthorized accounts that incurred fees and charges, which it believes fulfills its repayment requirements under the settlement to the L.A. City Attorney. But L.A. City Attorney Mike Feuer said it was “too soon to say that all affected Wells Fargo customers have been made whole.” He noted that, under the settlement, the bank is required to offer mediation to customers who feel they have not been made completely whole until September 2018. It could not be determined whether the bank has reimbursement requirements under the other two settlements. A spokesman for Wells Fargo had no immediate response. The bank agreed in September to pay $185 million in penalties and up to $5 million to customers who, regulators say, were pushed into fee-generating accounts they never requested. Wells Fargo also said it is still analyzing whether additional unauthorized accounts were opened in 2009 and 2010, which goes beyond its requirements under the settlement. The bank also said that more than 177,000 accounts that had potentially unauthorized credit cards opened, or unauthorized inquiries made, had credit score declines. The scandal hammered Wells Fargo’s stock for roughly two months. It also forced the bank to change its compensation plan and scrap sales targets in order to emphasize customer service. The bank is still conducting other internal inquiries to determine who else may be responsible for the sales problems, and has said it will make amends in various ways, from compensating customers whose credit scores may have been harmed to welcoming back employees who may have been fired for the wrong reasons. Wells Fargo’s non-interest expenses rose 4.9 percent to $13.22 billion, reflecting higher legal costs. “Our key conclusion is that legal and remediation costs are likely to undermine asset growth, creating downside risk,” Guggenheim Securities analyst Eric Wasserstrom wrote in a research note. Like other U.S. bank stocks, Wells Fargo’s shares have risen sharply since the election of Donald Trump. The bank’s shares were up 1 percent at $55.07 Friday, well above their low of $43.55 in the aftermath of the settlement announcement. ","

 ,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has agreed to pay $55 million to  settle a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit accusing it of discriminating against minority borrowers by allowing mortgage brokers to charge them more for home loans, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The U.S. Justice Department complaint, filed in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, accused the bank of willfully violating the U.S. Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act between 2006 and 2009 and showing “reckless disregard” for the rights of at least 53,000 African-American and Hispanic borrowers. “We’ve agreed to settle these legacy allegations that relate to pricing set by independent brokers,” JPMorgan spokeswoman Elizabeth Seymour said. “We deny any wrongdoing and remain committed to providing equal access to credit.” A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara had no immediate comment. The alleged discrimination involved so-called wholesale loans that were made through mortgage brokers the bank used to help originate loans, the complaint said. Chase allowed brokers to change rates charged for loans from those initially set based on objective credit-related factors, the complaint said. As a result of that discretion, minorities were charged more for home loans than white borrowers with the same credit profile, paying tens of millions of dollars in additional mortgage costs, the complaint said. An African-American taking out a $191,100 loan on average paid $1,126 more over the first five years of the loan than a white borrower. An Hispanic borrower with a $236,800 loan paid on average $968 more than a non-Hispanic white borrower, the complaint said. Chase did not require mortgage brokers to document the reasons for changing rates and failed to address racial discrimination, encouraging it to continue, the complaint said. The Justice Department has been pursuing a number of banks over alleged discrimination. From 2010 to 2014, the agency’s Civil Rights Division obtained more than $1.4 billion in relief under fair housing laws, according to an August report. In one case, Wells Fargo & Co agreed to pay $175 million to settle allegations that it charged African American and Hispanic borrowers higher rates and fees on mortgages. Cities around the country, including Miami, Baltimore and Los Angeles, also have filed lawsuits claiming that major banks targeted minorities for high-cost loans that often ended in foreclosures. The bank first disclosed Bharara’s lawsuit in a quarterly filing in 2015. ","

 ,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"(Reuters) - Christopher Bandas of the Bandas Law Firm has had enough of class action lawyers sullying his name. “I just can’t bite my tongue anymore,” Bandas told me Tuesday, in the first interview he has granted to me. “I’ve seen too much scurrilous stuff coming from class counsel.” If you follow class actions, you’ve probably heard of Bandas. He’s one of the most famous of the lawyers who regularly represent objectors to class action settlements, and perhaps the most notorious bane of the plaintiffs’ class action bar, which often accuses Bandas of filing ill-founded objections to proposed class action settlements, then demanding big-money payments to clear those obstacles. Last month, for instance, the plaintiffs' firm Edelson went so far as to sue Bandas for racketeering, alleging that he demanded at least $225,000 to drop an objection to Edelson’s $13.8 million settlement of a robocalling class action against Gannett. Bandas said the Edelson complaint was “wrong on the law (and) patently frivolous….No court in the country has ever supported (Edelson’s) very specious position.” Now the class action firm Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein has claimed that Bandas violated a Georgia law against representing a client without court authorization. In a brief filed Monday in federal court in Atlanta, Lieff asserted that Bandas contracted to provide a panoply of services to Wanda Yde in connection with Yde’s objection to a proposed $16.4 million Telephone Consumer Protection Act settlement with Wells Fargo but deceptively portrayed Yde as a pro se objector. Yde’s objection explicitly disclosed that she is represented by Bandas and that he advised her on the pro se filing, which challenges class counsel’s request for nearly $5 million in fees and costs. But according to Lieff Cabraser, which is class counsel in the Wells case, the objector’s disclosure didn’t adequately reveal the broad scope of Bandas’ agreement with Yde, which, for example, gave Bandas control over appellate decisions about the case. Moreover, Lieff’s brief said, Bandas had a motive to downplay his involvement: Yde herself is a former employee at Bandas’ firm and her mother is Bandas’ longtime legal assistant. According to Lieff Cabraser, Yde’s testimony at a Jan. 14 deposition revealed that she hardly even reviewed her contract with Bandas or the objection his firm prepared on her behalf, placing trust in her mother and former employer. Bandas’ retainer agreement with Yde, which Lieff filed as an exhibit to the transcript of Yde’s deposition, includes a provision restricting Yde’s incentive award or payment to $5,000. Yde’s personal ties to Bandas, as well as the “carte blanche authority” she granted him in her retainer agreement, “suggest that she is merely an instrument of Bandas’ purposes, not someone objecting in her own right,” Lieff Cabraser’s filing said. Bandas’ failure to sign Yde’s objection and acknowledge his role is “a transparent, calculated tactic to evade this Court’s jurisdiction.” Lieff’s brief was filed as a reply in support of the firm’s motion to strike Yde’s objection. At a hearing Tuesday on final approval for the TCPA settlement, the firm said it would withdraw the motion to strike in light of Bandas’ application for admission pro hac vice in the Wells case. Bandas’ lawyer, Jerome Froelich of McKenney & Froelich, said the flap is “over for now.” I do, however, expect Lieff to refile its allegations against Bandas in a different form, perhaps a show cause order. Bandas told me he has come to expect to be lacerated by class counsel. Lieff, in particular, “likes to throw a lot of mud against the wall, then, when they see we’re right, walk away,” Bandas said. He and Froelich said Bandas is on high ground in the Wells Fargo case. Despite Lieff Cabraser’s deployment of the word “ghostwriting” to describe Bandas’ role in drafting Yde’s objection, the filing clearly says Bandas is Yde’s counsel. In his response to Lieff Cabraser’s original motion to strike Yde’s objection, Bandas and his lawyer cited a 2007 American Bar Association ethics opinion and Georgia precedent allowing lawyers to counsel pro se plaintiffs as long as the lawyers reveal their involvement, which Bandas did. “When you disclose your involvement, it’s the antithesis of ghostwriting,” Bandas said. I asked why he didn’t just sign Yde’s original objection and request pro hac vice admission. Bandas said he would have had to find local counsel to do so and didn’t want to incur expenses for Yde. What about the retainer contract provision limiting the objector’s payment to $5,000? Plaintiffs’ lawyers from Lieff, Edelson and the Competitive Enterprise Institute have previously claimed Bandas requests hundreds of thousands of dollars to drop objections and allow class actions to conclude. Bandas said he cannot comment on previous settlements but set the potential award for Yde at $5,000 because that is considered a reasonable incentive for class representatives. In the Wells case, he pointed out, class reps have requested $20,000 apiece. Bandas said class counsel accounts of his conduct shouldn’t be trusted. He said, for instance, that in the class action at the heart of the Edelson racketeering suit, it was Edelson – and not Bandas – that pushed for a settlement of his objection. “That’s how they do it – they approach us with money and then they change the narrative,” Bandas said. “I assure you that almost everything you hear from class counsel is skewed to their advantage.” Bandas said he’s a big backer of a proposed change in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that would require judges to sign off on class counsel payments to objectors or their lawyers. If the rule change is adopted, Bandas said, class counsel won’t be able to accuse him of attempting to extract payments in exchange for dropping objections. “This will let the court know when they try to throw money at a problem,” Bandas said.

 ,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender, said earnings rose to $6.7 billion, or $1.71 per share, from $5.4 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding an atypical tax benefit, the bank earned $1.58 per share, well above the average analyst estimate of $1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan has one of the largest global investment banks, which affects its earnings significantly when market activity picks up or declines. Along with other big banks, it was widely expected to benefit from a wave of trading in stocks and bonds following Donald Trump’s stunning victory in the presidential election on Nov. 8. In a statement discussing results, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon cited those market trends, as well as growth in deposits and loans, higher credit card sales and competitive gains in “virtually all” of JPMorgan’s businesses. The bank also kept a tight lid on expenses, he said. JPMorgan’s shares were little changed in premarket trading. Like other banks, its stock has seen big gains since the election on expectations that Trump’s plans to cut taxes, ease regulations and boost infrastructure spending will help profits. JPMorgan’s stock had risen 23 percent from the election through Thursday’s close. Looking ahead, big banks are expected to benefit this year from rising interest rates, which allow them to charge more money for loans. The Federal Reserve, which raised a key rate target by a quarter of a percentage point in December, is expected to raise them again three times in 2017. JPMorgan said its net interest income rose 5 percent during the fourth quarter to $12.1 billion, thanks to an uptick in rates, as well as more lending. The bank’s total net revenue rose 2.5 percent to $24.33 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $23.95 billion. ","

 ,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"(Reuters) - The S&P 500 rose on Friday after major U.S. banks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with strong results, helping fuel confidence about a recent market rally. Wall Street has surged since President-elect Trump’s unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at valuations well above historic averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo was 1.04-percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.43 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500’s 6.1 percent rise. “Earnings are key going forward, and we’re off to a decent start,” said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. Trading volumes were light ahead of a three-day weekend. At 2:42 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 0.14 percent at 19,863.26 points, while the S&P 500 .SPX had gained 0.10 percent to 2,272.67. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.39 percent to 5,569.18. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We’ve come a long way very quickly so there’s scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive,” said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.49-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.06-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

 ,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"(Reuters) - ClubCorp Holdings Inc MYCC.N, one of the largest owners and operators of private golf and country clubs in the United States, said on Thursday it was exploring strategic alternatives after Reuters reported the company was in a process to sell itself. ClubCorp is in the early stages of an auction process that has attracted the interest of potential buyers that include private equity firms, people familiar with the matter said earlier on Thursday. ClubCorp said it has formed a committee made up of independent board directors to carry out the review of its options. KSL Capital, a private equity firm, bought ClubCorp for $1.8 billion in October 2006 and took it public in 2013. ClubCorp shares were trading up 13 percent at $17 in afternoon trading in New York on Thursday, giving the company a market capitalization of around $1.1 billion. ClubCorp, founded in 1957, operates more than 200 properties, including golf and country clubs, business clubs and sports clubs across the U.S., Mexico and China. It is a serial acquirer in the golf course industry, buying 12 new clubs in 2015 and 2016. It looks to buy locally-owned golf courses and then refurbish them by adding or improving amenities such as up-scale dining and event rooms. “It is obvious to us that ClubCorp’s reinvention capital expenditures are transformative in nature and are in no shape or form ‘maintenance,’” the letter wrote. FrontFour also suggested ClubCorp, which owns the land for a large number of its properties, consider converting its real estate into a real estate investment trust (REIT). REIT structures help reduce the tax burden on rental income and can benefit shareholders through the significant distribution of profit as dividend.

 ,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Is your money vice too many movies? A costly dry cleaning habit? Too much wine? It is time to look at the year-end spending summary available from your bank or credit card issuer - or a tracking service like Mint.com - to get a reality check that could help you make better choices in 2017. For Barak Kassar, a 50-year-old businessman in San Francisco, it was Uber that broke the bank in 2016. He plans on trimming off at least $200 this year. “I have taken a few rides out of laziness, when taking a bike or public transport would be far less expensive,” Kassar said. For Lyn Alden, a 29-year-old financial analyst based in Atlantic City, New Jersey, it was Chipotle, where she had spent more than $1,000 in a year. “It’s amazing how a simple work lunch habit that flies under the radar can add up to such a large sum,” Alden said. Most financial institutions have revelatory spending information available on-demand throughout the year, which can be downloaded and sliced and diced at will. But that can be a lot to ask. Here’s how to get the most out of those once-a-year pie charts: 1. Make yourself look Just saying you want to spend less on a particular category tends to lead to failure. People are notoriously bad at estimating their spending, according to Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, known as the Money Coach (askthemoneycoach.com/). In more than a decade of coaching clients, Khalfani-Cox has yet to find one who can correctly guess their monthly spending. “If they say they spend $5,000 a month, I automatically assume it is $6,000,” she said. On most spending-tracking services, users can customize their views and make their categories as specific as they need, but the important thing is to look at the big picture and compare categories, said Kimmie Greene, a consumer financial expert with Mint, a unit of Intuit Inc. Those pie charts will make it apparent where efforts to reduce spending would make sense, and when it would not impact the bottom line so much. “Is there one big thing that could divert your debt? Do you want to cut the cable cord? Do you want to get rid of your car?” Greene said. “If you just say you’re never going to eat lunch out again, that’s just not so realistic.” 2. Pluck the low-hanging fruit The easiest way to save money is not necessarily cutting that morning coffee: It is simply paying your bills on time and not overdrafting your bank account. Mint.com has found the average person spends $75 a month in credit card fees - $900 a year - which includes late fees, finance charges and yearly service fees. Add to that $48 a month in bank fees for things like overdrafts, ATM fees, low balance charges and the like. “Most of the people who missed a credit card payment actually have the money, but life got the better of them for one reason or another,” Greene said. Some services like Mint will push out notices to users when a fee is paid, but sometimes it is only when it is all added up in a yearly tally that it gets their attention. “They say, “Oh wow, I didn’t realize my bank took $996 of my money last year,” Greene said. “It’s like the $35 notice pops up, but it doesn’t hit home.” Wells Fargo’s pilot phone consultation program reached over 10,000 people in the last year. The consultant looks up the customer’s bank records and has an extensive conversation about goals and habits and try to help come up with small tasks to try. “We publish lots of information, we give them things to read and give them tools, but helping people form the daily habits, that’s what we’re really focused on right now,” said Brett Pitts, head of digital at Wells Fargo. 3. Reduce your tax burden Your spending report has the added bonus of being a tax preparation aid. Use the information to look for any tax-deductible spending, advised Khalfani-Cox. In particular, look for charitable deductions you might have forgotten about and medical expenses. “About seven out of 10 people do not itemize, and that’s a huge mistake,” Khalfani-Cox said. ","

 ,01192017,Investopedia,01122017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Fintech, which has already disrupted the payments, banking and financial advisory markets, is beginning to enter the $14 trillion mortgage market. Given the growing popularity of digital financial solutions, there appears to be a demand for electronic mortgage solutions among home buyers and sellers alike. The U.S. mortgage market has been dominated by several major players with Wells Fargo at the top and JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and US Bank not far behind, according to Daily Fintech. But since the 2008 mortgage meltdown, the industry has been upended. Non-bank mortgage lending is expanding as commercial banking declines. In fact, mortgage lending by type of institution shifted dramatically between 2007 and 2014. Recently, commercial banks provided 52% of mortgage lending, down from 74% in 2007. In 2014, mortgage lending by non-banks almost doubled to 43% from 23% in 2007. (For more, see: 7 Things That Will Shape the Future of Fintech.) Where is that growth coming from? Here's how fintech is gradually entering the mortgage lending market. Radius Financial Group cracked the fully paperless mortgage code in 2016. The firm, along with help from DocMagic, the MERS loan registry, Fannie Mae and Santander Bank closed six loans without paper documents. Radius used DocMagic and the MERS loan registry to handle distinct parts of the process, showing the potential for automation in document preparation and loan tracking. Electronic closings and e-notes aren’t new, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have bought e-mortgages since the turn of this century. Yet, the problem with these types of transactions is that few warehouse lenders can purchase electronic mortgages, according to a recent National Mortgage News article. This drawback is likely to change as more companies enter the electronic mortgage market. (For more, see: Fintechs' Expansion Will Shatter the Status Quo.) Clara, a California startup, aims to solve some of the mortgage problems that plague consumers seeking to buy a home. Founded by engineer Lukasz Strozek and Jeff Foster, a former policy advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, Clara strives to smooth out the inefficiencies that accompany the mortgage lending industry. Clara differentiates itself by educating borrowers and offering an online portal for completing paperwork. The firm also maintains that its rates are lower than competitors. Lenda, a home-loan provider, also offers a digital mortgage solution. Other digital mortgage lending services include Quicken Loans' Rocket Mortgage. Then there’s SoFi, the fintech firm known for student and personal loan services, which is also gaining ground in the digital mortgage lending sphere. (For more, see: How Tech Startup SoFi Plans to Disrupt the Banking Industry.) A recent JD Power survey found that 62% of respondents under 35 who bought a home this year stated that they’d use a mobile app to complete a mortgage application, if available from their lender. And 20% of buyers of all ages weren’t happy with their lender, providing further support that there is demand for a new type of mortgage service. It is likely that there will be more automation within the mortgage lending industry going forward – either full service start to finish solutions or companies expediting a part of the process through automation. Mortgages are composed of many moving parts, from the loan application and approval process, to appraisals, completing and verifying borrowers' credit and loan application, as well as completing and signing the final paperwork. In the end, like so many other aspects of finance that fintech has taken on, there’s room for automation. Reducing time, fees and face-to-face contact are an allure for the fintech mortgage market. Ultimately, this new frontier seems to be gaining traction with innovators and disrupters. (For related reading, see: What Does Trump Mean for the Fintech Market?)

Jeff Cox,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"Wells Fargo posted fourth-quarter earnings Friday that missed on the top and bottom lines. Shares rose, though, as the company CEO promised to keep working to restore the scandal-plagued company's image. The San Francisco-based institution saw profit of 96 cents per share against estimates of $1 from analysts surveyed by Reuters. That represented a 6.8 percent decline from $1.03 per share from the same period in 2015. Revenue was $21.58 billion against Wall Street estimates of $22.451 billion. The bank is coming off one of the most difficult years in its 165-year history. Regulators fined Wells Fargo in 2016 for creating false accounts for some 2 million customers. In addition to the scandal, which involved a process known as cross-selling, the bank also failed its ""living will"" test with the Fed. Company CEO Tim Sloan said the company continues to work to rehabilitate its image. ""We are leaving no stone unturned so that we can emerge from this a better, stronger company,"" Sloan said on a conference call with analysts. Among the big changes the company has outlined and Sloan discussed Friday: Raising the fee reimbursement level to customers from $2.6 million to $3.2 million and raising the minimum wage for employees to up to $17. The company also has eliminated individual sales goals in favor of store-wide standards. ""We want to identify anyone who was negatively impacted so we can make things right,"" he said. Bank stocks in general received a postelection boost but have struggled lately. Wells shares have fallen 1.1 percent in 2017. Net interest margin for Wells grew to 2.87 percent, just ahead of Wall Street expectations. The bank attributed the gain to growth in loans, investment securities and trading assets, as well as help from higher interest rates. Following June's Brexit vote, rates have been on a steadily higher trajectory, benefiting financial institutions. Return on equity also was solid at 11.49 percent compared to the 10 percent cost of capital benchmark. The bank reported $12.5 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.

Evelyn Cheng,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"Banks will need to prove in their quarterly results that they've justified their stocks' massive post-election gains. ""The market has rewarded the stocks very well in the fourth quarter,"" said Ken Leon, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. ""The question is, can they really catch up with the euphoria of having a Trump administration?"" The fourth-quarter reporting season kicks off in earnest Friday with results from BlackRock, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs report early next week after Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The bank stocks are a key part of the U.S. market's rally to record highs. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) has shot up more than 24 percent since the election, while the broader financials sector is up 17 percent as the top performer in the S&P 500 over that time. As a result, expectations are generally elevated. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said in a Wednesday note that most of the large banks it covers should beat consensus earnings estimates. That's despite a history of fourth-quarter numbers disappointing, Goldberg said. ""I don't think there's a lot of room for shortfall, assuming we don't get a surprise,"" said Devin Ryan, analyst at JMP Securities. ""We're going to be focusing more on incremental comments from management that suggest the backdrop is changing."" Investors may not hear as much optimism on potential political changes as they would like. While the bank stocks have rallied early this year to highs not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, not many expect the complete repeal of the post-crisis Dodd-Frank legislation as Trump has promised. ""They're probably going to be slower than maybe the market has anticipated. We don't view financial regulation as a top priority for the new administration,"" said Shannon Stemm, financial services analyst at Edward Jones. In his first news conference since the election Wednesday, Trump did not discuss tax reform or deregulation. Wells Fargo will take its own place in the spotlight for its second earnings report since a phony bank accounts scandal came to light. Friday's report will mark the first full quarter with Tim Sloan as president and CEO, after the abrupt departure of John Stumpf as chairman and CEO just days before Wells Fargo's third-quarter report in October.

Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"Several companies in the Dow Jones industrial average have had a rough start to the new year. Nearly one-fifth of the index has been downgraded since Jan 3., including Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Goldman Sachs, Exxon Mobil, McDonald's and Disney. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs downgraded staples brands Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble from neutral to sell ratings in two reports, citing a stronger U.S. dollar for one and the price-earnings ratio for the other. Shares of both fell about 1 percent on the day the report came out. Exxon was downgraded to market perform from outperform at Wells Fargo, citing a closed window for an acquisition. McDonald's was downgraded on slowing sales, while Disney was lowered by Pivotal from hold to sell to account for changes in earnings expectations and changing political risks. And Citi downgraded Goldman to sell from neutral in a valuation call after the recent runup for the financials group. Despite the downgrades this month, the Dow has come within a third of a point of hitting the psychological mark of 20,000.

Bertha Coombs,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"UnitedHealth Group was one of the first insurers to raise a red flag about losses on Obamacare plans, and as the expected repeal of the health-reform law proceeds under the incoming Trump administration, CEO Stephen Hemsley said his firm is well-positioned to handle new policy changes that come out of Washington. ""We think we have been developing the kind of assets and capabilities to serve a health-care system, and can accommodate a variety of approaches,"" Hemsley told analysts on the company's fourth-quarter earnings conference call, adding ""that has been our narrative with the policy community."" When asked whether he'd been in touch with President-elect Donald Trump, Hemsley would only say that at this point the company's contact had been at ""a high level"" and that it will continue to advance ""a simpler, state-based health-care system,"" which presumably means undoing much of the complexity imposed by the Affordable Care Act. UnitedHealth's profits in the fourth quarter exceeded analyst expectations. The health insurance and services giant posted earnings of $2.11 per share, compared to a Thomson First Call estimate of $2.07 per share, on revenue of $47.52 billion. Profits rose more than 50 percent from a year ago, when the company took a charge for losses on Obamacare exchange plans. The company does not expect exchange plans to impact results in 2017. The Optum health services division continues to power the company's overall growth. Full year 2016 revenue rose 24 percent from year ago, despite a decline in its OptumRX pharmacy benefits management unit, while profits were up more than 32 percent. The company said it plans to expand its medical services business to help gain better control on its insurance members' health-care costs. OptumCare is now providing medical care in more than two dozen markets, and the recent $2.3 billion deal to acquire Surgical Care Affiliates will help give it greater scale by increasing its medical care footprint to another 17 markets. UnitedHealth is also a growing player in the market for health savings accounts, through Optum Bank, which now has more than $7 billion in consumer health assets, after acquiring Wells Fargo's  HSA business in 2016 and U.S. Bancorp's business in 2015. ""Since Optum is mostly used for employer-based HSA plans, they have a large captive audience. It is convenient for employees to enroll with Optum, so most do it as a default. This is a reason for the large growth in their plans,"" said Dr. Carolyn McClanahan, a physician and certified financial planner with Life Planning Partners. Acquisitions have helped Optum Bank become the nation's largest HSA administrator by assets, ahead of HealthEquity and HSA Bank, a division of Webster Financial, according to researchers at Devenir Group. The HSA account business has grown roughly 25 percent annually, but the industry could be poised for even bigger growth under the Trump administration and Republican-controlled Congress, which are signalling that HSAs could be a key part of their health-reform plans. ""It has the potential to grow even faster — could it be 30 to 50 percent?"" said Eric Remjeske, Devenir Group president and co-founder, who says expansion of health savings accounts could see major banks trying to come back into the market after shedding assets in recent years. ""I think at some point they're going to realize that this is a product and a business line that's here to stay,"" said Remjeske. ""The assets are pretty sticky."" UnitedHealth executives did not elaborate on plans for Optum Bank growth, or address any potential GOP policy to expand health savings accounts on the conference call. UnitedHealth's Hemsley said the company is advocating for the same policies it expects will make the health system work better. ""We have been on this for some time, prior to the outcome of any election, etc. So, we would have been indifferent in terms of who had proceeded,"" Hemsley said.

Analysts expected JPMorgan Chase to report a profit of $1.44 per share on revenue of $23.949 billion, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. The stock has been near 52-week highs since mid-December. Fridays' report marks the bank's first results since the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate target in a year. The Fed is expected to raise them again three times this year. JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said as the U.S. economy builds momentum, there is opportunity for ""good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented."" ""Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year, reflecting our intense client focus and solid performance across our businesses,"" Dimon said in a release. ""In the Consumer business, we had double digit growth in deposits and core loan balances, our credit card sales volume was a record, and for the year we had over $1 trillion of merchant processing volume,"" he said. Bank stocks have rallied in recent months on expectations that President-elect Donald Trump will eliminate regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. JPMorgan's return on tangible common equity, a key performance measure, was 12.2 percent in the latest quarter. The bank's full year net income came in at $24.7 billion, or $6.19 per share. The bank also said it returned $3.8 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter. Total noninterest expenses fell 3 percent to $13.83 billion, primarily driven by lower legal expenses. Last year, JPMorgan surpassed Wells Fargo to become the world's most valuable bank by market capitalization. That change came as JPMorgan rose slightly and Wells suffered the fallout of a phony customer account scandal.

Abigail Stevenson,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"If you are an investor looking to ride the Trump rally for the rest of the week, Jim Cramer says to make sure you muster up a strong level of conviction. ""We are at a moment where there are so many cross-currents, some of which are caused by the president-elect himself, that you will need a cast-iron stomach to run the gauntlet from here through Friday's inauguration,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. The reason it is so important to have firm belief in stocks in a portfolio right now, Cramer said, is because a ""tweet lightning bolt"" from Donald Trump could take down a company's shares at any time. The sell-off in bank stocks on Tuesday made them more attractive to Cramer, not less. He recommended waiting two days before buying any stocks going into the dip. Oil stocks are also hard to own right now with crude stalled in the low $50s. Nevertheless, Cramer encouraged investors to stay long oil and gas. ""Come Friday, we will have the most pro-fossil fuel president in history. Don't be whipsawed … find something you like that is oil and gas and stick with it,"" Cramer said. Financial stocks took a nosedive on Tuesday, but that didn't scare off Cramer from the group. ""I am committed to this group and after some profit-taking, I think it runs anew,""Cramer said. On Friday, three of the largest banks in the U.S.—Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo—issued statements that were incredibly positive. Many investors believe that the recent rally in financials is based on a mere post-election high, but Cramer disagreed. Banks have been waiting for this moment, Cramer said, and they have been prepared to strike at the right time. With some groups like retail struggling recently, Cramer noted tremendous strength in the restaurant group, particularly the casual dining and fast food plays. Even more impressive is that when these companies missed the numbers, their stocks went higher. This signaled the market's willingness to take into consideration long-term strength. To gain further insight on what the charts predict for the future, Cramer spoke with Bob Lang, who is a technician and founder of ExplosiveOptions.net and a colleague of Cramer's at RealMoney.com. In Lang's perspective, 2017 could be the year for Panera Bread, Cheesecake Factory, Jack in the Box and Popeyes. ""On the fundamentals, I have to agree with him,"" Cramer said. Cramer also turned his attention to a privately-held company making waves in the technology industry. Knightscope is a technology company that makes Autonomous Data Machines. These are basically robots that patrol areas like corporate campuses, shopping malls and event venues. Think ""Robocop"" without the accidental fatalities. In addition to its innovative hardware and software, Knightscope also has a unique machine-as-service business model that dramatically reduces the upfront costs of suing the company's technology. And while Knightscope is not publicly traded, it recently did a so-called mini-IPO in collaboration with SeedInvest. Cramer spoke with Knightscope's chairman and CEO Bill Li, who commented on crime as a negative monetary impact for society. ""Every single year it is a hidden tax we all pay in blood, tears and treasure. So imagine if we can combine a set of hardware, software and give every security guard super-human capabilities,"" Li said. With news of more consolidation in the tobacco space, Cramer thinks it is time for a shake-up at some of the biggest tobacco companies. British American Tobacco announced it would acquire the last 58 percent of Reynolds American that it doesn't already own for more than $49 billion, or $59.64 a share. This was just one of the latest moves in a long wave of consolidation that has hit the tobacco industry, as Reynolds American acquired Lorillard for $25 billion over a year ago. The news of British American gave Cramer an epiphany. ""With British American and Reynolds combining forces, they will finally have the scale to really challenge Philip Morris,"" he said.

Stephanie Landsman,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"Believe the Trump rally is losing its footing? You may want to explore investing in gold. Ambrosino Brothers Senior Vice President Todd Colvin, a trader who has worked on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange trading floor for more than 20 years, pointed out some key patterns that currently support owning gold. ""Equities remain very elevated, and we're starting to see VIX call buying come in with both hands which suggests there's fear of a downside move,""  said Colvin on ""Futures Now"" last week. ""We're looking at treasury yields creeping lower as well. So you've got everything kind of dynamically moving here,"" he said. ""Gold is a good place to park some money until we start to see the dust settle."" Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average came within a whisker of 20,000, a key psychological level, for the first time on December 13. Despite the index's failure to hit that milestone, the index has actually soared eight percent since the November presidential election. During that same period, gold prices have fallen more than six percent, a sign that the yellow metal might be poised to rebound. Bullion recently set an important bottom near $1130 per ounce, a level traders are now watching very closely. ""This market is way, way oversold on the fact that everything is solved and the [Federal Reserve] is going to raise rates and the economy is back on its feet. I'd like to see some proof in this first quarter data before I write that off,"" he said. The latest earnings season kicked off Friday, with Bank Of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo reporting quarterly results. They were seen largely as a bullish sign for the economy. Yet it could still shape up to be a long season, as a new administration takes the helm at the White House. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration is Friday, and the uncertainty surrounding which economic policies could be enacted is contributing to Colvin's case to own gold. ""I think gold right now is a kind of wait and see place to be,"" he said. ""Certainly, the Fed is going to have an influence, the dollar is going to have an influence—but ultimately all that is very over-hyped and I think the market needs to take a step back, and gold is a good place to watch from,"" Colvin added. Even though Colvin projects the precious metal should reach $1250 an ounce over the next 30 to 60 days, he is telling investors to be vigilant. ""Right now we need to see a $1200 [an ounce] sustainable trade in gold,"" he said. ""If we can't hold it, $1175 is your downside 'get me out' because if we get back down there, I think it starts to turn a little negative.""

Meg Tirrell,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"Competition for the EpiPen keeps mounting. The talking auto-injector competitor to Mylan's billion-dollar allergy attack remedy, the Auvi-Q, will return to market Feb. 14, manufacturer Kaleo said Thursday. The price? A whopping $4,500 for two auto-injectors. But not so fast, Kaleo said. It guarantees a cash price of $360 for two auto-injectors. Plus it will offer a program it calls Auvi-Q AffordAbility that guarantees U.S. patients with commercial insurance will have no out-of-pocket costs for the devices, plus free product for those who don't have insurance and have a household income of less than $100,000. It's an example of the complicated economics that govern drug pricing. ""We wish we didn't have to do this, but the system is set up in a way that without this bold move, patients wouldn't get access and be able to afford Auvi-Q,"" Kaleo Chief Executive Spencer Williamson said in a telephone interview with CNBC Thursday. ""We're confident the model provides access and affordability, and that it is a sustainable model."" No competing device, branded or generic, Williamson added, ""will cost a commercially insured patient less out of pocket than Auvi-Q."" The list price is multiples higher than competitors, though, including the EpiPen. But Kaleo said it expected many insurers to cover the product. ""Fortunately many health-care plans out there see the benefit of having choice for patients,"" Williamson said. ""The reason the list price is high is it's the only way we can make sure patients have access and can get it for $0."" When reached Thursday, multiple analysts of the pharmaceutical industry either expressed disbelief or laughed at the $4,500 list price for two Auvi-Q auto-injectors. One thought $4,500 must be a typo, that an extra zero had been added. ""This is where pharma is going, that's the thing,"" said Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal. ""The trick right now is how to try to isolate the patient from the pain while being able to charge more and more."" Will enough insurers actually pay full price, or close enough to it, to offset what the company pledges to spend in patient assistance? ""Yes,"" Gal said. ""The entire game is to charge an enormous amount of money to insurers and have those insurers cross-subsidize everybody else."" Williamson says nobody, even private insurance plans, will pay $4,500, because they'll get discounts and rebates. Gal estimates even with a 30 percent or 40 percent discount to insurers, Kaleo would be in the black. ""You're still getting $3,000 for a product that probably cost them under $100 to make,"" Gal said. Mark Herzog, Kaleo's vice president of corporate affairs, declined to share whether Gal's estimate on manufacturing costs is correct, saying as a private company, Kaleo doesn't share confidential financial information. ""We've seen this pricing mechanism before,"" said Michael Rea, CEO of Rx Savings Solutions. ""It's the same game with a new drug."" Auvi-Q's list price compares with a list price of $608 for two EpiPens, the price that sparked a firestorm that's plunged Mylan's stock more than 26 percent since August. EpiPen prescriptions leap during back-to-school season as parents stock their kids up for the year ahead, and the price — up 400 percent over a decade — hit many hard this year. The Auvi-Q, before it was pulled at the end of 2015, was priced similarly to — and slightly higher than — the EpiPen on a list price basis, according to data from Evercore ISI. But drug companies argue the list price doesn't accurately reflect revenue flowing to them; as Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch has told reporters and Congress since the pricing scandal erupted, many others in the health-care system, predominantly pharmacy benefits managers, benefit from higher list prices as well. As a result of the public outcry, Mylan introduced an authorized generic version of the EpiPen — the same product but without the brand name on it — at half the price. It also increased its patient assistance as well. The Auvi-Q device was pulled from the market in late 2015 by then-seller Sanofi because of the potential for delivery of an inaccurate dose of the lifesaving drug epinephrine. Williamson and Auvi-Q co-inventor Dr. Eric Edwards said Thursday they are confident in the quality of the devices they plan to bring back to market. The Auvi-Q isn't the only competition Mylan's now facing for its biggest product. Last week, CVS made a deal with Impax Laboratories to sell another epinephrine auto-injector, the Adrenaclick, for a cash price of $109.99 at its pharmacies. Analysts argue this complex system of drug pricing demands more transparency. ""It's extremely confusing that you have this multi-thousand dollar list price and then you have a cash price that's so much lower,"" Wells Fargo analyst David Maris said by telephone Thursday. ""It's an exceptionally confusing system that preys upon confusion, because with confusion comes bad decision-making."" ""Here's the problem with this,"" Maris continued. ""A lot of companies want to point to the idea that no one pays retail; it's like diamonds — 'Suckers pay retail' — Well, someone's paying something that they shouldn't be paying."" ",EpiPen competitor Auvi-Q comes back Feb. 14
Fred Imbert,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"Stocks fell on Thursday after President-elect Donald Trump  disappointed investors during his first news conference since July, while Wall Street geared up for the start of earnings season. ""I think we're moderating some of the moves we've seen over the past few weeks, and that's OK,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. ""We've baked in a lot of good news; now we need policy details."" The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 65 points lower, with Goldman Sachs and Walt Disney contributing the most losses. At session lows, the blue-chips index had fallen more than 180 points. The S&P 500 dropped around 0.2 percent, with financials falling 0.7 percent to lead decliners. Pressuring the financial sector were bank stocks, as the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) shed 1.3 percent. The Nasdaq composite closed lower for the first time in 2017, falling 0.29 percent. ""Donald Trump's press conference on Wednesday was not what investors wanted to hear, with talk of protectionism and more company bashing not exactly being market friendly,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a note. Trump took shots at the pharmaceutical industry, which sent health care and biotechnology stocks reeling. He also failed to provide new details on three of his key policies: tax reform, deregulation of certain sectors and fiscal stimulus. ""The market ran to the upside after the election on the prospects of lower corporate and personal taxes, infrastructure spending and other measures,"" said Ernie Cecilia, CIO at Bryn Mawr Trust. ""But the details and timing of said policies are also very important."" So-called safe-haven assets rose on Thursday, with gold futures briefly breaking above $1,200 per ounce, a key technical level. U.S. Treasury prices also rose, with the benchmark 10-year note yield falling to 2.35 percent and the short-term two-year note yield slipping to 1.17 percent. The U.S. dollar fell 0.4 percent against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.062 and the yen around 114.6. ""With the engine behind the Dollar's aggressive appreciation partly attributed to optimism over Trump boosting US growth via fiscal spending, the uncertainty presented yesterday should expose prices to renewed downside risks,"" said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, in a note to clients. ""While the news conference covered topics about the Russian hacking reports, Trump's separation of his business empire and repeated criticism of the media, the lack of details of the President-Elects administration's plans for economic stimulus simply left Dollar bullish investors empty handed,"" he said. Wall Street also braced for the start of earnings season on Friday. Major banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America are all scheduled to report quarterly results Friday before the bell. ""I don't think the banks are going to disappoint, but how are they going to guide?"" said Wunderlich's Hogan. In economic news, weekly jobless claims rose less than expected, while U.S. import prices rose in last month, boosted by higher oil prices. Investors also digested remarks from several Federal Reserve officials. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, a voting member of the central bank's policymaking committee, said in prepared remarks three rate hikes are appropriate. Harker, speaking on the economic outlook before the Main Line Chamber in Malvern, Pa., said 2017 is starting off on a ""good foot"" and inflation expectations are starting to rally. Still, he said monetary policy is a ""limited set of tools"" and growth policies are up to elected officials. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans struck a more cautious note, however. He said Thursday the economy could grow strongly for a bit, bit that it is likely unsustainable. Evans is also a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee. Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, another voting member, noted in his speech that several of Trump's plans would likely boost productivity in the U.S.. Fed Chair Janet Yellen will address educators at town hall meeting in Washington from 7 p.m. Overseas, European equities fell, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index sliding 0.65 percent.

Dan Caplinger,01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The financial industry has gone through a lot of turmoil over the past decade, and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) in particular has found itself at the center of controversy on more than one occasion over that time span. The bank suffered a big hit during the financial crisis in 2008 and early 2009, but its takeover of Wachovia represented an opportunity that paid off in the long run. More recently, though, a scandal surrounding employee practices has rocked confidence in the stock. Given that, some investors who have been hoping that the banking giant might do a stock split in the near future now fear that a split might never come. Below, we'll look more closely at the history of Wells Fargo stock splits to see whether those fears are justified. Image source: Wells Fargo. Here are the dates and split ratios for the stock splits that Wells Fargo has done in the past, keeping in mind that prior to November 1998, splits refer to the Norwest Corporation, which Wells Fargo merged with at that time: Date of Split Split Ratio March 31, 1959 3-for-1 March 31, 1969 2-for-1 May 17, 1977 2-for-1 June 30, 1988 3-for-2 July 21, 1989 2-for-1 June 28, 1993 2-for-1 Nov. 10, 1997 2-for-1 Aug. 11, 2006 2-for-1 Data source: Wells Fargo investor relations. All but the final stock split was done by Norwest Corporation, with which Wells Fargo merged in 1998. Wells Fargo's stock split history goes back a long while. But because only the last split was directly attributable to the current Wells Fargo, it has the most weight in determining what has made the bank make stock-split decisions in the past. Looking back at the Norwest contribution to Wells Fargo's stock split history, the bank generally made split decisions fairly aggressively. In 1997, the stock had only risen into the high $60s before the bank did a split. Before that, splits happened even more frequently, with share prices climbing only into the $50s or even $40s before prompting another move. That said, Wells Fargo's own 2006 stock split gives more valuable information about what's likely to be part of its decision-making process going for. At that time, the stock had risen into the mid-$70s, with considerable appreciation following the best years of the housing boom. The 2-for-1 split took the share price back into the $30s, and there it stayed for much of the next seven years, with a brief plunge during the financial crisis from which it equally quickly recovered. Over the past few years, Wells Fargo stock has risen, climbing almost to the $60-per-share level in 2015 before falling back. Given how far the bank let its stock climb before doing the 2006 split, no one was really surprised that Wells Fargo hadn't sought to split its shares at a lower price level. Since then, the stock has given up ground and missed out on an industry rebound, largely because of the scandal it faced last year. Wells Fargo found out through a third-party investigation that thousands of branch employees opened up to 2 million unauthorized accounts, claiming to be acting on customers' behalf. The motivation for the unauthorized activity seemed to be that workers sought to meet goals for new accounts and cross-selling. Although the penalties were minor, the episode called into question the sales culture that made Wells Fargo such a successful bank throughout its history. Among investors, future views on Wells Fargo right now are justifiably mixed. Some believe that the bank can't fix its broken reputation, while others believe that its long history can help it rebuild. Unless that happens successfully, then the question of a stock split will be a moot point, because the stock could remain mired at current levels. Even if Wells Fargo stock climbs, there's no guarantee it will split its shares. Several of its peers have much higher share prices but haven't bothered do to stock splits. Attitudes toward high-priced shares have changed over time, and now, fewer companies are concerned about stock prices even that move into triple digits. Because of those factors, Wells Fargo investors should rely on necessarily ever seeing a future stock split. In the long run, what matters far more is whether the bank can regain the confidence of customers and investors and produce the long-term returns for shareholders that helped make it a success story in the first place.

Image source: The Motley Fool. When it was revealed in September that Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) employees were opening fake checking and credit card accounts for customers, it soon became clear that the bank's incentive structure for branch workers was to blame. It's now in the process of fixing this, taking a major step last week by rolling out a new compensation program for its branches. ""This has been a top priority over the past few months and it is a significant step in reinforcing to our retail banking team members what is expected of them, how their actions connect to our business priority of serving our customers and how they'll be rewarded for performance against these expectations,"" said CEO Tim Sloan on the bank's quarterly conference call with analysts. There was no way for Wells Fargo to get around doing so, but the question for investors going forward is whether the California-based bank can maintain its edge without aggressively cross-selling financial products to its customers. Wells Fargo highlighted five aspects of its new compensation program when it reported fourth-quarter earnings last week. The big thing to note is the fact that the new compensation program doesn't include product sales goals. This matters because one of Wells Fargo's perceived strengths over the years has been its success at getting its average customer to use at least six of its financial products, compared to less than three at most other banks. You can already see how this decision is impacting Wells Fargo's business. New checking account openings in December fell 40% compared to the same month in 2015. New credit card applications dropped 43%. The story was the same in November. In the short run, these aren't likely to filter down to Wells Fargo's bottom line. What's more important right now is customer activity -- i.e., how much they're using their existing cards and accounts. Over the long run, however, the decline in new account openings will almost certainly weigh on Wells Fargo's growth. ""Our existing customers have continued to use their accounts and we've seen higher deposit and credit card balances and increased credit and debit card transaction volume which drives near-term revenue,"" said Sloan. ""The decline in the rate of new account openings may impact the pace of future revenue growth, so we'll continue to be transparent regarding those trends."" For current and prospective investors in Wells Fargo, in turn, its decision to eliminate product sales goals and the corresponding impact on the bank's top and bottom lines should be watched closely over the months and quarters ahead.

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett-run Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) has a portfolio filled with the stocks of some of the best companies in the U.S. As we head into 2017, here are two examples from Berkshire's holdings that pay strong dividends with room for growth that could be great choices for your dividend portfolio right now. Image source: The Motley Fool. I mentioned in a recent article that one of the investments I'd like to see Buffett and company make in 2017 is to double-down on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Currently, Berkshire's Apple stake is relatively small, in comparison with some of its other stock investments, but I feel it represents one of the best values among all of Berkshire's stocks. Image source: The Motley Fool. Apple is one of my biggest stock investments, and there are several reasons why. First, it's cheap. I know that argument has been overused when discussing Apple, but it's true. At just 13.2 times 2017's expected earnings, the market isn't pricing in too much future growth, but Apple's earnings per share is projected to grow by 8% in 2017 and 12% in 2018. Apple's free cash flow grew 23% year over year in the most recent quarter, and the portion of its revenue coming from services such as Apple Music and Apple Pay continues to climb at impressive rates. Plus, with a massive pile of cash parked overseas and an incoming president who pledged to offer a foreign-profit repatriation discount to corporations, Apple could be on the prowl for value-adding acquisitions in the coming years. In fact, CEO Tim Cook said in September that billions of dollars in foreign profits were already planned to be transferred home in 2017, and that was before Donald Trump was elected. As far as the dividend goes, it's completely understandable that Apple's 1.9% yield doesn't get many income seekers excited, but it's important to realize that the current payout represents just 28% of Apple's trailing-12-month earnings. This means that there is a lot of room for the dividend to grow, and Apple has made it clear that it intends to increase its dividend every year, which it has done at an impressive 10.7% annualized rate since it started paying dividends in 2012. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is one of Berkshire's largest stock investments, with a stake valued just shy of $26 million as of this writing. It is one of the best dividend payers in the banking industry with a yield of 2.8%. Image source: The Motley Fool. The bank was also among the sector's worst performers in 2016 -- rival Bank of America rose by 33% and U.S. Bancorp rose by 20%, while Wells Fargo managed to increase by a paltry 1.4%, mainly due to its fake-accounts scandal that was revealed in September. Wells Fargo has experienced a considerable drop in new accounts and customer confidence in the months that followed, but it's unclear how much of a lasting impact the scandal will have once it becomes more of a distant memory. About two months after news of the scandal broke, Buffett said that he had not sold a single share of the bank, nor did he plan to. This caught many people by surprise, as Buffett has been quick to get out of investments in the past when he felt a company's reputation was compromised. While Buffett acknowledges that the scandal and the incentive system that caused it were big mistakes, he calls the bank an ""incredible institution."" When it comes to Wells Fargo, Buffett simply believes the good outweighs the bad, and I'm in complete agreement. The company took appropriate measures to learn and recover from the scandal, including leadership changes, termination of its unhealthy sales culture, and firing the 5,300 employees who participated in the wrongdoing. The bank remains the best of the ""big four"" in terms of asset quality and profitability. It has earned consistently better returns on equity and assets than peers, and there's no reason to believe the fallout from the scandal will change that. WFC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts. Warren Buffett has famously said that ""our favorite holding period is forever"" in reference to Berkshire's stock investments. Of course, Buffett doesn't hold all of his stocks forever -- in fact, Berkshire sells stocks all the time. If his reasons for buying a stock no longer apply, or if there's some other reason he's no longer interested in a stock as an investment, Buffett is completely willing to cash in his chips. The point is that you should approach these investments as if you're going to hold them forever. Buying high-quality, dividend-paying stocks is perhaps the most certain path to wealth you can take, so buy these with the long haul in mind. ","
      
    Warren Buffett's Best Dividend Stocks for 2017 -- The Motley Fool

Bank stocks performed tremendously well in 2016, but there could still be more upside in the years ahead. If you're thinking of adding a bank stock or two to your portfolio as we head into 2017, here are three you may want to consider. Image Source: Getty Images. The financial sector was one of 2016's best performers, up 20% for the year, which was about double the gain of the S&P 500. XLF data by YCharts If you take a closer look at the chart, you'll notice that financial sector underperformed the S&P for most of the year. Most of the gains took place over the last two months -- specifically, after the election. In a nutshell, the market thinks the election of Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, as well as a Republican majority in the House and Senate, could be the magic formula to catapult bank profits higher. Rising interest rates would translate into higher profit margins, deregulation could lower ongoing costs and make it easier for banks to do business, and Trump's job and wage growth plans could produce more demand for banking services. Having said all of that, I have a positive outlook for bank stocks in general over the next few years at least. There are many great bank stocks to buy, but here are three of my favorites right now. 1. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) was one of the best performers of 2016, up by more than 30% for the year. And there's good reason the bank was a big beneficiary of the Trump rally -- it stands to benefit from higher interest rates more than peers. Simply put, the bank has more noninterest-bearing deposits than the rest of the ""big four"" U.S. banks, which should allow the bank to capitalize on its interest-bearing assets, such as loans, more than peers. In fact, the bank has said that its net interest income would increase by $5.3 billion annually with a 100-basis-point increase in rates. Along with its most recent earnings report, Bank of America announced that even though its share price is higher, it is boosting its buyback plans by more than 70%, which tells me that management still considers the stock to be a bargain. 2. Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT:XLF) is a great choice if you believe the banking sector will perform well, but don't want to choose individual stocks. The fund has a low 0.14% expense ratio, and is designed to track the performance of the financial sector as a whole. The fund's top holdings are: Company % of Fund's Assets Berkshire Hathaway (B shares) 10.8% JPMorgan Chase 10.8% Wells Fargo 8.7% Bank of America 7.8% Citigroup 5.9% Goldman Sachs 3.1% Data Source: TD Ameritrade. Information is current as of 12/31/16. 3. BofI Holding (NYSE:AX) is a more speculative choice, but one that deserves serious consideration. The bank, whose name stands for ""Bank of Internet"", is the oldest internet-only bank in the U.S. By maintaining an online-based business model, the bank enjoys competitive advantage such as low overhead and the ability to offer better rates on loan and deposit products than peers. The bank's growth has been impressive, especially in recent years. Since 2012, the company has grown its earnings per share at a 34% annualized rate, and has increased its return on equity (ROE) to a staggering 19.4% (the industry standard is 10%). Furthermore, over the past few years, the bank has successfully transitioned away from a time deposit (CD) business model to an asset portfolio dominated by checking and savings accounts. Impressively, the bank has produced its growth while maintaining significantly better asset quality than peers -- BofI's net charge-off rate is less than one-tenth of the average for a bank of its size. No stock that is capable of the gains these banks generated in 2016 is without risk. There is a lot that could potentially go wrong -- for example, the economy could enter a recession and interest rate growth could grind to a halt. While I believe with a Republican-controlled Congress, President-elect Trump will succeed in lowering taxes and rolling back regulations, it's far from certain at this point. ","
