,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"The all-stock deal, valued at more than $2.5 billion when it was made public in July, will give Exxon access to a gas field to expand exports from Papua New Guinea and better position it to meet Asian demand for liquefied natural gas. The changes to the additional cash payment represent an increase in total potential consideration to about $78.94 per InterOil share from about $71.87 earlier, InterOil said in a statement. The payment is worth $7.07 per share for each trillion cubic feet equivalent (tcfe) of certified gross resource from the Elk-Antelope field above 6.2 tcfe and up to a maximum of 11 tcfe, up from the earlier cap of 10 tcfe. InterOil also said the termination fee has been increased to $100 million from $67 million, and extended the outside date of the transaction to March 31, 2017. ","

It was established in 1897 and is a global group of energy companies that sold 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. Much of Shell’s revenues come directly from its motorists' division, which sells fuel, engine oil, lubricants and credit cards. Shell offers credit card options to seven different countries around the world. In the United States, Shell offers its customers three options for payments: the Shell Drive for Five, Platinum Select MasterCard, and the Shell Saver card. The Shell Drive for Five Card is a credit card that can only be used to purchase items at a Shell gas station or convenience store. The Platinum Select MasterCard can be used for credit purchases wherever MasterCard is accepted. The Saver card works like a debit card, where users can link a checking account to pay for their gas purchases. Shell has an online website that will provide all three applications. All require applicants to put in their personal information such as name, address and contact phone number. The Saver card requires the applicant’s driver’s license information as well as two security codes in the event of a lost password. From there, a checking account number must be provided to link to the card. The two credit cards require the most information, such as date of birth, Social Security number, and annual salary amount. Both will run a credit check on the applicant, and approval is based on the applicant's credit history. Each of Shell’s payment cards has its own set of reward or benefit programs. The Drive for Five card saves 5 cents for every gallon of Shell fuel purchased. Customers with the Platinum Select MasterCard who spend at least $500 during a billing cycle can get 10 cents per gallon credit the following business cycle. Those who spend $1,000 to $2,499.99 will get 15 cents per gallon credit, and anything more than $2,499.99 will get 20 cents per gallon credit. The Saver card offers its users a savings of 2 cents on each gallon of gas purchased. Any of the three cards would be suggested for customers who frequently purchase gas from Shell stations. Both the Drive for Five and Saver cards can only be used at Shell stations, so the more Shell gas that is pumped, the more benefits accrue. The Platinum MasterCard would be good for anyone who frequently uses credit cards to make purchases and would like reduced gasoline prices. In order to be eligible for a credit on gas prices, you must make $500 or more in purchases using the card. Those who use car travel regularly are excellent examples of who would benefit from a Shell payment card. Companies that employ a traveling sales force would also benefit with a Shell rewards card program. Energy company Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) offers an alternative to the Shell program. Exxon offers a Smart card that lets customers earn 12 cents off every gallon for the first two months, then 6 cents off every gallon thereafter. Further, there are several other credit cards that offer reward points which can be an alternative to using a Shell payment card. Many credit cards offer better rewards when used at gas stations. For example, the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card lets its users earn 3% on gas purchases of at least $10 up to $2,500 per month. Similarly, the Chase Freedom credit card offers up to 5% cash back on gas station purchases every three months. The Drive for Five credit card has an APR of 25.24% on purchases and an APR of 29.99% on cash advances. The Platinum Select MasterCard has an APR of 24.24% on purchases and an APR of 28.24% on cash advances. Both cards have the same penalty fees for late or return payments of up to $37.

Eric Chemi,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"What do companies like General Dynamics, Goldman Sachs and Exxon Mobil have in common? They're a few of the names with board members joining the next presidential Cabinet, if Donald Trump gets his way. Directors from those companies and others — including Wells Fargo, News Corp. and Ingersoll-Rand — are going to be nominated for high-level government positions in the new administration. And those stocks have already seen a benefit to their share prices since the election, beating the overall market. Future government officials such as James Mattis, Gary Cohn, Wilbur Ross, Rex Tillerson and Elaine Chao all serve on at least one board of a major publicly traded company. Here's a list, compiled by CNBC and corporate data firm Equilar: We can go one step further and put all these companies into their own basket of stocks. Let's call it the ""Trump Cabinet index"" — and that index has outperformed the overall market since the election. Since Nov. 8, this basket was up 14 percent through Friday, surpassing the S&P 500's move of 6 percent. Specifically, 10 of 15 companies are beating the market. To be clear, none of these people actually serve in the government yet, since almost all of them will require Senate confirmation. And that's not a slam dunk: There's already been plenty of public discussion from current senators about whether Exxon Mobil CEO Tillerson is an appropriate choice to be secretary of State, especially because of his connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin. But for now the index is worth following. We'll be updating the index as time goes on depending on who is in and out of the government, and which companies they have direct relationships with. It will be interesting to watch whether these companies get an added benefit for having one of their own in government, or whether they sell off harder than normal when the difficulties of managing the nation become a daily reality. Some notes about the index: We did not include WWE because Linda McMahon is no longer on its board of directors, having left to run for senate several years ago. But we did include Goldman Sachs, because Cohn is on that board. Even though Cohn's future nomination as director of the National Economic Council doesn't require Senate confirmation since it's not a Cabinet position, we thought it was a relevant and powerful enough job to include in the basket. We also included Steve Mnuchin's connection to Sears, which he gave up in early December specifically to join the incoming team. ",'Trump Cabinet index' is outpacing the market since election
Jacob Pramuk,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"In one of his final pitches to voters last month, Donald Trump eviscerated what he called a ""corrupt machine"" of entrenched political leaders, corporations and donors that he said damaged the American working class. The video tied his opponent Hillary Clinton to Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and a major Democratic donor, billionaire financier George Soros. ""For those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don't have your good in mind,"" Trump said in the Nov. 6 video. Since his election, though, Trump has stocked his administration with Blankfein's right-hand man at Goldman and two other alumni of the influential firm, one of whom worked for Soros. Several Trump Cabinet picks donated to his election effort, while his secretary of State choice led a mammoth American company with a global reach. Past presidents have put Wall Street figures and personal donors in their administrations, as well. But after a populist message of shifting power to the forgotten helped to fuel his improbable political rise, Trump seems entirely comfortable filling his administration with the wealthy and influential, money in politics experts said. ""You're playing with fire if you ride a wave of anger against the establishment and big-money politics and then practice big-money politics,"" said Daniel Weiner, senior counsel at the New York University School of Law's Brennan Center for Justice. After Trump entered the presidential race last year, he said his wealth ensured that he did not need donors. He largely funded his own primary run before shifting to more traditional fundraising in the general election. Trump slammed former GOP opponent Sen. Ted Cruz and then Clinton for their ties to Goldman, using his populist pitch to try to win over disillusioned voters on the left who supported Wall Street critic Sen. Bernie Sanders. In the final election push, Trump pledged to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington of big-money influence. Trump's transition team announced last month that it would not include lobbyists and said that members of the administration would be banned from lobbying for five years after they left the government, an effort to curb special interests in politics. Beyond the push against lobbying, though, Trump has signaled little desire to reduce the role of the wealthy and powerful, said Sheila Krumholz, executive director at the Center for Responsive Politics. ""His focus on lobbyists means he's concerned about it, but he's defining it very narrowly. Insiders will arguably have more power in the next administration given the kind of powerful perch that they're being appointed to,"" she said. Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a request to comment on this story. Trump has picked two chief executives of major U.S. companies, a former Goldman partner and a billionaire investor for his Cabinet. He has also chosen Goldman's former second-ranking executive, Gary Cohn, and Linda McMahon, a former WWE CEO who gave $6 million to a super PAC backing him, for non-Cabinet level spots. Cohn will head the National Economic Council, while McMahon was picked for the Small Business Administration. Current Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker donated to President Barack Obama, while George W. Bush Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson was the CEO of Goldman, so Trump isn't the first president to pick Wall Street veterans and donors for top spots. But Krumholz said Trump has chosen more wealthy people for his administration than presidents typically have in the past. Trump has defended his picks from the business world by saying they know how to create jobs and will help him follow through on his economic promises. Here is a list of Trump's Cabinet-level picks so far. It includes what they gave to him and outside groups backing him, according to Federal Election Commission records. Still, it remains to be seen how much the senators confirming Trump's picks and the voters who propelled him to the White House care about the wealth in his administration. While Democrats have signaled they could make confirmation difficult for some of the picks, particularly Tillerson, Mnuchin and Sessions, the Republican Senate majority will likely push them through barring a major upheaval within the party. Voters may not be concerned about the influential people in Trump's administration as long as he follows through on campaign promises to boost economic growth and promote job creation in the Rust Belt, said Steven Billet, director of the master's program in legislative affairs at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management. Trump has promised that his tax reform and trade policies will boost American businesses and he has already celebrated a deal with United Technologies for it to keep some of the Carrier jobs it planned to move to Mexico. ""If he doesn't deliver the kind of jobs that are appealing to that slice of the American public that was so stridently supportive of his candidacy, then he's going to have a problem,"" Billet said. The Trump transition has recently faced influence issues outside of the appointments. On Tuesday, the transition team denied that Trump's two grown sons had ""any involvement"" with a reported charity event that sought donations of up to $1 million in exchange for packages that included a private reception with the president-elect. Trump's sons Donald Jr. and Eric serve on his transition team and the president-elect has said they will help to run his businesses after he takes office. A charitable auction for a meeting with Trump's daughter Ivanka was also recently canceled after questions were raised about the ethics of offering access. The proceeds were supposed to go to the St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital. Separately, early Trump supporter and former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski has started a consulting firm based only a block away from the White House to promote Trump's agenda.

Elizabeth Gurdus,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"The U.S. has a pressing need to bolster its weak cybersecurity in the face of huge breaches like Russia's suspected sabotage of the election system and Yahoo's billion-user hack, Ret. Adm. James Stavridis told CNBC on Thursday. ""It is the greatest mismatch between the level of threat, very high, and the level of preparation, quite low,"" the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander told ""Squawk Box."" ""We're headed toward a cyber Pearl Harbor, and it is going to come at either the grid or the financial sector,"" he said, echoing a term used by then Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in 2012. The two nations that pose the biggest threats to the United States are Russia and China, Stavridis said, followed by North Korea and Iran. While he sees Russia and China as most dangerous, the United States should be vigilant with regards to all potential actors, he said. Stavridis brought up North Korea's response to the 2014 film ""The Interview,"" a satire about an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""They lashed out with a cyberattack against Sony Pictures, an American corporation, did tens of millions of dollars of kinetic damage to Sony as well as a great deal of reputational damage,"" he said. ""So it's not just big nations coming at big nations, it's also small nations going at big nations."" But the big nations could conceivably come to a solution, said Stavridis. He proposed that future administrations create a position titled director of national intelligence and cybersecurity. ""That idea of interagency cooperation is key to protecting us in the cyber realm,"" he said. Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, had been rumored as a possible candidate for secretary of State in the Trump administration. He said he was pleased with President-elect Donald Trump's choice for the position, citing Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson's business relations abroad and noting the importance of cultivating a ""more transactional relationship"" with Russia.

Michael Brush,12222016,MarketWatch,12152016,"Published: Dec 16, 2016 8:46 a.m. ET Those with high deferred tax liabilities will be the real winners By Many investors are now hunting for companies that pay high U.S. taxes because they stand to benefit the most if Donald Trump cuts corporate taxes, as he said he would. But the real accounting sleuths are looking elsewhere for the hidden gems that may get the biggest boost. They’re digging up the companies that have the largest “deferred tax liabilities” on the books. If you want to skip the details on the moving parts and just get to examples of the biggest beneficiaries, then go to the “ big potential winners” section below. Otherwise, here’s a little background on what’s at work. (Also read: How S&P 500 companies would save $87.1 billion if Trump passes his tax plan.) You can think of a deferred tax liability as a store of value on the balance sheet that gets released on to the income statement over time for accounting purposes. Companies use this account to make up for differences in how they keep their two sets of books — one for the tax collector and the other for investors. Companies typically expense certain costs — the price of big-ticket items like equipment and plants, for example — more quickly for the IRS than they can in the books prepared for investors. This lowers their taxes in the near term. But then they go up in later years, all things being equal. To make up for the timing differences, companies set aside deferred tax liabilities. Here’s where things get interesting for investors. Companies calculate the amount to set aside using the prevailing tax rate, currently 35%. But if Trump and Republicans in Congress reduce the tax rate, companies will suddenly have to set aside far less money for deferred tax liabilities, providing an immediate boost to earnings. Suppose the tax rate gets cut to 20%, a likely compromise scenario in Washington. (Trump wants 15%, but many Congressional leaders don’t want to go quite that far.) This would mean a company’s new deferred tax liability would be 57% (or 20%/35%) of the old one. Deferred tax liabilities would decline by 43%, in other words. That money would go straight to the income statement as “earnings” and, theoretically at least, boost the value of a company’s market value. “It’s a gift from the government. It’s like debt forgiveness,” says Bastiat Capital founder Albert Meyer, an accounting expert whose stock picks are up an annualized 7.9% since April 2006 versus 5% for the benchmark S&P 500 Index. “If they lower the tax rate, the deferred tax liability has to be restated, and that provides a onetime credit in the income statement.” True, this is a “non cash” event. There is no money that magically appears out of nowhere. But it will affect reported earnings and thus influence investor sentiment on a stock. The big potential winners To find some of the biggest potential winners, I asked S&P Global Market Intelligence to screen for the companies with the largest deferred tax liabilities. The two companies with the biggest are Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway

                                   at $31.7 billion. Those companies could see their market values rise 7% to 10% from the effect of the tax reduction. To see why, let’s walk through an example, with AT&T. If the tax rate drops to 20%, AT&T’s deferred tax liability would decline to $34 billion from $59.6 billion, a reduction of $25.5 billion. Hence, there would be a $25.5 billion credit adjustment in the income statement, effectively boosting earnings by $25.5 billion in the year of the restatement, says Meyer. Since the company has a $245 billion market value, that $25.5 billion gain theoretically represents a 10.45% increase in market value, he says. That is just an estimate, not a hard-and-fast rule. But it’s a good gauge of the potential impact the change may have on how investors think about valuing the company. Now, consider Pfizer. The tax cut reduction to 20% would take down its deferred tax liability of $31.7 billion to $18.1 billion, for a “savings” of $13.6 billion. That could represent a 7% increase in its $186 billion market value. Utilities While the six companies above have the biggest absolute deferred tax liabilities, the biggest potential impact to stock prices may lie elsewhere — among the companies that have the largest liabilities relative to their market values. Since utilities spend a lot on plants and equipment, they have some of the biggest depreciation expenses for tax purposes. So they have some of the biggest deferred tax liabilities relative to market value. Utilities also happen to be out of favor among investors right now, which makes them an interesting contrarian play. Investors are fleeing bond-like stocks that pay high dividends, such as utilities, on fears that Federal Reserve interest-rate increases will be bad for those stocks. The theory is that the shares of bond-like stocks (and bond prices) can fall as interest rates go up, since the price moves “adjust up” their yields to match yields set higher in the markets because of Fed rate hikes. This widespread aversion to utilities is one reason Larry McDonald of the Bear Traps Report likes utilities as a contrarian buy right now. An added plus for utilities is that they typically have big deferred tax liabilities. Thus, they stand to gain a lot if Washington cuts the corporate tax rate. According to my calculations using data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, the six utilities with the biggest deferred tax liabilities relative to market value are: Entergy

Michael K. Farr,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"Farr, Miller & Washington is a ""buy-to-hold"" investment manager, which means we make each investment with the intent to hold the position for a period of 3-5 years. Nevertheless, in each of the past eleven Decembers I have selected and invested personally in ten of the stocks we follow with the intention of holding for just one year. These are companies that I find especially attractive in light of their valuations or their potential to benefit from economic developments. I hold an equal dollar amount in each of the positions for the following year, and then I reinvest in the new list. The following is my Top 10 for 2017, listed in alphabetical order. This year's Top Ten represent a nice combination of growth and defensiveness. Six of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors are represented, and their average long-term estimated growth rate (in EPS) is well in excess of the overall market. Also on average, these companies are much larger than the average S&P 500 company while carrying an average dividend yield of about 2.0 percent. Results have been good in some years and not as good in others. I will sell my 2016 names on Friday, December 30th and buy the following names that afternoon. These are not recommendations to buy or sell securities. There is risk of losing principal. Past performance is no indication of future results. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Abbott Laboratories is a diversified, global healthcare company focused on nutritionals, medical products, established pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics.  Abbott is a unique asset because of its significant emerging-market exposure and the significant ""direct-to-consumer"" revenue that it generates.  Abbott's stock price has recently under-performed the broader market and its healthcare peers due to concerns about nutritional sales in China, the company's exposure to emerging markets in general, and the company's proposed acquisition of St. Jude.  Though emerging markets are currently out-of-favor, we believe that this exposure will prove to be profitable for clients over the long run.  The St. Jude acquisition is expected to be very accretive to 2018 earnings per share (EPS).  And though Abbott will need to substantially increase its debt load in order to fund this transaction, coverage ratios should be reasonable, and St. Jude and Abbott have both run businesses that have held up well during tough economic times.  The aforementioned concerns have left Abbott's stock trading at a discount to the overall market (e.g. 16 times estimated CY17 EPS) while offering investors a 2.7 percent dividend yield.  This multiple looks especially attractive vs. the 20 times plus multiples being awarded to consumer staple stocks, a sector that is also considered defensive in nature by investors. Alphabet (GOOG) Alphabet is a holding company best known for owning Google.  Google generates revenue primarily through selling advertising through Google Search, Google Maps, and YouTube, with a growing contribution from sales of apps and content (Google Play), hardware, and cloud services.  The stock has under-performed in 2016 as it consolidated big gains from the second half of 2015.  Despite 16 percent earnings growth this year, the stock is up just 4 percent.  Meanwhile, the company continues to tweak its algorithms, ad loads, and placements to generate more clicks and higher revenues.  The balance sheet is flush with net cash and investments totaling some $85 billion.  Sixty percent of that cash is overseas, so any tax reform that lowers the rate on repatriation would benefit the company and shareholders.  The company does have some regulatory issues in Europe, but it could be years before that gets resolved.  We expect earnings growth in the low-to-mid teens over the next few years as the company benefits from the ongoing movement of advertising dollars from traditional formats to digital, ramps up cloud software and infrastructure services to corporations, and capitalizes on its investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  The stock trades at 19.3 times estimated CY17 EPS. Becton Dickinson (BDX) Becton Dickinson is a global supplier of medical devices, hospital supplies, diagnostic equipment, and medication management systems to hospitals and labs.  Consumable products comprise 85 percent of revenue with the other 15 percent coming from equipment.  The company should continue to benefit from the following long-term secular trends:  1) Aging populations spending more on healthcare in developed nations; 2) Rising wealth in emerging economies leading to higher healthcare spending and a greater focus on safety; and 3) Movement in the U.S. health care market away from products and towards ""solutions."" Becton Dickinson has a strong track record of growing sales and earnings faster, and in a more stable fashion, than the overall market.  The company's earnings did not drop during the 2008/2009 financial crisis, and we believe that the company's long-term growth algorithm (e.g. 5 percent revenue growth and 10 percent EPS growth) is reasonable and attractive in the current slow-growth environment.  Questions about the future of the Affordable Care Act could weigh on the shares near-term, but the long-term secular trends cited above should ultimately outweigh these near-term concerns.  The risk/reward appears positive with the stock trading at 17.2x estimated CY17 EPS.  The dividend yield is 1.7 percent. CVS (CVS) CVS is comprised of over 9,600 retail pharmacies, more than 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) with over 80 million plan members, a senior pharmacy care business serving over one million patients per year, and an expanding specialty pharmacy business.  CVS drove industry-leading performance by combining its retail pharmacy business with Caremark's PBM.  However, the stock has been weak in recent months as the competition appears to have caught up a bit.  Specifically, the company recently announced that rival PBMs were steering business away from CVS pharmacies.  This caused the company to reduce its expectations for prescriptions filled in 2017, which reduces revenue but hits profits more severely due to the significant fixed costs incurred by running a retail pharmacy.  Longer term, we believe that CVS is well-positioned to take advantage of higher U.S. drug demand (generic, branded and specialty), and its PBM business should continue to play an important role in keeping drug costs from rising too rapidly.  The stock currently trades at 13.5 times estimated CY17 EPS and offers investors a 2.5 percent dividend yield.  The current valuation appears quite attractive for long-term focused investors. ExxonMobil (XOM) ExxonMobil is an integrated oil company.  Its business starts with the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas and then moves to the production of petroleum products, and finally to the transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.  The stock performance has lagged the broader energy sector, which is not unusual in the early stages of a commodity price recovery.  Oil prices are up 50 percent from the lows of January 2016.  The company has historically generated strong returns on average capital employed through its relatively low finding and development costs.  The reset in commodity prices has forced companies to find ways to live within their cash flow, and ExxonMobil appears well on its way to achieving free cash flow neutrality (cash from operations covers capital expenditures, dividends, and any share repurchases).  ).  Additionally, the company may benefit from policy changes that open more drilling areas or improve relations with Russia.  If the U.S. rolls back sanctions on Russia, the company stands to regain access to huge reserves of oil.  The stock trades at 21.4 times estimated CY17 EPS.  On cash earnings, the stock is trading at 7.6 times our estimates for 2017 EBITDA per share.  The stock also offers a 3.3 percent dividend yield. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Johnson & Johnson is one of the world's largest and most diversified healthcare companies with revenue divided among the pharmaceutical, medical device and consumer divisions.  The company should continue to benefit from an aging global population and rising standards of living in the world's emerging economies.  Johnson & Johnson has a long history of growing its businesses organically while simultaneously adding value by adeptly managing its portfolio of over 250 operating companies.  The company enjoys a AAA-rated balance sheet, produces a lot of free cash flow, and generates above-average returns on equity.  Healthcare stocks have been among the worst performers in 2016 due to concerns about intervention in drug pricing and the future of the Affordable Care Act.  These concerns have left Johnson and Johnson trading at 16.2x estimated CY17 EPS, which represents a discount to the broader market averages.  This reasonable multiple, the 2.8 percent dividend yield, and our expectation that JNJ should continue to grow faster, and in a more stable fashion than the overall market over the next five years, underpin our positive view of the stock at current levels. Lowe's (LOW) The home improvement sector has been one of the few attractive areas within retail for the past few years, and we think the strong relative performance can continue for a few more years as residential investment remains depressed compared to long-term historical averages.  LOW's effectively operates in a duopoly with competitor Home Depot, while the remaining industry competitors are too small to achieve the economies of scale that the two industry bellwethers enjoy.  In addition, LOW offers relative immunity from online competition from the likes of Amazon.com.  These characteristics are hard to find within the retail sector.  With regard to financial performance, earnings growth has been very strong over the past several years as solid sales growth has combined with margin expansion to produce high-teens EPS growth since 2009.  Based on continued positive sales and margin trends, we believe the company can continue to put up double-digit EPS growth for several more years.  As such, we think LOW represents good value.  The stock currently trades at an attractive multiple of 15.9 times estimated CY17 EPS, and the dividend yield is 1.9 percent. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft, best known for its Windows operating system, is a productivity software powerhouse that has made the move to the cloud and more of a subscription-based revenue model.  This transition has occurred over the past couple of years and has resulted in flat cash flow from operating activities.  Satya Nadella has done a superb job of changing the culture within the company to focus on making the best productivity software no matter the operating system on which it runs.  Azure is Microsoft's open, flexible, enterprise-grade cloud computing platform that has emerged as a strong number two to leading Amazon.  Office and server tools continue to appeal to commercial enterprises.  We see 2017 as the inflection year in which subscription revenue is large enough to consistently offset the loss of one-time (transactional) software sales.  This ongoing transformation should drive acceleration in revenue growth and margin expansion, leading to increased profitability and cash flow.  The bulk of the big investments have already been made, and the company is nearing its big, slow turn to the cloud.  Shareholder-friendly capital allocation should continue with a 2.5 percent dividend yield and 1 percent-2 percent of shares being repurchased each year.  The stock is trading at 20.7 times estimated CY17 EPS. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) Shares of Sprouts Farmers Market have suffered in recent months due largely to intensified competition and food price deflation.  The company, whose motto is ""healthy living for less"", operates healthy grocery stores that offer fresh, natural, non-GMO and organic food. Sprouts sits at the ideal intersection of natural/organic, affordability and accessibility. To drive foot traffic Sprouts prices its produce offering 20 percent-25 percent below traditional supermarkets, and even further below Whole Foods Markets and other natural foods competitors. This price point means Sprouts is attractive to both the everyday shopper and the hardcore natural foods customer.  Sprouts' footprint is largely in the Southwest, but the company is expanding east and adding 14 percent to its total square footage every year.  We believe that this rate of store growth, along with mid-single digit same-store sales growth from its relatively young store base, should translate to mid-teens revenue and EPS growth for the foreseeable future.  In addition, the company generates strong cash flow and is able to fund its store expansion internally while also returning capital to shareholders through a share buyback program. Sprouts is currently trading at 20.5 times estimated CY17 EPS. United Technologies (UTX) United Technologies is a diversified industrial company that provides products and services to the building systems and aerospace industries worldwide. The company's aerospace segments target both commercial and government (including both defense and space) customers. The company has a fantastic long-term track record of financial performance, with strong double-digit EPS growth, outstanding cash generation, and a rock-solid balance sheet.  However, recent performance has been held back by development costs for the company's ground-breaking new geared turbofan (GTF) jet engine as well as increasing competition and pricing pressure in Europe and China for Otis elevators (both equipment and service). We think the company is taking the appropriate action to improve performance in these two areas.  Once through the current investment phase, we think the company can ultimately return to sustainable double-digit EPS growth.  Based on those expectations, we continue to believe the company offers strong value for long-term investors, trading at 16.9 times estimated CY17 EPS - a significant discount to the overall market.  In addition, the current dividend yield is an attractive 2.4 percent. ",Top 10 stocks for 2017—commentary
Ryan Vlastelica,12292016,MarketWatch,12222016,"Published: Dec 27, 2016 8:15 a.m. ET Many questions remain about Trump’s policies and geopolitical aims By In an increasingly tense world, why is Wall Street looking so sanguine? From a geopolitical perspective, 2016 has been the most volatile year in recent history, with historic elections in Britain, Italy, and the U.S. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president has ratcheted up anxieties, with the real-estate mogul recently saying that he planned to “greatly strengthen and expand” the country’s nuclear capability, raising the specter of a Cold War-era style arms race. However, observers may be hard pressed to discern any signs of the swiftly shifting political landscape in the equity markets. After a rocky start, trading this year was marked by a rally that has taken major indexes to repeated records, but despite the tilt higher Wall Street has mostly been marked by a historic level of quiescence.

According to LPL Financial, the average level for the “fear index” in 2016 was below 16, the fifth straight year it has averaged below 20, the level considered its long-term average. Readings below 12 suggests that the market isn’t betting on any sharp market swings. Despite that, investors are nearly unanimous that the events of the year have injected huge amounts of uncertainty into the economy. It is unknown what the fallout will be to the U.K.’s vote to exit from out of the European Union, known as Brexit, or the populist movements sweeping Europe. President-elect Donald Trump remains a wild card, as his tweets hint at potentially massive changes to U.S. policy on China, in addition to calling out companies and Wall Street executives. “The world economy and markets have embarked on a journey into the unknown,” researchers at Pimco wrote in a Dec. 15 note. The firm didn’t adjust its outlook for 2017, but wrote that “our confidence in any particular scenario is low. The reason: the world has now fully arrived in the radically uncertain, ‘stable but not secure’ predicament.” The most commonly invoked aphorism on Wall Street is “markets hate uncertainty.” So why hasn’t “a journey into the unknown” devolved into wild price swings? Some analysts believe that we might get that at some point—but not yet. Read:  Delayed reaction? Here’s when the latest terror attacks could rattle markets See also: How Trump and Brexit are shaking up investment portfolios for 2017 Perhaps the biggest question mark among geopolitical issue involves Russia. On Monday, the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by a Turkish police officer, raising tensions that had already been elevated due to the country’s alleged hacking during the U.S. campaign; Moscow has been charged with stealing and leaking emails in an effort to interfere with the election in favor of Trump. While top Senate Republicans have joined Democrats in calling for investigations into the issue, Trump has dismissed intelligence assessments of the hack, raising questions about the kind of response will be made by the government, if any. “These are really big wild cards. You hear guys like [Sen. Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell saying that no matter what Russia did, they’re not our friend. And then Trump comes out to say he’s a fan of Putin—that’s a huge chasm, and we don’t know what side anyone is on,” said Michael Mullaney, director of global market research at Boston Partners, which manages $89 billion. U.S. intelligence and Homeland security accused Russia of directing a series of cyberattacks to influence the outcome of the presidential election. “If the election was tampered with, then there should be some kind of retaliation, which would fly in the face of both Trump and Tillerson, who is also very friendly with Putin. Those are significant curveballs, and all they do is add more uncertainty to the market,” said Mullaney.

who was recently named Trump’s secretary of state and has had business dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Despite the uncertainty, equities have risen steadily since the election, with investors betting that the broad outlines of Trump’s expected economic policy proposals—which include massive corporate tax cuts, deregulation, and heavy infrastructure spending—will accelerate economic growth and spur inflation. “Markets have factored in the prospect of lower taxes. That’s the numerical rationale for these gains; it’s not just euphoria about a business-oriented president,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. “We’re not that goofy, overall,” she said of market analysts. Read: Wall Street’s Trump optimism comes with heavy dose of uncertainty Trump has released few details about the policies he will pursue, making it difficult to evaluate their impact on the economy or corporate growth. Thus far, however, corporate optimism doesn’t seem to match the expectations conveyed by Wall Street’s rapid rise. Nick Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group, recently noted that 2017 revenue growth estimates for Dow components had fallen to 4.5% from the 4.8% that had been forecast before the election. “If history is any guide, they will be trimming it further,” he wrote of company analysts in a newsletter. “Moreover, our first look at 2018 revenue [comparisons] for the Dow shows analysts expect top line growth to decelerate further, to just 3.7% versus 2017.” Don’t miss: Stocks get Trump bounce, but not the real economy Even if fundamentals don’t show signs of weakening, however, the prospect of elevated tension with military rivals like Russia, or with major trading partners like China or Mexico—both of which Trump has threatened to levy tariffs on—could be enough to bring markets down. “If you look at headlines about our relationship with China getting choppy, or the degree to which we may become buddies with Russia, or about how Europe manages itself in this political age, then it’s easy to see why we expect volatility will come back into this market,” said Bill Belden, managing director at Guggenheim. “The current lack of concern seems to be that the dust will settle in a way that’s not too dissimilar from what we have now, but even if that’s true, the path to the dust settling is uncertain.” Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

,01052017,Reuters,12292016,"(This January 3 story was corrected to remove reference in paragraph 8 to ConocoPhillips, which is not an integrated oil company) By David Morgan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Big Oil could be in a unique position to protect its interests against a Republican proposal to tax imports, given that President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet is studded with oil champions sensitive to the risk of higher gasoline prices. Trump’s emerging leadership includes Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, former Texas Governor Rick Perry as energy secretary and  Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Trump himself has made no secret of his support for the energy sector. And in Congress, both Republicans and Democrats have close industry ties, including House tax panel chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican whose district takes in the northern Houston suburbs. House Republicans want to adopt a sweeping tax reform that would sharply reduce tax rates for corporations and end the taxation of U.S. corporate overseas profits. But a provision known as border adjustability is stirring up controversy. Though intended to boost U.S. manufacturing by exempting export revenues from tax, the provision worries some industries because it would also tax imports. Because U.S. oil refiners import about half the crude oil they use to make gasoline, diesel and other products, analysts say the change could lead to higher gasoline prices and potentially undermine economic growth. Integrated oil companies such as Exxon, Chevron Corp, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc could also be hit, depending on whether they are net importers. But the industry’s allies would likely move to soften any rough edges, analysts say. “I don’t see this mix of leadership figures in the House, Senate and the White House, doing something that has the effect of raising gasoline prices,” said Peter Cohn, an energy analyst with Height Securities, a Washington-based investment firm. The danger is that a move to protect the oil refiners could open the door to assistance for other industries, including retailers and automakers, which would also face higher costs if no longer able to deduct the cost of imports from their taxable income. Such a knock-on effect could prevent border adjustability from raising an expected $1 trillion in revenues to help pay for lower tax rates over the next decade. “We hope that raising these concerns early in the process will allow members of Congress to consider the issues carefully,” Chet Thompson, president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group, said in a statement. Brady said earlier this month that his committee was sensitive to the impact on specific businesses and “listening very closely to how we can make sure we smooth that out.” Moreover, some economists dismiss industry worries about higher import costs, saying the dollar’s value would rise in response to such sweeping tax changes and ultimately reduce the cost of imports. Currency markets would adjust to higher oil prices by lowering the dollar value of crude, they predict. “This argument by the oil industry is, frankly, all wrong,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who now heads the American Action Forum think tank. “Refiners are going to be basically held harmless. They’ll have a lower dollar price of oil. Net cost is the same. And they go about their business. I’m unsympathetic,” he added. Height Securities’ Cohn said Trump and his advisers could look for ways to soften any blow to refiners and their customers: “Trump doesn’t want to have refineries closing on his watch.” Oil already benefits from several tax code provisions in place for decades that would be eliminated under the House Republican plan. But they stand to gain more than they will lose. For instance, an existing tax deduction for domestic production lets oil producers shave down their corporate tax rate to 32 percent from the top headline rate of 35 percent. Under the congressional Republicans’ plan, the corporate rate would be cut to 20 percent; under Trump’s plan, to 15 percent. Similarly, companies that now write off intangible drilling costs or get a tax allowance for asset depletion would be able to immediately expense capital investments. Then there is a tax credit oil companies claim for fees from foreign countries. Congressional Republicans would eliminate foreign taxes altogether, while Trump would maintain taxation at a substantially lower rate. ","

Mark Fahey,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"President-elect Donald Trump can influence stock prices and change corporate plans simply by tweeting, and few companies are as dependent on the government as the big contractors. About 61 entities earned $1 billion or more from federal contracts in the 2015 fiscal year, and 34 of those are publicly traded companies, according to data from the federal procurement data system. As you would expect, the biggest recipients are defense contractors, which already had good reason to watch Trump closely after he was involved in a deal to keep Carrier jobs in Indiana. Companies like Lockheed Martin may top the list at $36 billion in contractual obligations, but companies across several other industries are getting a huge amount of their revenue from the government, according to data from the federal system and FactSet. For the energy sector, Exxon Mobil is the biggest contractor with almost $800 million in petroleum contracts, mostly for the Defense Logistics Agency. That may seem like a lot, but it's a negligible fraction of the energy giant's revenue each year. The same is true for the telecom leader, AT&T, and shipping leader FedEx, which each made a little over $600 million from the government in 2015. The situation is completely different for the leading firm in information technology, SAIC, which depends on government contracts for 78 percent of its revenue. Private prisons firm GEO Group lead the real estate sector, making about 71 percent of its $1.8 billion in sales from government contracts. In health care, McKesson Corp. made over $8 billion, most of which came from its lucrative relationship with Veteran's Affairs. That's about 4 percent of the pharmaceutical distributor's revenue. For companies classified as financial firms, Berkshire Hathaway was the largest government contractor. But the company didn't earn that position through its financial businesses — most of its government revenue came from its nonfinancial holdings, including providing metals to the U.S. Mint, mobile homes for FEMA and flight training for the FAA, according to government data. Not counting state or local spending, the federal government paid almost $240 billion to its top 100 contractors in 2015. Those are big sums, and those companies are going to be noticing everything Trump says. ",Top government contractors: 52 public companies that make the most
Michael K. Farr,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"Farr, Miller & Washington is a ""buy-to-hold"" investment manager, which means we make each investment with the intent to hold the position for a period of 3-5 years. Nevertheless, in each of the past eleven Decembers I have selected and invested personally in ten of the stocks we follow with the intention of holding for just one year. These are companies that I find especially attractive in light of their valuations or their potential to benefit from economic developments. I hold an equal dollar amount in each of the positions for the following year, and then I reinvest in the new list. The following is my Top 10 for 2017, listed in alphabetical order. This year's Top Ten represent a nice combination of growth and defensiveness. Six of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors are represented, and their average long-term estimated growth rate (in EPS) is well in excess of the overall market. Also on average, these companies are much larger than the average S&P 500 company while carrying an average dividend yield of about 2.0 percent. Results have been good in some years and not as good in others. I will sell my 2016 names on Friday, December 30th and buy the following names that afternoon. These are not recommendations to buy or sell securities. There is risk of losing principal. Past performance is no indication of future results. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Abbott Laboratories is a diversified, global healthcare company focused on nutritionals, medical products, established pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics.  Abbott is a unique asset because of its significant emerging-market exposure and the significant ""direct-to-consumer"" revenue that it generates.  Abbott's stock price has recently under-performed the broader market and its healthcare peers due to concerns about nutritional sales in China, the company's exposure to emerging markets in general, and the company's proposed acquisition of St. Jude.  Though emerging markets are currently out-of-favor, we believe that this exposure will prove to be profitable for clients over the long run.  The St. Jude acquisition is expected to be very accretive to 2018 earnings per share (EPS).  And though Abbott will need to substantially increase its debt load in order to fund this transaction, coverage ratios should be reasonable, and St. Jude and Abbott have both run businesses that have held up well during tough economic times.  The aforementioned concerns have left Abbott's stock trading at a discount to the overall market (e.g. 16 times estimated CY17 EPS) while offering investors a 2.7 percent dividend yield.  This multiple looks especially attractive vs. the 20 times plus multiples being awarded to consumer staple stocks, a sector that is also considered defensive in nature by investors. Alphabet (GOOG) Alphabet is a holding company best known for owning Google.  Google generates revenue primarily through selling advertising through Google Search, Google Maps, and YouTube, with a growing contribution from sales of apps and content (Google Play), hardware, and cloud services.  The stock has under-performed in 2016 as it consolidated big gains from the second half of 2015.  Despite 16 percent earnings growth this year, the stock is up just 4 percent.  Meanwhile, the company continues to tweak its algorithms, ad loads, and placements to generate more clicks and higher revenues.  The balance sheet is flush with net cash and investments totaling some $85 billion.  Sixty percent of that cash is overseas, so any tax reform that lowers the rate on repatriation would benefit the company and shareholders.  The company does have some regulatory issues in Europe, but it could be years before that gets resolved.  We expect earnings growth in the low-to-mid teens over the next few years as the company benefits from the ongoing movement of advertising dollars from traditional formats to digital, ramps up cloud software and infrastructure services to corporations, and capitalizes on its investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  The stock trades at 19.3 times estimated CY17 EPS. Becton Dickinson (BDX) Becton Dickinson is a global supplier of medical devices, hospital supplies, diagnostic equipment, and medication management systems to hospitals and labs.  Consumable products comprise 85 percent of revenue with the other 15 percent coming from equipment.  The company should continue to benefit from the following long-term secular trends:  1) Aging populations spending more on healthcare in developed nations; 2) Rising wealth in emerging economies leading to higher healthcare spending and a greater focus on safety; and 3) Movement in the U.S. health care market away from products and towards ""solutions."" Becton Dickinson has a strong track record of growing sales and earnings faster, and in a more stable fashion, than the overall market.  The company's earnings did not drop during the 2008/2009 financial crisis, and we believe that the company's long-term growth algorithm (e.g. 5 percent revenue growth and 10 percent EPS growth) is reasonable and attractive in the current slow-growth environment.  Questions about the future of the Affordable Care Act could weigh on the shares near-term, but the long-term secular trends cited above should ultimately outweigh these near-term concerns.  The risk/reward appears positive with the stock trading at 17.2x estimated CY17 EPS.  The dividend yield is 1.7 percent. CVS (CVS) CVS is comprised of over 9,600 retail pharmacies, more than 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) with over 80 million plan members, a senior pharmacy care business serving over one million patients per year, and an expanding specialty pharmacy business.  CVS drove industry-leading performance by combining its retail pharmacy business with Caremark's PBM.  However, the stock has been weak in recent months as the competition appears to have caught up a bit.  Specifically, the company recently announced that rival PBMs were steering business away from CVS pharmacies.  This caused the company to reduce its expectations for prescriptions filled in 2017, which reduces revenue but hits profits more severely due to the significant fixed costs incurred by running a retail pharmacy.  Longer term, we believe that CVS is well-positioned to take advantage of higher U.S. drug demand (generic, branded and specialty), and its PBM business should continue to play an important role in keeping drug costs from rising too rapidly.  The stock currently trades at 13.5 times estimated CY17 EPS and offers investors a 2.5 percent dividend yield.  The current valuation appears quite attractive for long-term focused investors. ExxonMobil (XOM) ExxonMobil is an integrated oil company.  Its business starts with the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas and then moves to the production of petroleum products, and finally to the transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.  The stock performance has lagged the broader energy sector, which is not unusual in the early stages of a commodity price recovery.  Oil prices are up 50 percent from the lows of January 2016.  The company has historically generated strong returns on average capital employed through its relatively low finding and development costs.  The reset in commodity prices has forced companies to find ways to live within their cash flow, and ExxonMobil appears well on its way to achieving free cash flow neutrality (cash from operations covers capital expenditures, dividends, and any share repurchases).  ).  Additionally, the company may benefit from policy changes that open more drilling areas or improve relations with Russia.  If the U.S. rolls back sanctions on Russia, the company stands to regain access to huge reserves of oil.  The stock trades at 21.4 times estimated CY17 EPS.  On cash earnings, the stock is trading at 7.6 times our estimates for 2017 EBITDA per share.  The stock also offers a 3.3 percent dividend yield. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Johnson & Johnson is one of the world's largest and most diversified healthcare companies with revenue divided among the pharmaceutical, medical device and consumer divisions.  The company should continue to benefit from an aging global population and rising standards of living in the world's emerging economies.  Johnson & Johnson has a long history of growing its businesses organically while simultaneously adding value by adeptly managing its portfolio of over 250 operating companies.  The company enjoys a AAA-rated balance sheet, produces a lot of free cash flow, and generates above-average returns on equity.  Healthcare stocks have been among the worst performers in 2016 due to concerns about intervention in drug pricing and the future of the Affordable Care Act.  These concerns have left Johnson and Johnson trading at 16.2x estimated CY17 EPS, which represents a discount to the broader market averages.  This reasonable multiple, the 2.8 percent dividend yield, and our expectation that JNJ should continue to grow faster, and in a more stable fashion than the overall market over the next five years, underpin our positive view of the stock at current levels. Lowe's (LOW) The home improvement sector has been one of the few attractive areas within retail for the past few years, and we think the strong relative performance can continue for a few more years as residential investment remains depressed compared to long-term historical averages.  LOW's effectively operates in a duopoly with competitor Home Depot, while the remaining industry competitors are too small to achieve the economies of scale that the two industry bellwethers enjoy.  In addition, LOW offers relative immunity from online competition from the likes of Amazon.com.  These characteristics are hard to find within the retail sector.  With regard to financial performance, earnings growth has been very strong over the past several years as solid sales growth has combined with margin expansion to produce high-teens EPS growth since 2009.  Based on continued positive sales and margin trends, we believe the company can continue to put up double-digit EPS growth for several more years.  As such, we think LOW represents good value.  The stock currently trades at an attractive multiple of 15.9 times estimated CY17 EPS, and the dividend yield is 1.9 percent. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft, best known for its Windows operating system, is a productivity software powerhouse that has made the move to the cloud and more of a subscription-based revenue model.  This transition has occurred over the past couple of years and has resulted in flat cash flow from operating activities.  Satya Nadella has done a superb job of changing the culture within the company to focus on making the best productivity software no matter the operating system on which it runs.  Azure is Microsoft's open, flexible, enterprise-grade cloud computing platform that has emerged as a strong number two to leading Amazon.  Office and server tools continue to appeal to commercial enterprises.  We see 2017 as the inflection year in which subscription revenue is large enough to consistently offset the loss of one-time (transactional) software sales.  This ongoing transformation should drive acceleration in revenue growth and margin expansion, leading to increased profitability and cash flow.  The bulk of the big investments have already been made, and the company is nearing its big, slow turn to the cloud.  Shareholder-friendly capital allocation should continue with a 2.5 percent dividend yield and 1 percent-2 percent of shares being repurchased each year.  The stock is trading at 20.7 times estimated CY17 EPS. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) Shares of Sprouts Farmers Market have suffered in recent months due largely to intensified competition and food price deflation.  The company, whose motto is ""healthy living for less"", operates healthy grocery stores that offer fresh, natural, non-GMO and organic food. Sprouts sits at the ideal intersection of natural/organic, affordability and accessibility. To drive foot traffic Sprouts prices its produce offering 20 percent-25 percent below traditional supermarkets, and even further below Whole Foods Markets and other natural foods competitors. This price point means Sprouts is attractive to both the everyday shopper and the hardcore natural foods customer.  Sprouts' footprint is largely in the Southwest, but the company is expanding east and adding 14 percent to its total square footage every year.  We believe that this rate of store growth, along with mid-single digit same-store sales growth from its relatively young store base, should translate to mid-teens revenue and EPS growth for the foreseeable future.  In addition, the company generates strong cash flow and is able to fund its store expansion internally while also returning capital to shareholders through a share buyback program. Sprouts is currently trading at 20.5 times estimated CY17 EPS. United Technologies (UTX) United Technologies is a diversified industrial company that provides products and services to the building systems and aerospace industries worldwide. The company's aerospace segments target both commercial and government (including both defense and space) customers. The company has a fantastic long-term track record of financial performance, with strong double-digit EPS growth, outstanding cash generation, and a rock-solid balance sheet.  However, recent performance has been held back by development costs for the company's ground-breaking new geared turbofan (GTF) jet engine as well as increasing competition and pricing pressure in Europe and China for Otis elevators (both equipment and service). We think the company is taking the appropriate action to improve performance in these two areas.  Once through the current investment phase, we think the company can ultimately return to sustainable double-digit EPS growth.  Based on those expectations, we continue to believe the company offers strong value for long-term investors, trading at 16.9 times estimated CY17 EPS - a significant discount to the overall market.  In addition, the current dividend yield is an attractive 2.4 percent. ",Top 10 stocks for 2017—commentary

In a 2015 memo, Clayton and his firm point to a settlement between Peabody Energy and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman when the coal company agreed to add climate-change risks to its annual SEC disclosures. And then reports surfaced about the SEC’s investigation of Exxon, which mirrors the Schneiderman investigation into whether Exxon misled investors in prior years about the risk of climate change. According to a December article by Inside Climate News, since Rex Tillerson became chief executive, Exxon’s official communications have supported mainstream climate science. Tillerson is now Trump’s nominee to be secretary of state. Exxon has put out at least three statements in support of the Paris climate agreement that Trump wants to exit, including calling it the “an important step forward.” At the 2015 annual meeting, however, Tillerson said it might be better to wait for better science before taking action on climate change. “What if everything we do, it turns out our models are lousy, and we don’t get the effects we predict?” he asked, according to the article. Sullivan & Cromwell emphasizes in one memo, “The SEC also indicates that there have been increasing requests for climate-related disclosures by shareholders of public companies.” Clayton personally represented Crude Carrier Corp. during its initial public offering.

Abigail Stevenson,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"While the market continues to focus on whether the Dow Jones industrial average will hit 20,000, Jim Cramer would rather look at how conceivable it is for the Dow to keep running after it does. Good news is that he does think it is possible. ""When you look at how far stocks would need to rally to get back to their all-time highs, you will find that many of these Dow names have been much higher in less fortuitous circumstances,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Cramer boiled it down to 12 encouraging stocks that must advance more than 10 percent to get back to their old highs. No. 1 is Wal-Mart, which would need to climb 32 percent to get back to where it was two years ago. With the strength of Amazon, Cramer recognized that this is a lot to ask and said he doesn't expect it to help the Dow get to 20,000. No. 2 is American Express. The stock has 28 percent to run back to its 2014, and Cramer recommended buying it at current levels. All it would take is a multiple expansion now that the multiple is in favor. No. 3 was IBM, which would have to mount a 26 percent gain to get back to its $216 high in 2013. Unfortunately, Cramer didn't think IBM will get back to a 15 price-to-earnings multiple up from its current 12. ""In truth, IBM should never have been as high as $216. Its earnings were inflated by buybacks and the price was hyped by hoopla surrounding Warren Buffett's anointment of the stock,"" Cramer said. No. 4 was Nike, the most intriguing stock to Cramer. Nike would need its stock to advance 26 percent to reach old highs, and Cramer thinks if Donald Trump can lower the corporate tax rate, it could help move it higher. However, he wasn't confident that it can close the gap between $53 and $67. No. 5 was Caterpillar, which also told investors it's not doing that well. It also would be the most hurt if Trump starts to play hardball with China, but it would also be a large beneficiary to a domestic infrastructure program. Cramer was willing to bet that the stock can creep towards its old level on positive commodity data and cost cuts from Trump. No. 6 and 7 were Exxon-Mobil and Chevron, which need to add 17 percent to get back to their old highs, and Cramer won't count on them to get the Dow to 20,000. ""Frankly, that is just asking too much of these stocks,"" Cramer said. No. 8 was Coca-Cola, and with a new CEO coming in, Cramer was willing to bet that the restructuring designed by outgoing CEO Muhtar Kent means the company will meet its numbers. However, he says the stock cannot be relied on to rally 14 percent to its former glory. No. 9 was Apple, and Cramer thinks the stock is looking like it will break out soon. It must advance a little more than 13 percent, and Cramer is concerned that Apple hasn't augmented its service revenue stream and isn't using its massive cash hoard to make more acquisitions. No. 10 was Cisco, which is still reeling from a downbeat quarter. Cramer wants Cisco to find a way to make it clear that its legacy business isn't hurting it as it transitions to more of a cloud play. He wasn't confident that the stock can rally 13 percent to its recent high. No. 11 and 12 was Disney and United Technologies, which need to rally 12 and 10 percent respectively to get to all-time highs. Based on Disney's theme park attendance, movies and potential to be a beneficiary of a corporate tax cut, Cramer called this one an ""up"" stock United Technologies will have a tough time gaining traction because of its recent strong run. If anything, Cramer expects the numbers to come down. So, while Cramer only found a few stocks among the list that could get back to old highs, many of them reached such high levels in a worse environment. Perhaps they can do it again.

Fred Imbert,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"U.S. equities closed higher in choppy trade on Wednesday, shrugging off a sharp decline in health care stocks following remarks made by President-elect Donald Trump. ""We have to get our drug industry coming back. Our drug industry has gotten disastrous. They're leaving left and right,"" Trump said at his first news conference since winning the U.S. election. The Nasdaq composite fell after Trump made his remarks, as the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) fell 3 percent. The tech-heavy index, however, ended the session 0.2 percent higher at a record closing level. The S&P 500 advanced 0.3 percent, shrugging off a 1 percent decline in health care. Energy stocks led the way in the S&P, rising 1.2 percent. Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, said the stock market has largely given Trump  the benefit of the doubt. He said that would change after the inauguration. ""After that point, his actions will become more important versus what he says,"" he said. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 99 points higher, with Goldman Sachs and IBM contributing the most gains. The blue-chips index briefly turned lower after Trump's remarks on the pharmaceutical industry. Investors came into the news conference looking for clues about his proposed policies. Stocks in the U.S. have rallied sharply since Trump's victory, amid hope that the incoming administration will cut corporate taxes, deregulate certain sectors and inject fiscal stimulus into the economy. Trump's news conference concluded without him providing details on these policies. ""We need some concrete numbers. We haven't sold off because there hasn't been a reason to do so. That said, you're dealing with some pretty nervous longs here,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""Our hope is that these three policies will be enacted and a more pragmatic approach will be taken to trade and immigration,"" said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. He also said he expects Trump to wait until the after the inauguration to provide more guidance on his policies. That said, some of the president-elect's tweets have raised concerns among investors. Since Nov. 8, Trump has taken to Twitter to criticize companies that planned to send jobs overseas rather than create them in the United States. He has also threatened to levy a high border tax against those firms. ""What's interesting about Trump is he's sort of managed to work around the traditional news cycle,"" said Tom Siomades, head of Hartford Funds Investment Consulting Group. ""The market is also grappling with that, too."" ""Companies like Airbus and Boeing will not only have to think about their input cost, but they will also have to pay attention to (the) PR perspective,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. Separately, Trump's nominee for secretary of State Rex Tillerson, testified on Capitol Hill at his confirmation hearing. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil CEO, has raised concerns among most of the Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Republican Marco Rubio, given his lack of public service experience and close ties to Russia. ""There's so much that could come out from those hearings,"" said Hartford Funds' Siomades. ""This cast of characters is not well known, and the market could react to that."" Wall Street also braced itself for the start of earnings season, as banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, among others, are slated to report quarterly results on Friday. ""I think we're going to get a good earnings season,"" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. ""The question is can the market sustain the euphoria with what could still be considered relatively modest earnings growth."" In the bond market, meanwhile, U.S. Treasurys traded higher after Trump's news conference, with the benchmark 10-year note yield falling to 2.365 percent and the two-year note yield holding near 1.18 percent. The U.S. dollar fell 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies after trading higher, with the euro near $1.057 and the yen around 115.38. The pound briefly fell around 1 percent against the dollar, breaking below $1.21. Sterling last traded at $1.22. Overseas, European equities traded higher, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index advancing 0.23 percent. In Asia, Chinese stocks closed lower overnight, with the Shanghai composite  dropping 0.79 percent, while the Japanese Nikkei 225  recorded a gain of 0.33 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 19,954.28, with Merck leading advancers and Pfizer  lagging. The S&P 500 rose 6.42 points, or 0.28 percent, to end at 2,275.32, with energy leading eight sectors higher and health care the top decliner. The Nasdaq composite advanced 11.83 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 5,563.65. About two stocks advanced for every decliner at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 878.84 million and a composite volume of 3.563 billion at the close.

Scott Levine,01122017,Fool,01052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The election of Donald Trump has many wondering whether the renewable energy industry will continue to flourish in the United States. Much to FuelCell Energy's (NASDAQ:FCEL) delight, though, there are several signs suggesting that America's neighbors to the north have no intention of slowing down. Though it's uncertain how advantageous this is for FuelCell Energy, it does represent some interesting opportunities -- opportunities that could possibly translate to ever-elusive profits. Let's take a closer look. Image source: Getty Images. There's certainly been no shortage of talk about pipelines extending from Canada recently. Stealing some of the headlines from the Dakota Access Pipeline, another familiar name -- Keystone XL -- has been reappearing since Donald Trump revealed his support of the pipeline to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Both leaders' apparent enthusiasm for activity in the oil sands bodes well for FuelCell Energy, which recently revealed its participation in related studies. Partnering with Alberta Innovates, FuelCell Energy will conduct an engineering study for a fuel-cell carbon capture application at a heavy oil refinery near Saskatchewan. According to FuelCell Energy's press release, ""A second potential site, the Scotford bitumen upgrading facility near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, will also be evaluated as part of the engineering study."" Operated by Royal Dutch Shell, the facility is part of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project -- site of the first commercial application of carbon capture and storage in the oil sands industry. FuelCell Energy also revealed in its press release that should the study prove that the application is a success, it could lead to ""a megawatt-scale fuel cell carbon application at an existing gas-fired plant."" It's not just the oil sands that represent an opportunity for FuelCell Energy, but coal power as well. The Canadian government recently announced its plan to phase out traditional coal-power plants by 2030. In working toward that goal, the government will work with four provinces to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from coal-power plants. Canada's commitment could benefit FuelCell Energy, as the company began a partnership with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) last spring on developing technology for carbon capture through a new application of carbonate fuel cells. A 2.8 MW DFC3000 fuel-cell power plant. Image source: FuelCell Energy corporate website. Addressing the benefits of this application, Chip Bottone, FuelCell Energy's president and CEO, recognized that, ""Carbon capture with carbonate fuel cells is a potential game-changer for affordably and efficiently concentrating carbon dioxide for large-scale gas and coal-fired power plants."" Testing the fuel cell carbon capture technology with its DFC3000 fuel-cell power system at a 2.7 gigawatt mixed-use coal- and gas-fired power plant in Alabama, the company estimates that the DFC3000 fuel-cell power system reduces approximately 70% of a plant's smog-producing pollutants like nitrogen oxides and remove 90% of carbon from the exhaust stream. Between the oil sands and transition from coal power, Canada's opportunities may very well be sources of revenue for FuelCellEnergy in the years to come. Unfortunately, those years are considerably down the line, and the company has much more pressing issues to contend with right now -- so much so that it may never get to realize those opportunities in the Great White North. Updating investors in December, management reported that it was ""reducing materials spend as well as implementing various cost control initiatives"" in order to achieve its long-term goals. The company, for example, reduced its global workforce by 17% as well as implementing other measures in order to reduce its operating expenses by $6 million on an annualized basis. This would translate to an approximate reduction of 14% based on the $42 million that the company reported in fiscal 2015. Further illustrating the company's precarious position, management noted it was forecasting revenue to fall to a range of $107 million to $109 million for fiscal 2016 -- a far cry from the range of $170 million to $210 million that it had forecast on the Q4 conference call in 2015. No longer a contender for the Beacon Falls Energy Park -- worth a potential $500 million between equipment and service over its life, according to management -- FuelCell Energy is relying on the more than $400 million it has in contracted backlog as of Oct. 31, 2016 to keep the lights on. Any opportunities in Canada that inspire hopes of profits must be tempered by the reality that the company is still struggling to prove the advantages of its fuel-cell solutions to customers.

Investors haven't been happy with IBM (NYSE:IBM) lately. Since Ginni Rometty started as CEO in January of 2012, IBM has seen 18 consecutive quarters of year-over-year declining revenue -- essentially every quarter of her tenure. The stock has lost nearly 10% compared to a gain of 78% for the S&P 500 over the last five years. IBM 5 Year Price Returns (Daily) data by YCharts. For IBM shareholders, Ginni Rometty's four-year reign as chief executive officer hasn't been anything to go to Disneyland about. But her company has become a leader in one corporate category: board members willing to shovel incentive pay at a CEO turning in a mediocre performance. With all the negative sentiment and equally dismal stock performance, should investors have any hope that IBM will right the ship? IBM believes it can, and it's betting the future on Watson. You may recall how Ken Jennings, famous for his 74 consecutive wins on Jeopardy, was dethroned by Watson, the IBM supercomputer. Why would a company risk so much on a game-playing computer? The key is not in the computer as much as in the science behind it. IBM's Watson beats 74-time Jeopardy champion Ken Jennings.  Image source: Flickr user edwardhblake. Watson is a system based on artificial intelligence (AI). Computer simulations of the human brain, called neural networks, mimic humans' capacity to learn. Using massive amounts of data and complex algorithms, an AI system gradually learns to recognize similarities and distinguish differences. It is taught to recognize patterns within massive amounts of data. IBM has been betting heavily on Watson by leveraging its AI platform and data analytics for a variety of business applications. The company's CEO has said that, in the next five years, every major decision -- personal or business -- will be made with the help of Watson. Several recent high-profile partnerships illustrate how IBM has been approaching this goal, and the strategy appears to be gaining steam. UA Record smartphone app powers Healthbox.     Image source: Under Armour. Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA) announced a strategic partnership with IBM to leverage the 190 million registered users of its Connected Fitness platform and Watson's deep-learning technology. The system would provide users with individual health and fitness insights backed by data. It is intended to act as a personal health consultant, fitness trainer, and assistant. This collaboration underpins the HealthBox, Under Armour's connected fitness system, which combines a fitness band, digital scale, heart-rate monitor, and the UA Record smartphone app. It will track sleep, fitness, activity, nutrition, and training information, and provide personalized recommendations. This is a valuable project for IBM since Watson learns with each infusion of data. The partnership is a win for Under Armour as well, and is part of a bigger play. Its acquisition of three fitness app companies that now comprise its Connected Fitness platform, the release of Healthbox, and the integration of Watson provides Under Armour with an end-to-end health and fitness solution that connects to its users in a very real way. This will likely drive future adoption and boost customer satisfaction. OnStar Go powered by Watson. Image source: General Motors Company. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) partnered with IBM to pair its OnStar vehicle-communication system with Watson's learning capabilities to create OnStar Go, a cognitive mobility platform. According to the press release, the new platform's numerous benefits include helping drivers avoid traffic, giving them the ability to order coffee on the go, making restaurant recommendations, and reminding users to pick up diapers and formula on the way home. Drivers will have to consent, and Watson will recognize their preferences and patterns in their decisions and habits. This will also develop individualized and location-based marketing. The partnership will present other business opportunities. OnStar has already signed iHeartRadio, which will provide personalized musical experiences, and MasterCard, which will allow consumers to pay for gas and other services from their car. Other partners include ExxonMobil, Glympse, and Parkopedia. iOS enterprise developers get access to Watson. Image source: IBM. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM's partnership was first announced over two years ago but has evolved in the meantime. Initially, the pair planned the development of over 100 enterprise apps for a variety of industries, including retail, healthcare, banking, transportation, and insurance. According to a recent announcement, enterprise iOS users will have in-app access to Watson, opening the door to deep-learning technology for these made-for-business apps. iOS app developers will be able to use Watson's AI as a platform for their own apps. Apple has already benefited from the partnership by gaining inroads into enterprise. IBM announced last year that it had begun to replace its PCs with Apple Mac computers. Employees were given the option to make the switch and 73% chose Mac. In a presentation at Jamf Nation User Conference, a gathering of Mac system administrators, IBM told attendees that PCs were three times more expensive to manage, Macs had a lower total cost of ownership, and that the Mac was the standard at IBM Japan -- PCs were the exception. These recent developments will provide greater validation to Apple's prospective enterprise customers while advancing the company's AI agenda. Apple has an installed base of over 1 billion active iOS devices with a growing percentage of those in enterprise. This, combined with Watson's ability to learn from streams of data, will provide both companies with a stronger relative position from which to compete. These collaborations are merely the most high-profile examples of hundreds going on behind the scenes. IBM tweeted earlier this year that more than 500 partners and 80,000 developers were building products and apps powered by Watson. The installed base that comes with the partnerships is growing, and should eventually show up in IBM's revenue and provide vindication for the company's Watson-centric strategy. IBM expects Watson to contribute $1 billion in revenue by 2018, and $10 billion by 2023, though it doesn't currently break out that contribution. Strategic Initiatives, where Watson's revenue resides was $8 billion in the most recent quarter, of $19 billion total revenue for IBM. It's a relatively small slice for IBM now, but it's clear the company expects to build AI into a major pillar of its business in the next few years. If it works, it might just reverse fortunes for the flailing big tech company.  ","

Clayton and his firm have sounded the siren for its clients on climate-change disclosure in more than one memo, strongly encouraging corporations to disclose climate change related risks to the SEC and investors. The memos also highlight the legal consequences companies like Exxon and Peabody Energy

In a 2015 memo, Clayton and his firm point to a settlement between Peabody Energy and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman when the coal company agreed to add climate-change risks to its annual SEC disclosures. And then reports surfaced about the SEC’s investigation of Exxon, which mirrors the Schneiderman investigation into whether Exxon misled investors in prior years about the risk of climate change. According to a December article by Inside Climate News, since Rex Tillerson became chief executive, Exxon’s official communications have supported mainstream climate science. Tillerson is now Trump’s nominee to be secretary of state. Exxon has put out at least three statements in support of the Paris climate agreement that Trump wants to exit, including calling it the “an important step forward.” At the 2015 annual meeting, however, Tillerson said it might be better to wait for better science before taking action on climate change. “What if everything we do, it turns out our models are lousy, and we don’t get the effects we predict?” he asked, according to the article. Sullivan & Cromwell emphasizes in one memo, “The SEC also indicates that there have been increasing requests for climate-related disclosures by shareholders of public companies.” Clayton personally represented Crude Carrier Corp. during its initial public offering. The company’s IPO filing included a lengthy disclosure of its risks related to climate-change policies.

It was first major international law firm to join, according to a press release. “We are committed,” said Sullivan & Cromwell chairman H. Rodgin Cohen at the time, “to being a socially responsible member of all the communities in which we practice.” The memos also remind clients state attorneys general like Schneiderman and California’s Governor Jerry Brown have vowed to continue with their efforts to hold fossil fuel and utility interests accountable on climate change, even if the Trump SEC drops the issue. See also:  Trump’s SEC may take aim at corporate disclosure It remains to be seen whether Clayton will take the SEC back to its lax enforcement days on the climate change disclosure issue or if he will carry his firm’s advice over to agency policy. At stake, writes Anderson, is the SEC’s interpretive guidance on climate change disclosure provided to companies in 2010, and the SEC’s related investigation into Exxon. The President-elect’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment on Clayton’s climate change disclosure support or relationship with Exxon.

Jack Hough,01122017,MarketWatch,01052017,"Published: Jan 9, 2017 9:49 a.m. ET Why actively managed mutual funds are poised to make a comeback after years of being trounced by ETFs By In 2017, consider committing an act of financial heresy: Buy an actively managed mutual fund. Look for one whose manager is frugal, odd and stubborn—or, put more politely, a value manager with high active share and low turnover. The ideal candidates will have disappointed in 2015 but shined in 2016. We list seven funds for consideration. A long, humiliating period for professional stockpickers might be giving way to something different. Stocks that have moved in near unison in recent years are beginning to chart more distinct paths. Data points that haven’t mattered in a decade, like the ­relationship between prices and fundamental measures of value, are starting to have more sway on returns. The divide between cheap stocks and expensive ones remains exceptionally wide, which could mean last year’s shift in favor of value investing is just the beginning. We know: Recommending a shift to active fund management now is a little like saying the time is right to take up smoking. Evidence to the contrary is vast and convincing. Most stockpickers struggle to beat their benchmarks. Index funds, by contrast, have much to recommend them, ­including simplicity, low fees, and tax efficiency. Investors have been stripping money out of active funds and stuffing it in passive ones at a record pace, and following the herd has never looked so smart. But for tactical investors, the timing might be good for a contrarian move. All that cash pouring into index funds might have flattered the relative performance of the indexes in recent years. And the broad U.S. stock market trades at an elevated valuation. “I have no religious objection to index funds,” says Larry Pitkowsky, co-manager of the GoodHaven fund

                                   launched in 2011. “But investors are stepping on the gas with valuations high. If anything, it’s better to use an index when the market is cheap.” From here, returns for index investing could underwhelm for a while, and talented value managers should be better rewarded for their efforts. Meanwhile, recent evidence points to better ways to identify promising funds than simply searching for five-year standouts. Don’t smoke. Don’t even vape. But do consider complementing a core portfolio of low-cost index funds with targeted bets on active management—what indexing champion Vanguard calls a core-and-satellite approach. In what follows, we don’t intend to argue that active beats passive, broadly speaking, because too many active managers are either high-fee index huggers or else fidgety flippers who add hidden costs that sap returns. But the question isn’t whether active management as a whole is a good deal. It’s whether any fund managers can reliably outperform, over long time periods or ­under certain conditions, and whether investors can identify those managers and conditions ahead of time. On that question, we’re somewhere between a strong maybe and a sheepish probably. And now seems like a low-risk time to give active a chance. This year will mark the 15th anniversary of a publication that causes active fund managers to toss in their 1,020 thread-count sheets. It’s the Spiva Scorecard. The acronym stands for Standard & Poor’s Indices Versus Active. Among other things, the biannual report now published in eight world regions shows the percentage of active funds that fail to beat their benchmarks. In 2015, 66% of large-cap funds did worse than the S&P 500 index

                                   . That was almost cause for popping Champagne corks. Just a year earlier, 86% came up short. When the 2016 numbers come out, expect them to be damning, too. Since 2000, there have only been three years when most U.S. large-cap managers succeeded at what they do for a living. Results across other size and style categories are poor, too. The Spiva reports beget a steady flow of news stories about the failings of active funds, and investors have been taking action. Over the past five years, passive funds have received inflows of more than $1 trillion. Last year, active funds saw withdrawals of more than $200 billion, a postcrisis high. Active funds still hold two-thirds of mutual fund money. If index funds simply accept market prices as they are, and active funds seek to identify pricing mistakes and exploit them, the stampede to the former from the latter raises the question of whether stock pricing has been affected. In recent years, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has tracked a trading strategy that buys what active managers shun, and shuns what they buy, to profitable effect. As cash flows toward indexes, it flows almost by definition against the interests of active funds. Many active funds have taken to what’s derided as closet indexing, in which managers stick close to the benchmarks for fear of being drastically wrong in any single year, thereby marring their marketing brochures. But, of course, that’s a recipe for gradual but certain failure. Active funds have higher fees than passive ones. If the two funds hold much the same merchandise, the costlier one will usually do worse. Research by Martijn Cremers, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame, has shown that funds with high active share—that is, ones whose portfolios are distinct from their benchmarks—tend to outperform after fees. The struggles of active funds, it would seem, might boil down to managers not being bold enough to justify their fees. There’s just one problem. A paper published last July by S&P showed that even after ignoring fees, active funds tend to lag behind their benchmarks. If fees aren’t the problem, what is? Maybe there’s ­another, hidden drag on industry returns. Or maybe stockpickers are just bad at picking stocks. There is, indeed, a hidden drag. Trading costs aren’t included in a fund’s published expenses. That makes them a possible explanation for why so many ­active funds underperform even before fees are subtracted. In a study published in November in the Journal of Financial Economics, Cremers looks at how active share and average holding periods jointly relate to performance. Funds with high active share and long holding periods, he finds, tend to outperform by two percentage points a year after fees. Those with high active share and short holding periods underperform. Different is good, but only if it comes with lasting conviction. As for the skill of stockpickers themselves, reliably bad ones aren’t supposed to exist any more than reliably good ones, according to efficient-market devotees. But strange things are happening. Looking at the Spiva record since 2000, the first eight years show 55% of active funds doing worse than their benchmarks. The most recent eight years show 65% underperforming. Fees for active and index funds have fallen by ­similar amounts since 2000. So why are stockpickers getting worse? “I think the big inflows have perpetuated the ­performance of passive,” says John Linehan, manager of the $22.7 billion T. Rowe Price Equity Income fund

                                   “If you own companies outside the index, you’ve been disadvantaged. Nothing can go on like that forever.” In Linehan’s view, passive portfolios will reach a breaking point when valuations become too skewed relative to those in active portfolios, and fund flows are no longer pushing the indexes to outperform. “When people are piling into a trade, it can pay to take the other side,” he says. That happened just after the dot-com stock bubble, which is one of the periods when even average active managers beat the benchmarks. Another such period occurred around the market top in 2007. The stock market doesn’t have to tumble for good active managers to earn their fees now, however. All that’s needed are some changes in the pattern of individual stock returns. One change that could already be underway is a long-awaited comeback for value stocks. Barron’s predicted just such a comeback in “Move Over, Facebook and Netflix: Value Investing Is ­Rebounding” (March 12, 2016). Since then, the iShares Russell 1000 Value exchange-traded fund

                                   Such shifts can play out over many years. During the last good run for value stocks, after the dot-com bust, they beat growth in five out of seven years by ­double-digit percentages. Value stocks still look like a good deal now, says Bob Schmidt, manager of the Brandes Institute, which researches market ­behavior on behalf of Brandes Investment Partners, a San Diego value manager overseeing $28 billion. Schmidt divides the world’s stocks into 10 equal groups, ranked by the ratio of share prices to tangible book value. On average, he found that over the past two decades, the cheapest decile was about 40% as expensive as the costliest. By last year, that figure had fallen to 15%. The only period close to that was during the dot-com bubble, at 25%. “During the tech-stock bubble, many active managers had a hard time keeping up with Dell, Cisco, and AOL,” says Schmidt. “Until recently, it was the same thing with Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix.” There are other green shoots for active managers, according to Jill Hall, a stock strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch. Correlations among stocks have been coming down, and the spread between the best-performing and worst-performing stocks has been widening. In other words, conditions are becoming more favorable for stockpickers, or at least less punishing. Read: Mark Hulbert on the real message behind those plunging stock-market correlations In a report published this past week, strategists at Nomura Instinet predict that the market is at or near “peak passive” and will soon experience an “active renaissance.” Active managers have gone through periods when they struggled to keep up with their benchmarks, followed by periods of mean ­reversion when they outperformed. The last big slumps occurred in the mid-1970s, the years around 1990, and the late ’90s dot-com bubble. “We believe the direction of interest rates is the key determinant of when mean reversion occurs,” the strategists wrote. “Rising rates ­anticipate economic growth, which benefits small-cap stocks, and when small-caps outperform, market diversity increases, giving active managers a tail wind.” Don’t expect active managers to begin beating benchmarks as a class. For talented managers, however, there could be more of what we see among the funds on our list—underperformance giving way to outperformance as the market begins repricing undervalued shares. For purposes of judging the talent of value managers, a poor 2015 is excusable. It might even be a badge of honor. That year, dot-com highfliers soared, and many cheap stocks got cheaper. Moreover, the best managers tend not to have spotless records. A recent Morningstar analysis showed some surprising characteristics among the top 10% of active mutual funds by performance over the past two decades. On average, they trailed their benchmarks in one out of every three rolling three-year periods. The shortfall during those slumps was close to three percentage points a year. During their worst three-year stretches, they underperformed by nine percentage points a year. That said, we restricted our list—compiled in part based on screen results from Morningstar—to funds that did well in 2016, when value stocks began coming around. Closet indexers are generally funds with an active share of 20% to 60%. The funds on our list have active share ranging from the top of that range to well above it. In general, a fund with a high active share works well as an add-on to a passive portfolio. Expect it to have plenty of volatility relative to the broad market. A good fund whose active share is only slightly above average has potential as a core holding, provided its fees are competitive. AllianzGI NFJ Dividend Value

Its managers screen the market to select the cheapest slice based on the relationship between share prices and the value of a company’s assets. They then favor smaller and more-prosperous companies. The approach keeps costs and turnover low for an active fund, but not returns. Over the past 15 years, the fund has beaten the S&P 500 by nearly two percentage points a year.

The GoodHaven fund is managed by a pair of alumni from the Fairholme fund, which is known for concentrated positions and spectacular periods of over- and underperformance, mostly the former. This has added up to long-term returns well ahead of the market, but also plenty of discomfort along the way. Launched in 2011, GoodHaven, too, is keeping things interesting.

,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"The deal, Exxon’s biggest since its 2009 buyout of XTO Energy, is the latest by oil producers across the Permian since last summer, with technological improvements and rangebound oil prices fueling the buyouts. Exxon is exchanging an initial $5.6 billion in stock for leases covering roughly 275,000 acres from the Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas. Additional payments of up to $1 billion will start in 2020, depending on how the acreage performs, Exxon said in a statement. Most of the wells to be drilled on the land should provide “attractive returns” with oil prices CLc1 at or above $40 per barrel, Exxon spokeswoman Suann Guthrie said. Much of the Permian’s oil can be pumped at current prices of about $53 per barrel, whereas the economics of other large U.S. shale fields require a price of $60 per barrel or more. About 250,000 acres is on three large parcels in the Permian, and the rest is on oil fields in Colorado and Louisiana. The Permian land, which Exxon estimates holds 3.4 billion barrels of oil retrievable with current technology, produces about 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), most of which is crude. Most of the acreage is held by production, meaning Exxon will not have to rush to add new wells to honor lease contracts. Exxon pumps about 140,000 boepd from its current Permian holdings of roughly 1.5 million acres. The company operates 10 drilling rigs in the Permian and said it will boost that to 25 to develop the new acreage, though no timetable has been set. The deal is the first major move by Chief Executive Darren Woods since he took over from Rex Tillerson, who has been nominated by President-elect Donald Trump to be U.S. secretary of state. Exxon plans to run the acreage through its XTO subsidiary, which operates elsewhere in Texas and North Dakota. Exxon’s shares were up about 0.6 percent in midday trading. ","

,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"Last July SABIC, one of the world’s largest petrochemicals groups, said it was studying whether to build a petrochemical complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast with an Exxon affiliate. The project would supply ethylene to other units making derivatives. SABIC chief executive Yousef al-Benyan told Reuters on Thursday that he would travel to the United States at the end of this month to look at the proposed project. “The outlook is still very positive...We will be working with Exxon Mobil to come up with a very strong competitive structure of this project. “We are very excited about current developments with Exxon Mobil, not only the cracker but also in the downstream type of projects we are going to do.” He added that SABIC would probably make an announcement about the ethylene project in the second quarter of this year, though this was not certain. SABIC is keen to invest abroad to diversify its risks and improve its access to foreign markets. Benyan said the company was looking to make other U.S. investments worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. “We think SABIC needs to strengthen its position in the U.S. and leverage the current growth of demand for our commodity business.” He did not give details of the possible investments but said, “Some of them will be partnerships and some will be alone, because I think we in SABIC have the capability to do that ourselves.” Asked about the outlook for SABIC’s sales in the United States under president-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to promote local companies, Benyan said that because of its U.S. facilities, SABIC viewed itself as a local manufacturer. He also said he did not at present see any risk to SABIC’s assets from last September’s vote in the U.S. Congress to allow relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. “This is part of our continuous risk assessment that we have within our corporate finances, but at this point we don’t see any problem, and this will never really change our mind about growing our business in the United States.” ","

,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp plans to overhaul a gasoline producing unit and the hydrocracker at its 560,500 barrel per day (bpd) Baytown, Texas, refinery in March, sources familiar with plant operations said on Friday. The 90,000 bpd gasoline-producing Fluidic Catalytic Cracking Unit 2 and the 25,000 bpd Hydrocracking Unit 1 will be shut along with other units during the overhaul, the sources said. FCCU 2 is the smaller of two cat crackers at the refinery. The 125,000 bpd FCCU 1 will remain in operation during the work. HCU 1 is the only hydrocracker at the refinery. A hydrocracker uses hydrogen under high pressure to produce motor fuels, primarily diesel from gas oil. The Baytown refinery is the second largest in the United States and Exxon’s largest U.S. refinery. ","

Tom DiChristopher,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"The world's biggest publicly traded energy company is joining the land rush in the prolific Permian Basin. Exxon Mobil announced Tuesday it will pay $5.6 billion in stock to acquire companies owned by Texas' Bass family that control parts of the Permian in New Mexico. The purchase roughly doubles Exxon's holdings in the basin, adding acreage with an estimated 3.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The assets are located in the Delaware Basin, part of the larger Permian. The deal is the largest oil and gas acquisition in the United States since crude prices crashed in November 2014, according to Houston-based oil and gas research firm PLS. It tops the previous record-setting $4.4 billion purchase of Memorial Resources by Range Resources in May. ""This acquisition strengthens Exxon Mobil's significant presence in the dominant U.S. growth area for onshore oil production,"" Exxon Chairman and CEO Darren W. Woods said in a statement. ""This investment gives us an exceptional Delaware Basin position ... that can generate attractive returns in a low-price environment."" Shares of Exxon were up modestly Tuesday. The Delaware Basin has lately boasted eye-popping land prices. Deals there made up the bulk of last year's $69 billion in U.S. energy mergers and acquisitions. Permian acreage is a prized because the basin's geology allows drillers to produce oil at very low prices and profit from the operations even as a severe crude price downturn extends into a third year. The adjusted per-acre price for Exxon's purchase comes in at about $20,000, ""a very good number for New Mexico,"" said Andrew Dittmar, mergers and acquisitions analyst at PLS. Exxon will pay the Basses, a prominent Forth Worth energy family, up to $1 billion in cash contingent on the land's production. The deal marks the second recent purchase of Delaware Basin assets controlled by a storied energy family. In September, EOG Resources bought Yates Petroleum for $2.5 billion. The Yates family's history in American oil stretches back about a century. EOG paid about $9,000 per acre in that deal, which was also centered on New Mexico's Lea and Eddy counties, PLS data shows. Exxon's deal also comes just one day after Noble Energy paid $3.2 billion, including debt, to buy Clayton Williams Energy. That acquisition focused on assets in the southern Delaware Basin in Texas, at a price of $33,000 per acre, according to PLS. ",Exxon Mobil doubles oil and gas holdings in Permian for $5.6 billion

He also said: ""When you start seeing volatility in other macro markets — specifically FX — that's going to take its toll on stocks."" The U.S. dollar spiked against a basket of currencies on the back of strong U.S. economic data. The Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell about 100 points in afternoon ET before closing about 70 points lower, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. The index also recorded a five-day losing streak. ""I think this is a pause ahead of the inauguration because there is so much policy uncertainty,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""We don't know what they will be focusing on first."" Trump is set to take the oath of office on Friday. The S&P 500 dropped around a third of a percent, with real estate leading decliners. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3 percent. ""Part of it is people taking profit off the table,"" said John Traynor, chief investment officer at People's United Bank. ""We were surprised by the November-December rally, so taking profit off the table the day before the inauguration makes sense."" Stocks in the United States rallied to record highs following Trump's victory in November, on the back of expectations for lower corporate taxes, more government spending and deregulation of certain sectors. ""The stock market tends to like a straightforward story, so if the new administration concentrates on its pro-growth policy actions, the narrative stays relatively simple and shares may find good reasons to continue their climb,"" Robert Landry, portfolio manager at USAA, said in a note. ""But if other priorities compete for the president's energy and focus — immediate repeal of the Affordable Care Act, creation of costly trade barriers and any number of foreign policy actions, just to name a few — the growth story could get muddled and the markets choppy,"" Landry said. Several Trump cabinet nominees were testified before Congress, including Treasury secretary designate Steven Mnuchin. In his testimony, Mnuchin denied that OneWest Bank — a bank he owned — was a ""'foreclose machine.' This is not true. On the contrary, I was committed to loan modifications intended to stop foreclosures,"" he said. Mnuchin also expressed concerns that the ""Volcker Rule"" — a component of the Dodd-Frank law meant to block banks from speculating with customers' money — is actually hurting the country's financial system by limiting liquidity. In economic news, weekly jobless claims dropped 15,000 to 234,000, around their lowest levels in 40 years. Housing starts, meanwhile, spiked 11.3 percent in December, beating estimates. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve business conditions index rose to 23.6, above a consensus estimate of 15.8. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets in London, said the Philly Fed data shows ""how optimistic the [manufacturing] industry is under the leadership of new upcoming president. This will support the U.S. economy further and strengthen the jobs market further."" U.S. Treasury yields extended gains following the data releases, with the benchmark 10-year note yield breaking above 2.487 percent, while the two-year note yield advanced to 1.238 percent. Yields also received a boost from remarks made by Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday, when she said the U.S. economy was close to reaching the Fed's goals. Investors in the U.S. also focused on corporate quarterly results as earnings season continued. Bank of New York Mellon and Union Pacific were among the companies reporting before the bell, with Dow components IBM and American Express set to report after the close. Video streaming giant Netflix saw its shares rose 3.8 percent, having posted solid results on strong subscriber growth. Overseas, European equities traded mostly lower after the European Central Bank kept monetary policy unchanged. The euro briefly fell versus the dollar after ECB President Mario Draghi said in a news conference there is no sign of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 72.32 points, or 0.37 percent, to close at 19,732.40, with Exxon Mobil leading decliners and UnitedHealth the biggest advancer. The S&P 500 dropped 8.20 points, or 0.36 percent, to end at 2,263.69, with real estate leading nine sectors lower and industrials and telecommunications as the only risers. The Nasdaq composite dropped 15.57 points, or 0.28 percent, to close at 5,540.08. About three stocks declined for every advancer at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 755.18 million and a composite volume of 3.158 billion at the close. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 12.4. Gold futures for February delivery settled $10.60 lower at $1,201.50 per ounce.

 ,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"Following are excerpts from a CNBC interview with Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of Total, from the World Economic Forum 2017 with Steve Sedgwick SS: Patrick great to see you again. Look the world is seemingly a different place 12 months on, the oil price has pretty much doubled. Does that make your job a lot easier? PP: For sure it is easier at 55 dollar then 28 dollar.  . I don't know if the word is easier. I begin to believe that the oil price is maybe a leading indicator of the mood of the world. But you know when you compare the situation one year ago, price collapse to 28 dollar a barrel, and the atmosphere in Davos was not very optimistic. This year is 55 but I remind you two years ago it was 100. So still some gap to do. People are more positive. And at the same time the status of the world did not improve a lot you know, in the one year many events in the Middle East, Brexit, many difficulties appear around the world so, but people are more positive. SS: Well that's interesting because we've seen the markets recover, we've seen the oil price recover and yet we've seen a whole host of quite damning political events for many in 2016 as well. But you think despite those political events the world is actually a more positive place and perhaps a safer place? PP: Safer, no. Not safer. There are many uncertainties. I would say what characterize the world for me today is a lot of uncertainty which is not good for business. There is an economist who was saying at the beginning of the century you have a difference between risks and uncertainty, risk you can manage, you can quantify risks. Uncertainty you don't know. And today what I face is many uncertainty- we are waiting to see what the foreign policy of Donald Trump will be, clearly Brexit and there is huge uncertainty over the future of Europe and how you deal with such a country outside of the European union, plus of course in the Middle East Iran is back because of the agreement last year- it involved many difficulties around. So there is much uncertainty. SS: All right, well you've mentioned three very important areas as well- Mr. Trump, Iran and Europe's cohesion. Let's start off with Mr. Trump as well. How's it going to be for you, do you think actually he's going to change the way that oil companies are going to do business in the US and elsewhere, do you think there's going to be any meteoric changes at all? PP:I think clearly, on energy, there are plenty of specialist of energy in this government, he has strong feeling that energy is one of the advantage of the U.S. economy already today in fact. So he's willing to not put too much regulations in order to help the investment in energy so it's good for energy companies, at least for oil and gas companies, so it's positive I think from these companies' point of view. We'll see then what he will do exactly- because you know there is a difference between what you say and when you are in power. We will see. SS: You say oil and gas companies, the oil companies are becoming more and more gas and oil companies and so the push to cleaner hydrocarbons, to renewables as well, the big investments that you at Total have been in making in green energy, in solar, in storage as well. Do you think a lot of that is actually going to be more difficult to carry on with large levels of investment because of Mr. Trump? PP: Not for gas, you know gas is one the big advantage of the U.S. economy, the shale gas revolution is at the heart of this rejuvenation of the US manufacturing industry, it is energy which is at the core of the capacity of the US to grow their manufacturing industry, to develop jobs. By the way we have invested in gas in the US this year, we have extended our position in Texas, in the Barnett. We just announced a deal with a (company name not clear) a gas company that wants to export energy. So for me US gas is working well. Renewables, we are also shown some progress- I suspect maybe the fiscal incentives which have been planned for renewables maybe will diminish but we will see. SS: That's quite damning in what is arguably the world's largest consumer of energy. PP: Yeah but OK in the meantime renewables have made progress so again it's a matter- I think there will be some debate between the congress, the President so we will see what the outcome will be of all that. But I'm positive, I think the U.S. economy is already strong. So I don't know if Mr. Trump will be able to do it stronger but it seems that it is his vision but we will see what he is doing exactly. SS: It's  no secret that Exxon Mobil and Total, and Total backed by a lot of other companies have a difference of opinion of a way to approach climate change and approach sustainability and what the remedy might be for oil and gas companies. How do you think Rex Tillerson might be as Secretary of State and what does it mean do you think for relations with other players including Russia? PP: There are many questions there. Climate change, Russia you know. I think first, I think the testimony from Rex Tillerson was quite clear- he believes in climate change, then there is the question of what is the strategy of Exxon now that he is no longer in charge. The difference was more between Exxon and Total: Should we involve the company in this green energy business to prepare for the future, that is a strategy decision, we believe that it is a matter of market, not just climate change, if we want to find new growth we can continue in oil and gas but at a certain point demand could peak so we prefer to prepare for the future and invest some of our money in renewable energy storage. Having said that, in twenty years we still remain an oil and gas company. But having also a foot in renewables. SS: And the second point, Mr. Tillerson knows Russia very well, you know Russia very well. There seems to be from Mr. Trump language of a rapprochement with Mr. Putin as well. Do you think it can benefit Total and the whole oil and gas industry? PP: It's not only the oil and gas industry, it's more a matter of world stability. Clearly Russia is a big player, by the way each time you have a new U.S. President- George W. Bush, Barack Obama, now Mr. Trump, first year they all began to engage in a positive dialogue with Russia. We will see if it happens. I hope so, because frankly we cannot have a [inaudible] it's important for Europe too to find a way to stabilize all of that. It's not so easy because the U.S. also like to have a big problem [inaudible]  in front of them. But of course I am an investor in Russia so if it is more stable it is better for me but I think also it is better for the world. SS: if the US is looking for closer relations with Russia. There is concern that it actually doesn't want to continue closer relations with Iran as well. You've made investments looking at developing South Pars as well. Do you fear for those investments? I spoke to one of your peers a while back who said he was concerned about investing in Iran precisely because of what sanctions could come from the U.S. PP: Let's be clear about Iran. There is a sanctions system existing in the U.S. we have to obey to that. There is no way for Total, or any other company, to escape from that. Having said that, and I've been very transparent with the Obama administration about all the moves- we made them aware of what we were doing, we respect what we have singed, we respect the agreements, if the sanctions framework is changing we will have to adapt ourselves. So I will just observe what will be done by the Trump administration about Iran. But you know it is a world where you cannot have many enemies- China, Russia, Iran you have to select things. So we will work and again it is an opportunity for us- you know for Total if you are an oil and gas company you have to go to where there is oil and gas- there is oil and gas in Russia, there is oil and gas in Iran. Having said that I'm perfectly aware there are some risks, it is a matter then of what is the size of the risk compared to the size of the company, and investing 1 or 2 billion in Iran when we have 150bn USD of assets is not a big risk and it could be a big reward for our shareholders. SS: Where is the biggest risk for Total in 2017? PP: The biggest risk? Again, for me it is more the uncertainty internationally, it's very difficult today to tell you what will happen and I suspect it will take some months.   Because I suspect that it's not only if President Trump came to office next Friday, you still have the full administration to put in place before we understand the full policies so it will take time. We are entering into 6 months, 9 months of uncertainty and it's not good for business because what business wants is predictability you know, if you are to invest, if you want to take decisions in energy you invest for 20 years, you need to have clear frameworks so that is the main risk for us. SS: Are you getting a clear framework from Europe as well? We mentioned Brexit, we mentioned the concerns about cohesion within the EU as well. France has got a very big election which is already dividing the population as well, you have of course have had some political experience as well. What do you think about Europe in 2017? Are you worried that we're going to see more of the same that we saw of Renzi and Brexit? PP: I hope no. But I think that clearly for the European leaders it will be a very important year. we'll have new leadership coming; elections in France, in Germany, in the Netherlands and I think clearly, by the way, the position of Mr. Trump is provocative vis a vis Europe but maybe we need to be provocative and I hope for the leaders in Europe, we wake up and we build again the project. Clearly we have a problem today. We have a problem of leadership by the way. It's a question of leadership. We need leaders. I hope the new leaders in Europe will be able to offer a vision to European citizens in order to move the project forward. SS: Don't we have a leader in Europe, don't we have Frau Merkel? PP: Well yes [inaudible] Merkel but maybe we will have the next French President as well SS: ...isnt that your former boss Mr. Fillon. Total: Yeah. And I think he can be a leader for Europe. But again, it's not a choice for me, let me be very clear. I am chairman and CEO of Total, I make no politics in that. As I have said in France, I vote for Total, which is more important for me. SS: Tell us a bit more about Total in 2017 as well. Do you feel slightly less pressure though because of this oil price move, because actually you're renewables division I think from the latest numbers actually some of the profits coming from that as well. It's looking better as well. Do you feel less pressure in 2017 than perhaps at any stage in the last couple of years? Total: For sure, but we have less pressure because we've made huge efforts. All the teams of Total worked hard. We have lowered our break even under 50 dollars per barrel and in terms of cash break even with a profit of sales we're now under 40 dollars a barrel so yes we made big efforts and so over the last two years where we had a lot of CapEx because we had lots of projects or projects to be delivered, we have no higher production and or financials banking [inaudible] strong. So for me 2017 is a new era. We were under pressure. Now we can be more offensive. We have, I would say, a very good status in the company. And our objective is to benefit from still a low price because there is low cost so we want to sanction projects and we want to make new deals to have access to resources like the one we have done in Brazil in December and in Uganda with Turo [inaudible]. So Total has gone through these difficult two years in good shape. And I'm very happy now we can be more offensive. SS: Are you calling time on CapEx cuts? PP: No, no, we have what we announce is that we will spend between 15 and 17 billion dollars of CapEx from 2017. I explained to investors it is a sustainable level of CapEx, with that we will be able to continue to grow the company larger more than the market services, or target that [inaudible]. This is what we want to do. So it's not a CapExs it is landing the CapEx to the sustainable level, which is more important. SS: And in terms of the renewable side of things: You and I were in a debate in Davos talking about the transition, the energy transition, the clean energy transition as well. And there was lot of concern from Christiana Figueres about the speed of transition. Are you happy with Total's investment in renewables. Is it just right?  You mentioned 15 to 17 billion dollars.I think your investments, I mean various figures, 500 million dollars a year is the figure that it's often cited? PP: Yeah. Let's be realistic, energy is a very important matter. I mean we are in the core of the energy, we have invested in renewables we are investing and I believe when we develop a strategy because again we want to remain a major company in the energy field. Renewables we love something.  But today, if I only had renewables Total would be unable to distribute any dividends. It's still an infant industry but we need to work on it. So accelerating is tough because as we were discussing in Davos, people want not only clean energy, people want reliable energy, people want cheap energy, so we have to be pragmatic. SS: Is that the priority with people reliable and cheap, reliable and cheap ahead of clean? PP I think I suspect yes because its energy is at the core of the development, economic development and when you go to India, when you go to China you think people, of course they want clean, to be able to have clean air but they want also to have access to energy which is more important for many people in the world. So I don't think, so I think yes an energy mix will evolve. You will have less coal, less oil, more gas. More renewables but it takes time. This transition is not because you decide. It's not, there is no magic tool there. It's just a matter of investments and words [inaudible]  that people need are serious and pragmatic strategies to prepare the future. So I hear [inaudible]  acceleration I suspect we have to be pragmatic and realistic but again it's a serious matter. SS: There's another great point raised and it's by Oleg  Deripaska of Rusal that he thought that some countries and I'll paraphrase in some countries are pretty hypocritical really they're using renewables as cover for increasing coal production and coal usage as well. Do you think there's a great degree of hypocrisy out there from some companies and perhaps some countries especially. PP: No I don't think, I mean medically I don't think there is some hypocrisy but what Mr. Deripaska pointed is right. What I observe in many countries, because they have a lot of coal, coal is burnt out in China, is burnt out in India, in the US as well, is that and it's cheap to produce coal, much cheaper than gas because gas is complex, you need to liquify it and you need to transport it so what I observe is that you have many countries which try to be genuinely like India, on the road map of two degrees. We have this national production of coal and they invest in solar and wind. One hundred seventy five gigawatts by 2022. And I think the Prime Minister Modi is very dedicated to that. But yes we see a mix of coal and renewables. It's a strange mix but I observe this trend in Germany, I observe this trend in Japan. Japan wants to decrease gas and increase coal with renewables. So there's something there and I think it is one of the for me the main concern about the climate change debate because frankly if we are unable to lower the coal share in the mix, there is no chance we can reach the two degree road map [inaudible] and that requires you to pricing. SS: We need the carbon pricing. Finally, there's a lot of inequality concerns. There's a lot of concerns about the haves and have nots and if Davos is anything it's a lot of haves, it's a very rich concentration of very wealthy and influential people. Do you think the Davos bubble the Davos echo chamber actually gets the message that there's some real problems out there and they need resolving very quick. PP: Yeah you're right. Clearly we are in a bubble and we are in part of the bubble. And Total, when you speak about globalization is one of the winners of this globalisation. We have been able to develop a company. I think what is important to know is that yes we discussed about what is happening around us. I'm not sure we fully understand but there is really a willingness and we have been proposed by Davos to sign a compact about responsible leadership. Responsible leadership for me it's very important. I think big companies like us it's not only a matter to distribute salaries to employees, dividends, social orders, taxes to states. It's not enough. By listening to all of these moves but we need to bring something else to the territories from which we work. You know we have the global company for us for example in France first. Then we moved out. We are moving because we are a global company because the cost of labour is lower in other countries. But if we stay, if we leave the territories behind us without taking care, I think we are making a mistake. Normally the states should take care of that but the states are unable and so it's back to what is the responsibility of a global corporation like Total and I think there is a fourth dimension, salaries, dividends, taxes plus something which is to take care also of our own territories. And I think we need to move on that and not only to think it's a matter for all of us. It's not a problem of all of us. It's our problems because I strongly believe globalisation is a good thing for the world. We have major poverty in the world. We have plenty of emerging countries. But all population in all developed countries seem to disagree so why they disagree because they are afraid so we need to answer them. And it's not only a politician story, it's also a matter for the leaders of large corporations like Total. I don't have the magic tool there again but I am convinced that we need to do that and to tell the people we were discussing these type of matters amongst the leaders of the world in Davos so it's not only we are yes, it's a bubble but this bubble is asking itself some questions. And it's important. ","Interview with Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of Total from the World Economic Forum 2017"
"Jason Hall, George Budwell, Timothy Green, Tyler Crowe, and Steve Symington",01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Steady income is within reach with these five stocks. Image source: Getty Images. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has an enviable track record of paying and growing its dividend for many years. But at the same time, there are plenty of reasons to skip this biggest of the big oil companies, particularly if you're looking for a solid source of income. We reached out to five of our top contributors and asked them to write about some companies with bigger dividends than ExxonMobil. They gave us compelling reasons to consider oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners L.P. (NYSE:HEP), tech stalwart Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), telecom and media giant Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), pharma blue chip Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and healthcare real estate upstart Caretrust REIT Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRE). Keep reading to find out which of these companies would make a great addition to your dividend stock portfolio. Tyler Crowe (Holly Energy Partners): One thing dividend investors want from an investment in ExxonMobil is stability with modest growth. For decades ExxonMobil has been able to deliver that, even through some of the biggest times of crisis for the oil and gas industry. It's one thing to recommend a company that has a higher dividend yield than ExxonMobil. It's an entirely other thing to find one that can deliver a dividend that has the ability to weather any storm the market can throw at it and even give room for growth. Image source: Getty Images. One that has developed a decent reputation for doing just that over the years is oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners. While it may not have the size and scale of many other transportation and logistics companies, it makes up for it with its contract structures and management's prudent approach to growth. All of the services the company provides are done on 100% fee-based contracts with strong minimum volume commitments from its customers. In doing so, it takes out almost all of the commodity price risk associated with the oil and gas industry. Also its modest growth profile is done in a way to maintain a manageable debt level and continue to deliver payout increases. The most recent distribution increase marked the 48th consecutive quarter in which management raised its payout. With its distribution yield of 7.1% and a history of raising its payout in a sustainable, consistent manner, investors looking for a little more yield than shares of ExxonMobil should take a look at Holly Energy Partners. Tim Green (Cisco Systems): Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems has been increasing its dividend at an impressive pace over the past few years. Cisco's quarterly dividend has more than tripled since mid-2012, with the most recent payment of $0.26 per share good for a yield of about 3.45%. Cisco's long-term growth includes industrial users, not just traditional tech applications. Cisco dominates its core switching and routing markets, although growth has been elusive in recent years. The company has been investing in growth businesses such as security and collaboration, but broad weakness during Cisco's most recent quarter and lackluster guidance suggests that a return to growth may take a while. The good news for dividend investors is that Cisco generates a tremendous amount of cash. Free cash flow came in at $12.4 billion during fiscal 2016, putting the payout ratio based on this number at about 42.5%. That leaves plenty of room to grow the dividend even without much earnings growth. Investors shouldn't expect Cisco's rapid dividend growth of the past few years to continue unless earnings pick up. But a solid yield and the potential for modest dividend growth going forward make Cisco a good choice for dividend investors. Steve Symington (Verizon Communications): With a 4.7% dividend that's been raised every year for the past decade, Verizon stock offers an attractive mix between stability and growth potential. Of course, there's no denying Verizon has had a hard time finding growth, given its increasingly competitive core markets. Excluding 2015 contributions of its since-divested landline business, revenue and adjusted net income per share fell 2.9% year over year last quarter, to $30.9 billion and $1.01, respectively. But Verizon also boasts exceptional customer loyalty, with retail postpaid phone churn below 0.9% for the past six straight quarters -- a testament to its continued investments in its market-leading network. And that leadership should only become more pronounced after it fulfills its promise to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the United States. Image source: Getty Images. Meanwhile, Verizon's Fios fiber-optic services are enjoying renewed growth, with FiOS revenue up 4.4% last quarter, to $2.8 billion, thanks to the additions of 90,000 FiOS internet connections and 36,000 FiOS Video connections. Verizon has also made a number of acquisitions to position itself for longer-term growth, including its purchase of connected vehicle solutions company Telogis and an agreement to acquire Yahoo! last July, the acquisition of smart-city solutions company Sensity Systems in September, and its acquisition of fleet and mobile workforce management company Fleetmatics completed in November. The fruits of these purchases will take time to realize, but collectively they should serve to only expand the scope and power of Verizon's business over the long term. And the earlier you buy shares, the longer you'll have to allow the power of Verizon's juicy dividend and compounding returns to do their work. George Budwell (Pfizer): With a yield of 3.88% at current levels, Pfizer offers a slightly richer payout than ExxonMobil. But the real difference between these two income-generating stocks is arguably the tailwinds facing their respective industries. Image source: Getty Images. The pharmaceutical industry, after all, is experiencing a golden era stemming from an uptick in innovation, an aging and rapidly expanding global population, and broader access to modern healthcare around the world. The same positive outlook simply can't be said for traditional oil and gas giants like Exxon that are facing significant pricing pressure at the moment, along with the ongoing global transition to renewable forms of energy, such as advanced biofuels and solar. So even though Pfizer has been resoundingly criticized for its hefty price increases on older medicines, the cumulative effect of these tailwinds should be more than enough to offset any political blowback. Simply put, Pfizer should have little problem increasing sales volumes for new drugs such as its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, or its slate of novel vaccines, to drive growth over the long haul. As such, this drugmaker's comparatively high dividend for a large-cap pharma stock should not only be safe in the near term, but it should continue to grow at a fairly regular clip going forward. Jason Hall (Caretrust REIT Inc.): If you're looking for a strong contender for long-term growth in both the dividend and share price, Caretrust REIT should be on your list. Caretrust owns senior housing and healthcare facilities and then works with healthcare operators, which lease and operate the properties Caretrust owns. Caretrust is in an excellent position to grow much larger, as this market is both underserved and will need to expand significantly over the next couple of decades to support an aging baby boomer population. With less than 160 properties today, Caretrust is a very small fish in a very big -- and growing -- pond. If management can continue allocating capital well, Caretrust has the makings of a portfolio-changing income investment over the next 20 years. ","
      
    5 Stocks With Bigger Dividends Than ExxonMobil -- The Motley Fool

  "
Dan Caplinger,01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend stocks pay out cash to shareholders each year. The best dividend stocks for investors feature two traits: healthy income and future payout growth. Let's look at five of the best dividend stocks for long-term investors: AT&T (NYSE:T), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), 3M (NYSE:MMM), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Image source: Getty Images. AT&T has been a key player in the telecommunications industry for more than 130 years. With a history that dates back to the invention of the telephone, AT&T was a pioneer in local and long-distance landline communication, and it has taken full advantage of the move to wireless telecom networks to offer a wide range of services to millions of customers across the nation. Image source: AT&T. For dividend investors, AT&T's 4.8% dividend yield is among the best in the stock market. Yet along with that rich payout, shareholders have also gotten a streak of 33 straight years of dividend increases, with the most recent having come just earlier this month. As long as people still want to talk to each other, AT&T will have a role to play in connecting them. ExxonMobil has also been a great source of dividend income for investors. Its 3.5% dividend yield doesn't quite match up to AT&T's, but its 34-year streak of consecutive annual payout boosts holds its own among top dividend stocks. ExxonMobil's dividend has doubled in less than a decade, and investors see a lot more room for growth in the future. Image source: ExxonMobil. What's particularly impressive about ExxonMobil's track record is that the company has had to overcome huge cyclical swings to maintain a stable dividend history. With oil prices having fallen from well above $100 per barrel to less than $30 in the span of just a few years, the energy giant has nevertheless succeeded in tapping new sources of revenue and becoming more efficient to maximize profits. That's a long-term recipe for outperformance that should result in further dividend growth in the future. Johnson & Johnson is a household name best known among most people for its Band-Aid and Tylenol consumer products. But J&J has also become a pharmaceutical powerhouse, and that part of the healthcare giant's business has produced the most growth lately. Add to that the innovative medical devices that the company produces, and it's easy to see why Johnson & Johnson is a popular choice among stock investors. Image source: J&J. J&J's dividends are also superior. A 2.8% yield might not seem to stand out in this rarefied crowd, but a 54-year track record of rising payouts puts it among the top ranks of the dividend elite. With an attractive 7% dividend increase just last year, Johnson & Johnson has worked hard to give income investors what they want to see, and all signs point to sufficient business growth to support ongoing dividend increases in the future. Conglomerate 3M has an impressive track record on the dividend front as well. A 2.5% yield gives investors above-average income, and 3M has raised its payout every year for 58 straight years, putting it among the top-10 stocks in the entire market. The company gave investors an 8% boost to the quarterly dividend last year, and most expect another increase in the immediate future.

Wall Street trading over the past several days has been subdued as investors await signs that the stock-market rally that followed President-elect Donald Trump’s November election victory, supported by his campaign promises to increase fiscal spending, cut taxes and roll back regulations, is based in reality and underpinned by solid corporate quarterly results. Mike Antonelli, an equity sales trader at R.W. Baird & Co., said global stocks would likely remain placid until investors have a better picture of the fourth-quarter earnings environment and companies’ outlooks for 2017, as well as Trump’s plans. Trump will be sworn in to office on Friday. The bulk of S&P 500 firms will release their earnings in the coming weeks.

That news sparked a selloff that spread throughout the sector. “The story coming out of retail hasn’t been good,” said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Asset Management, adding that “individual stories” will likely continue to influence the broader sector. On Wednesday, the dollar recovered from Trump’s comments on Tuesday, who said a strong dollar can harm the U.S. economy.

Read: Trump is waving adios to the longstanding ‘strong-dollar policy’ Economic docket: On the economic front, the consumer-price index, a widely watched gauge of inflationary pressure, showed price growth accelerated in 2016 at the fastest pace since 2011. In December, the index rose 0.3%. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 0.2%. The reading was in line with investor expectations and had little impact on stock futures. U.S. industrial output accelerated last month at its strongest pace in two years. The housing-market index from the National Association of Homebuilders showed that builder sentiment slipped in January after notching its highest reading of the business cycle in December. Despite the drop, the January number was the second-highest reading of the cycle. Inflation appears to be heating up, according to the Federal Reserve’s so-called Beige Book, which found that eight out of 12 Fed districts saw modest price increases. Underscoring retail woes, the report said that retailers struggled to raise prices. Read:  How long postelection rallies last after Inauguration Day—in one chart Stock movers: Mallinckrodt PLC

,01262017,Reuters,01192017,"Last July SABIC, one of the world’s largest petrochemicals groups, said it was studying whether to build a petrochemical complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast with an Exxon affiliate. The project would supply ethylene to other units making derivatives. SABIC chief executive Yousef al-Benyan told Reuters on Thursday that he would travel to the United States at the end of this month to look at the proposed project. “The outlook is still very positive...We will be working with Exxon Mobil to come up with a very strong competitive structure of this project. “We are very excited about current developments with Exxon Mobil, not only the cracker but also in the downstream type of projects we are going to do.” He added that SABIC would probably make an announcement about the ethylene project in the second quarter of this year, though this was not certain. SABIC is keen to invest abroad to diversify its risks and improve its access to foreign markets. Benyan said the company was looking to make other U.S. investments worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. “We think SABIC needs to strengthen its position in the U.S. and leverage the current growth of demand for our commodity business.” He did not give details of the possible investments but said, “Some of them will be partnerships and some will be alone, because I think we in SABIC have the capability to do that ourselves.” Asked about the outlook for SABIC’s sales in the United States under president-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to promote local companies, Benyan said that because of its U.S. facilities, SABIC viewed itself as a local manufacturer. He also said he did not at present see any risk to SABIC’s assets from last September’s vote in the U.S. Congress to allow relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. “This is part of our continuous risk assessment that we have within our corporate finances, but at this point we don’t see any problem, and this will never really change our mind about growing our business in the United States.” ","

Investors will not only be looking at how the company performed in 2016, but will also be eager to get a sense of the company’s investment plans for 2017. Oil companies have aggressively scaled back capital expenditures since the oil price downturn in 2014. The chart below shows capital expenditure for ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron and ConocoPhillips (COP), which collectively fell by 47.3% from 2013 to 3Q-2016. This has left some industry experts wondering if spending reductions have gone too far. For example, Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid A. Al-Falih has warned that there could by a global oil shortage as soon as 2020 if investment flows continue to be scaled back. In an investor presentation in November 2016 posted on Chevron’s website, the company says it plans to reduce capital and exploratory spending again in 2017 by about 25% from planned 2016 spending. Friday’s results should provide an update into whether these spending cuts are being accelerated or scaled back in a rising oil price environment. Some companies are already boosting investment spending. Bloomberg reported on Friday that China's largest offshore oil explorer, CNOOC (CEO), is planning to increase investment spending in 2017 between 19% and 39% for the first time since 2014. The marginal spending increase is equivalent to approximately $8.7 to $10.2 billion, or equal to roughly half of Chevron’s entire 2017 budgeted capital spending. 2017 will likely be a pivotal year for the oil industry. Those companies increasing investment spending could benefit if oil prices continue their upward path. A renewed downturn in prices, however, could see those who increased spending nursing large losses. On the other hand, companies that are scaling back investments could see their long term competitiveness eroded, especially if the oil shortage predicted by Saudi energy minister comes to pass.

Patti Domm,01262017,CNBC,01192017,"President Donald Trump could lift sanctions against Russia over the conflict in Ukraine by himself — and may justify doing so by saying that he is putting America first. Trump is expected to discuss the sanctions when he speaks by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, White House aide Kellyanne Conway said in a television interview Friday. The White House also announced that Trump has separate calls with the leaders of Germany and France, two U.S. NATO allies that support sanctions on Russia. ""We'll see what happens,"" Trump said regarding Russia sanctions at a press conference on Friday. ""As far as the sanctions, it's very early to be talking about that, but we look to have a great relationship with all countries, ideally."" The U.S. sanctions, imposed through executive order by President Barack Obama, can be lifted by Trump's pen — without the vote of Congress — if he so wishes, experts said. It's not clear whether his intention is to lift sanctions right away, but Trump's first official discussion with Putin could lay the groundwork for removal. ""People said Trump will never remove the sanctions on Russia. Of course he will. It's a leveling of the playing field for U.S. corporations,"" said Helima Croft, head of global commodities research at RBC. The sanctions against Russia hurt that country's energy industry and make it harder for Russia to raise capital. Getting rid of the sanctions is a major priority for Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. companies, including Exxon Mobil, were forced to drop activities in Russia if they were in new areas of development, such as Arctic drilling and Russian shale. But Croft explained that European companies, under separate European Union sanctions, were allowed to continue work on existing projects while being barred only from new ones. Based on Trump's rapid-fire execution of orders in his first week, such as directing the construction of a wall on the Mexican border, experts say it's possible he could move toward lifting sanctions against Russia. He could do so without the consent of European allies, which have sanctioned Russia separately. ""Clearly, he really wants this relationship to work. I have some sympathy in the sense the U.S. relationship with Russia has been very badly damaged, and a lot of that has Obama to blame,"" said Ian Bremmer, president of global political consultancy Eurasia Group. Trump has been moving toward lifting the sanctions already. ""He has so many of his speaking points aligned with those of the Kremlin, around Crimea, Ukraine, around Syria, around American exceptionalism and values,"" Bremmer said. Trump also seems bent to to move forward without gaining agreement from historic allies in Europe. ""If I were advising Trump, I would want him to be coordinating with Merkel and others who were steadfast allies ... I think he's made up his mind on this,"" said Bremmer. ""I guess what we've been learning about Trump is that he actually does what he said he was going to do. The problem is the sanctions were imposed for what the Russians did in Ukraine and Crimea. The Germans have worked hard to keep this together, as the French president has,"" said Professor Angela Stent, director Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University. ""This would send a message to Russia that it can get away with it, but it undermines the European Union's efforts to hold Russia accountable."" Obama first imposed sanctions after Russia invaded Crimea, claiming it to be part of Russia. ""It's the Europeans who did it much later when the (Malaysian) airline was shot down over Ukraine,"" Stent said. Bremmer expects Trump to move forward regardless of prevailing sentiment Europe, where nationalist candidates stand to gain ground in several elections this year. In France, Marine Le Pen has gained in polls. She says she wants to get rid of the euro currency. ""Germany is the country that's in the most vulnerable position because of Trump, compared to most of the American allies. Europe is getting weaker. He likes Brexit, says other countries should leave. Germany is the country most interested in maintaining a strong Europe, and Trump is undermining (Merkel). Trump is renouncing American exceptionalism, in not telling other countries what to do,"" said Bremmer. At the same press conference where Trump spoke on Friday, British Prime Minister Theresa May was forthright in saying that sanctions against Russia should continue until Russia conforms agreements designed to reduce fighting in Ukraine. Bremmer believes Trump will move forward quickly. But other experts say Trump may ease sanctions slowly — and therefore less visibly — rather than tossing them out right after taking office. Critics have called out Trump for praising Vladimir Putin, whom U.S. intelligence concluded was personally involved in trying to undermine last year's U.S. presidential election and help get Trump elected. Rex Tillerson, Trump's candidate for Secretary of State who just retired as CEO of ExxonMobil, and has strong personal links to Moscow and his former company has billions at stake in Russia. Trump initially refused to accept intelligence community findings that Russian officials intentionally meddled in the U.S. election by hacking into Democratic National Committee computers. Trump has since vowed to make the U.S. more secure from cyber espionage, but has said nothing about punishing Russia. There is also another consideration. Tillerson has yet to be approved by the Senate. Tillerson was questioned by Congress on his feelings about Russia. One strategist said Trump may not lift sanctions right away because of the Tillerson vote, expected next week. Exxon has one of the most high-profile projects that was disrupted by sanctions, an Arctic drilling deal with Rosneft. The joint venture with Russian state-controlled oil giant was to explore and produce fossil fuels in Arctic waters, and it represents a big part of Exxon's potential future production growth. The sanctions were imposed in 2014, and Exxon said in a filing after the sanctions were put in place that its ""maximum before-tax exposure to loss from these joint ventures"" totaled $1 billion through the end of 2015. Russian projects were able to find some other funding sources, including China. Rosneft recently raised funds by selling an $11 billion stake to Qatar and Glencore. If the sanctions are lifted, Croft said the knee jerk reaction in the oil market would likely be a decline in prices just because of the prospect of more supply. Under the sanctions, Russia actually was able to increase its oil production, and the decline in the ruble actually helped producers by keeping production costs lower. Croft said the move in oil prices would be temporary, since the new supply from Russia would not be immediate, and Russia is part of a producers group, with OPEC, that has agreed to cut back production to keep oil prices at a higher level. If the sanctions are lifted, one area of immediate interest would be in the potential for Russian shale. The Bazhenov Shale formation in the West Siberian basin is believed to hold massive reserves of tight oil — which can be reached by U.S.-pioneered technology that Russia can't access because of the sanctions — and that could be one of the first places companies might want to invest. ""Russian oil production has been strong, and it's actually increased until the OPEC deal. It could mean a renewal of Western investment in Russian oil, in the new areas in terms of tight oil, Arctic and offshore,"" said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of research firm IHS Markit. ""The taste for big expensive long term projects is a lot lower today than it was when the sanctions were imposed. One area that is very interesting is tight oil in Russia."" Tight oil has been much cheaper to extract through horizontal drilling than deep water projects. ""There's a debate about how prolific it is,"" said Yergin, who said the Bazhenov by all signs is a huge reserve and would take a while to develop. ""If the analysis of U.S. shale is used, it could be very significant. I think all these development take time, and it takes a lot of experience to determine all of these resources and how to recover it. Certainly it would be a whole new horizon for Russian oil,"" he said. ",President Trump could say 'America first' to end sanctions on Russia
Fred Imbert,01262017,CNBC,01192017,"U.S. equities closed lower on Thursday, with real estate falling around 1 percent, as investors eagerly awaited President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. ""Everyone is just waiting for the inauguration,"" said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. ""The market just feels a little heavy."" He also said: ""When you start seeing volatility in other macro markets — specifically FX — that's going to take its toll on stocks."" The U.S. dollar spiked against a basket of currencies on the back of strong U.S. economic data. The Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell about 100 points in afternoon ET before closing about 70 points lower, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. The index also recorded a five-day losing streak. ""I think this is a pause ahead of the inauguration because there is so much policy uncertainty,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""We don't know what they will be focusing on first."" Trump is set to take the oath of office on Friday. The S&P 500 dropped around a third of a percent, with real estate leading decliners. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3 percent. ""Part of it is people taking profit off the table,"" said John Traynor, chief investment officer at People's United Bank. ""We were surprised by the November-December rally, so taking profit off the table the day before the inauguration makes sense."" Stocks in the United States rallied to record highs following Trump's victory in November, on the back of expectations for lower corporate taxes, more government spending and deregulation of certain sectors. ""The stock market tends to like a straightforward story, so if the new administration concentrates on its pro-growth policy actions, the narrative stays relatively simple and shares may find good reasons to continue their climb,"" Robert Landry, portfolio manager at USAA, said in a note. ""But if other priorities compete for the president's energy and focus — immediate repeal of the Affordable Care Act, creation of costly trade barriers and any number of foreign policy actions, just to name a few — the growth story could get muddled and the markets choppy,"" Landry said. Several Trump cabinet nominees were testified before Congress, including Treasury secretary designate Steven Mnuchin. In his testimony, Mnuchin denied that OneWest Bank — a bank he owned — was a ""'foreclose machine.' This is not true. On the contrary, I was committed to loan modifications intended to stop foreclosures,"" he said. Mnuchin also expressed concerns that the ""Volcker Rule"" — a component of the Dodd-Frank law meant to block banks from speculating with customers' money — is actually hurting the country's financial system by limiting liquidity. In economic news, weekly jobless claims dropped 15,000 to 234,000, around their lowest levels in 40 years. Housing starts, meanwhile, spiked 11.3 percent in December, beating estimates. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve business conditions index rose to 23.6, above a consensus estimate of 15.8. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets in London, said the Philly Fed data shows ""how optimistic the [manufacturing] industry is under the leadership of new upcoming president. This will support the U.S. economy further and strengthen the jobs market further."" U.S. Treasury yields extended gains following the data releases, with the benchmark 10-year note yield breaking above 2.487 percent, while the two-year note yield advanced to 1.238 percent. Yields also received a boost from remarks made by Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday, when she said the U.S. economy was close to reaching the Fed's goals. Investors in the U.S. also focused on corporate quarterly results as earnings season continued. Bank of New York Mellon and Union Pacific were among the companies reporting before the bell, with Dow components IBM and American Express set to report after the close. Video streaming giant Netflix saw its shares rose 3.8 percent, having posted solid results on strong subscriber growth. Overseas, European equities traded mostly lower after the European Central Bank kept monetary policy unchanged. The euro briefly fell versus the dollar after ECB President Mario Draghi said in a news conference there is no sign of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 72.32 points, or 0.37 percent, to close at 19,732.40, with Exxon Mobil leading decliners and UnitedHealth the biggest advancer. The S&P 500 dropped 8.20 points, or 0.36 percent, to end at 2,263.69, with real estate leading nine sectors lower and industrials and telecommunications as the only risers. The Nasdaq composite dropped 15.57 points, or 0.28 percent, to close at 5,540.08. About three stocks declined for every advancer at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 755.18 million and a composite volume of 3.158 billion at the close.

Dan Caplinger,01262017,Fool,01192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend stocks pay out cash to shareholders each year. The best dividend stocks for investors feature two traits: healthy income and future payout growth. Let's look at five of the best dividend stocks for long-term investors: AT&T (NYSE:T), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), 3M (NYSE:MMM), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Image source: Getty Images. AT&T has been a key player in the telecommunications industry for more than 130 years. With a history that dates back to the invention of the telephone, AT&T was a pioneer in local and long-distance landline communication, and it has taken full advantage of the move to wireless telecom networks to offer a wide range of services to millions of customers across the nation. Image source: AT&T. For dividend investors, AT&T's 4.8% dividend yield is among the best in the stock market. Yet along with that rich payout, shareholders have also gotten a streak of 33 straight years of dividend increases, with the most recent having come just earlier this month. As long as people still want to talk to each other, AT&T will have a role to play in connecting them. ExxonMobil has also been a great source of dividend income for investors. Its 3.5% dividend yield doesn't quite match up to AT&T's, but its 34-year streak of consecutive annual payout boosts holds its own among top dividend stocks. ExxonMobil's dividend has doubled in less than a decade, and investors see a lot more room for growth in the future. Image source: ExxonMobil. What's particularly impressive about ExxonMobil's track record is that the company has had to overcome huge cyclical swings to maintain a stable dividend history. With oil prices having fallen from well above $100 per barrel to less than $30 in the span of just a few years, the energy giant has nevertheless succeeded in tapping new sources of revenue and becoming more efficient to maximize profits. That's a long-term recipe for outperformance that should result in further dividend growth in the future. Johnson & Johnson is a household name best known among most people for its Band-Aid and Tylenol consumer products. But J&J has also become a pharmaceutical powerhouse, and that part of the healthcare giant's business has produced the most growth lately. Add to that the innovative medical devices that the company produces, and it's easy to see why Johnson & Johnson is a popular choice among stock investors. Image source: J&J. J&J's dividends are also superior. A 2.8% yield might not seem to stand out in this rarefied crowd, but a 54-year track record of rising payouts puts it among the top ranks of the dividend elite. With an attractive 7% dividend increase just last year, Johnson & Johnson has worked hard to give income investors what they want to see, and all signs point to sufficient business growth to support ongoing dividend increases in the future. Conglomerate 3M has an impressive track record on the dividend front as well. A 2.5% yield gives investors above-average income, and 3M has raised its payout every year for 58 straight years, putting it among the top-10 stocks in the entire market. The company gave investors an 8% boost to the quarterly dividend last year, and most expect another increase in the immediate future. Image source: 3M. 3M also has a track record for innovation that has put it at the top of its industry, with diversified exposure to a number of different business segments including consumer products, healthcare, and technology. From orthodontic products and Post-It Notes to car-care items and passive fire protection, 3M has made its mark across the U.S. corporate spectrum and stands ready to keep delivering both growth and income to its shareholders. Finally, Procter & Gamble has an impressive stable of nearly two dozen consumer brands that bring in at least $1 billion in revenue each and every year. From Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste to Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razors, the consumer products giant serves not only the U.S. but more than 180 countries across the globe. Brand loyalty allows P&G to charge premium prices above much of its competition, yet consumers willingly pay for the perception of higher quality. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble has a dividend streak that goes back 60 years, which is the longest of any stock in the Dow Jones Industrials, and it pays a dividend yield of about 3.2%. With the company paying out just two-thirds of its earnings in dividends, P&G has the capacity to reward shareholders even more richly in the years ahead. With a rising middle class of consumers around the world, Procter & Gamble has the products people will want for decades to come. If you want both income and future growth potential, only the best dividend stocks will do. These five dividend stocks give you a diversified portfolio of solid picks that should meet your dividend needs. ","
      
    The Best Dividend Stocks for Long-Term Investors -- The Motley Fool

Matthew DiLallo,01262017,Fool,01192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. It would be an understatement to say that 2016 was a tough year for the oil patch. Plunging crude prices heading into the year forced producers to reduce investment spending so deeply that many couldn't even drill enough wells needed to keep production flat. Because of these market conditions, oil companies spent minuscule amounts of capital exploring for new oil and gas sources. As a result, the industry found the fewest new barrels of oil in 70 years. According to a report by energy research firm Rystad Energy, oil companies discovered a mere 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) last year outside of North American shale plays. For perspective, the U.S. alone consumes more than 7 billion barrels annually, which meant the industry did not come close to replacing consumption last year. Meanwhile, offshore discoveries, which is where companies uncovered most of the new sources of oil in recent years, fell 90% from 2010's level to just 2.3 billion BOE last year. This trend is not one that can continue given that world oil demand is not expected to peak until 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. Image source: ConocoPhillips. The primary driver of last year's decline was the continued drop in exploration spending. Energy companies only spent $40 billion on exploratory drilling last year, which resulted in 40% fewer wells drilled than in 2014 when prices started on their downward spiral. Global oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX), for example, cut its global capital and exploratory budget by 24% from 2015's level to $26.6 billion. However, Chevron only earmarked $1 billion of that budget for exploration, well below the $3 billion budget the company set for 2015. Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) cut its global exploration and appraisal budget down to $1.4 billion last year, a decline of 22% from 2015. Another culprit behind last year's low level of oil discoveries is that several exploration prospects came up dry. For example, a joint venture between ConocoPhillips, Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU), and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A) (NYSE:RDS-B) struck out in its initial attempt at finding oil in the Shelburne Basin off Canada's Atlantic Coast. As a result, Suncor Energy noted that it had to write off its share of the costs, which totaled 105 million Canadian dollars. That dry hole was one of a growing number of deepwater exploration failures for ConocoPhillips in recent years. In 2015, the company noted that a deepwater exploration well in Angola found a non-commercial gas column and another in the Gulf of Mexico did not encounter any hydrocarbons. As a result, it plugged and abandoned both wells, writing off $142 million in dry hole expenses. These and other dry holes drove its decision to exit deepwater exploration altogether. Image source: Suncor Energy Inc. While oil discoveries were down significantly, oil companies still found several notable new oil and gas deposits. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), for example, announced in June that an offshore well in Guyana confirmed a world-class oil discovery. According to ExxonMobil, this deposit contains between 800 million to 1.4 billion BOE of recoverable resources. Then, in October, the oil giant confirmed a discovery offshore Nigeria that holds between 500 million to 1 billion barrels of oil. Finally, the company capped the year off with a December announcement of a new onshore natural gas discovery in Papua New Guinea. Energy companies made several other smaller discoveries around the world last year. Norwegian oil giant Statoil (NYSE:EQNR), for example, finished up its Canadian Atlantic exploration program last year, which resulted in two more discoveries and the confirmation that its 2013 Bay du Nord find contains between 300 million to 600 million barrels of recoverable oil. Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell made a discovery in the Gulf of Mexico at its Fort Sumter prospect, uncovering more than 125 million BOE. That was one of three new Gulf finds last year, though that is down from seven in 2015. Image source: Apache Corporation. While offshore discoveries proved tougher to locate, North American onshore shale plays continued to be the gifts that keep on giving. One of the most notable shale discoveries was Apache's (NYSE:APA) Alpine High play in a sleepy part of Texas' Permian Basin. Apache believes that there's at least 3 billion barrels of oil and another 75 trillion cubic feet of gas in just two of the five rock formations underneath its acreage position in the region. Apache believes that the other formations could also contain significant quantities of recoverable hydrocarbons. On top of that, several other producers increased their estimates for ultimate hydrocarbon recoveries from their acreage position in various shale plays. One of the most notable was EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), which more than doubled its Permian Basin net resource potential from 2.35 billion BOE to 6 billion BOE. That upward revision came just a year after EOG Resources boosted its resource estimate in the region by 1 billion BOE due to improved recoveries resulting from advances in technology. The decline in offshore oil and gas discoveries will not have an immediate impact on global oil supplies. That is because it can often take a decade or more to turn offshore finds into production due to the high costs and long construction lead times. Furthermore, there's plenty of prior deepwater discoveries to develop as well as a plethora of shale resources to unleash. That said, the lack of new discoveries in recent years could prove problematic a decade from now as producers deplete currently producing fields. Given the forecast that oil demand will not peak for several decades, it suggests that the world will need to continue uncovering and developing new oil deposits. That means the industry cannot continue the recent history of failing even to come close to replacing production because there will come a point where this shortfall will impact supply. Such an event could cause a significant run-up in oil prices while producers race to meet the market's needs. ","
      
    Oil Companies Just Had Their Worst Year Since 1940 -- The Motley Fool

Michael Brush,01262017,MarketWatch,01192017,"Published: Jan 24, 2017 9:50 a.m. ET These are the companies that may benefit the most, according to a survey of analysts and fund managers By Donald Trump’s critics like to claim he doesn’t stand for anything. But that’s just because they haven’t looked hard enough. In speeches, online campaign policy messages and even tweets, Trump has regularly detailed policy reforms especially for business and the economy. These include lower taxes, fiscal stimulus, incentives to bring earnings home and protectionist policies. Though he didn’t add any details in his inauguration speech — and that’s never the point of this ceremonial address — his “America first” theme underscored his intent to enact those policies. After all, those policies basically put U.S. companies and the U.S. economy first. Will he actually get all of this done? No one knows. But with so many friends in Congress, and a majority there, it would be a mistake to count him out. As we’ve seen, prognosticators who discount Trump have a way of ending up looking dumb. So as the new president starts his first week in the White House, this is a good time to take stock of companies that will benefit the most from key Trump business and economic policies, according to Wall Street analysts. Here’s a comprehensive roundup. Companies with sales in the good ol’ US of A Trump has made it clear he wants some form of protectionism as a cornerstone of his economic policy. For better or worse, and whatever form this takes, it’s likely to benefit companies that generate most of their sales at home. Those companies will also get a direct shot of assistance from fiscal stimulus. They’ll get a relative boost from any ongoing strength in the dollar, since this reduces reported earnings for companies that get much of their earnings overseas. Goldman Sachs singles out the following companies as potential Trump policy beneficiaries because they generate virtually all of their revenue in the U.S. Naturally, many of them are in retail, and consumer products and services. Candidates for a Trump bump here include: Lowe’s

That’s because the new president is likely to take steps to block subsidized steel from China sold here below cost. “We are going to have greater scrutiny on steel tariffs and how much steel is imported,” says Marshall. U.S. steel companies will also benefit from a rebound in infrastructure spending and manufacturing. “A lot of them are at 60% capacity,” says Marshall. “We think it could get closer to 80% or 90%.” One of his favorites is Commercial Metals

                                   in this space. Companies with low labor costs The labor markets are so tight at 4.7% unemployment, companies have to bid up wages to get or keep workers. This is why average hourly wages recently saw the biggest jump since 2009, at 2.9%. Now, Trump wants to apply fiscal stimulus in the form of personal and corporate tax cuts, and more spending on the military, veterans benefits and infrastructure. That’s an unorthodox policy at full employment, because it risks sparking so much inflation that the Federal Reserve might have to get overly aggressive in raising rates — which could spook markets. All of this remains to be seen as a risk. In the meantime, with labor costs clearly on the march and greater wage pressure ahead, thanks to Trump stimulus, it makes sense to favor companies that don’t spend a lot on labor, relative to revenue. A group of low-labor-cost companies suggested by Goldman Sachs late last year has vastly outperformed companies with high labor costs. Analysts at the investment bank expect this to continue in 2017, as wages continue to go up and the market prices in higher inflation. As an added plus, the low-labor-cost companies singled out by Goldman Sachs, below, have faster sales and earnings growth compared with high-labor-cost companies. Consumer-facing low-labor-cost companies favored as winners by Goldman Sachs include: Netflix

                                    QCOM, -0.61% Companies that pay high taxes After Ronald Reagan’s Tax Reform Act lowered taxes in October 1986, large-cap companies paying the highest tax rates beat the broad market for the next three years, points out Credit Suisse analyst Lori Calvasina. So now with Trump looking to lower the corporate tax rate, it makes sense to go with companies that pay high tax rates. Trump wants a 15% corporate tax rate. House Republican lawmakers propose a 20% rate. But even a reduction to 25% would boost S&P 500 Index

                                   earnings by 8%, say analysts at Goldman Sachs. As an added plus, many of the high-tax-rate companies also generate most, or all, of their sales at home. That makes them less vulnerable to steps to penalize importers and bigger direct beneficiaries of fiscal stimulus. Stocks to consider because they pay the highest effective tax rates, according to Goldman Sachs, include: Goodyear Tire & Rubber

For now, it’s probably better to stay away from this group, as a Trump play. “We continue to believe Trump might be a double-edged sword,” says Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn. It’s also tough to know at this point which defense programs and services will get priority, says Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi. For now it’s probably best to simply monitor the group for trading opportunities. Lockheed fell hard on Dec. 23 when Trump tweeted negatively about F-35 program costs. But it then went on to post 4% gains in two weeks as it recovered from the Trump twitter storm. Infrastructure plays This group is another tough one. Yes, our nation’s infrastructure is crumbling. You see this all the time when you drive around. And Trump’s plan to boost infrastructure spending would no doubt help this space, especially materials companies like Vulcan Materials

                                    SUM, +2.41% But infrastructure plays face three challenges. 1. The earliest the industry could see any measurable spending benefit from Trump policies would be 2018, said economists Kermit Baker of the American Institute of Architects and Ken Simonson at the Associated General Contractors of America at a lunch recently sponsored by Stifel analyst Robert McCarthy. But it’s more likely to arrive in 2019. That’s a long way off. 2. Trump’s immigration policies could aggravate the construction labor shortage. Immigrants make up 30% of construction labor. 3. The group has rallied a lot, despite those challenges. “Our concern is that something will break investor euphoria,” says Stifel analyst Noelle Dilts. Indeed, this is a risk for all “Trump plays” and the market in general. The S&P 500 has rallied 6.5% since Election Day, which means investors have priced in a lot of Trump success. If he stumbles at all in his legislative agenda, the market could reverse itself, especially because investor sentiment is so high. But as we saw during the campaign, Trump has a way of getting what he wants. So any reversal in the market, and especially the names above, on a Trump stumble will probably be a buying opportunity.

Tom DiChristopher,02022017,CNBC,01262017,"Exxon Mobil beat earnings forecasts on Tuesday as revenues increased, though the company took a $2 billion impairment charge, mostly due to lowering the value of some of its U.S. gas assets. Excluding one-time items, Exxon reported a fourth-quarter profit of 90 cents a share, versus Wall Street expectations of 70 cents a share. Results for the Irving, Texas-based oil giant were helped by belt-tightening throughout 2016. However, persistently low oil prices and weaker profit margins in Exxon's refining business weighed on earnings for the full year. ""Financial results for the year were negatively impacted by the prolonged downturn in commodity prices and the impairment charge,"" Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said in a statement. Shares of Exxon slipped about 1 percent Tuesday. Evercore analyst Doug Teresson said many market watchers were focused on the charge. Including that impairment, Exxon would have missed profit forecasts. ""The market did view the result negatively because they missed the headline number, but that's really only because of ... impairments for Exxon, which are non-recurring. And so the clean results were actually similar to consensus, but they were just messy,"" he told CNBC's ""Fast Money: Halftime Report."" Excluding that charge, Exxon reported fourth-quarter earnings of $3.7 billion, or 90 cents a share. In the period a year ago, it reported earnings of $2.8 billion, or 67 cents a share. Revenues for the most recent quarter were $61.01 billion, compared with expectations of $62.28 billion. Exxon said it will increase its 2017 capital spending program, which includes exploration, to an estimated $22 billion. In 2016, capital spending fell 38 percent to $19.3 billion. Fourth-quarter earnings fell from a year ago in all three of the company's major segments: exploration and production, refining and chemicals. The $2 billion impairment resulted from the company's review of its reserves. Exxon determined that some of its U.S. assets' future cash flows no longer exceeded their carrying value. These were primarily in the Rockies. Exxon warned last quarter it would have to revise the amount of unproduced resources it holds if oil prices remained low through the end of the year. In the current price environment, the resources would no longer qualify as proven reserves under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the company said at the time. Liquid petroleum products fetched a higher price than they did a year ago. That was partially offset by weaker profit margins in Exxon's refining business. Integrated oil companies such as Exxon have seen their refining margins shrink as the price of crude oil, the raw material for many fuels, stabilizes above $50 a barrel. Throughout much of the oil price downturn that began in 2014, low crude costs boosted refining margins. Exxon's cash flow generated by its operations — a key metric in the oil and gas industry — improved significantly from last year. Cash flow from operations was $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $4.3 billion a year ago. Cash flow from asset sales was also higher, hitting $2.1 billion, versus about $800 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Last week, the company announced a dividend of 75 cents, unchanged from the third quarter. ",Exxon Mobil profit and revenue rise as the oil giant takes $2 billion impairment
Rebecca Ungarino,02022017,CNBC,01262017,"Energy, the second worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 this year, could see further pain. Chevron, one of the top-weighted holdings in a popular energy ETF (the XLE) fell nearly 2 percent on Monday after posting disappointing quarterly earnings Friday, and Exxon Mobil and Schlumberger closed down about 1 percent each. Crude oil, which has generally moved in tandem with energy names for the last year, has fallen 2 percent in 2017. In a note Monday, Miller Tabak managing director Matt Maley said the XLE is nearing a critical multiyear trend line that if broken could mean the energy sector ""is getting quite close to a compelling decline."" In addition, some strategists noted, futures traders' crude oil positions as expressed in commitment of trader data are at historic extremes, with their longest positions on record. This is quite the contrarian indicator, Maley wrote, as the ""specs"" are ""almost always wrong at extremes."" ""In other words, there are A LOT of people on the bullish side of the boat in crude oil,"" Maley wrote, while ""commercials"" in the energy space have their largest short positions ever. The extreme positioning gives pause to Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at MKM Partners, who sees downside ahead for energy. ""Now when you talk about energy stocks, you have to remember it was the best-performing sector last year, but most of that was a function of a reversal of it being the worst-performing sector for much of 2014 and 2015. And the bulk of that gain came in the early part of last year. So if you weren't overweight energy stocks by April, you missed out on most of the outperformance,"" Krinsky said Monday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" And now, Krinsky said, the opposite is occurring; the XLE relative to the S&P 500 as well as on an absolute basis is beginning to break down below its uptrend line back to early 2015, echoing some of Maley's sentiment. However, Eddy Elfenbein, editor of the Crossing Wall Street blog, likes energy at this juncture in light of recently agreed-upon production cuts from OPEC.   ""I think it's just an unwinding of some of the recent trades. I mean, oil has had a spectacular year since the lows of about a year ago,"" Elfenbein said Monday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""    The XLE is up 25 percent in the last year. Elfenbein noted the energy sector's poor performance over the last seven weeks or so, but sees upside in roughly six months to a year as crude oil production cuts will take some time to play out.    ""The key, this is the big game changer is that the OPEC cuts that they announced in November, these were the first major cuts in eight years, they're actually working. OPEC… they never cooperate. And it really is working this time,"" Elfenbein said, adding that such cuts had put a ""floor"" of sorts at the $50 a barrel level.     Still, the technicals in Krinsky's eyes don't appear promising.   ""We don't think it's going to be anything like we saw in 2015, but [the] XLE probably has some more downside, lower to mid-60s,"" Krinsky said, adding that although the ETF is still well above its 200-day moving average, the extreme positions are reason enough to believe underperformance will continue in the near term.

Tom DiChristopher,02022017,CNBC,01262017,"Shares of Chevron gave up about 2 percent of their value in pre-market trading Friday as the oil giant turned in quarterly results that badly missed estimates. Chevron executives pointed to lower margins in its refining business and tax charges as drags on earnings during a conference call. They also said layoffs were largely behind them, but the company would continue looking for ways to drive down costs. The company also said it will be able to fund spending and dividends in 2017 with cash generated from operations, following a downturn that forced oil giants and smaller drillers alike to tap debt and other to sources to pay for normal business operations. ""Our 2016 earnings reflect the low oil and gas prices we saw during the year,"" Chairman and CEO John Watson said in a statement. ""We responded aggressively to those conditions, cutting capital and operating expenses by $14 billion."" Chief Financial Officer Patricia Yarrington said on the conference call Chevron is considering more assets sales. ""Additional opportunities are in progress and many will close in 2017,"" she said. Last month, the company said it would lower its capital spending for a fourth consecutive year. Chevron's $19.8 billion program for 2017 will focus on projects with shorter cycles and higher returns aimed at producing oil and gas within two years. That includes more drilling in the the U.S. Permian basin, located in Texas and New Mexico, which is leading the nation's shale oil recovery, Watson said. The company said it was operating 10 oil rigs in the region and planning to add another about every eight weeks, he said on Friday. Chevron also provided updates on its critical Gorgon liquefied natural gas project, which experienced some shutdowns in 2016, as well as its Wheatstone natural gas hub. Watson acknowledged the first phase of Gorgon's ramp-up missed expectations and said Chevron would apply those lessons to future phases there and at Wheatstone. He said the next phase of Gorgon would start processing LNG early in the second quarter. Phase one of Wheatstone is scheduled for mid-2017, with phase two expected six to eight months later. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $415 million, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of $31.5 billion. Analysts had expected Chevron to earn 64 cents on revenue of $33.3 billion, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. In the year-ago period, Chevron reported a loss of $588 million, or 31 cents a share, shortly before oil prices hit 12-year lows. Low crude oil and gas prices throughout much of 2016 pushed the oil giant to a loss for the year. For 2016, Chevron reported a loss of $497 million, or 27 cents a share. Cash flow, a key measure of corporate health in the oil and gas industry, was $12.8 billion in 2016, down from $19.5 billion the previous year. Chevron spent $22.4 billion on capital projects and exploration last year, down from $34 billion in 2015, reflecting the industry trend of reducing expenses to weather the downturn. Chevron saw results improve from the year-ago period in its upstream business, which includes exploration and production of fossil fuels. The company chalked that up to lower exploration and operating expenses and its oil and gas fetching a higher price. Oil prices stabilized above $50 a barrel in the fourth quarter after OPEC and other major oil producers agreed to cut production. In the downstream segment, which includes refining and marketing fuel, Chevron saw fourth-quarter profits slide both in the United States and abroad. The company broke even in its U.S. downstream business, compared with profits of $496 million a year ago. Integrated oil companies such as Chevron have seen their refining margins shrink on the rising price of crude oil, the raw material for many fuels. Throughout much of the oil price downturn that began in 2014, low crude costs boosted refining margins. Revenues for the quarter were $30 billion, up 7 percent from sales of $28 billion a year ago. On Wednesday, the San Ramon, California-based oil giant announced a quarterly dividend of $1.08 a share, unchanged from the previous quarter, when it hiked the shareholder payout by a penny.

Fred Imbert,02022017,CNBC,01262017,"U.S. equities closed lower on Monday, notching their worst day of the year, as a new measure taken by the Trump administration on immigration sent jitters through the market. President Donald Trump signed an executive order late Friday that would temporarily bar entry into the U.S. to Iraqi, Syrian, Iranian, Sudanese, Libyan, Somali and Yemeni citizens. The order seeks ""extreme vetting"" procedures for those it did allow to enter the U.S. In signing the order, Trump said he pledged to ""keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America."" ""We spent the first two months [following the election] focusing on the positives for companies. What we're seeing here is  that life is not a straight line,"" said Craig Sterling, head of U.S. equity research at Pioneer Investments. ""Perhaps the market is looking at the other side of things. Maybe the Trump administration is not going to do all the things businesses want."" The Dow Jones industrial average fell around 120 points after sliding more than 223.39 points, dropping below 20,000, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 dropped 0.6 percent, with energy shedding 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite underperformed, falling 0.8 percent. ""I think it also has to do with what the immigration policy represents [in terms of] the way the Trump administration is going to operate,"" said John Conlon, chief investment officer at People's United Wealth Management. ""The fact is that you've got a major policy that was implemented very quickly. That's causing uncertainty."" The order sparked outrage as thousands took to the streets across the U.S. in protest. Several world and corporate leaders also condemned the order. On Saturday, a federal judge issued an emergency stay to halt the deportation of people with valid visas who landed in the U.S. ""The Trump worries are now beginning to set in,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. ""We're having this ongoing worry effect that could overtake earnings and economic data."" The U.S. stock market has seen a massive rally since Trump's election, with the S&P and Dow advancing 7.25 percent and 9.61 percent since Nov. 8, respectively. ""You're coming off all-time highs on virtually every index,"" said Mark Spellman, portfolio manager at Alpine Funds. ""It doesn't take much for people to take a breather."" Traders have bet on Trump's promises of tax reform, infrastructure spending and deregulation that would boost growth, just as earnings have begun growing again. ""While investors were very quick to price in the expected impact that deregulation, infrastructure spending and job growth could have on the U.S. economy, I find it very difficult to believe that after pricing in heavy premiums based on fiscal promises, that investors are not now reconsidering what damage Trump might do by implementing other promises that supplemented an incoherent and ranting political campaign,"" said Jameel Ahmad, vice president of research at FXTM. ""Whether it is building a wall, banning certain nationalities, starting a trade war or pretty much anything else President Trump may do to upset people, it does risk both creating and deepening a negative perception of the U.S.,"" Ahmad said. In economic news, pending home sales for December rose 1.6 percent, while personal income rose 0.3 percent, below an expected increase of 0.4 percent. The data releases come a day before the Federal Reserve kicks off its first monetary policy meeting of the year. The central bank raised rates by a quarter of a percent at its December meeting. However, market expectations for a rate following this meeting are just 4 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. ""I'm as enthused as anyone about tax cuts (even though we don't know what final form will look like) and regulatory relief (but worried about trade protectionism and immigration bans),"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note. ""But to think that somehow the Fed is no longer relevant to both the economy and markets as they step up rate hikes I think is delusional,"" Boockvar said. U.S. Treasurys were mostly steady, with the benchmark 10-year note yield holding near 2.496 percent and the short-term two-year note yield around 1.22 percent. The U.S. dollar fell 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.069 and the yen around 113.7. In corporate news, earnings season continues this week as the likes of Exxon Mobil, Apple, Facebook and UPS get set to report quarterly results. European stocks traded broadly lower, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index dropped 1.05 percent. In Asia, stocks also fell, with the Japanese Nikkei 225 dropping 0.51 percent.

ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) peers have written down and impaired the value of several of their assets since the beginning of this oil and gas downturn, but ExxonMobil had not yet done so. That changed this past quarter when the company took a $2 billion hit to the bottom line. Despite that large asset charge, ExxonMobil's results weren't all that bad. Let's take a look at the numbers to see why the fourth quarter should give some hope for the coming year. Image source: Getty Images. Data source: ExxonMobil earnings release. * In millions, except per-share data. Last quarter, management gave everyone a heads-up that we should expect a sizable asset writedown this quarter. Well, we got it. Management took a $2.02 billion asset impairment, mostly related to its dry gas operations in the Rocky Mountains. This is a little bit of a surprise, actually. Based on the statement last quarter about taking oil and gas reserves off the books, there was the assumption that assets like its Canadian oil sands would be impaired. This writedown is pretty revealing, though. Management does writedowns based on discounted cash flows for those assets and the current carrying values of those assets. So reading the tea leaves into this impairment charge, we can come to two conclusions: The long life aspect of Canadian oil sands means that their asset value may not face as much risk as many might assume, and that there has been a permanent structural shift in natural gas production and pricing in the U.S. Aside from that one big change, the rest of ExxonMobil's results were par for the course. Downstream and chemical results suffered slightly from rising crude oil prices that impacted feedstock costs for these segments, and some favorable tax-related items gave its corporate segment a rare gain. DATA SOURCE:  EXXONMOBIL EARNINGS RELEASES. CHART BY AUTHOR. The one bright spot in the quarter was ExxonMobil's cash from operations. The $7.4 billion in cash was more than enough to cover its $4.8 billion in capital expenditures for the quarter, but fell just short of also covering the $3.1 billion in dividend payments. The $2.1 billion in asset sales helped to make up for the rest without having to take on any additional debt, something few integrated oil and gas companies have been able to do lately. Management quickly put that excess cash generation to work as it reduced total debt by $3.4 billion to $42.8 billion. Senior Vice President Jeff Woodbury gave his typical ""just the facts"" conference call, where he pointed out on multiple occasions that the company was generating more cash from operations than its capital budget. He said: ExxonMobil earned $7.8 billion in the year, while managing through a challenging business environment. Corporation delivered on its plan to produce 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day and maintain focus on business fundamentals. Volume contributions from our portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator. Total CapEx was $19.3 billion, down 38% from 2015, as we exercised capital discipline and investment selectivity and continued to push -- pursue market and execution efficiencies. Solid operating performance, combined with continued investment and cost discipline, generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $26.4 billion, and positive free cash flow of $9.7 billion. As I mentioned in the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations and asset sales more than covered the dividend and net investments in the business. ExxonMobil's results, even adding in the large asset impairment, weren't that bad. The big asset charge hides the fact that the company's cash generation has improved significantly compared to the prior quarter and portends a much better 2017. If you want to get into the nitty-gritty of ExxonMobil, its analyst day presentation is on March 1, where it will go into detail about its production and spending outlook for the next several years.

    ExxonMobil's Earnings Slip on a Rare Writedown -- The Motley Fool

Tyler Crowe,02022017,Fool,01262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For the past several years, the name of the game in the oil and gas business has been cutting capital spending to stay within cash flows. That's not exactly easy when oil prices are in decline. Now that the oil-price ship seems to have found its course again, ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) management is talking about some of the things it wants to accomplish, since it's generating enough cash to pay for it. Here are some quotes from ExxonMobil's most recent conference call that show where the company is seeing a lot of promise, as well as how it plans to address some shareholder concerns. Image source: Getty Images. With ExxonMobil's analyst day coming up, Senior Vice President Jeff Woodbury didn't give a whole lot of detail on plans for 2017 and beyond, aside from this little tidbit: Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2017 capital and exploration expenditures to be about $22 billion. We know there will be a lot of interest in our investment plans, and we will share additional details in a few weeks at our analyst meeting. That figure stands in comparison with the $19.3 billion the company spent in 2016. When pressed about the uptick in spending, particularly whether it was from raising costs from service companies, Woodbury explained that a large part of that spending is for higher activity and incremental gains, mostly in its upstream production. ExxonMobil and the other integrated majors have been criticized for not embracing shale more and making it a bigger part of the portfolio. As Woodbury points out, though, that slower growth has more been focused on learning how to attack its holdings in the most economical way. As a result, the company is now leveraging that learning period into production gains: Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development and allow us to maximize learning curve benefits through the cycle. For instance, in the Permian Basin, where we operate 2/3 of our production, our average drilling footage per day has increased about 85% since 2014 because of continuous learning and application of ExxonMobil's proprietary Fast Drill Process. We continue to focus on liquids growth through development activities and strategic farm-ins and acquisitions. Since 2010, XTO [Energy, an ExxonMobil subsidiary] has grown liquids production at a compounded annual growth rate of about 11%, and which currently represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production. Things like this can get lost in the fray of such a large company, but shale is becoming a stronger part of the business. Last month, ExxonMobil made a big splash by acquiring a large acreage position in the Permian Basin for $5 billion. The Permian has been a hot commodity because of the great well economics it produces. It's not that surprising, then, to hear Woodbury extol the virtues of this new asset and how much potential it has for the company in the coming years, as well as its potential for profit. I've highlighted a section that should really get investors excited: Less than 5% of the acquired resource has been developed to date, providing substantial opportunity for future growth. As a result of our proven capabilities, we are well positioned to maximize the value of this resource. This acquisition will add an estimated 3.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels in multiple stacked pace -- plays, 75% of which is liquids. The highly contiguous nature of the acreage will also provide significant cost advantages by combining XTO's low-cost execution capabilities with proprietary technology from upstream research company. We plan to drill the longest laterals within the play, which will maximize per well recoveries and help generate market-leading development cost. More than 85% of the wells are expected to have lateral lengths 2 miles or longer because the acreage is not constrained by traditional land lease issues. This transaction increases ExxonMobil's inventory of Permian drilled wells that yield at least a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel to more than 4,500 wells. We currently produce more than 140,000 net oil-equivalent barrels per day in the Permian and are operating 10 rigs. This is expected to move higher in 2017, as we begin activity on the newly acquired acreage. Liquefied natural gas has been a pretty hot topic for investors as of late, and ExxonMobil just received approval for its Golden Pass LNG facility from the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee. While there is certainly a long-term opportunity for LNG, Woodbury explained that ExxonMobil isn't in a rush to develop this asset because there is going to be some short-term lumpiness in the LNG market: Over the long term, we expect that LNG capacity or demand will continue to grow. In fact, almost something like 250% of today's LNG capacity. A large part of that growth is primarily driven by Asia. Now like most commodities, you're going to have periods in which there's oversupply and periods where there's insufficient supply. And we do expect that with the number of projects coming on that there are some projects that -- well, there's a period in which we'll see LNG oversupply. Now if I step back from that, that's the -- if you will, the value proposition, and I step back, we've got a very extensive portfolio. And I would tell you that brownfield developments -- that is, incremental investments to the existing operations, like Papua New Guinea or even Golden Pass -- provide us [an] economic advantage by lowering the cost, by leveraging the installed investment. At Golden Pass, as you noted, we did get FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] approval. The one key step that we're still waiting for after many years is final Department of Energy approval of non-FTA [free-trade-agreement] export authorization, and we're hoping that that will come shortly. But each one of these projects will be evaluated on their own merit. As you've heard us say previously, as it relates to LNG projects, we want to lock in a large part of the -- that capacity on long-term contracts. And Golden Pass, within the whole portfolio of investment opportunities that we have, we're pursuing long-term sales contracts. Several of ExxonMobil's competitors have either come under scrutiny for executive pay or have recently changed their executive-pay contacts. When asked about this, Woodbury said why he thinks the system the company has in place is best suited for long term investors and why ExxonMobil will probably hang on to its current structure: [R]emember that a large part of our compensation program is based on a long-term payment schedule. And it is intended in order to make sure that our executives are being held to the decisions that we're making over the long term. And our long-term incentive is paid over a 10-year period, 50% about five years; the remaining 50% after 10 years. Really, it's the later of 10 years or retirement, so some of us go even beyond 10 years. But it's really designed to ensure that our executives feel the same performance that our investors feel because when it does pay out, it's paid out at the current stock price. Now I'll tell you that the Compensation Committee does step back and look at the program periodically to make sure that it's ensuring, it's encouraging the right type of behaviors, and it's recognizing the success of the corporation. Anyone investing in this company for a decade or more has to be encouraged that executive pay with these companies is structured on such a long-term time horizon, as the incentives for management are much more in line with the investment time horizon for its shareholders.

    ExxonMobil's Management Has Lined Up Some Big Things for 2017 -- The Motley Fool

Rich Smith,02022017,Fool,01262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Coal-miner CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) did not have a great 2016. In its earnings report released on January 31, 2017, CONSOL confessed to investors that Q4 ""earnings"" of negative $302 million marked a sharp reversal from last year's $34 million Q4 profit. For the year, CONSOL reported combined net losses of $839 million, or $3.70 per diluted share -- more than twice what it lost in 2015. Hoping to right the ship in the new year, CONSOL confirmed that it is ""pursuing ... the possible sale of the coal business to a third party or the spin-off of the coal business to CONSOL's shareholders,"" and hopes to effect such a divestiture before the end of this year. And yet, this poses an existential dilemma for CONSOL shareholders. Historically, CONSOL Energy has always been considered to be first and foremost a coal mining stock. So if CONSOL divests itself of coal, what exactly will it have left? CONSOL Energy asks: Might we interest you in a coal spin-off? Image source: Getty Images. In 2016, CONSOL reported total sales of $2 billion from all its divisions, down 25% year over year. Of these revenues, coal sales accounted for a bit less than $1.1 billion of the business, while sales of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids made up $793 million. The balance of CONSOL's revenue was attributed to such activities as ""purchased gas sales,"" ""freight-outside coal,"" and ""other outside sales."" Ex-coal, CONSOL should continue doing about $800 million to $900 million in business focusing primarily on oil and gas exploration and production. CONSOL probably won't be earning profit on these revenues even after coal is removed from the picture, however. Here's why not: According to CONSOL's consolidated statements of income, oil and gas exploration and production activities incurred $1.2 billion in operating costs last year, which is already more than the revenues the oil and gas business is bringing in. Now let's assume that roughly half of the company's $400 million in ""other costs"" incurred also belong to the oil and gas business. Voila! CONSOL Energy, ex-coal, is probably going to be running at least a $500 million operating deficit ($900 million in revenues, minus $1.4 billion in costs) after any spin-off. So how much might a coal-less CONSOL Energy be worth? That's hard to say. Valued on sales, traditional oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil, Conoco, and Chevron are selling for anywhere from 1.8 times sale to 2.6 times sales today. Apply that valuation to CONSOL's $900 million or less in oil and gas revenue and you get a fair valuation of at most $2.3 billion for CONSOL after it ditches its coal business. Of course, CONSOL stock costs $3.9 billion today, which would seem to imply that the coal business CONSOL wants to get rid of is worth as much as $1.6 billion -- which is quite simply a fantastic (as in, unrealistic) valuation. There aren't a whole lot of publicly traded coal companies left standing to compare CONSOL's coal business to today (because most have gone bankrupt already). But two companies with similar-sized coal revenues, SunCoke Energy (NYSE:SWC) and Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE:CLD), are still in business. SunCoke stock sells for 0.46 times sales, while Cloud Peak gets 0.44x sales for its shares. Applying a similar 0.45x sales valuation to CONSOL's coal business implies a fair value of only about $400 million -- one quarter of $1.6 billion. What we're left with, then, is a difficult question: If CONSOL's oil and gas business is worth $2.3 billion, and its coal business perhaps $400 million, then ... where does the remaining $1.2 billion in CONSOL's market capitalization go? In fact, given the trajectory the shares have been taking these past few days, I'd say that scenario is more likely than not. ","

Barbara Kollmeyer,02022017,MarketWatch,01262017,"Published: Jan 31, 2017 3:39 p.m. ET Critical information for the U.S. trading day By Traders begging for nonpresidential drivers may get exactly that today, thanks to Apple and the start of a Fed meeting. “This week was supposed to be dominated by central banks’ decisions, earnings, and economic data from across the globe, but with Donald Trump in office, nothing seems capable of taking the spotlight from the White House.” That was FXTM strategist Hussein Sayed in a note that pretty much nails the mood. The jitters look set to stick around today, with some youngsters in for a #SaturdayNightMasscare history-refresher after Trump sent a defiant attorney general packing: Much debate now surrounds just when to start worrying about politics in earnest, and Sayed has one answer: “The major risk looming now is the breakup of the Republican coalition, although this doesn’t seem to be the case for now. I believe it’s going to be the biggest risk to financial markets in the near future, as we end up with protectionist policies without the implementation of fiscal policies, thus triggering a sharp reversal in stocks worldwide.” Our call of the day echoes this a bit. From Macro Man blogger Macronick comes the warning that markets could be headed for an “escalator up, elevator down” selloff. And “even a garden-variety 5% dip in the S&P would feel pretty vicious,” given the subdued state of volatility over the last two months, the blogger adds. If the Trump administration “overplays its hand,” eroding its relationship with the GOP, its much-anticipated infrastructure spending and tax-cut programs could get delayed or downsized, Macronick says. Then, harking back to the debt-ceiling shock of 2011, a prolonged political upset could start to hit growth and business confidence. Next would come a reflation reversal for stocks. While we’re not there yet, there’s plenty of time for more fireworks, says Macronick. “Investors have been viewing Trump as a second coming of Reagan,” the blogger adds. “They should remember his presidency may yet end up bearing much in common with Nixon’s—a period marked by widespread civil unrest and extreme animosity between the White House and press.” To be sure, strategists have been warning about Trump-inspired selling for a while, and the market has instead scored records.

Here’s his chart (table): “The data clearly show that the S&P 500 has historically traded strongly into the first rate hike but then has lost momentum as monetary policy has been tightened making little or no progress, on average, for the 12-month period that followed increase in headline U.S. borrowing costs,” says Mould.

William Ruckelshaus, fired as deputy attorney for defying Nixon during Watergate, weighed in on comparisons to the Saturday Night Masscare, in which the 37th president did his own “You’re fired!” routine.

Tyler Crowe,02092017,Fool,02022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For the past several years, the name of the game in the oil and gas business has been cutting capital spending to stay within cash flows. That's not exactly easy when oil prices are in decline. Now that the oil-price ship seems to have found its course again, ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) management is talking about some of the things it wants to accomplish, since it's generating enough cash to pay for it. Here are some quotes from ExxonMobil's most recent conference call that show where the company is seeing a lot of promise, as well as how it plans to address some shareholder concerns. Image source: Getty Images. With ExxonMobil's analyst day coming up, Senior Vice President Jeff Woodbury didn't give a whole lot of detail on plans for 2017 and beyond, aside from this little tidbit: Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2017 capital and exploration expenditures to be about $22 billion. We know there will be a lot of interest in our investment plans, and we will share additional details in a few weeks at our analyst meeting. That figure stands in comparison with the $19.3 billion the company spent in 2016. When pressed about the uptick in spending, particularly whether it was from raising costs from service companies, Woodbury explained that a large part of that spending is for higher activity and incremental gains, mostly in its upstream production. ExxonMobil and the other integrated majors have been criticized for not embracing shale more and making it a bigger part of the portfolio. As Woodbury points out, though, that slower growth has more been focused on learning how to attack its holdings in the most economical way. As a result, the company is now leveraging that learning period into production gains: Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development and allow us to maximize learning curve benefits through the cycle. For instance, in the Permian Basin, where we operate 2/3 of our production, our average drilling footage per day has increased about 85% since 2014 because of continuous learning and application of ExxonMobil's proprietary Fast Drill Process. We continue to focus on liquids growth through development activities and strategic farm-ins and acquisitions. Since 2010, XTO [Energy, an ExxonMobil subsidiary] has grown liquids production at a compounded annual growth rate of about 11%, and which currently represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production. Things like this can get lost in the fray of such a large company, but shale is becoming a stronger part of the business. Last month, ExxonMobil made a big splash by acquiring a large acreage position in the Permian Basin for $5 billion. The Permian has been a hot commodity because of the great well economics it produces. It's not that surprising, then, to hear Woodbury extol the virtues of this new asset and how much potential it has for the company in the coming years, as well as its potential for profit. I've highlighted a section that should really get investors excited: Less than 5% of the acquired resource has been developed to date, providing substantial opportunity for future growth. As a result of our proven capabilities, we are well positioned to maximize the value of this resource. This acquisition will add an estimated 3.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels in multiple stacked pace -- plays, 75% of which is liquids. The highly contiguous nature of the acreage will also provide significant cost advantages by combining XTO's low-cost execution capabilities with proprietary technology from upstream research company. We plan to drill the longest laterals within the play, which will maximize per well recoveries and help generate market-leading development cost. More than 85% of the wells are expected to have lateral lengths 2 miles or longer because the acreage is not constrained by traditional land lease issues. This transaction increases ExxonMobil's inventory of Permian drilled wells that yield at least a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel to more than 4,500 wells. We currently produce more than 140,000 net oil-equivalent barrels per day in the Permian and are operating 10 rigs. This is expected to move higher in 2017, as we begin activity on the newly acquired acreage. Liquefied natural gas has been a pretty hot topic for investors as of late, and ExxonMobil just received approval for its Golden Pass LNG facility from the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee. While there is certainly a long-term opportunity for LNG, Woodbury explained that ExxonMobil isn't in a rush to develop this asset because there is going to be some short-term lumpiness in the LNG market: Over the long term, we expect that LNG capacity or demand will continue to grow. In fact, almost something like 250% of today's LNG capacity. A large part of that growth is primarily driven by Asia. Now like most commodities, you're going to have periods in which there's oversupply and periods where there's insufficient supply. And we do expect that with the number of projects coming on that there are some projects that -- well, there's a period in which we'll see LNG oversupply. Now if I step back from that, that's the -- if you will, the value proposition, and I step back, we've got a very extensive portfolio. And I would tell you that brownfield developments -- that is, incremental investments to the existing operations, like Papua New Guinea or even Golden Pass -- provide us [an] economic advantage by lowering the cost, by leveraging the installed investment. At Golden Pass, as you noted, we did get FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] approval. The one key step that we're still waiting for after many years is final Department of Energy approval of non-FTA [free-trade-agreement] export authorization, and we're hoping that that will come shortly. But each one of these projects will be evaluated on their own merit. As you've heard us say previously, as it relates to LNG projects, we want to lock in a large part of the -- that capacity on long-term contracts. And Golden Pass, within the whole portfolio of investment opportunities that we have, we're pursuing long-term sales contracts. Several of ExxonMobil's competitors have either come under scrutiny for executive pay or have recently changed their executive-pay contacts. When asked about this, Woodbury said why he thinks the system the company has in place is best suited for long term investors and why ExxonMobil will probably hang on to its current structure: [R]emember that a large part of our compensation program is based on a long-term payment schedule. And it is intended in order to make sure that our executives are being held to the decisions that we're making over the long term. And our long-term incentive is paid over a 10-year period, 50% about five years; the remaining 50% after 10 years. Really, it's the later of 10 years or retirement, so some of us go even beyond 10 years. But it's really designed to ensure that our executives feel the same performance that our investors feel because when it does pay out, it's paid out at the current stock price. Now I'll tell you that the Compensation Committee does step back and look at the program periodically to make sure that it's ensuring, it's encouraging the right type of behaviors, and it's recognizing the success of the corporation. Anyone investing in this company for a decade or more has to be encouraged that executive pay with these companies is structured on such a long-term time horizon, as the incentives for management are much more in line with the investment time horizon for its shareholders.

    ExxonMobil's Management Has Lined Up Some Big Things for 2017 -- The Motley Fool

Rich Smith,02092017,Fool,02022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Coal-miner CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) did not have a great 2016. In its earnings report released on January 31, 2017, CONSOL confessed to investors that Q4 ""earnings"" of negative $302 million marked a sharp reversal from last year's $34 million Q4 profit. For the year, CONSOL reported combined net losses of $839 million, or $3.70 per diluted share -- more than twice what it lost in 2015. Hoping to right the ship in the new year, CONSOL confirmed that it is ""pursuing ... the possible sale of the coal business to a third party or the spin-off of the coal business to CONSOL's shareholders,"" and hopes to effect such a divestiture before the end of this year. And yet, this poses an existential dilemma for CONSOL shareholders. Historically, CONSOL Energy has always been considered to be first and foremost a coal mining stock. So if CONSOL divests itself of coal, what exactly will it have left? CONSOL Energy asks: Might we interest you in a coal spin-off? Image source: Getty Images. In 2016, CONSOL reported total sales of $2 billion from all its divisions, down 25% year over year. Of these revenues, coal sales accounted for a bit less than $1.1 billion of the business, while sales of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids made up $793 million. The balance of CONSOL's revenue was attributed to such activities as ""purchased gas sales,"" ""freight-outside coal,"" and ""other outside sales."" Ex-coal, CONSOL should continue doing about $800 million to $900 million in business focusing primarily on oil and gas exploration and production. CONSOL probably won't be earning profit on these revenues even after coal is removed from the picture, however. Here's why not: According to CONSOL's consolidated statements of income, oil and gas exploration and production activities incurred $1.2 billion in operating costs last year, which is already more than the revenues the oil and gas business is bringing in. Now let's assume that roughly half of the company's $400 million in ""other costs"" incurred also belong to the oil and gas business. Voila! CONSOL Energy, ex-coal, is probably going to be running at least a $500 million operating deficit ($900 million in revenues, minus $1.4 billion in costs) after any spin-off. So how much might a coal-less CONSOL Energy be worth? That's hard to say. Valued on sales, traditional oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil, Conoco, and Chevron are selling for anywhere from 1.8 times sale to 2.6 times sales today. Apply that valuation to CONSOL's $900 million or less in oil and gas revenue and you get a fair valuation of at most $2.3 billion for CONSOL after it ditches its coal business. Of course, CONSOL stock costs $3.9 billion today, which would seem to imply that the coal business CONSOL wants to get rid of is worth as much as $1.6 billion -- which is quite simply a fantastic (as in, unrealistic) valuation. There aren't a whole lot of publicly traded coal companies left standing to compare CONSOL's coal business to today (because most have gone bankrupt already). But two companies with similar-sized coal revenues, SunCoke Energy (NYSE:SWC) and Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE:CLD), are still in business. SunCoke stock sells for 0.46 times sales, while Cloud Peak gets 0.44x sales for its shares. Applying a similar 0.45x sales valuation to CONSOL's coal business implies a fair value of only about $400 million -- one quarter of $1.6 billion. What we're left with, then, is a difficult question: If CONSOL's oil and gas business is worth $2.3 billion, and its coal business perhaps $400 million, then ... where does the remaining $1.2 billion in CONSOL's market capitalization go? In fact, given the trajectory the shares have been taking these past few days, I'd say that scenario is more likely than not. ","

Hess' stock started on a downward spiral after the company released its 2017 guidance. The driller said it was boosting capex to $2.25 billion, which was up 18% from last year. That capital would enable the company to increase production by 8% to 12% when measuring its exit-to-exit rate while delivering an average rate of 300,000 to 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d). Analysts, however, were expecting more. Their consensus was that the company would spend $2.4 billion and produce 320,000 BOE/d. Image source: Hess. That said, J.P. Morgan came out in support of the company, saying that its post-guidance sell-off was a buying opportunity. The bank reiterated its overweight rating and $65 price target. Furthermore, it noted that the company's longer-term earnings power was improving due in part to an expanding resource base in Guyana. Speaking of Guyana, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) reported positive results from an exploration well in the country, noting that it encountered high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. ExxonMobil also stated that an appraisal well in the country identified another high-quality reservoir below the Liza field. ExxonMobil also said that the Liza field should produce as much as 100,000 barrels of oil per day when it begins flowing in 2020. These positive developments are excellent news for Hess, which owns a 30% interest in these exploration blocks. Another weight on Hess' stock last month was the release of its fourth-quarter earnings. While the company reported a narrower-than-expected loss thanks to cost reductions, investors still sold off the stock, apparently expecting more.

,02232017,Reuters,02162017,"(Reuters) - Wall Street is pushing back against a proposed rule to force U.S. banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc to hold more capital against investments in commodities, placing what some see as an overly restrictive limit on banks’ ties to the sector. In a comment letter filed late on Friday and not yet made public, the industry argues the proposed rule would hurt the economy, and that fears about environmental risks from physical commodities activities are overblown. The U.S. Federal Reserve handed down the proposal in September, after a public backlash stemming from the belief that big banks’ involvement in commodities markets hurt consumers by driving up prices. The comment letter, filed by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the Institution of International Bankers and seen by Reuters, comes as big banks face an uncertain future in Washington. Even though President Donald Trump has said he favors deregulation and has hired several Wall Street executives as advisers, it is unclear how he or the new Congress will approach various rules. Apart from Goldman Sachs, few banks have large exposure to physical commodities any longer. At one time, it was a big and lucrative business for both Goldman and Morgan Stanley, due to a quirk in their regulatory structure. Other banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, eventually plunged into the business as well, but exited as global capital requirements got more onerous, making such investments too costly to maintain. The Fed’s proposed rule would formalize and increase those standards, imposing what it has called a 1,250 percent risk weighting on banks that own, trade and move physical commodities. Among other measures, $1 in capital would need to be held for every $1 investment, the regulator’s highest charge for the riskiest investments. The rule could potentially force banks to withdraw from the commodities business altogether, because such capital charges would severely depress returns. In its proposal, the Fed said new measures would shield banks and the broader financial system from a costly mishap like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Advocates say the rule is also needed to help mitigate commodity price fluctuations and social conflicts that arise from commodity-related activities.

                Wall Street challenges U.S. regulator over proposed commodities rule | Reuters"
,02232017,Reuters,02162017,"(Reuters) - Wall Street is pushing back against a proposed rule to force U.S. banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc to hold more capital against investments in commodities, placing what some see as an overly restrictive limit on banks’ ties to the sector. In a comment letter filed late on Friday and not yet made public, the industry argues the proposed rule would hurt the economy, and that fears about environmental risks from physical commodities activities are overblown. The U.S. Federal Reserve handed down the proposal in September, after a public backlash stemming from the belief that big banks’ involvement in commodities markets hurt consumers by driving up prices. The comment letter, filed by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the Institution of International Bankers and seen by Reuters, comes as big banks face an uncertain future in Washington. Even though President Donald Trump has said he favors deregulation and has hired several Wall Street executives as advisers, it is unclear how he or the new Congress will approach various rules. Apart from Goldman Sachs, few banks have large exposure to physical commodities any longer. At one time, it was a big and lucrative business for both Goldman and Morgan Stanley, due to a quirk in their regulatory structure. Other banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, eventually plunged into the business as well, but exited as global capital requirements got more onerous, making such investments too costly to maintain. The Fed’s proposed rule would formalize and increase those standards, imposing what it has called a 1,250 percent risk weighting on banks that own, trade and move physical commodities. Among other measures, $1 in capital would need to be held for every $1 investment, the regulator’s highest charge for the riskiest investments. The rule could potentially force banks to withdraw from the commodities business altogether, because such capital charges would severely depress returns. In its proposal, the Fed said new measures would shield banks and the broader financial system from a costly mishap like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Advocates say the rule is also needed to help mitigate commodity price fluctuations and social conflicts that arise from commodity-related activities. In the letter filed on Friday, the bank-affiliated groups said the rule would hurt “competition, end users, the liquidity of commodities markets ... and thus the real economy.” A number of utility and power companies, including Calpine Corp, have also cited liquidity and price concerns.

Mark Fahey,02232017,CNBC,02162017,"President Donald Trump's tax plan may cut the federal business income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, but dozens of companies are already enjoying rates below the new maximum. The plan would be a windfall for retailers like Best Buy and CVS and for financial services companies like Visa and JPMorgan Chase, which tend to pay close to the 35 percent. On the other hand, companies that have access to substantial tax deductions and are already below 15 percent could suffer if the cut comes at the expense of closing tax loopholes. The average effective federal tax rate for profitable Fortune 500 companies was a little under 20 percent from 2008 to 2012, according to a 2014 study by the progressive tax reform organization Citizens for Tax Justice. About 35 percent of those companies were already under Trump's proposed 15 percent rate. CTJ is in the process of updating those calculations, and most companies' tax rates have been fairly consistent over the long term. It's hard to know exactly how Trump's tax plan would affect individual companies, partly because the administration hasn't released the details of its proposal yet. Two weeks ago, Trump said he would make a ""phenomenal"" tax announcement in two or three weeks. On Wednesday he said tax reform was ""very well finalized"" but that it wouldn't come until after health-care reforms. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday morning that he wants to see the reforms passed before Congress goes on its August recess. According to Trump's published tax plan, ""no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes."" Mnuchin said the administration is looking at a combined plan with Republicans in Congress, who have been pushing a 20 percent business tax and a controversial border adjustment tax. The final mix of reforms could very well benefit companies that are currently paying more than 15 or 20 percent, while driving up taxes for companies that already have low rates thanks to loopholes. Trump's strategy for keeping the tax cuts revenue-neutral depends in part on eliminating some ""special interest loopholes."" ""You can make the basic observation that companies like Exxon Mobil that are routinely able to reduce their tax bill will likely benefit much less than companies in the retail sector, which traditionally pay a lot closer to 35 percent,"" said Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at CTJ. ""Congress has enacted special tax breaks for a number of different industries, but retailers are generally unaffected and there aren't a lot of breaks designed for them."" Take a company like Amazon, which has paid 11 percent in taxes on its domestic income over the last eight years. According to the company's annual report, that rate was reached using a number of special deductions, including stock-based compensation deductions, accelerated depreciation deductions, research and development credits, and the domestic production activities deduction. Companies like Boeing (-1 percent from 2008 to 2012) and Honeywell (8 percent) use similar deductions and credits. ""The companies that tend to do the best tend to be companies that make a lot of capital investments, like utilities or manufacturers because the accelerated depreciation rules have been so generous over the last couple of decades,"" said Gardner. ""They give big rewards to anyone investing in factories or machinery."" Generally, the biggest deductions are more useful for companies in utilities, telecommunications, oil and gas, manufacturing and some pharmaceutical companies, while retailers, financial services, food companies and health-care companies tend to pay closer to the statutory rate. Take a look at all the profitable Fortune 500 companies below: The final impact of Trump's tax plan depends a lot on the revenue trade-offs that are included to pay for the cuts. A border tax, for example, would be a hit on retailers, but dropping the business tax rate would also disproportionately help retailers. Big companies may lose some deductions, but the plan also calls for a one-time repatriation of the $2.5 trillion in corporate cash sitting offshore at a 10 percent rate, which would save companies like Apple, Microsoft and Citigroup billions of dollars. As the plan stands now, it would increase the federal debt by $7.2 trillion over the first decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. An analysis by the Tax Foundation estimated revenues would be decreased by at least $4.4 trillion over the next decade, depending on the specific policy changes. Lawmakers could reduce some of those revenue shortfalls by removing any number of other tax loopholes, but Gardner isn't optimistic that those changes will be implemented. It's often much easier to propose steep tax cuts than it is to work out a way to pay for them. ""It's certainly true that an even-handed revenue-neutral reform would leave some companies substantially worse off, especially those that have relied most heavily on the tax breaks being taken away,"" said Gardner. ""But in the real world, Congress might answer the easy question of how far to cut the tax rate and avoid the hard question of how to pay for it."" ",These companies could lose the most from Trump’s tax plan
Bob Pisani,02232017,CNBC,02162017,"Home Depot is at another historic high on Tuesday following its excellent earnings report, but a major factor behind its stock price rise has been dividend hikes (it raised its dividend 29 percent on Tuesday), and an aggressive buyback program, including the new $15 billion share buyback program that it also announced. To give you an idea of just how big a $15 billion buyback is, the company's market cap is roughly $175 billion, so we are talking about buying back nearly 9 percent of the company. Even by the standards of the last decade, that is a big buyback. Home Depot is part of a select group of companies I call ""buyback monsters,"" companies that have bought back more than 25 percent of their shares since 2000. Why 2000? Because most companies hit their highest levels of shares outstanding between 2000 and 2006; since then, most companies have been reducing share count, in some cases aggressively. Consider Home Depot. In 2003, they had 2.36 billion shares outstanding, according to Factset. Today, they have 1.21 billion shares outstanding. That is half the shares they had outstanding 14 years ago. All other things being equal, that means earnings are twice as high as they would have been in 2003, when there were twice as many shares outstanding. Home Depot isn't alone. IBM had 1.9 billion shares outstanding in 1997, today it has about 950 million, again less than half what it had 20 years ago. ExxonMobil had 7 billion shares outstanding in 2000, today it has 4.1 billion, a reduction of about 42 percent. This is not a trend that is limited by any one sector. There are companies that have been aggressively reducing their share counts in Industrials, Technology, and Consumer: Industrials: share count reductionsNorthrup Grumman: 50 percent since 2003CSX: 29 percent since 20003M: 25 percent since 2000United Technologies: 25 percent since 2005 Technology: share count reductionsMicrosoft: 30 percent since 2004Intel: 30 percent since 2001Cisco: 32 percent since 2001 Why are there buybacks at all? They were originally used to support the issuance of stock options. The options increased the share count outstanding, so to keep the count down the company bought back shares. But as the opportunity for significant top-line growth waned, buybacks to reduce share counts became a separate strategy to prop up earnings growth. And that's my beef: Buybacks are a form of financial engineering. Here's another problem: It's not at all clear that buying companies just because they are buying back shares will be a successful investment strategy. Take IBM — despite being one of the most aggressive buyback monsters on the Street, you can't say IBM's stock price has soared in the last decade. In 2014, the company eased off a bit on its buybacks, and the stock headed south. It headed south because IBM was beset by fundamental growth issues: Its revenues from its old line businesses were shrinking and there was notrevenue from nascent businesses (like Watson and artificial intelligence) replacing it. The lesson: No amount of financial engineering like buying back shares can replace management's inability to grow the business. Not surprisingly, there are ETFs for all this, but their performance has been spotty. ThePowerShares Buyback Achievers ETF (PKW) tracks a market-cap-weighted index of companies that repurchased at least 5 percent of their outstanding shares in the previous 12 months. Top holdings include McDonald's, Boeing, and QUALCOMM. It has slightly outperformed the S&P 500 in the last year, but it has underperformed the S&P 500 by about 6 percentage points over a two-year period. So just reducing shares doesn't necessarily mean that companies will outperform. A better approach might be that taken by the AdvisorShares Wilshire Buyback ETF (TTFS), which uses a ""smart beta"" approach that screens not just for reduction of shares but also free cash flow, and no increase to leverage. The TTFS has outperformed the PKW by about 9 percentage points in the past two years. Do not expect buybacks to go away. Buybacks could become an even bigger business, if the whole business of tax reductions become a reality. Billions could be repatriated from overseas, and most strategists believe that a large amount of that money could find its way into buybacks. The fact that all the FANG names were down 2 percent to 3 percent, and the industrial and energy sectors were down 1.5 percent each, points to a bigger problem. It's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Stock and bond ETFs associated with active trading saw heavy volumes and some withdrawals during October's turbulent market conditions, while investors put money into exchange traded funds that are more associated with buy and hold strategies. Companies are coming out of ""blackout periods"" around their earnings and can now increase their buyback activity. A CNBC reporter since 1990, Bob Pisani covers Wall Street from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Tariff concerns remain a key talking point on Wall Street when dissecting the market volatility fit over the past month, but the issue seems to be carrying less heft among corporate executives. Aurora Cannabis reported on Monday that revenue jumped 260 percent over the last 12 months, with kilograms produced climbing to 4,996 from 1,010 over the past year. SAP is buying Qualtrics, nabbing the company just before its planned IPO. ","Buyback binge is going strong, but here is why they are not the solution"
"George Budwell, Rich Smith, and Neha Chamaria",02232017,Fool,02162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, can be a powerful and smart way to pursue above-average income opportunities in the market. The short story is that ETFs provide instant diversification, thus lowering the risk of holding a single high-yield stock that may turn out to be a ticking time bomb later on down the road. Given the expansive universe of high-yield ETFs in existence at the moment, however, it's not exactly easy to choose the cream of the crop. Our Foolish team of dividend experts, though, think that the iShares Core High Dividend (NYSEMKT:HDV), the Vanguard REIT ETF (NYSEMKT:VNQ), and the SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT:DWX) could all boost your portfolio's earnings power to the next level. Here's why. Image Source: Getty Images. George Budwell (iShares Core High Dividend): While the iShares Core High Dividend Equity Fund's yield of 3.31% won't exactly knock your socks off, this well-diversified ETF does come with a rock bottom expense ratio of 0.12% and a solid track record of producing outstanding returns on capital. Long story short, the iShares Core High Dividend Equity Fund has marched steadily northward since its inception approximately 6 years ago, outperforming most of its peers in the process: HDV data by YCharts. What's underneath the hood? This ETF tracks a dividend-weighted index of 75 U.S. equities that pay a better than average yield. And as an added measure, the fund also screens equities for high earnings potential and dividend sustainability in order to up the overall quality of its holdings. The net result is that the iShares Core High Dividend Equity Fund is made up of mostly dividend stalwarts like ExxonMobile, Chevron Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, among many others. That's an impressive roster of blue-chip companies by any measure and underscores why this ETF has performed so well during the market's lengthy bull run over the past several years. As a prime example, J&J has been able to maintain one of the strongest balance sheet ratings among U.S. equities for decades, despite its heavy investment in its dividend program and R&D activities. Pfizer is also a well-known cash cow with outstanding free cash flows and a superb balance sheet in its own right. In all, this dividend ETF offers a nice mix of high-quality equities, a respectable yield, and a bargain-basement expense ratio. Neha Chamaria (Vanguard REIT ETF): With a dividend yield of 6%, Vanguard REIT ETF is my top pic for income investors. As its name suggests, this ETF invests only in REITs, which also explains its high yields, though it isn't exactly a dividend-themed fund. As you might know, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their income to shareholders to avoid paying taxes. This ETF, which tracks the MSCI US REIT Index, holds 156 real estate investment trust stocks that invest in properties across diverse sectors, including healthcare, industrials, offices, residential, and hotels. You can get a fair idea about the diversity within the REITs this ETF offers when you realize that its top holdings include names like Simon Property Group, Public Storage, Prologis, and Equinix. At about 23%, retail REITs have the largest exposure in this ETF, and residential and specialized REITs come in next with about 16% share in assets each. You might be wondering why I'm optimistic about a REIT ETF in a rising interest rate scenario -- higher interest rates, after all, have traditionally hurt REIT valuations. Vanguard, however, has held up pretty strong in the past three months, and I wouldn't be surprised if it continues to do so. One reason is that most of the ETF's top holdings have strong track records of growth in funds from operations and dividends. Just to give you an example, Simon Property's dividend has grown at an annual compounded rate of 13.2% in the past five years. Moreover, as Vanguard is a diversified ETF, there will ideally almost always be pockets of strength in its portfolio even during adverse times. Potential higher infrastructure spending under Donald Trump's presidency could, for instance, boost manufacturing activity and prospects for office and industrial REITs, allowing them to command higher rents. Likewise, higher consumer confidence bodes well for retail REITs, and so on. Finally, this ETF's expense ratio of 0.12% is not only substantially lower than those of industry peers, but also among the lowest in the REIT space. That means greater savings and higher returns for shareholders while they enjoy the hefty dividends along the way. Right now, the U.S. dollar is still not far off its five-year high, making companies' income earned (and dividends paid) in foreign currency worth relatively less when converted back into U.S. dollars. To my mind, that makes now a good time to look for foreign dividend payers as a promising investment -- because they'll be worth more once exchange rates turn around. My pick for this play on exchange rates is therefore the SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF, which tracks the 100 highest-yielding dividend-paying companies outside the U.S. This $1 billion fund carries a hefty, but not unreasonable, expense ratio of 0.45%, but a market-beating dividend yield of 5.1%. Even after deducting expenses, the SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF yields twice the average dividend yield on the S&P 500. Valuation-wise, this ETF's stocks carry an average P/E ratio of 17.1 -- which is also well below the S&P's average P/E of 25.7. The SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF achieves diversification in its portfolio by capping exposure to any given region of the world at 25% (it's maxed out on financials right now, for example, and getting close to 25% on energy companies), and capping exposure to individual market sectors at 25% as well. Although DWX has underperformed over the past five years, it may finally be coming into its own here near the dollar's peak, and delivered a near 25% return to investors over the past year. My bet: The SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF will continue to outperform as the dollar's value peaks, plateaus, and begins to drop off. ","
