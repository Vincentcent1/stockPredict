 ,10262017,CNBC,10192017,"BroadSoft, the Gaithersburg, Md.-based company that handles the cloud-based software used to manage call conferencing, announced Monday that it is being sold to California-based telecommunications giant Cisco as both companies seek to harness the changes brought by cloud computing. The $1.9 billion deal represents a 2 percent premium over Friday's closing stock price. The transaction is scheduled to close in the first half of 2018. The offer price is more than 25 percent higher than where BroadSoft shares were trading before Reuters reported Aug. 30 that the company was exploring a potential sale. Executives described the combination as a step to focus on group teleconferencing services, an expansion beyond the traditional routing hardware Cisco is best known for. Cisco has been building out its WebEx videoconferencing service for large businesses in recent years. ""We've seen firsthand how the agile workforce of today is transforming how work gets done, whether that's virtually, on the move or in their physical work environments,"" Cisco Senior Vice President Roland Acra said in a call with investors. ""Our customers expect the tools from Cisco that will enable them to continue that transition."" Cloud computing technology, and the often cheaper global calling and videoconferencing it enables, has been a significant opportunity for traditional telecommunications companies. Microsoft, one of Cisco's close competitors in the business conference-call space, recently announced that it would end its Skype for Business offering in favor of a new product called Microsoft Teams. Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011 when it was a market-dominating consumer videoconferencing app. Since then, the market for business-focused online collaboration tools has exploded, with companies such as Slack, Google and Facebook competing for market share. In a call with investors Monday, Cisco executives said the combination with BroadSoft would give the company a stronger hand as it competes with Microsoft. Microsoft has ""run into a brick wall with BroadSoft, frankly, at the lower end of their business,"" said Rowan Trollope, a senior vice president at Cisco. For BroadSoft, the deal brings one of the Washington area's biggest exits in recent memory. BroadSoft was founded in 1998 by two telecommunications executives and quickly built a software business targeting cable providers and phone carriers. In recent years, the company has tacked on new acquisitions in the Internet phone service industry, acquiring local start-ups Leonid Systems and mPortal.

Reuters with CNBC.com,10262017,CNBC,10192017,"Cisco Systems, the worlds largest networking gear manufacturer, announced an agreement on Monday to acquire BroadSoft for $1.9 billion. Cisco said it would pay $55 per share, in cash.  BroadSoft shares had closed at $54.90 on Friday, giving the company a market capitalization of $1.67 billion. Shares opened about 1.5 percent higher on Monday after the deal was announced. The deal, which comes after Reuters first reported in August that BroadSoft was exploring a sale, allows Cisco to further diversify away from its stagnating switches and routers business by giving it a stronger foothold in selling unified communications software to big telecommunications firms. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins told CNBC that the deal will help Cisco's enterprise clients and small businesses connect better with consumers. ""Every customer, when they think about their digital strategies, they think about how they interact with their customers,"" Robbins told ""Squawk on the Street."" ""This acquisition of BroadSoft actually gives us the most comprehensive set of collaboration solutions for our customers."" The BroadSoft deal would be Cisco's second major acquisition this year following the $3.7 billion acquisition of privately held AppDynamics in March. After the 2016 election, Robbins told CNBC that tax reform, particularly the repatriation of overseas cash, would prompt Cisco to look into mergers and acquisitions. Cisco's latest deal comes as there is mounting pressure on Capitol Hill to pass a budget and focus on tax cuts. When asked on Monday, Robbins told CNBC that the prospect of tax reform did not impact the timing of the BroadSoft deal. ""To date, we have not had any deals that we have considered that we have delayed, or put on hold, because of waiting on repatriation,"" Robbins said. ""Obviously we remain very optimistic about tax reform, and are hopeful that something will happen late this year or early in 2018."" With its traditional business of making switches and routers seeing revenue declines, Cisco, like other legacy technology firms, has been focusing on high-growth areas such as security, the Internet of Things and cloud computing. Based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, BroadSoft provides software and services that enable mobile, fixed-line and cable service providers to offer unified communications over their internet protocol networks. BroadSoft has historically sold its products to large telecommunications companies such as Verizon Communications and AT&T, which then resell the software to their business customers. BroadSoft has recently tried to revamp its business model to sell directly to these customers, a move that risks its relationships with its telecommunications partners, according to a Barclays Plc research report. New York-based hedge fund P2 Capital Partners owned a 4.6 percent stake in BroadSoft as of the end of June, according to Thomson Reuters data. P2 has often behaved as an activist shareholder and has even offered to buy companies in which it has invested. Another BroadSoft shareholder with a history of acquisitions is buyout firm KKR, which is BroadSofts 13th-largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Michael Sheetz,10262017,CNBC,10192017,"General Electric reported third-quarter earnings that were barely half of what Wall Street expected, and its new CEO did not shy away from the miss. ""The results I'm about to share with you are completely unacceptable,"" CEO John Flannery said on a conference call with investors Friday, where he telegraphed that big changes were ahead. ""We are focusing heavily on the culture of the company,"" Flannery said. ""Things will not stay the same at GE."" The company is in the process of finalizing its 2018 financial outlook and says it will unveil those projections and any changes to its dividend in November. As part of that process, the company is reviewing sources of cash in this year and next. In the third quarter, GE's cash flow from operating activities fell 78 percent from a year ago, to $4.1 billion. Flannery said every aspect of the large, traditionally bureaucratic company will be scrutinized, from what businesses it owns and invests in to the processes it uses to make decisions to its management practices. ""Everything is on the table and there are no sacred cows,"" Flannery said. GE's strong dividend is a top concern for investors, and Flannery made no promises, saying there are ""moving pieces"" to consider. ""The dividend is a priority in our capital allocation framework and we understand its importance to our investor base,"" said Flannery, who replaced Jeff Immelt as CEO in August. The company's current annual dividend gives a yield of 4.1 percent, the second-highest among Dow companies behind Verizon Communications. Extensive cost cutting is also ahead, with the company now seeking to slice $2 billion in costs next year, up from a prior target of $1 billion. Flannery's comments appeared to resonate well with investors. Although the stock was down as much as 8 percent prior to the conference call, shares recouped losses and were down more than 2 percent in active trading. After stripping out restructuring charges, GE earned 29 cents per share from continuing operations in the third quarter, down 9 percent from the period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected the company to earn 49 cents per share. The earnings miss reported by GE was the company's biggest in at least the last 17 years, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Prior to Friday's report, the company's biggest miss relative to Wall Street expectations was just 7 cents in April 2008, according to Bespoke's Paul Hickey.

Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) third quarter was its chance to prove what it's been saying for several quarters now is true. Management said it expected service revenue, which decreased for the 11th straight quarter in the second quarter, would start to show improvements in the second half of this year. Sure enough, Verizon showed an improvement in its service revenue, climbing about 1.4% sequentially in the third quarter from the second quarter low. The turnaround was helped by a net addition of 274,000 postpaid phone subscribers. That's the second straight quarter where Verizon has added postpaid phone subscribers after several quarters of declining results. The trend coincides with Verizon's decision to join competitors like T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) in offering an unlimited wireless data plan. Management also noted it expects the trend to continue in the fourth quarter. Image source: Verizon. Competitive pressure from T-Mobile and Sprint resulted in Verizon losing a lot of postpaid phone subscribers and offering lower-priced plans to retain its existing customers. Combined with pressure from the switch from subsidized smartphone contracts to equipment installment plans -- where device and service billing are separated -- resulted in an extended decline in service revenue. The good news for Verizon investors is that the last two quarters show several promising signs on all fronts. First of all, T-Mobile is becoming less aggressive as it's starting to focus on growing cash flow. A successful merger with Sprint would further lower competitive pressure, but significant hurdles still remain for the two companies to join forces. Second, the percentage of Verizon's phone activations and customers on device payment plans has stabilized over the last four quarters. Forty-nine percent of Verizon subscribers are on a device payment plan and 77% of new activations are on a payment plan. Those numbers have been relatively flat over the past year. Thus, the pressure from the shift to service-only contracts appears to be over. Perhaps the most promising trend is the return to growth in postpaid phone subscribers, which contribute much more in service revenue than connected devices. Verizon's unlimited plan is to thank, as management made clear in its first-quarter earnings call. Before introducing the unlimited plan, Verizon had lost nearly 400,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the first six weeks of the first quarter. It ended up losing just 289,000 that quarter, and it's added 358,000 and 274,000 in the subsequent quarters. Naturally, more customers mean more service revenue. While service revenue is starting to head in the right direction, Verizon's cost of services is also increasing. In fact, cost of services was up 2.8% sequentially from the fourth quarter, growing twice as fast as service revenue. The increase in cost of services likely stems from the unlimited plan as well. The new plan puts a strain on Verizon's network, especially considering the early adopters of the new plan are most likely to take full advantage of their new freedom to use as much data as they like. Verizon has already shown signs that its network is having trouble keeping up with the demand for data. Verizon recently introduced a lower-tier unlimited data plan, which throttles video quality down and restricts speeds when using the phone to connect to the internet through another device. The move puts its plan and pricing nearly in line with T-Mobile's, and it should help reduce cost of services. The line item will be one for investors to continue to monitor alongside continued increases in service revenue. If the growth in revenue doesn't eventually start outpacing the costs to provide that service, it's not doing a whole lot of good for investors. ","
      
    Verizon Makes Good on Its Revenue Growth Promise -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,10262017,Fool,10192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is the largest consumer wireless service provider in the United States. It also owns a wireline business, providing phone, internet, and video service to the home, as well as a digital media business called Oath, combining the assets of Yahoo! and AOL. The vast majority of its revenue and earnings come from its wireless business, where it faces intense competition from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), Sprint (NYSE:S), and AT&T (NYSE:T). As T-Mobile and Sprint make moves to win over customers, they have chipped away at the industry economics that have benefited Verizon and AT&T. That's leaving some investors wondering whether Verizon stock is a buy. Image source: Verizon. As the largest wireless service provider, Verizon benefits greatly from economies of scale. While Verizon charges some of the highest prices for its service in the industry, its cost of providing that service per subscriber is actually one of the lowest. As a result it consistently reports the largest wireless EBITDA margin in the industry. Verizon's scale also protects it against future entrants into the industry. Building out a wireless network requires substantial upfront costs. There are also barriers to obtaining the wireless spectrum necessary to operate a wireless service. Considering these barriers, the threat of a new competitor entering the space in earnest is low. Companies like Comcast and Charter are actually using Verizon's network to launch their own wireless services instead of trying to enter the market on their own. Verizon also has a strong brand and network. That gives it some pricing power, but improvements in T-Mobile's network combined with its aggressive pricing have cut into Verizon's ability to charge a premium. Verizon is still, in my opinion, the best-positioned wireless carrier in a hyper-competitive market. Verizon's third-quarter earnings report gave a few reasons to be optimistic about the company's future. First of all, Verizon added over 250,000 net postpaid phone subscribers for the second quarter in a row. That reverses a trend of poor or negative net adds over the last couple years. That also shows the strength of Verizon's brand and network in both retaining existing subscribers and attracting new ones. More importantly, Verizon has started to turn around its falling wireless service revenue. The amount Verizon brought in from service contracts last quarter increased for the first time in three years, and management said the trend will continue in the fourth quarter. That said, service revenue is still falling year over year, but should start to show improvements as soon as next year. Verizon is a strong company and its operations are moving in the right direction, but whether or not the stock is a buy ultimately comes down to what investors have to pay for it. Here's how the four major wireless companies stack up in terms of valuation. Company Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA Ratio Verizon 6.9 AT&T 6.8 T-Mobile 7.4 Sprint 5.6 With an EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 6.9, Verizon appears to be fairly valued. It's trading for the same multiple as AT&T, its closest competitor. Considering AT&T's massive investment in the pay-TV industry and its declining postpaid phone subscriber base, I think Verizon's growth prospects are actually better than AT&T's and should earn it a higher multiple. Meanwhile, T-Mobile trades for a slightly higher EV-to-EBITDA ratio. It probably deserves a higher multiple than Verizon due to its rapid growth. The opposite is true for Sprint, and it's reflected in its depressed price. As such, Verizon appears fairly valued on an EV-to-EBITDA ratio. For investors looking to get into the wireless industry, it presents a good buy right now. I'll be holding onto my own shares for the foreseeable future. ","

Shares of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are rallying after reporting a strong showing in the third quarter of 2017. While all the focus is rightly directed at the company's wireless subscriber base, there is more going on behind the scenes that make this stock an exciting long-term investment. Data by YCharts. Verizon's stock has underperformed the market this year as investors have fretted over the business foundation: Wireless subscribers. However, due in large part to the rollout of unlimited data plans to keep up with smaller competitors like T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), Verizon is back in subscriber growth mode with 603,000 net adds in the third quarter. Chart by author. Data source: Verizon quarterly earnings. Highlights from the quarter also included the Fios division, Verizon's video and internet service, growing revenue by 4.8%. The AOL and Yahoo! media divisions, reorganized as the Oath brand, had revenue of $2 billion. Management said the full integration of the two online media companies was ahead of schedule. Over the last few years, Verizon has been quietly acquiring small Internet of Things (IoT) businesses and organizing them into a new operating segment. Organic revenue growth, which excludes any bump from acquisitions made in the last year, was up 13% in the third quarter. Period Telematics Revenue YoY IoT Organic % Growth Q1 2017 $214 million 17% Q2 2017 $220 million 20% Q3 2017 More than $220 million 13% Chart by author. Data source: Verizon quarterly earnings. The company can be a bit cryptic in explaining this small department, giving revenue figures for telematics -- the connected vehicle and fleet management businesses -- but only giving revenue growth percentages for the IoT division overall, which includes telematics. Telematics growth has seemingly stalled after Verizon bought its way into the industry last year. With annualized revenue of just under $900 million, the company has cut a small piece of the market share pie, estimated to be at just over $7 billion this year. However, estimates say the industry will grow to over $18 billion by 2022. That makes this currently insignificant Verizon segment something to pay attention to. The overall IoT segment is fuzzy with only an overall percentage to work with. What we do know is that Verizon has made a handful of small purchases ranging from connected commercial lighting to smart city businesses. The figure likely includes Verizon's work on the future 5G network, which is now being pilot testing in select urban markets. An announcement was made earlier in the week that partner Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) will begin testing its hardware on Verizon's 5G network in 2018, with the expectation that 5G modems will begin shipping for commercial use in early 2019. Image source: Getty Images. While wireless subscriptions continue to be the primary focus for investors, Verizon is ramping up its future business and finding ways to monetize it even now. The future 5G network, which touts faster speeds and lower latency time, will do more than provide a faster network for smartphone users. It will be the network that powers the future of technology growth. What that means is that Verizon is positioning itself as something more than an enabler of mobile phones. 5G will carry the information needed to power the IoT: autonomous vehicles, connected healthcare, smart homes, and smart cities. The quarter was a win because of the strong addition of new wireless subscribers, but for me this stock is all about the progressive rollout of that small IoT business segment. ","

Metric Q3 2017 Q3 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $10.019 billion $9.305 billion 8% Net income $550 million $366 million 50% Earnings per share $0.63 $0.42 50% Data source: T-Mobile Q3 2017 earnings release. T-Mobile added 1.3 million net new customers, which helped its total subscriber count top 70.7 million by the end of the third quarter. Of those new customers, 817,000 were of the postpaid variety, including 595,000 net postpaid phone customers. Postpaid subscribers pay monthly bills and are typically the most valuable customers for wireless carriers. T-Mobile continues to use innovative promotions to fuel its customer growth. In September, it announced that its family plans will now include a free Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) subscription. Image Source: T-Mobile US. In the press release announcing the deal, the company stated: T-Mobile has completely disrupted wireless, and Netflix has totally disrupted entertainment. What happens when you bring two disruptors together? Get ready to find out! Well, early evidence suggests that what happens is more people become customers of T-Mobile and, ostensibly, Netflix. Better still, the Netflix promotion may also be helping T-Mobile retain more of its existing customers, as postpaid phone churn improved by 9 basis points year over year. All told, T-Mobile's customer growth drove an 8% year-over-year increase in total revenue, to $10 billion. In turn, EBITDA -- adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, spectrum gains, and certain other items -- rose 5% to $2.8 billion. CEO John Legere, in his typical unabashed style, praised T-Mobile's performance in its earnings release: Just step back and look at these financial results -- they're incredible! Record service revenues, record free cash flow, record Q3 adjusted EBITDA -- and that's on top of 18 quarters in a row with more than one million customers added. We're delivering results that no one else can match and have proven time and time again that we know how to fight for customers and win for shareholders. We won't stop! Legere may be more flamboyant than the average CEO, but T-Mobile continues to back up his bold statements. T-Mobile raised its 2017 full-year subscriber growth forecast to between 3.3 million and 3.6 million branded postpaid net additions, up from 3.0 million to 3.6 million. It also increased its adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $10.8 billion to $11.0 billion, up from a range of $10.5 billion to $10.9 billion. Notably, T-Mobile declined to conduct its usual conference call with analysts after its earnings release. In a question-and-answer document (opens a PDF) posted to its investor-relations website, the company stated: Our incredible Q3 results speak for themselves! We want to keep the focus on those results, without letting them be drowned out by the rumors that have been swirling around. As it relates to those rumors, we've got nothing to share. The rumors T-Mobile is referring to are recent reports that it will merge with No. 4 U.S wireless carrier Sprint (NYSE:S). Such a deal could make the combined company an even more formidable foe to current industry leaders Verizon and AT&T. However, even if T-Mobile and Sprint were to agree to a merger, regulators would probably give it heavy scrutiny. Regardless, with another quarter of what's expected to be industry-leading customer gains, T-Mobile continues to expand its share of the massive U.S. wireless industry. ","

"Anders Bylund, Keith Noonan, and Steve Symington",10262017,Fool,10192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. High yields and low stock prices often go hand in hand. That's just the mathematical nature of dividend yield calculations -- cheap shares and generous payouts add up to juicy yields. But some of these high-yield shares are cheap for good reason, and extreme yields are often red flags marking a troubled business and a bad investment. One way to avoid the worst high-yield offenders is to check with the experts, who can point you to high-quality businesses that also love returning cash to their shareholders. So we rounded up a few of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool and asked for some advice. Read on to see how our panelists arrived at telecom giants Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T), plus telecom infrastructure specialist Uniti Group (NASDAQ:UNIT). Image source: Getty Images. Keith Noonan (AT&T): With its hefty dividend and underappreciated growth prospects, AT&T is an undervalued income play that's worth holding for the long term. It's worth looking at why the company's stock can currently be had for cheap. On the wireless service side of things, value-priced competitors including Sprint and T-Mobile have caught up to AT&T's 4G network -- reducing the appeal of ""premium"" service. The result is a pricing war that's causing AT&T to lose subscribers and take margin hits to offer more competitive service, but the company's advantage in wireless should re-emerge with the expansion of 5G networks. The rollout will be a capital-intensive endeavor, but 5G will be at the center of the Internet of Things and other next-gen communication technologies, so the opportunity extends far beyond mobile service. The company's pending acquisition of Time Warner, which seems to be on track to be approved, is another reason to like the stock. As tech companies are scrambling to build their content offerings and bolster their respective ecosystems, AT&T has made a promising play for one of the world's top entertainment conglomerates. If the deal goes through, AT&T will be in position to offer wireless television packages that competitors will be hard pressed to match and also make Time Warner's advertising business much more profitable, thanks to the advantages of digital ad targeting over cable distribution. With AT&T's roughly 5.4% dividend yield and a 33-year history of delivering annual payout increases, you won't find many companies offering a better returned income component in the technology and telecom sectors. Its forward price-to-earnings multiple of roughly 12 looks like a bargain in today's frothy market. Steve Symington (Verizon Communications): Verizon endured a rough first half of 2017, after increasing competition led to its first-ever postpaid wireless subscriber decline to kick off the new fiscal year. But the telecommunications juggernaut quickly fixed the situation by launching new unlimited-data plans the following quarter. Just last week, Verizon followed up by demonstrating continued wireless momentum in adding 603,000 retail postpaid accounts in Q3, and maintaining healthy retail postpaid churn of 0.75%. At the same time, Verizon's service revenue declined 5.1% year over year. But its trends to that end are improving; service revenue grew on a sequential basis last quarter for the first time in three years, and Verizon expects to exit 2017 with a year-over-year service revenue decline of under 4%. Meanwhile, last month, Verizon boosted its quarterly dividend for the 11th straight year, bringing its annual yield at today's prices to roughly 4.8%. With shares still down around 9% year to date and trading at just 12.7 times forward earnings, Verizon is an enticing bet for investors willing to buy stock now and watch the business continue to improve. Image source: Getty Images. Anders Bylund (Uniti Group): The former networking infrastructure arm of regional telecom Windstream (NASDAQ:WIN) sports a current dividend yield of 16%. Generous sharing of the real estate investment trust's cash flows is one half of   the yield equation. On the other side, Uniti's share prices have fallen 47% lower over the past 52 weeks, thus driving the effective yield that much higher. The stock is suffering under terrible results from Windstream, and many investors fear that Uniti's largest client may go bankrupt soon. These fears are not unreasonable -- Windstream recently canceled its own high-yield dividend policy altogether, in an effort to shore up its unstable balance sheet and negative free cash flows. Windstream may indeed make an exit, stage left, at any time. Yet I am confident enough in Uniti's value to own that stock, even as I'm predicting a dire end to the company's largest customer. I'm convinced that Windstream spun out its most valuable asset to create Uniti. The long-haul network manages 4.8 million strand miles of network fiber and 468 wireless towers, boasts a far stronger balance sheet, generates cash while Windstream is burning it, and is actively looking to distance itself from Windstream. Uniti started its young standalone life in 2015 with just one client, and you already know who. Since then, a campaign of smaller network buyouts and an active client-hunting project has expanded the customer list to 16,000 names. That list includes high-quality clients such as the U.S. Department of Defense, several nationwide telecoms not named Windstream, and a few cable TV broadcasters. Furthermore, the long-term lease agreement between Windstream and Uniti was structured to preserve the contract terms in the event of a bankruptcy. If worse comes to worst, Windstream's bankruptcy would cause some temporary uncertainty and delayed payments, but whoever picks up the fallen company's assets for pennies on the dollar will end up honoring the terms of Windstream's original agreement. I'm no lawyer, but there's legal precedent for so-called favorable lease terms surviving Chapter 11 filings. Maybe I'm underestimating the risks here, but Uniti remains a useful and promising part of my retirement portfolio. At these bargain-bin prices, maybe you should start a Uniti position, too.

That puts Verizon at a disadvantage if you happen to be looking for some sort of media throw-in with your plan. And let's face it, you're spending more of your time on your phone watching video. Consumers on average spend nearly half an hour each day watching videos on their phones, according to media agency Zenith. Just wait until the second season of ""Stranger Things"" comes out. Video has become the latest weapon in the carriers' battle for your business. Yet even as things stand, Verizon remains surprisingly resilient, adding 603,000 retail postpaid customers -- or people who pay at the end of the month and generally have higher bills and stick around longer -- in the third quarter. That follows a rebound in the second quarter that was helped by the reintroduction of an unlimited-data plan. As such, Verizon CFO Matt Ellis doesn't believe the company needs to throw in any video perks. He noted the still low customer turnover rate (known in the industry as churn). ""We can have good churn without bundling any offering,"" he said on a conference call with investors on Thursday. Verizon's postpaid growth got some help from the addition of 91,000 new tablets and 238,000 new wearables and other connected devices. The company added a net 274,000 new phone customers in the period. Beyond video, the extras have flown fast and furious. Sprint offers a year of service for free (excluding taxes and fees), and its prepaid arm Virgin Mobile boasts an all-iPhone lineup with a rate of $1 for the first year of service. In addition to the bundling of free HBO, AT&T offers its DirecTV Now streaming video service at a discount when bundled with a phone plan. The lack of an online video service is hitting Verizon's home entertainment business. The company lost 18,000 Fios video connections, although it added 66,000 Fios internet connections. Many traditional pay TV providers are starting to feel the sting of competitive online video offers and the rise of ""cord-cutters"" who ignore traditional cable in favor of streaming video. Verizon is considering its own full-blown video-streaming service, comparable to DirecTV Now or Sling TV, CEO Lowell McAdam told Bloomberg last month. Ellis, speaking on the call, said that Verizon doesn't want to launch a me-too product and that it would continue to look for ways to offer a different product built around live programming. ""How and when is still TBD,"" he said. For now, the unlimited data offer seems to be keeping things stable. Verizon reported a third-quarter net profit of $3.7 billion, or 89 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, it earned 98 cents a share. Revenue rose 2.5 percent to $31.7 billion. Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings of 98 cents a share and revenue of $31.45 billion, according to Yahoo Finance. Verizon shares rose 2.4 percent to $49.80 in premarket trading.

Austen Hufford,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 19, 2017 8:52 a.m. ET By Verizon Communications Inc. gained wireless subscribers in the latest quarter, as the telecommunications company worked to shore up its largest unit in light of its weakening television business. Verizon reported a net increase of 603,000 retail postpaid connections in its third quarter, including 274,000 phone subscribers. The company had 115.3 million total wireless retail connections, up from 113.7 million the same quarter last year and 114.5 million in the second quarter. The company's revenue beat Wall Street expectations while meeting analysts' estimates on profit. Verizon shares rose 2.3% in premarket trading Thursday. Earlier this year, Verizon, the nation's largest wireless carrier by subscribers, unexpectedly brought back its unlimited wireless plans for the first time since 2011. The unlimited plans allow customers pay a flat rate for nearly unlimited monthly internet usage on their smartphones. In its latest quarter, the company continued to increase the percentage of its total subscriber base that were on smartphones and using high-speed wireless internet. Revenue from the wireless business, Verizon's largest, fell 2.4% to $21.58 billion, as the switch to unlimited plans continued to weigh on service revenue. Still, the company said service revenue trends were improving and had increased from the second quarter. Revenue at the wireline segment that includes its Fios service grew 1.1% to $7.66 billion, boosted by its acquisition of XO Communications. Analysts are closely awaiting the release of Apple Inc.'s latest phones, including the premium iPhone X. If popular, the new phones could drive more customers to upgrade at Verizon but rivals could also grab customers away with discounts. Still, promotions around the latest iPhone have been softer than in previous years. Verizon cited ongoing consumer shifts to over-the-top video options and away from traditional television as the reason for losing 18,000 Fios video customers in the quarter. That is more that the loss of 15,000 in the second quarter and 13,000 in the first quarter. It gained 36,000 in the third quarter last year. In all, Verizon profit was the same as the third quarter last year, with net income of $3.62 billion, or 89 cents a share. Revenue grew 2.5% to $31.72 billion. Still, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenue fell 2.3%. On an adjusted-basis, earnings per share was 98 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected adjusted per-share profit of 98 cents on $31.45 billion in revenue. As a mature business in a saturated market, Verizon is increasingly looking to increase profits through spending cuts. Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said in September that the company is aiming to cut $10 billion in costs over the next four years by moving to zero-base budgeting. Verizon expects capital spending for 2017 to be at the lower end of its $16.8 billion to $17.5 billion range. During the quarter Verizon, which is the new parent company of Yahoo, said that a massive data breach at Yahoo in 2013 was far more extensive than previously disclosed, affecting all of its 3 billion user accounts. Verizon also announced that it would shut the groundbreaking and once-popular AOL instant messenger service later this year. On Thursday, the company said the integration of AOL and Yahoo is ahead of internal expectations.

                                   position is of that same size. “We added GE several months ago with the expectation that new management would lead a slow but steady turnaround, and that the market had largely discounted a likely earnings cut and reset,” wrote Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s equity model portfolio team. He said that “at the time” the company was added to the portfolio, “we saw the dividend as secure.” GE’s quarterly results, however, indicated much worse cash flow statistics than the investment bank expected, and “given substantially worse fundamental trends. particularly in light of more positive trends in several of GE’s segments including aerospace and healthcare,” it could no longer justify keeping the stock in the portfolio. “We believe the stock may continue to weaken around a potential dividend cut,” it wrote to clients. Don’t miss: GE’s stock is in breach of an unwritten rule for Dow members On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe downgraded GE to underweight, a bearish view that contributed to the stock’s recent selling pressure. Shares of GE are down 9.7% this week alone, and they have sunk about 32% in 2017. While GE didn’t announce a cut in its payout when it released results last week, investors fear it may do so on Nov. 13, when it is expected to outline a path to recovery following years of share-price underperformance, as seen in the FactSet chart below, which compares GE (red) against the S&P 500 (green) over a 15-year time horizon. “There does need to be a balance of investing in growth, organic and inorganic growth, and the dividend payout. So as a philosophy, expect a balance. We’ll present this framework in November as we complete the 2017 and 2018 process,” said newly installed Chief Executive John Flannery on the post-results conference call with analysts. GE pays a quarterly dividend of 24 cents a share, which at current levels amounts to a yield of 4.48%.

Austen Hufford,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 26, 2017 7:14 a.m. ET By Comcast Corp. suffered its largest quarterly loss of cable television subscribers in three years, underscoring the pressure on traditional TV players as competition with new entrants heats up. The cable giant's results for the September quarter come after AT&T Inc. said Tuesday that it was continuing to lose its most profitable pay-TV viewers. The traditional pay TV providers are competing with new, more affordable online channel bundles, as well as streaming services like Netflix Inc., which are luring away subscribers. Despite such concerns, Comcast on Thursday reported higher-than-expected profits per share as well as adjusted revenue growth. In the cable TV business, the company lost 125,000 residential and business customers, compared with a gain of 32,000 in the same quarter last year. In the second quarter, Comcast lost 34,000 residential and business video customers. The company, like AT&T, believes the spate of major hurricanes in the quarter contributed to the subscriber losses. Comcast and other cable providers stand to benefit on the internet access side of their business as streaming TV subscriptions and usage increase. Comcast gained 214,000 internet customers in the quarter, down from the 330,000 gained in the year-ago period. Total revenue per customer relationship increased 2.1% to $151.51. Comcast lost 94,000 voice customers in the quarter, compared with an addition of 2,000 in the year-ago quarter. Overall revenue for Comcast's cable division, which makes up 62% of the top line, rose 5.1% to $13.2 billion. This year Comcast launched a new wireless cellphone service, aimed at adding a fourth pillar to the typical television-phone-internet bundles. The mobile service is only for customers who subscribe to at least its internet service already. The cable operator is relying on a five-year-old network-resale agreement with Verizon Communications to offer its service. Comcast has signaled that it views the wireless service as an add-on for its customers, aimed at increasing profits and reducing the percentage of customers leaving its service. At the NBCUniversal media division, revenue and profits had tough comparisons to last year, when the company's networks aired the 2016 Olympic Games. Revenue in the division fell 13% to $8.01 billion, with declines in both the broadcast television and cable networks divisions. When the impact of the Games was stripped out, revenue increased 6%. Revenue in the filmed entertainment division fell 0.5% as there were no megahits in the quarter. Still, the company's release of ""Despicable Me 3"" highlighted its focus on growing the size of its franchise business, which provides revenue beyond a movie's theater run. Theme parks revenue increased 7.7%, driven by new attractions in Japan and Orlando, Fla. In all, net income rose to $2.65 billion, or 55 cents a share, up from $2.24 billion, or 46 cents a share, a year ago. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share came in at 52 cents. Revenue fell 1.6% to $20.98 billion but adjusted revenue, excluding the impact of the Olympics, grew 5.8%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters projected adjusted earnings of 50 cents a share on $21.04 billion in revenue.

 ,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"In a shift away from its quickly eroding linear satellite segment, AT&T has a new Android TV-powered DirecTV set-top box in the works that abandons satellite connectivity for internet-connected streaming. Variety uncovered a new FCC filing in which AT&T details the new device, which goes by the model number C71KW-400. In the documents AT&T describes the device as “the new AT&T/DirecTV Wireless 4K OTT Client.” According to the user manual accompanied in the files, the device can’t be used with the DirecTV’s existing Genie Servers. The manual also shows that a voice remote will be shipped with the set-top box. The device comes equipped with Ethernet connectivity, digital audio, and HDMI and USB ports, but no antenna or satellite connection, so it will connect only to the internet. The filings also reveal the device is based on Google’s Android TV operating system, and screenshots of YouTube and Google Play running on the device were included in the manual. It appears users will be able to download apps compatible with Android TV such as HBO Now, Hulu, and Netflix. AT&T is moving toward OTT delivery as its pay-TV satellite business is deteriorating. On Tuesday the operator reported linear satellite customer losses of 251,000 during the third quarter. The DirecTV subscriber base shrunk by 0.8 percent since the end of the third quarter last year, which is notably the first time the platform has ever seen year-over-year subscriber losses. In its third quarter earnings report, AT&T also revealed it gained 296,000 subscribers for its internet-based DirecTV Now offering, which now has about 787,000 subscribers.

Maria Armental,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 24, 2017 6:35 p.m. ET By AT&T Inc.'s shrinking traditional TV subscription and wireless phone businesses continued to take a toll on the telecommunications giant's financial performance in the latest period. Shares, which Tuesday set a 52-week low, fell 1% to $34.45 in after-hours trading as results missed expectations. The Dallas-based company has made a big push in media and entertainment as its core wireless business stalled. Already the largest domestic pay-television operator following its acquisition of satellite company DirecTV, AT&T is trying to buy Time Warner, owner of CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. film and TV studio. The deal, under regulatory review, is expected to close by year's end. AT&T said the number of subscribers to its video services fell by 89,000 in the quarter ended Sept. 30, as customers abandoned its fiber-optic-video and satellite-TV services. The decline, the third quarterly drop in a row, came despite 296,000 new accounts on its DirecTV Now service, which streams channels over the internet. DirecTV Now ended the quarter with 787,000 subscribers. The country's No. 2 wireless company posted a net loss of 97,000 postpaid phone subscribers, those who are billed monthly and tend to be more profitable. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had projected a loss of 126,000 phone subscribers. Including other devices, AT&T added 117,000 postpaid wireless customers. The company ended the quarter with 138.8 million U.S. wireless subscribers. Verizon Communications Inc., the largest domestic carrier by subscribers, last week said it had added 603,000 postpaid wireless connections in the third quarter. Meanwhile, T-Mobile US Inc. said Monday it had added 1.3 million subscribers in the third quarter, including 817,000 postpaid subscribers. The monthly cancellation rate -- or churn -- for mainstream wireless customers, edged up to 1.07%, from 1.05%, driven by cancellations among tablet users. Looking at phones alone, the cancellation rate was 0.84%, compared with 0.90% in the year-ago quarter. Overall, third-quarter profit fell 9% to $3 billion, or 49 cents a share. Excluding merger and integration costs and other items, profit was 74 cents a share. Revenue fell 3% to $39.67 billion. Excluding lost business because of hurricanes and earthquakes, revenue would have been $39.8 billion, the company said. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had projected profit of 63 cents a share, or 75 cents as adjusted, on $40.10 billion in revenue. The company's Latin American operations helped improve those results, adding $6.05 billion in operating revenue, up 13% from a year earlier, driven by the Mexican wireless business.

                                   is heavily dependent on its phone sales, a fact that allows investors to learn more from the financial data. The company will announce earnings just after launching preorders for its new $1,000 smartphone, the iPhone X. The forecast issued by the world’s most highly valued company could be the most important number released by a technology company this earnings season, as it could suggest how many of the expensive phones Apple expects to sell and deliver in the holiday season. Here’s what to pay attention to: Apple Apple lives and dies with its iPhone sales. This year, along with the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, the company also unveiled the iPhone X for $999, the highest price Apple has charged to date. “It’s an obvious departure from where things have gone in the past,” said Dawson. “It’s a new price tier and Apple is now firmly in the superpremium space with the iPhone X.” Since Apple launched two new iPhones in late September, early orders and some results may be visible in the company’s financial statements, which will be released Nov. 2. But the forecast is what investors should watch, since it will be the most clear indication of current iPhone 8 sales, as well as potentially offering insight into the number of consumers that are holding off for the iPhone X. Also, speculation about delays in manufacturing have persisted, which means the forecast will give investors some idea of how many phones the company can actually deliver. Read also: Apple stock could get a trillion-dollar tailwind from Trump’s tax reforms, says RBC “The big question is that—can they meet demand?” Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin said. “Investors are going to want to know if they’re going to be able to mass manufacture this phone. If there is a manufacturing hiccup making a particular part, that’s an open question.” Alphabet At its Oct. 4 launch event, the internet company effectively doubled down on its hardware bet, unveiling two new Pixel phones, a smaller version of its Home speaker designed to compete with the Echo Dot from Amazon, and many other gadgets. Aside from Apple, the products are the only full, cohesive suite of computing devices available from a single U.S. company, and the main selling point is that Google is able to leverage its gains in artificial intelligence through the hardware. Opinion: The biggest laggard of the FAANG stocks is now breaking out However, because Google’s hardware revenue is lumped into a sales category called “Google Other revenues”—which also includes Google’s cloud-computing division, YouTube Red subscriptions and app revenue—it is impossible to gauge Google hardware sales from its earnings report. Beyond any color Alphabet executives provide, which they typically avoid, investors will likely have to wait for third-party research to gain meaningful insight into the success of the Pixel and Google’s other gadgets. “We’ll get no explicit guidance,” Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said. “In general, I would expect Pixels will sell slightly better than last year, but because they’re tied to Verizon Communication Inc.

                                   sales will be constrained. It’s the same issue as with the last announcement of Pixel phones.” Alphabet is set to report results Oct. 26. Amazon The company’s line of Echo speakers, powered by virtual assistant Alexa, is essentially Amazon’s iPhone—a new type of device that becomes popular with users and synonymous with the company that made it as rivals seek to catch up. Amazon is treating it with that type of importance, putting 5,000 people to work on the Alexa product line and spending $5.5 billion on “technology and content” research-and-development to develop new Echo devices introduced at a Sept. 27 launch event. “Amazon is transitioning itself into a consumer-facing hardware company, doubling down on the overall strategy on consumers,” Bajarin said. “Through its hardware endpoints in the smart home and voice assistant, it will have a regular touch point with the customer that’s not a shopping page, via a smart speaker and perhaps a screen.” Don’t miss: How winning the race for Amazon’s ‘HQ2’ could turn out to be a curse Like Google, Amazon logs its device sales within a much, much larger category, so it will be difficult to deduce early sales from the numbers alone when the company reports results on Oct. 26. It’s also worth considering that the launch event was just days before the end of the quarter. Echo devices are recorded in the “retail sales” section of “net sales” in Amazon’s supplemental financial information. Last quarter, that bucket of revenue was $23.75 billion, of which a fraction was Echo devices. As a result, commentary and third-party research will likely be more useful. Fitbit In late August, Fitbit previewed its long-awaited competitor to Apple’s line of smartwatches. Priced at $300 and called Ionic, the mixed reviews suggest that it is not the Apple Watch killer the company needed to break out from its core base of cheaper, fitness-focused wearables. “I think it’s in a really challenging place strategically,” Dawson said. “Fitbit needed to go upmarket, but now they’re competing head-on against Apple. They’ve gone from a position of having the market to themselves to going up against one of the biggest companies in the industry with a subpar product.” Since the company’s sales are based on its hardware products—including the Ionic—Fitbit’s guidance will give bigger clues about its expectations for the Ionic, which went on sale Oct. 1, the beginning of the quarter. The company has not yet said when it will report earnings. The rest Roku launched a new streaming device lineup on Oct. 2, though the company says that it views hardware as a customer acquisition strategy and it is not trying to “maximize for player revenue.” When the company went public, executives said the future of Roku sales are in its software, or platform, business, but they should still offer guidance for the new devices in the company’s first earnings report since going public.

Max A. Cherney,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Popular stock indicator presents risks to investors due to how its 30 stocks are weighted. Adobe Stock The “Dow” is hitting new highs with regularity.  That sounds good to casual market observers.  Heck, every week I hear about someone who does not know or care about the stock market telling their friends about how the Dow just crossed a certain level, and that its doing great in general.  That’s true in fact, but there is more to it, unless you just want to rest on your laurels and ignore a major risk that is inherent in tracking the Dow. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the favorite market proxy for decades before the S&P 500, once considered a gauge monitored by professional investors only, started to replace the Dow in notoriety.  As I have written and shown in past articles, the S&P 500 is a terrible proxy for the stock market as we get later into a bull market cycle, but as it turns out, the Dow is even worse.  A while back, I alerted you to the fact that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is based on a very oddball formula to determine how much influence each of its 30 component stocks has on the overall index.  The allocation, or weighting of each of the stocks in the index is simply a function of the dollar price of each stock.  Why is that an issue?  Because the price of a stock is not a valuation measure.  If one stock is selling at $100 a share and another at $50 a share, that tells you nothing about where it has been, what its earnings trend is, or anything else that might be of value to an investor who actually cares to know what they own. This creates a false sense of what you are following when you follow the Dow.  And if you own an index fund that is based on the Dow, you are not just following it, you are invested in it.  One of the biggest issues when bear markets eventually strike is that investors realize they had a chance to better-understand what they owned, but did not care about it until it was too late. There are many ways to structure a portfolio.  Many index ETFs are “capitalization-weighted” which means that the larger the value of a stock’s outstanding shares, the larger the weighting in that ETF and its underlying index.  That does not make a lot of sense to me in most cases, but it does to a lot of people, so that’s as far as I will go on that point for now.  The other way to allocate among stocks in an index or portfolio is to “equal-weight” the holdings.  This makes more sense to me, but then again, I also love all my kids equally, so there you go.  I do notice that more ETFs are equal-weighting their holdings, but cap-weighting is still the dominant approach. Now, back to the Dow.   The venerable stock market indicator weights its 30 holdings based on the dollar price of the stock.  Why?  Because in 1896, Charles Dow decided it was the simplest way to help investors understand the stock market (source: Investopedia).  I wish there were some more erudite process I could explain to you, but there is not.  Yet for 121 years, this has been the case with the Dow.  I created a table below to help you see the folly of this approach today, and so that you can join me in shaking your head as to why this has not been changed all these years. What is the Dow? It depends on how you slice it. Ycharts.com as of 10/20/17 market close From left to right, see the price-weighted composition of the Dow, which is the actual Dow Jones Industrial Average you see quoted.  Note that only 7 stocks make up over 42% of the Dow index.  The other 23 stocks comprise only 58% of the Dow.  This top-heaviness is due in part to strong price moves by the companies that now top the list, since the more their prices climb relative to the prices of the other stocks, the higher their weighting goes.  But if you thought you were making a big investment in the stocks at the lower portion of the list, you are not. Next, I constructed a capitalization-weighted Dow, and you can see that those top 7 Dow components make up only about 16% of the total value of the 30 stocks in the index.  In other words, if the Dow were set up like the S&P 500 and many other indexes, it would look completely different. Finally, I show an equal-weight version of the Dow. At the bottom of the chart, you can see the return for 2017 of each version of the Dow, through October 20.  For this year so far, the returns are very high in all cases.  But that is not the point.  The point is that the Dow is not influenced by “the stock market” as much as it is the current beneficiaries of the Dow’s quirky stock weighting scheme.  This is that thing I mentioned before, that investors may regret not realizing when times are not as good as they are now for the Dow. The 30 Largest S&P 500 Component Stocks, Based on Price Per Share YCharts 2017 Finally, since the Dow and S&P 500 are often used interchangeably in conversation about how the “market” is doing, I put together another chart showing what the S&P 500’s 30 largest holdings would look like if it used a price-weighted approach instead of a market-cap weighted approach (note that I included 31 total securities Alphabet a.k.a. Google is listed twice given its 2 separate share classes).  As you can see, this looks very little like the Dow.  More significantly, it looks nothing like the S&P 500!  The top 30 stocks make up only 13.5% of this concocted price-weighted index.  And some of the stocks with the highest prices are among the smaller companies within the S&P 500. Keep your eyes out for what is NOT obvious about the current market rally.  It will serve you well when the unraveling eventually occurs.

Tomi Kilgore,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 26, 2017 12:13 p.m. ET Ending a 110-year streak as a Dow member could be a blessing in disguise for GE investors By Shares of General Electric Co. have fallen so far this year that they have broken an unwritten rule that the keepers of the Dow Jones Industrial Average use for inclusion in the 121-year old index, in which GE is a founding member. That may not directly lead to GE being booted from the Dow, a move that would end a 110-year long membership. It would mark the third time that GE was not a member of the blue-chip barometer--it was removed and then brought back twice before its latest stretch.

                                   that are trading at more than 10 times the price of GE’s stock. On Thursday, GE shares fell 0.3% to $21.43 in midday trade, while Boeing’s stock slipped 0.2% to $257.87. David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, a unit of S&P Global Inc., told MarketWatch earlier this year that the committee members “prefer” that the ratio of the highest to lowest priced stocks in the Dow be “less than” 10 to 1. GE’s stock broke that ratio guideline on Sept. 8, when it fell to a close of $23.82, while Boeing shares rose to $238.78. A spokesperson for S&P Dow Jones Indices said they won’t comment on individual stocks, but added that none of the “rules” are set in stone. The index committee regularly meets to review the composition of its indexes, as well as pending corporate actions, statistics comparing its indexes to the broader market and significant market events, which could include excessive share price movements. “In addition, the committees may revise index policy covering rules for selecting companies, treatment of dividends, share counts or other matters,” the company said in a statement. “S&P Dow Jones Indices considers information about changes to its indices and related matter to be potentially market moving and material. Therefore, all index committee discussions are confidential.” If the committee deemed GE no longer worthy of the Dow, for the first time since it was added back in on Nov. 7, 1907, investors may actually breathe a sigh of relief.

GE was a founding member of the Dow, which launched on May 26, 1896 with 12 members, including long-gone “smokestack” companies such as American Cotton Oil, Tennessee Coal & Iron and U.S. Leather, according to data provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices. It was replaced in September 1898, when founding member U.S. Rubber re-entered the index, but then returned just seven months later. GE exited again in April 1901, then came back in on Nov. 7, 1907, as it replaced fellow founding member Tennessee Coal & Iron. It has remained in the index ever since. GE has had a nice run that past century, but a change may be needed. It ended the year as the biggest S&P 500 index component by market capitalization as recently as 2005, when it was valued at $370.3 million, according to data provided by S&P Global.

",GE’s stock has breached an unwritten rule for Dow members - MarketWatch
Philip van Doorn,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 26, 2017 3:46 p.m. ET A measure called return on corporate capital is revealing — and there’s a free investor tool for research By Ever since stocks were first bought and sold, investors have sought to find company metrics that would separate the winners from the losers. Sales growth, earnings growth, earnings per share — even CEO pay. Now it turns out that companies that are good at deploying capital to produce quality goods and services represent lower risk and a higher likelihood of long-term stock gains. We examined this phenomenon two years ago, tying high returns on invested capital (ROIC) to excellent stock performance over very long periods. The data were provided by FactSet, which defines ROIC as a company’s net income divided by total invested capital (total shareholders’ equity and long-term debt). The idea of ROIC is to measure how efficiently a company’s managers use the money they have raised. At that time, Gary Lutin, a former investment banker at Lutin & Co. who oversees the Shareholder Forum in New York, said long-term investors who wanted to invest some of their money in individual stocks also needed to think about the products and services being sold by the companies and consider whether they would remain competitive for up to 20 years. Lutin & Co. invests only in non-publicly-traded companies, so as not to interfere with Lutin’s work at the Shareholder Forum, which works to provide “fair access to information that can be relied upon by both corporate and investor decision-makers,” and receives financial support from professional investors. Free data The Shareholder Forum on Oct. 20 rolled out a new calculation called return on corporate capital (ROCC). That can be useful for investors because the data are available for free and are calculated in a uniform manner using GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) data from SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) filings. Definitions of ROIC vary, and some companies even calculate ROIC using adjusted earnings numbers. But ROCC is calculated the same way for every company, using annual data: Net income plus interest expense and income taxes, divided by the ending balance of total assets less total liabilities other than interest-bearing debt. The idea is that if a company consistently generates high returns on corporate capital, good things will eventually happen. A focus on the company’s main business, rather than financial engineering through share buybacks or on adjusted earnings figures, means real profits are rolling in at high levels relative to investment. That eventually can be expected to support higher share prices, as the profits feed organic expansion, acquisitions or other things that are good for shareholders. The example of Valeant Evan Tindell, chief investment officer of hedge fund Bireme Capital, said ROCC enables investors to “look at the absolutely unadjusted figures.” He cited Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.

                                   as a company that “consistently” focuses on adjusted figures in its earnings releases. For example, Valeant reported a GAAP net loss of $38 million for the second quarter, but adjusted earnings of $362 million, after making adjustments for amortization, asset impairments restructuring and other times. Wall Street analysts’ estimates are based on projected adjusted earnings per share. Valeant’s average ROCC over the past five fiscal years has been 1.8%, compared with 8.7% for its industry group, according the “real” GAAP numbers used by the Shareholder Forum. In an interview on Oct. 17, Lutin pointed out that ROCC comparisons are a sound foundation for analysis but should be considered only the starting point. Some companies, such as Amazon.com Inc.

                                   will be “spending what could be booked as profits today in their development of goods and services to make bigger profits tomorrow,” he said Amazon’s average ROCC over the past five years is 4.9%. That looks like a low figure, but for investors, the Amazon story has been about rapid sales growth, dominance in internet retail and expansion into new areas of business. The low ROCC and the stock’s high price-to-earnings ratio — 125.7 times consensus 2018 earnings estimates — may mean this type of valuation will eventually become unsustainable.

                                   for example, you can see the company’s average ROCC is 26.2%. The ROCC tool uses Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) from companies’ SEC filings to determine industry groups. These company-specified classifications are not always the best reflection of their current business, so you may have to make your own comparisons of companies in similar industries. For example, with 3M, you can see its ROCC greatly exceeds that of its industry group. The problem is that the industry group is “surgical and medical instruments,” when this industry represents only one of 3M’s five industry groups. If we look at the S&P 500’s industrial sector, there are seven companies that FactSet classifies as industrial conglomerates. Here are the five-year average ROCC figures for the group, along with their five-year total returns: You can see that for this industry group, the one with the best ROCC over the past five years didn’t have the best total return.

John Maynard Keynes famously described the stock market as a beauty contest in his 1936 book, “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money” to explain price fluctuations in equity markets. What he meant was that investors were trying to determine which stocks would be most attractive to other investors. “Speculating on what other people will find beautiful is a fool’s game,” Lutin said. “It’s a lot easier, and a whole lot safer, to pick a company that generates good returns by producing goods and services. A sound business foundation is also likely to continue its value a lot longer than today’s beauty.” Here are five-year average returns on corporate capital for the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average

,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"The U.S. Justice Department approved the tie-up this month with some conditions, including some divestitures. The FCC extended the same conditions in its approval order, the first major telecom merger approved under President Donald Trump. In addition to approving the CenturyLink deal, the FCC outlined a new standard by which the agency will review future mergers — a shift that could make it easier for other large media and telecommunications mergers to win approval. “It has reached a point where all our media policy decisions seem to be custom built for this one company,” FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said of the Sinclair deal at a congressional hearing last week. The FCC has traditionally employed a balancing test weighing potential public interest harms against any potential public interest benefits and applicants bear the burden of proof. The FCC approval of CenturyLink’s Level 3 deal offered a more limited standard of review that would use “narrowly tailored transaction-specific conditions to remedy” harms, according to the order. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, dissented and said the Republican majority “radically alters the commission’s long-standing merger review standards,” her office said. Rosenworcel said “instead of using the agency’s decades-old merger review standard, (the FCC) arbitrarily introduces a new one.” Commission Republicans have pushed to halt the practice of demanding conditions or concessions from companies seeking to merge that are not directly related to a transaction. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who has been critical of the FCC review process under former President Barack Obama, denied the FCC was changing the standard of review in issuing the decision. “But we do make clear what had become increasingly hazy in recent years. This clarity will help the public to see that transactional review is an occasion to carefully consider how the transaction itself impacts the public interest, not an opportunity to extract a range of concessions, tangentially-related at best,” Pai said Monday.

Verizon and Equifax did not immediately comment. Mayer plans to appear, a representative for the former CEO confirmed. Republican Senator John Thune, who chairs the committee, said Wednesday in a statement that after major breaches, “urgent action is necessary to protect sensitive personal information.” Equifax disclosed in September that the data breach affected as many as 145.5 million U.S. consumers, and Smith has testified on the issue before three committees. Equifax last week delayed scheduling its quarterly earnings announcement in the wake of the incident that has sparked several investigations. Verizon combined Yahoo with AOL, which it bought two years ago, to form a venture called Oath. Mayer, a former Google executive, said in June in a blog post that Yahoo had taken steps to bolster its “security defenses.” Verizon in February lowered its original offer for Yahoo assets by $350 million in the wake of two massive cyber attacks at the internet company. The closing of the deal, which was announced in July 2016, was delayed as the companies assessed the fallout from data breaches Yahoo disclosed last year.

,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission will vote next month to allow broadcasters to voluntarily use a new technology to improve picture quality and allow better reception on mobile phones, the agency said on Thursday. The FCC in February granted initial approval for the advanced standard that would also let broadcasters use a TV set that is turned off to send emergency alerts, but would require TV owners to eventually buy new sets or converter boxes. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said on Thursday Net Generation TV would be “the first standard to marry the advantages of broadcasting and the Internet. It holds the promise of delivering better video and audio, advanced emergency alerts, improved accessibility features, personalized and interactive content.” The proposal would require local simulcasting of current signals for at least five years for stations that choose to deploy Next Gen TV so existing TVs and tuners can still receive programming, a person briefed on the matter said. The ATSC 3.0 standard offers much more precise geolocating of TV signals, ultra-high definition picture quality and more interactive programming. It was created by a nonprofit group represented by the broadcasting, consumer electronics, cable, computer and motion picture industries. The standard uses precision broadcasting and targets emergency or weather alerts on a street-by-street basis. The system could allow broadcasters to wake up a receiver to broadcast emergency alerts. The alerts could include maps, storm tracks and evacuation routes, companies have said. At a House hearing on Wednesday, Democratic U.S. Representative Debbie Dingell raised privacy concerns about the data the new TVs could collect about viewers. One issue is whether broadcasters will be able to pass on the costs of advanced broadcast signals through higher retransmissions fees and demand that providers carry the signals. The National Association of Broadcasters, which represents Tegna Inc, Comcast Corp, CBS Corp, Scripps Networks Interactive Inc, Walt Disney Co, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc and others, petitioned the FCC in April 2016 to approve the new standard. Many companies have raised concerns about costs, including AT&T Inc. Verizon Communications Inc said last week the FCC should not require TV viewers “to pay for a new broadcast TV service they have not yet requested.” Cable, satellite and other pay TV providers “would incur significant costs to receive, transmit, and deliver ATSC 3.0 signals to subscribers, including for network and subscriber equipment,” Verizon said. Verizon also said because of the increased bandwidth requirements, TV providers would be forced “to reconfigure channel lineups and potentially drop some programming.” LG Electronics Inc said in a filing that the next generation standard is “the future of mass media communications – a future that is increasingly mobile, interactive and content-rich.” Many nations are considering the new standard. South Korea adopted the ATSC 3.0 standard in 2016. ","

,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"(This Oct 26 story in the 11th paragraph, corrects to say Viacom announced plans to launch its streaming Nickelodeon channel in Japan earlier this month, from launched it) By Jessica Toonkel New York-based Viacom already has mobile agreements in other countries. Now, it is in talks with U.S. carriers to see if it can execute a similar strategy, Viacom Chief Executive Bob Bakish told Reuters in an exclusive interview recently. The company is setting up a division that ultimately will have at least 100 people to produce short-form shows that are more easily watched on mobile phones, he said. “There are hundreds of millions of mobile users in the U.S. who are in the nascent stages of consuming content on their devices and certainly are in the nascent stages of doing it on a pay basis,” Bakish said. Bakish declined to say which carriers his company has approached. The stakes are high for Viacom and its traditional TV rivals, which need to find new sources of revenue as they grapple with shrinking cable subscribers and fees from distribution deals. That makes dealing with mobile carriers, which it has done elsewhere, more attractive. In Japan, Viacom has two deals with mobile companies for its MTV and Nickelodeon apps. In the 18 months since launching, mobile consumption of Viacom’s MTV Hits, a music video service available on AbemaTV, a free, ad-supported web-based mobile service, has surpassed its MTV Japan TV channel, Viacom said. The two share ad revenue. In Indonesia, the No. 1 mobile carrier Telkomsel has started offering Nickelodeon children’s programming as part its data plans for its 173 million subscribers. Terms of the deals were not disclosed, but Viacom said 20 percent of its Japanese distribution revenues in 2017 were from  streaming clients, up from about 2 percent in 2014. While U.S mobile carriers are interested in video, it is important for content to be packaged to entice mobile viewers to keep watching, said Brian Angiolet, global chief media and content officer at Verizon. “The content community sees this opportunity but they can’t just raid what they are already doing,” Angiolet said. “It can’t look like what they have done with traditional partners.” ","

,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"Shares of Comcast were down 0.2 percent at $36.75 at mid-afternoon after tumbling nearly 4 percent in premarket trading as investors shrugged off higher-than-expected earnings. The company said it lost 125,000 video subscribers in the third quarter. It said in September that it might lose up to 150,000 due to recent hurricanes and increased competition in the pay-TV industry. Comcast has said it is well-positioned for changes in viewing habits because of its high-speed internet, or broadband, business, which added 214,000 subscribers in the quarter. But on a conference call, Wall Street analysts said that business’ growth had slowed. The company had added 330,000 broadband subscribers in the year-earlier period. The analysts asked how Comcast viewed the competitive landscape as rival AT&T expands its fiber-based internet service into areas Comcast serves. Chief Executive Brian Roberts said the company had anticipated AT&T’s expansion. “Our view is to deliver the best product, period, and we will constantly increase speeds,” he said. “That’s why we’ve been so focused on Wi-Fi.” In May, Comcast introduced its cloud-based XFi service, which allows users to set up their home Wi-Fi, shut off children’s devices at bedtime and troubleshoot problems from an application on their mobile phones, website or television. Roberts also said Comcast’s Xfinity Mobile service, which competes with wireless carriers like AT&T and Verizon, had surpassed 250,000 customer lines since its introduction in May. Net income attributable to Comcast rose 18.5 percent to $2.65 billion, or 55 cents a share. Excluding special items, earnings per share came to 52 cents. Analysts on average had expected 50 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 1.6 percent to $20.98 billion from the year-earlier period, when the company’s NBC broadcast network benefited from the 2016 Olympics. Wall Street had forecast $21.04 billion. ","

,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc and private equity firm JMC Capital Partners are looking to sell their stakes in a joint venture that operates more than 1,300 free WiFi kiosks fashioned from old phone booths around New York City, according to people familiar with the matter. The move is the latest twist in the project overseen by Daniel Doctoroff, former chief executive of news and data provider Bloomberg LP and former deputy mayor of New York City. He now runs Sidewalk Labs, an urban development unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc. Doctoroff is chairman of a Sidewalk Labs subsidiary that is the top investor in the joint venture. Qualcomm and JMC are working with an investment bank to explore the sale of their stakes in CityBridge, the venture that is behind the LinkNYC WiFi project, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Qualcomm is seeking to exit the venture because it views it as non-core, while the private equity firm JMC is aiming to generate a profitable return on its investment, the people said. Qualcomm and Sidewalk Labs declined to comment. JMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jovana Rizzo, a spokesperson for CityBridge, said in a statement that the group is “committed to fulfilling its obligation to the city of New York and continuing the expansion of LinkNYC across the five boroughs.” A spokeswoman for New York City’s Information Technology & Telecommunications Department said in a statement that the city would have to approve any changes and so far “nothing has been presented to us. Any decision we make has to center around continuing the success of the program and ensuring New Yorkers’ best interests are met.” LinkNYC emerged in 2014 as part of a 12-year contract with New York City to replace 7,500 payphone stands and was expected to generate $500 million in revenue for the city’s coffers. The program’s launch in February 2016 prompted complaints from business owners and residents about crowds hanging around the hotspots for hours at a time and users browsing online pornography on kiosk screens. LinkNYC removed the web-browsing feature. More than 2.7 million people have registered to use the kiosks, which also have phone charging stations and free calling services, LinkNYC said Wednesday. LinkNYC kiosks generate revenue through ad sales. Qualcomm and JMC each invested about $25 million into the joint venture in 2014, the sources said. Another $50 million came from an outdoor advertising company and a software firm that were later bought by a consortium led by Sidewalk Labs and merged in 2015 under the name Intersection. Sidewalk Labs remains the lead investor. Sidewalk Labs, which already owns more half of the CityBridge joint venture through Intersection, could be a potential acquirer of the stakes, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Sidewalk Labs declined to comment on its potential interest. Large wireless carriers such as Verizon Communications and AT&T could potentially be good partners as well in the joint venture, according to the sources. Verizon and AT&T could not immediately be reached for comment. Sidewalk Labs’ Intersection expanded its network of Internet kiosks to London in June, turning on the first of 1,000 expected to be installed with Britain broadband provider BT and a local advertising firm. On Wednesday, Intersection announced plans to open 100 kiosks in Philadelphia without any business partners starting next year. ","

Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is the largest consumer wireless service provider in the United States. It also owns a wireline business, providing phone, internet, and video service to the home, as well as a digital media business called Oath, combining the assets of Yahoo! and AOL. The vast majority of its revenue and earnings come from its wireless business, where it faces intense competition from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), Sprint (NYSE:S), and AT&T (NYSE:T). As T-Mobile and Sprint make moves to win over customers, they have chipped away at the industry economics that have benefited Verizon and AT&T. That's leaving some investors wondering whether Verizon stock is a buy. Image source: Verizon. As the largest wireless service provider, Verizon benefits greatly from economies of scale. While Verizon charges some of the highest prices for its service in the industry, its cost of providing that service per subscriber is actually one of the lowest. As a result it consistently reports the largest wireless EBITDA margin in the industry. Verizon's scale also protects it against future entrants into the industry. Building out a wireless network requires substantial upfront costs. There are also barriers to obtaining the wireless spectrum necessary to operate a wireless service. Considering these barriers, the threat of a new competitor entering the space in earnest is low. Companies like Comcast and Charter are actually using Verizon's network to launch their own wireless services instead of trying to enter the market on their own. Verizon also has a strong brand and network. That gives it some pricing power, but improvements in T-Mobile's network combined with its aggressive pricing have cut into Verizon's ability to charge a premium. Verizon is still, in my opinion, the best-positioned wireless carrier in a hyper-competitive market. Verizon's third-quarter earnings report gave a few reasons to be optimistic about the company's future. First of all, Verizon added over 250,000 net postpaid phone subscribers for the second quarter in a row. That reverses a trend of poor or negative net adds over the last couple years. That also shows the strength of Verizon's brand and network in both retaining existing subscribers and attracting new ones. More importantly, Verizon has started to turn around its falling wireless service revenue. The amount Verizon brought in from service contracts last quarter increased for the first time in three years, and management said the trend will continue in the fourth quarter. That said, service revenue is still falling year over year, but should start to show improvements as soon as next year. Verizon is a strong company and its operations are moving in the right direction, but whether or not the stock is a buy ultimately comes down to what investors have to pay for it. Here's how the four major wireless companies stack up in terms of valuation. Company Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA Ratio Verizon 6.9 AT&T 6.8 T-Mobile 7.4 Sprint 5.6 With an EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 6.9, Verizon appears to be fairly valued. It's trading for the same multiple as AT&T, its closest competitor. Considering AT&T's massive investment in the pay-TV industry and its declining postpaid phone subscriber base, I think Verizon's growth prospects are actually better than AT&T's and should earn it a higher multiple. Meanwhile, T-Mobile trades for a slightly higher EV-to-EBITDA ratio. It probably deserves a higher multiple than Verizon due to its rapid growth. The opposite is true for Sprint, and it's reflected in its depressed price. As such, Verizon appears fairly valued on an EV-to-EBITDA ratio. For investors looking to get into the wireless industry, it presents a good buy right now. I'll be holding onto my own shares for the foreseeable future. ","

"Rich Duprey, Travis Hoium, and Brian Feroldi",11022017,Fool,10262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Among the pearls of wisdom Warren Buffett has dropped along the way in his long investing career, the saying ""price is what you pay, value is what you get"" is one of his more famous ones. And when looking for a deep-value stock, that phrase is highly appropriate. Don't concentrate solely on the prices Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), or The Chefs' Warehouse (NASDAQ:CHEF) are trading at to determine whether they're a good value; dive deeper to see why, despite their prices, they are bargain-basement stocks. Brian Feroldi (Tractor Supply): If you're a city dweller, then the odds are good that you've never set foot in a Tractor Supply store before. That's because this retailer primarily caters to country folk who live in rural areas and have a unique set of product needs -- think animal feed, fences, tools, and outdoor gear. Tractor Supply has been highly successful at fulfilling its customers' needs for years. That's taking long-term investors on a highly profitable ride: TSCO Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts What's amazing about these numbers is that Tractor Supply has generated them without much help from online sales at all. In fact, the company only recently rolled out its ""buy online, pick up in-store"" program, which is something that other retailers have offered for years. This suggests that Tractor Supply's success is largely owed to its first-mover advantage in many rural areas. Despite its history of success, Tractor Supply's stock has been whacked recently on the back of tepid earnings and the general retailer malaise. However, I'm still bullish on this company because same-store sales are growing and there is still plenty of room left in the U.S. for store growth -- especially when you factor in the company's PetSense concept. Wall Street shares my bullishness and is projecting earnings-per-share (EPS) growth in excess of 11% annually over the next five years. That's quite compelling for a company that is only trading at 16 times forward earnings and offers up a dividend yield of 1.8%. Travis Hoium (Verizon): Paying a cellphone bill has become one of the most common expenses for Americans in 2017, and Verizon is one of the biggest beneficiaries of that spending. The company has one of the top two cellular networks, along with AT&T, and is able to generate long-term consistent cash flow from customers under contract. You can see in the chart below that Verizon's growth and free cash flow have taken a step backward in the last year, but that's for good reason. Aging 4G networks are coming under immense competition from T-Mobile and Sprint, causing price pressure for Verizon. At the same time, the company is investing in its next-generation 5G network. VZ Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts It's the 5G wireless network that makes me bullish on Verizon's growth and long-term cash flow. The company has a much bigger balance sheet than rivals like Sprint and T-Mobile, allowing it to launch a nationwide network more quickly. As the network rolls out, we'll see millions of new devices from self-driving cars, wireless watches, VR devices, and more connected to Verizon's network. Verizon's stock is a great value at 12.6 times trailing earnings, and a 4.8% dividend yield should please income investors. Long-term, this is a company that should grow from its already massive base because I see no sign that the future isn't becoming even more wireless than it is today. Image source: Getty Images. Rich Duprey (The Chefs' Warehouse): Despite the malaise in the restaurant industry, one of the best-performing sectors has been fine dining, which -- until August anyway -- had experienced growth every month so far this year. Now, for two consecutive months, same-store sales have been down. In September, the segment was the worst performer, due largely to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hitting Texas and Florida hard. Even so, The Chefs' Warehouse still finds itself up 26% year to date and over 70% higher for the past 12 months. The specialty food products distributor makes sure fine dining establishments, country clubs, cruise lines, and other specialty food places have unique center-of-plate dishes to offer customers to set themselves apart from the competition. Although expenses have grown, organic growth is still charging ahead, up 10% in the second quarter, which it seeks to expand upon by bringing chain restaurants into the fold. It is also in the direct-to-consumer market now, too. The restaurant business may be in a decline, but it is beginning to rebound, and analysts see 2018 getting better for the industry. So how do we get to The Chefs' Warehouse being a deep-value stock? Despite trading at 42 times trailing earnings and 34 times next year's estimates, the market values it at just 12 times the free cash flow it produces. The specialty food distributor is expected to grow earnings at 15% annually for the next five years, with profits anticipated to be 42% higher next year. This small-cap stock is valued at only $523 million at the moment, but it has the potential to become a billion-dollar leader as restaurants seek to gain an edge over the competition by putting The Chefs' Warehouse's unique dishes on their menus.

    3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices -- The Motley Fool

  "
Motley Fool Staff,11022017,Fool,10262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For Amazon, revenue last quarter was up 34%, retail sales were up 22% year over year, AWS revenue was up 42%, and its high-margin segments are growing by leaps and bounds. How much longer can the e-commerce leader keep up this pace? And how big are its opportunities in areas like the online pharmacy business? Meanwhile, Alphabet is growing across the board, and at an accelerating rate; and thanks to Google's skinny TV bundles and YouTube streaming, people are spending a lot more time watching its video content -- but yes, there was a minor smudge in this shiny report, related to its mobile penetration. And as for Microsoft, it's continuing to use the cloud to power its renaissance. But if you think that means that its PC-related business has to be declining, think again. (These Fools give a lot of credit to the man at the top, CEO Satya Nadella.) So here's the real question: All of these stocks have just set new highs. Which, if any, are still solid buys at these levels? A full transcript follows the video. Chris Hill: We begin this week with Earningspalooza. Three of the biggest public companies all hitting record highs. Microsoft, Alphabet, we're going to start with Amazon's third-quarter report. Revenue came in just shy of $44 billion, that's a 34% increase over a year ago. Shares of Amazon on Friday, Jeff, up 12%. Jeff Fischer: Unbelievable, Chris. The shares are up 46% year to date, and 360% just in the last five years. If you thought you were too late to Amazon, you were not. The good news is, I don't think you're too late now, either. I think the company will be much more valuable five and 10 years from now. Right now, it has a $525 billion market cap. Let's see where it is five years from now, I bet it'll be much higher. Anyway, Chris, retail sale sales were up 22% year over year. That's higher than they grew a year ago, when they grew 20%. That's amazing. Amazon Web Services revenue was up 42%, which is a little slower than a year ago, but still very strong. The company did have lower operating margins pretty much across the board. The Web Services business, which is key, which is where a lot of profits are made, the operating margins were up at sequentially, so people were happy to see that, as well. Not talked about so much, but really interesting to me is, ad revenue was up about 60%. Huge growth there, and that's very high marching revenue, and they have a lot more room to keep growing that revenue. Hill: Yeah. Amazon, a company that famously keeps things close to the vest, they don't have an advertising division, per say, Matty. The number he referenced there goes in their ""other revenue"" segment. Matt Argersinger: It speaks to the tremendous optionality of this business. I'll go back to the core retail business growing over 20%. If you look at the overall e-commerce just in the U.S., it's growing in the low teens year over year. So, as mature as Amazon is, it's still putting up this amazing growth. We've talked a lot about other companies making headway. Wal-Mart is making headway, Target, to a certain extent, other e-commerce players. But Amazon, the Juggernaut of the business, is still growing and accelerating its growth, which I just think is exceptional. Fischer: Yeah, Matt, and they haven't yet cracked groceries to a great extent. They bought Whole Foods, but it's still a small part of their business. They haven't really cracked healthcare, let alone pharmacy, there are rumors that they're looking at how to get into that, because that's a giant industry. So, there's a lot more for them to grab. Hill: As we came into the studio to tape today, there were all these reports that CVS is in talks to buy health insurer Aetna for as much as $66 billion, and part of the rationale for that, if it in fact goes through, is so that CVS can defend against Amazon. Argersinger: It's amazing. Actually, Jason was telling me before the show that you can type AmazonRx, and right now it goes just Amazon. But clearly, whatever anecdotal evidence you need, Amazon is getting into this business. I think about the fact that, now, my wife and I, for the most part, we get all of our groceries at home. Amazonfresh is an amazing service. With the Whole Foods acquisition, you have more and more to choose from. But I like the idea of, you go see your doctor, order directly from your doctor online through Amazon, and by the time you get home, your drugs are waiting for you, along with your groceries. Hill: Do you think there's someone whose job it is at Amazon to just secure URLs? That Jeff Bezos is like, ""I don't know if we're going to do this, go ahead and secure that just in case."" Alphabet's third quarter profits came in higher than expected, so did overall revenue. Their margins are growing. Matty, did anything bad happen to Alphabet? Or was this all sunshine and rainbows? Because it really looks like all sunshine and rainbows. Argersinger: It really is. There might be one thing I'll mention. This is another example of the big getting bigger, the big getting stronger. We talked about Amazon's business accelerating. Alphabet's business is kind of accelerating. Revenue up 24%. That's above the average they've been generating the last several years. Growth in the core advertising business was up 21%, and growth in Google's other revenue -- this is not other bets, just other revenue, hardware, cloud -- that business was up 40%. What really impresses me, and it's impressed me for a long time but continues to blow my mind is YouTube, and the power of what that's doing for the platform and for Google's search business. 1.5 billion users spending an average of 60 minutes per day on YouTube. It's massive. But one interesting thing the company pointed out in the conference call is, they're also racking up a lot of time in the living room. 100 million viewing hours per day at home through smart TV or other TV devices. No longer is YouTube just, I'm looking at my phone or my iPad or playing a game or something like that. It's now, people are watching YouTube on their TV and doing so at really prodigious rates. Jason Moser: Yeah, the skinny bundle offering, just like Hulu has, I think there's a lot of runway there. And we're seeing them making a big advertising push. Certainly, we've seen some stuff here going on in the baseball playoffs season. I think that, as time goes on, those skinny bundles that Hulu and Google are offering are only going to get better, because they give consumers what they want in the way of content, and the service aspect of it is just so much more optimal. When you consider that you don't have to call anybody, you just go in there and click the button here or there, you record a payment, you don't have to call or wait on hold -- Argersinger: It's so easy. Moser: The service aspect of it is so much better than something you might deal with with Verizon or Comcast, who notoriously have very bad reputations for service. Argersinger: One small cloud over this sunshine and rainbows we've been talking about is the traffic acquisition cost. They're up 54% year over year. That's of course, Google paying smartphone makers and web browsers to run Google search and ads. Critical cost, that's again up 54%. Mainly that's because mobile is so much more of an expensive platform for them, they have to really pay up for it. We want to see that scale out, we want to see that number come down, otherwise Alphabet's operating profits probably are going to keep up with revenue over time. Hill: Microsoft's first-quarter profits came in solidly higher than Wall Street was expecting. Jason, the cloud business continues to grow, has been growing for a while. The PC business growing this quarter, too. That was a little bit surprising. Moser: A little bit. The word I used back in July was cloud. The word this quarter is cloud. This is the same old thing here, but that's in a good way. When you look at the commercial cloud business, the run rate is now at $20 billion annually. For context, Amazon Web Service is around $18 billion, both leaving Google in the dust in that regard right now. But, Google is obviously a very good player as well. The more I think about it, the more I think Satya Nadella is Microsoft's Steve Easterbrook. We think about all of the success that Easterbrook has had at McDonald's in turning this business around. Satya Nadella has done a lot of the same with Microsoft, identifying the key opportunities, cloud. I think we probably all still have some questions about the LinkedIn acquisition, but the bottom line is, they're realizing stronger engagement and it's contributing to earnings per share. Then, there's a big runway in gaming, as well. A new Xbox coming soon. All in all, this is still a business that's extremely relevant in offices all over the world. Again, I think that's going to continue, and Nadella and his team are doing a very good job exploiting that and monetizing it, and investors are clearly winning. Hill: We've got Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft. We have three stocks. These are three of the four biggest public companies out there. Apple is the biggest. We'll be talking about them on next week's show when they report their earnings. But of these three stocks, for investors who are looking over the next five to 10 years, they're all hitting new highs this week. Are any of them unreasonably priced? Is one more so than the others, you look at and think, ""Even if you have the five to 10 year time horizon, it's something where you want to wait for a little bit of a pullback?"" What do you think, Matty? Argersinger: I'll call it Microsoft only because I think the business, compared to the other two, is a lot more mature, and the valuation for Microsoft is kind of in line with Alphabet. And I think Alphabet has a lot bigger runway ahead of it. What Microsoft has done has been very impressive. But if I had to pick one of the three, I would say Microsoft. Hill: Jason? Moser: I think Amazon is the easy target there, but Matty hits on a very good point. We have to think forward. Microsoft, I think we've been conditioned to accept this low valuation. It's still somewhere around 20X free cash flow. But, on a forward-looking basis, I think Alphabet and Amazon are the companies that have the bigger opportunities. Honestly, I think you buy a little bit of all three and you'd be just fine. Hill: Jeff? Fischer: I'll say, there's no question that all three trade at a bull market type of price, and at some point in the next five to 10 years, we'll see a significant market drawback. It's almost inevitable. Call it a bear market, whatever you like. We'll see a year or two of stocks falling, at least, in the next five to 10 years. That said, I think all three are priced such that five years, there's a decent chance they'll generate a decent return over five years. 10 years, there's a very good chance they'll generate a good return. That is, as long as Amazon or Google, Alphabet, is not attacked by regulations, or Amazon, which trades at 75X free cash flow, compared to Microsoft at 20X, doesn't make some missteps and hit its profitability prospects.

Barbara Kollmeyer,11022017,MarketWatch,10262017,"Published: Oct 27, 2017 10:24 a.m. ET Eager buyers get up early to place an order, only to be thwarted by tech glitches By For some of Apple’s faithful clients, the joy was being sucked out of a big day — that is, the first opportunity to order the $999 iPhone X. Less than 10 minutes after pre-orders opened online on Friday, people were being told that their iPhone X wouldn’t arrive for two to three weeks (or more) — a sign that initial supplies had already run out. Now that wait has now stretched out to as long as six weeks for both the 64GB and the 256 versions, according to the Apple web site. Preorders for the iPhone X were scheduled to begin at 3:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the company’s website and via the Apple Store app in more than 55 countries and territories, for delivery of the handset at the end of next week. But earlier Friday, the hashtag #iPhone X was top-trending on Twitter, as complaints piled up from fans trying to be first to get the new smartphone. Some of the frustration was aimed at Apple

Japan’s Nikkei newspaper reported earlier this week that iPhone X shipments may be only half what is expected this year.

Pre-orders were 4 million that year. $AAPL pic.twitter.com/Tspi5lhqe6 Shares of Apple rose 1.9% early Friday, as the reports eased concerns over demand for the $999 iPhone X. A survey of availability by Cascend Securities in the 100 most populous markets in the U.S. found that in every case, iPhone X was sold out for pre-order online home delivery by 5 a.m., when it started the survey. Apple’s iPhone 8, which shipped out last month, posted the weakest sales of any of the company’s new phones in recent years, according to estimates by two market-research companies.

Austen Hufford,11022017,MarketWatch,10262017,"Published: Oct 26, 2017 7:14 a.m. ET By Comcast Corp. suffered its largest quarterly loss of cable television subscribers in three years, underscoring the pressure on traditional TV players as competition with new entrants heats up. The cable giant's results for the September quarter come after AT&T Inc. said Tuesday that it was continuing to lose its most profitable pay-TV viewers. The traditional pay TV providers are competing with new, more affordable online channel bundles, as well as streaming services like Netflix Inc., which are luring away subscribers. Despite such concerns, Comcast on Thursday reported higher-than-expected profits per share as well as adjusted revenue growth. In the cable TV business, the company lost 125,000 residential and business customers, compared with a gain of 32,000 in the same quarter last year. In the second quarter, Comcast lost 34,000 residential and business video customers. The company, like AT&T, believes the spate of major hurricanes in the quarter contributed to the subscriber losses. Comcast and other cable providers stand to benefit on the internet access side of their business as streaming TV subscriptions and usage increase. Comcast gained 214,000 internet customers in the quarter, down from the 330,000 gained in the year-ago period. Total revenue per customer relationship increased 2.1% to $151.51. Comcast lost 94,000 voice customers in the quarter, compared with an addition of 2,000 in the year-ago quarter. Overall revenue for Comcast's cable division, which makes up 62% of the top line, rose 5.1% to $13.2 billion. This year Comcast launched a new wireless cellphone service, aimed at adding a fourth pillar to the typical television-phone-internet bundles. The mobile service is only for customers who subscribe to at least its internet service already. The cable operator is relying on a five-year-old network-resale agreement with Verizon Communications to offer its service. Comcast has signaled that it views the wireless service as an add-on for its customers, aimed at increasing profits and reducing the percentage of customers leaving its service. At the NBCUniversal media division, revenue and profits had tough comparisons to last year, when the company's networks aired the 2016 Olympic Games. Revenue in the division fell 13% to $8.01 billion, with declines in both the broadcast television and cable networks divisions. When the impact of the Games was stripped out, revenue increased 6%. Revenue in the filmed entertainment division fell 0.5% as there were no megahits in the quarter. Still, the company's release of ""Despicable Me 3"" highlighted its focus on growing the size of its franchise business, which provides revenue beyond a movie's theater run. Theme parks revenue increased 7.7%, driven by new attractions in Japan and Orlando, Fla. In all, net income rose to $2.65 billion, or 55 cents a share, up from $2.24 billion, or 46 cents a share, a year ago. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share came in at 52 cents. Revenue fell 1.6% to $20.98 billion but adjusted revenue, excluding the impact of the Olympics, grew 5.8%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters projected adjusted earnings of 50 cents a share on $21.04 billion in revenue.

Austen Hufford,11022017,MarketWatch,10262017,"Popular stock indicator presents risks to investors due to how its 30 stocks are weighted. Adobe Stock The “Dow” is hitting new highs with regularity.  That sounds good to casual market observers.  Heck, every week I hear about someone who does not know or care about the stock market telling their friends about how the Dow just crossed a certain level, and that its doing great in general.  That’s true in fact, but there is more to it, unless you just want to rest on your laurels and ignore a major risk that is inherent in tracking the Dow. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the favorite market proxy for decades before the S&P 500, once considered a gauge monitored by professional investors only, started to replace the Dow in notoriety.  As I have written and shown in past articles, the S&P 500 is a terrible proxy for the stock market as we get later into a bull market cycle, but as it turns out, the Dow is even worse.  A while back, I alerted you to the fact that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is based on a very oddball formula to determine how much influence each of its 30 component stocks has on the overall index.  The allocation, or weighting of each of the stocks in the index is simply a function of the dollar price of each stock.  Why is that an issue?  Because the price of a stock is not a valuation measure.  If one stock is selling at $100 a share and another at $50 a share, that tells you nothing about where it has been, what its earnings trend is, or anything else that might be of value to an investor who actually cares to know what they own. This creates a false sense of what you are following when you follow the Dow.  And if you own an index fund that is based on the Dow, you are not just following it, you are invested in it.  One of the biggest issues when bear markets eventually strike is that investors realize they had a chance to better-understand what they owned, but did not care about it until it was too late. There are many ways to structure a portfolio.  Many index ETFs are “capitalization-weighted” which means that the larger the value of a stock’s outstanding shares, the larger the weighting in that ETF and its underlying index.  That does not make a lot of sense to me in most cases, but it does to a lot of people, so that’s as far as I will go on that point for now.  The other way to allocate among stocks in an index or portfolio is to “equal-weight” the holdings.  This makes more sense to me, but then again, I also love all my kids equally, so there you go.  I do notice that more ETFs are equal-weighting their holdings, but cap-weighting is still the dominant approach. Now, back to the Dow.   The venerable stock market indicator weights its 30 holdings based on the dollar price of the stock.  Why?  Because in 1896, Charles Dow decided it was the simplest way to help investors understand the stock market (source: Investopedia).  I wish there were some more erudite process I could explain to you, but there is not.  Yet for 121 years, this has been the case with the Dow.  I created a table below to help you see the folly of this approach today, and so that you can join me in shaking your head as to why this has not been changed all these years. What is the Dow? It depends on how you slice it. Ycharts.com as of 10/20/17 market close From left to right, see the price-weighted composition of the Dow, which is the actual Dow Jones Industrial Average you see quoted.  Note that only 7 stocks make up over 42% of the Dow index.  The other 23 stocks comprise only 58% of the Dow.  This top-heaviness is due in part to strong price moves by the companies that now top the list, since the more their prices climb relative to the prices of the other stocks, the higher their weighting goes.  But if you thought you were making a big investment in the stocks at the lower portion of the list, you are not. Next, I constructed a capitalization-weighted Dow, and you can see that those top 7 Dow components make up only about 16% of the total value of the 30 stocks in the index.  In other words, if the Dow were set up like the S&P 500 and many other indexes, it would look completely different. Finally, I show an equal-weight version of the Dow. At the bottom of the chart, you can see the return for 2017 of each version of the Dow, through October 20.  For this year so far, the returns are very high in all cases.  But that is not the point.  The point is that the Dow is not influenced by “the stock market” as much as it is the current beneficiaries of the Dow’s quirky stock weighting scheme.  This is that thing I mentioned before, that investors may regret not realizing when times are not as good as they are now for the Dow. The 30 Largest S&P 500 Component Stocks, Based on Price Per Share YCharts 2017 Finally, since the Dow and S&P 500 are often used interchangeably in conversation about how the “market” is doing, I put together another chart showing what the S&P 500’s 30 largest holdings would look like if it used a price-weighted approach instead of a market-cap weighted approach (note that I included 31 total securities Alphabet a.k.a. Google is listed twice given its 2 separate share classes).  As you can see, this looks very little like the Dow.  More significantly, it looks nothing like the S&P 500!  The top 30 stocks make up only 13.5% of this concocted price-weighted index.  And some of the stocks with the highest prices are among the smaller companies within the S&P 500. Keep your eyes out for what is NOT obvious about the current market rally.  It will serve you well when the unraveling eventually occurs.

Tomi Kilgore,11022017,MarketWatch,10262017,"Published: Oct 26, 2017 12:13 p.m. ET Ending a 110-year streak as a Dow member could be a blessing in disguise for GE investors By Shares of General Electric Co. have fallen so far this year that they have broken an unwritten rule that the keepers of the Dow Jones Industrial Average use for inclusion in the 121-year old index, in which GE is a founding member. That may not directly lead to GE being booted from the Dow, a move that would end a 110-year long membership. It would mark the third time that GE was not a member of the blue-chip barometer--it was removed and then brought back twice before its latest stretch. But getting kicked out of the Dow

                                   that are trading at more than 10 times the price of GE’s stock. On Thursday, GE shares fell 0.3% to $21.43 in midday trade, while Boeing’s stock slipped 0.2% to $257.87. David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, a unit of S&P Global Inc., told MarketWatch earlier this year that the committee members “prefer” that the ratio of the highest to lowest priced stocks in the Dow be “less than” 10 to 1. GE’s stock broke that ratio guideline on Sept. 8, when it fell to a close of $23.82, while Boeing shares rose to $238.78. A spokesperson for S&P Dow Jones Indices said they won’t comment on individual stocks, but added that none of the “rules” are set in stone. The index committee regularly meets to review the composition of its indexes, as well as pending corporate actions, statistics comparing its indexes to the broader market and significant market events, which could include excessive share price movements. “In addition, the committees may revise index policy covering rules for selecting companies, treatment of dividends, share counts or other matters,” the company said in a statement. “S&P Dow Jones Indices considers information about changes to its indices and related matter to be potentially market moving and material. Therefore, all index committee discussions are confidential.” If the committee deemed GE no longer worthy of the Dow, for the first time since it was added back in on Nov. 7, 1907, investors may actually breathe a sigh of relief.

GE was a founding member of the Dow, which launched on May 26, 1896 with 12 members, including long-gone “smokestack” companies such as American Cotton Oil, Tennessee Coal & Iron and U.S. Leather, according to data provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices. It was replaced in September 1898, when founding member U.S. Rubber re-entered the index, but then returned just seven months later. GE exited again in April 1901, then came back in on Nov. 7, 1907, as it replaced fellow founding member Tennessee Coal & Iron. It has remained in the index ever since. GE has had a nice run that past century, but a change may be needed. It ended the year as the biggest S&P 500 index component by market capitalization as recently as 2005, when it was valued at $370.3 million, according to data provided by S&P Global. With a current market cap of $189.1 billion, it has less than a quarter of Apple’s market cap of $811.1 billion, and ranks 16th in the Dow by that metric.

",GE’s stock has breached an unwritten rule for Dow members - MarketWatch
,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer apologized on Wednesday for two massive data breaches at the internet company, blaming Russian agents for at least one of them, at a hearing on the growing number of cyber attacks on major U.S. companies. “Unfortunately, while all our measures helped Yahoo successfully defend against the barrage of attacks by both private and state-sponsored hackers, Russian agents intruded on our systems and stole our users’ data.” Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless operator, acquired most of Yahoo Inc’s assets in June, the same month Mayer stepped down. Verizon disclosed last month that a 2013 Yahoo data breach affected all 3 billion of its accounts, compared with an estimate of more than 1 billion disclosed in December. In March, federal prosecutors charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers with masterminding a 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts, the first time the U.S. government has criminally charged Russian spies for cyber crimes. Those charges came amid controversy relating to alleged Kremlin-backed hacking of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible links between Russian figures and associates of President Donald Trump. Russia has denied trying to influence the U.S. election in any way. Special Agent Jack Bennett of the FBI’s San Francisco Division said in March the 2013 breach was unrelated and that an investigation of the larger incident was continuing. Mayer later said under questioning that she did not know if Russians were responsible for the 2013 breach, but earlier spoke of state-sponsored attacks. Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, asked Mayer on Wednesday why it took three years to identify the data breach or properly gauge its size. Mayer said Yahoo has not been able to identify how the 2013 intrusion occurred and that the company did not learn of the incident until the U.S. government presented data to Yahoo in November 2016. She said even “robust” defenses are not enough to defend against state-sponsored attacks and compared the fight with hackers to an “arms race.” Yahoo required users to change passwords and took new steps to make data more secure, Mayer said. “We now know that Russian intelligence officers and state-sponsored hackers were responsible for highly complex and sophisticated attacks on Yahoo’s systems,” Mayer said. She said “really aggressive” pursuit of hackers was needed to discourage the efforts, and that even the most well-defended companies “could fall victim to these crimes.” The current and former chief executives of credit bureau Equifax, which disclosed in September that a data breach affected as many as 145.5 million U.S. consumers, said they did not know who was responsible for the attack. Senator Bill Nelson said “only stiffer enforcement and stringent penalties will help incentivize companies to properly safeguard consumer information.” Thune told reporters after the hearing the Equifax data breach had created “additional momentum” for Congress to approve legislation. He said Mayer’s testimony was “important in shaping our future reactions.” The Senate Commerce Committee took the unusual step of subpoenaing Mayer to testify on Oct. 25 after a representative for Mayer declined multiple requests for her voluntarily testimony. A representative for Mayer said on Tuesday she was appearing voluntarily. ","

 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"Supported by Sprint and T-Mobile said on Saturday that they had ended merger talks, marking the second time in three years that the two failed to reach a deal to create a stronger competitor to Verizon and AT&T. The announcement represents a setback to Sprint, T-Mobile and their majority shareholders — Sprint is owned by the Japanese technology giant SoftBank and T-Mobile by Deutsche Telekom of Germany — in their efforts to create a stronger third-place competitor in the American wireless market. But unlike three years ago, when Sprint and T-Mobile called off their last round of merger discussions because of strong opposition from the Barack Obama administration, this time the culprit was control. The final blow to the latest round of talks came Saturday night in Tokyo, when Tim Höttges, the chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, met at the Tokyo home of SoftBank’s founder, Masayoshi Son, according to a person briefed on the matter. There, Mr. Höttges delivered to Mr. Son and Sprint’s chief executive, Marcelo Claure, new terms for a merger of the American companies. Mr. Son and Mr. Claure ultimately rejected the plan because it did not give SoftBank and Sprint enough control over the combined entity, people briefed on the discussions said. Choosing to abandon the deal talks means that Sprint and T-Mobile must now continue on their own paths to challenging their much bigger and better-financed rivals. For consumers, that probably signals a prolonging of a price war among the four wireless providers — one that analysts have said appears unsustainable for the smaller carriers in the long run. In a joint statement, Sprint and T-Mobile said that they could not come to “mutually agreeable terms” for a combination. “We have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile’s shareholders compared to our outstanding stand-alone performance and track record,” John Legere, T-Mobile’s chief executive, said in the statement. Mr. Claure of Sprint added in the statement, “We have agreed that it is best to move forward on our own.” People briefed on the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly, said that a deal always hinged on SoftBank’s comfort with taking a minority stake in the combined business. Deutsche Telekom was expected to be the biggest shareholder of the merged company, given that T-Mobile is the bigger business by market value. T-Mobile’s market capitalization as of Friday’s close was $48.5 billion, while Sprint’s was $26.7 billion. Though the two had been in on-again, off-again talks for months, they appeared to be making progress, with an eye on striking a deal before Thanksgiving. But at a SoftBank board meeting on Friday, several directors of the Japanese company expressed reservations about giving up control of a major telecom service provider, according to one of the people briefed on the matter. Shares in both companies fell last week after Nikkei Asian Review, a Japanese business publication, reported that SoftBank intended to walk away from the transaction. But Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile planned to make one last offer to SoftBank and Sprint. The stakes for Sprint and T-Mobile are perhaps higher now than they were in the summer of 2014, when the two last pursued a merger. While both have waged a price war against their bigger competitors, drawing new customers in the process, few in the industry believe that the Sprint and T-Mobile can sustain the costs of a drawn-out war against better-capitalized opponents. Walking away from a merger with T-Mobile will provide the biggest test yet of Mr. Son’s ability to turn around Sprint after more than a decade of trouble. The billionaire led SoftBank’s takeover of the troubled American telecom in 2012, paying nearly $22 billion for a majority stake. At the time, Mr. Son argued that he could take on Verizon and AT&T — but those ambitions hinged on ultimately combining his new telecom with T-Mobile. Then, Sprint was seen as the stronger company and in position to own a bigger share of the combined business. Three years later, however, T-Mobile has become the better performer, its brash cost-cutting campaign forced Verizon and AT&T into a tough price war. Sprint has largely lagged behind, though analysts praised its third-quarter financial performance as showing signs of promise. Putting the two companies together would have created a business with more scale — and more financial capability to pay for both network upgrades and discounts for service plans. Sprint, in particular, was seen as bearing a bigger financial burden, carrying $34.2 billion in long-term debt on its books as of Sept. 30, while having posted annual losses for years. T-Mobile, while reporting $27.7 billion in long-term debt as of Sept. 30, has been profitable every year since 2013. Combining the two telecom providers would have helped their majority shareholders as well. SoftBank has faced concerns from investors about how it would manage Sprint’s debt load, while Deutsche Telekom has been concerned about the fate of its best-performing business asset. Among the most prominent advocates of a merger of the two companies was Mr. Son of SoftBank. “Three is a real fight, a real competition,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview in September. Both companies had been hoping that, unlike in 2014, a merger of the two would be looked upon more favorably this time around. The Obama administration had strongly hinted that it would fight to oppose a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, arguing that consolidation would hurt consumers. By contrast, the deal makers at both companies said that they believed the Trump administration would let a deal take place. Now, Sprint and T-Mobile will be left on their own to battle Verizon and AT&T — and each other. Executives from both companies appeared ready to wage that fight. “We are determined to continue our efforts to change the wireless industry and compete fiercely,” Mr. Claure said in the joint statement. “We look forward to continuing to take the fight to the duopoly and newly emerging competitors.” And Mr. Legere wrote in a tweet, “We’ve been changing this industry for good for the past 5 years and #WeWontStop!” Advertisement ",Sprint and T-Mobile End Merger Discussions - The New York Times
 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Corp will accelerate investment in its network as it plots a future as a standalone company, its chief executive officer said on Wednesday, days after the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier and rival T-Mobile US Inc said merger talks had failed. Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said at an investor conference the company could spend more than its previous guidance of $5 billion to $6 billion per year on capital expenditures, and that cash on hand could dip next year as it builds out its network. “We came to the realization that we’re still far away from what the Sprint network can actually deliver,” Claure said on Wednesday. “I don’t think we’ve put all our assets to work.” Sprint and No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile said on Saturday they have called off merger talks to create a combined U.S. wireless company to rival market leaders AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. Claure said on Wednesday that the talks fell through because SoftBank Group Corp CEO Masayoshi Son was not prepared to relinquish control of Sprint. SoftBank owns a majority of Sprint shares. “We’re always going to be open to looking at possible alternatives,” he said, adding that “we believe that eventually there’s going to need to be a tie-up between a telco and a cable company.” Sprint shares rose 4.2 percent to $5.99 in early afternoon trading on Wednesday.

 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"(Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Altice USA will sell mobile service on wireless carrier Sprint Corp’s network under a new multi-year agreement announced on Sunday, becoming the latest firm to enter the wireless market in a bid to retain customers. The companies announced the agreement a day after Sprint and T-Mobile US Inc ended merger talks. Under the terms of the agreement, Altice, the fourth-largest U.S. cable operator, will use Sprint’s network to provide voice and data services in the United States. It gave no time line on when it will introduce such services. The deal will allow Sprint to use Altice’s cable infrastructure to transmit cellular data and develop a next-generation network, or 5G. Sprint and T-Mobile on Saturday called off merger talks to create a bigger U.S. wireless company to rival market leaders. That has left Sprint, the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier, to engineer a turnaround on its own. Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, Sprint’s majority owner, said in a separate announcement on Sunday that it intended to increase its stake in Sprint but that it would keep ownership of outstanding common stock under 85 percent, a move that avoids triggering a tender offer for the remaining shares. SoftBank currently owns roughly 82 percent of Sprint. U.S. cable companies have begun venturing into the wireless market as a way to bundle more services to reduce churn, or customer defections, at a time when more consumers are canceling cable subscriptions. Comcast Corp started selling wireless service this year on Verizon Communications Inc’s network, and Charter Communications Inc plans to launch service next year. ","

Rumors are spreading that the merger being negotiated by T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) is hitting a rough patch right now, months after the companies first started talking, and just as the two were expected to expected to seal the deal. According to reports, Sprint majority stakeholder SoftBank Group, and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom AG can't agree on how much control each would receive in the deal; CNBC is reporting Deutsche Telecom's management may visit SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son this weekend to smooth things over. You may remember that Sprint and T-Mobile considered a deal back in 2014 that would have resulted in Sprint buying out T-Mobile, but those talks ended when the prospect of a merger met with strong resistance from regulators. If the Sprint and T-Mobile deal falls apart for good this time, it's unlikely the nation's third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers will try a third time. As Sprint and T-Mobile try to keep their merger talks alive, let's take a quick look at two possible alternatives for Sprint if the deal doesn't work out. Image source: Getty Images. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) could be a strong contender to make a bid for Sprint, mainly because the cable company just jumped into the mobile wireless business earlier this year. Comcast only offers wireless services to its Xfinity Internet subscribers, and buying Sprint would significantly expand the cable company's reach. And even if Comcast doesn't want to become the nation's fourth-largest wireless carrier, the cable company could always purchase some of Sprint's spectrum, and sell it off later. Comcast made a similar move several years ago when it bought up wireless spectrum and later sold it to Verizon. What we do know is that Comcast is looking for new areas of growth as pay-TV subscriber numbers continue to decline. Research from Kagan estimates that by 2021, traditional TV providers will have lost 11 million subscribers nationwide. One hang-up for a potential Comcast deal is that it would need to be approved by Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR). Like Comcast, Charter announced plans for a mobile wireless service for its customers, and the two have teamed up, in a sense, to ensure they can test the mobile waters without competition from each other. To that end, they agreed that neither would make any wireless acquisitions without the other's consent. This could also open up another opportunity for Sprint, where both Charter and Comcast buy some of Sprint, and the mobile carrier uses the cash to continue building out its business. Charter and Comcast had pursued a similar scenario over the summer, but it never materialized as Sprint opted to pursue a deal with T-Mobile. It's also possible that Sprint could get snatched up by DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH). DISH been aggressively buying up swaths of wireless spectrum -- it purchased $6.2 billion worth in the latest wireless auction alone. So there's been lots of talk about DISH either buying or being bought by a wireless provider, and a collapse of the Sprint/T-Mobile deal would only fuel further speculation. DISH is expected to launch an Internet of Things network -- for bringing small, data-sipping devices online -- in the next few years, but a deal with Sprint would instantly make DISH a key player in the mobile market, and give it even greater opportunities to utilize its wireless spectrum. Though it looks like T-Mobile and Sprint are trying to salvage their deal, anything could happen at this point. What's clear, though, is that Sprint is very interested in being bought. The carrier has worked hard to improve its business recently -- Sprint posted its highest operating income in 10 years in its latest quarter -- but the company's position in the U.S. wireless market isn't nearly as strong as it used to be. Sprint isn't likely to give up on the idea of being acquired if its deal with T-Mobile were to fall apart -- again. ","

Eric Volkman,11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. These days, it's hard to find a stock more beaten down than Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR). The regional telecom's shares have been absolutely hammered over the past few years -- to the point where they're touching the lowest they've been in over three decades. That's quite a dive. Let's take a closer look to determine if Frontier might be able to pick itself up from the floor and get its stock moving higher again. Frontier stock's latest major price swoon began in early 2015, very shortly after the company agreed to pay over $10.5 billion to acquire a big set of Verizon Communication (NYSE:VZ) assets in Florida, California, and Texas. That was the second monster deal between the two companies; in 2009, Frontier parted with $8.6 billion to buy similar assets in 14 states. Image source: Getty Images. When the 2015 deal closed last year, Frontier took over approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband accounts, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers formerly owned by Verizon. At a stroke, Frontier doubled its size, and then some. The company placed this massive bet because, in the words of CEO Daniel McCarthy, ""[i]t significantly expands our presence in three high-growth, high-density states, and improves our revenue mix by increasing the percentage of our revenues coming from segments with the most promising growth potential."" The problem was that this flew in the face of two major trends: cord-cutting and what we can call broadband migration. The former is the well-known practice of ditching traditional pay-TV providers like FiOS for a smorgasbord of streaming services. The latter, which is related to cord-cutting, refers to customers moving to cable internet from the DSL technology delivered over phone lines. This isn't only a Frontier problem; it's been prevalent throughout the telecom industry. Yet the company was particularly vulnerable to it because of its size and scope -- it's much smaller, as you can see below, than top peers Verizon and AT&T (NYSE:T). Compounding that, unlike those giants, Frontier doesn't have other significant business units (like AT&T's DirecTV) that it can mobilize to help make up for the declining revenue. FTR Market Cap data by YCharts. Since the latest Verizon deal closed, the purchased customer base in Florida, California, and Texas has eroded in every quarter. And for more than a year, the company's revenue has dropped from quarter to quarter, with the bottom line landing consistently in the red. A deep (62%) dividend cut earlier this year shored up the finances somewhat; unfortunately, it also gave investors a solid reason to abandon or avoid the shares. A subsequent reverse stock split saved the company from an embarrassing delisting but ultimately couldn't halt the share price slide. It's been quite a tumble. From the start of this year alone, Frontier's stock has plummeted by almost 83%. It's hard to see how Frontier can crawl its way out of this. It invested heavily in technology its customers don't seem to want much these days, and there's no backup revenue source. The dividend, even at the drastically reduced rate, yields an insane 27%. That's not a sign of financial strength, nor does it indicate a deep bargain find -- it's a flashing red light for a company that's in deep trouble. I can't imagine any scenario in which Frontier stock rebounds from even this drastically reduced level. I very much doubt this will be a recovery story. ","

Daniel B. Kline,11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In 2014, regulatory opposition forced Sprint (NYSE:S) to give up on its plan to acquire T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). Three years later, the two companies returned to the negotiating table, coming close to finalizing an agreement before the deal hit roadblocks once again. What happened? And what lies ahead for the No. 3 and 4 wireless providers? A full transcript follows the video. Dan Kline: Nice to be here! Shen: Are you in town this time for any special occasion? Kline: I was speaking to potential college journalists -- well, I guess, they're actual college journalists who want to be professional journalists. I got to give them the scary ""our profession is not as good as it was,"" but there are wonderful places like Motley Fool where, if you can make your way here eventually, it'll be good for you. It was actually organized by a former Fool, as well. Shen: There you go. Today, Fools, for our main subject of discussion, we're branching out into the telecommunications industry for this episode. You'll have a chance, Dan, to share some of your coverage there. It's been a while since we've talked about this space, but I understand that T-Mobile and Sprint have been making headlines in the past several months, this whole ordeal. Those companies are the No. 3 and No. 4 names, respectively, among U.S. wireless providers. Before we dive into the recent news around their potential merger and how that's fallen through, I want to talk about some of the background for the two companies, and I think that will help once we get into the nitty gritty of the recent news, in terms of understanding some of their motivations and the various incentives that are at play here. Let's start with T-Mobile. The company, I think, is probably best known for two things -- its CEO, John Legere, and also its Un-carrier branding, which I think has been very successful for the company. Kline: And it's not just branding. When John Legere took over, and he's a very bombastic guy, I always likened him to a 1980s pro-wrestling manager. He's very in your face, he'll taunt you, he'll call out his opposition, he has nicknames. Sort of a fun version of what the president likes to do. So what they did with Un-carrier is, he looked at every consumer pain point in the mobile process. So the first big one was contracts. You'd be tied into this two-year contract, you would have a device subsidy, you wouldn't know what you were really paying for anything. They got rid of that. The more recent ones are having only unlimited data. Yes, I know there's caveats, they slow you down after 22 gigs, but that's 2% of the audience. For most people, completely unlimited data. And every few months, they come out with something new, and it's silly stuff. T-Mobile Tuesday is just like, this Tuesday I get a free Frosty at Wendy's. But last month, they came out with, ""We're giving all of our customers Netflix."" So they're really trying to find a way to be different, to be a customer first mobile company. And it's worked. T-Mobile has added over a million subscribers for 18 straight quarters. And as John Legere likes to say, they've had all the growth in the wireless space. Shen: Legere started his role at T-Mobile in late 2012. They rolled out the first Un-carrier Initiative 1.0, they called it at the time, not much later, I believe it was March of 2013. So in that time, as you mentioned, the company has seen some pretty strong results. I think customers and listeners will realize that a lot of the things that they enjoy now, maybe even take for granted when they look through their wireless bill, was often a byproduct of the competition coming from these various Un-carrier moves. Kline: T-Mobile has forced AT&T and Verizon, and to a lesser extent Sprint, because Sprint wasn't quite as evil as AT&T and Verizon were acting in some of their no-longer practices, but the big one was overages. It's hard to quantify how much we were paying in overages, because they function in two ways. There's the actual, ""I go over my data allotment and have to pay."" That was billions of dollars. But Legere would always talk about the person who bought a too-big plan, because they didn't want to worry about it, and that was perhaps tens of billions of dollars that was getting sucked out of consumers' pockets. So by being transparent and saying, ""We're not going to do those kind of things"" -- T-Mobile was No. 4 and sinking, and since 2013, now they're No. 3 and rising. And they've been picking up momentum pretty much every quarter. The challenge is, as Verizon, AT&T, everybody's prices have come down, everybody offers unlimited, Sprint is really cheap, the challenge is, how do you keep doing that when maybe a lot of those pain points are gone? Shen: Yeah. At the end of 2013, which was, again, the year the Un-carrier program started, T-Mobile had 46 million customers, they had a churn of about 1.7% per month. Now, as of the most recently reported quarter, that's Q3 for 2017, reported just October 23, they have 71 million customers, great growth there. Their churn is down to 1.2%, seeing very consistent progress with that core metric for this industry. Some other notable highlights, from that approximately four-year period, to note, under the leadership of Legere, they moved, as you said, from the No. 4 to the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier. Of course, that gap -- Kline: It's a huge gap. Shen: -- is a massive one. So it's really AT&T against Verizon at No. 2 and No. 1, respectively, and then T-Mobile and Sprint at No. 3 and No. 4, respectively. They've had 18 straight quarters of more than one million net customer additions, which I think you mentioned, Dan. They've had compound annual top line growth of almost 14% for that period, improving profitability. T-Mobile shares have gained over 200%, so stockholders are pretty happy with the Un-carrier. Let's turn our attention now to Sprint. What have been the big themes or drivers for this company in recent memory? Because they're not doing nearly as well. Kline: Sprint is doing better, but Sprint was a sinking ship. It was losing ground as T-Mobile was gaining ground, because it had no identity. It was just the carrier that's a little cheaper than AT&T and Verizon, but not quite as cheap as T-Mobile. Marcelo Claure, their CEO, who is willing to go toe-to-toe with John Legere, he sort of righted the ship, but the way he's done it is heavy discounting. So Sprint is almost always, at some point, the best deal. And when I say some point, I mean, maybe it's families this week, maybe it's individuals next week. They're not always the lowest across the board for every type of plan you would want. But they generally have some crazy deal that would be good for somebody. They do things like two iPhones for one. So they've returned to slight growth in terms of subscribers, but it's not necessarily sustainable, because a lot of their promotions sunset. So March 2018, you no longer pay $30 a month, now you pay $55. And it's so easy to move now, which makes the T-Mobile churn number even more impressive. It's no longer the days where moving was a big challenge and it was hard to get your number. Now, it's very easy. You could switch cellphone providers every three months if you wanted to, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. So Sprint is on better ground, but they haven't spent a lot of money on their network, which is a problem. They will argue that they're within 1% of the other networks, and that's not really what the data shows. Shen: In terms of the coverage and the network quality. Kline: Yeah. And the reality is, they're the No. 4 network, generally, on most of the accepted standards. There's all sorts of different data and different ways you can parse things, but it's pretty widely accepted that Sprint is the worst, and it's going to get worse as they don't spend money, which is part of why they might like to be for sale. Shen: And as of the most recent quarterly report, Sprint has added postpaid subscribers for nine straight quarters. They did see their highest postpaid additions in company history. So some positive marks, as you mentioned. They also cut a ton of costs year to date. I believe it's yielded savings of $750 million. Kline: It's price, as well, with postpaid. Boost Mobile tends to be the cheapest. So they might be cannibalizing their own customer base, because you can port your Sprint phone to a Boost Mobile phone with zero effort and pay less. Shen: The cost-cutting efforts are definitely a focus for management right now. They're improving their profitability, but at this point, that company has still reported negative earnings for several years running. And on the not so bright side, the stock is down about 30% year-to-date, and quite a bit today, last I checked before we came into the studio, because the negotiations for this T-Mobile-Sprint deal are officially over. The press release from both companies came out on Saturday. The stock in general has been seesawing between $3 to $10 per share, essentially, for the past five years. I feel like the cost-cutting and the slowly improving business, or the gradual turnaround that Claure is working on here, it's one part of the puzzle. As you mentioned earlier, the company needs to generate so much cash -- any company in this industry needs to generate so much cash each year to reinvest in the wireless network, to not only just match your competitors in terms of what service you offer, but then you have, for example, 5G networks on the horizon, people already starting to test the infrastructure for that. Kline: Buying spectrum. Shen: And that's just another demand in terms of resources that you have to satisfy. Kline: If you look at what Sprint is doing, they're cleaning up the asset for a sale, a merger, a partnership, whatever it ends up being. We'll talk about that later. But you're not going to make a deal with something that's bleeding customers, that's losing billions of dollars. So if you can take the loss to pretty much zero, and it was a relatively minor loss in the last quarter, and be putting the subscriber needle in the right direction, you're at least showing, whether it's a partner or a buyer or however it comes down, ""Hey, there's a bottom here. We're not going to go to zero."" And there was a while where it looked like every Sprint customer was just going to become a T-Mobile customer. Shen: We'll take a closer look at the deal negotiations between the two companies and how that panned out. We'll talk about that next. So now you have some high-level perspective of these two companies, where they are and where they've been the past couple of years. So we can talk about the deal that just wasn't meant to be. It's the second time now, right? So on Saturday, November 4, Sprint and T-Mobile pushed out the press releases announcing the end of their merger negotiations. Dan, I feel like on this show, we've talked several times about these long, drawn-out ordeals. We've talked about Viacom, their leadership battle, we've talked about the Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's merger being this long, drawn-out saga. And now, we have this last one here. Can you give us a little bit of an idea of how things progressed in the last few months, how they started up and how they ended? Kline: There are logical reasons for these companies to get together. You put their subscriber bases together, and it's about equal to either AT&T or Verizon. So it gives them scale. You can lay off a lot of customer service people, a lot of accountants. Shen: Redundant functions, yeah. Kline: You don't need two networks. There were also some major drawbacks. I didn't want this deal to happen, because I remember when Sprint bought Nextel, when Nextel was essentially No. 5 in the wireless space. Nextel used a different technology than Sprint. As Sprint and T-Mobile are not on the same network technologies. Your Sprint phone can not become a T-Mobile phone. That was the case with the Nextel phone and the Sprint phone. So you're buying something that's not super easy to integrate. It's not like they can just become Spree Mobile, and all of the sudden it's just one company. [laughs] I got one up on you there, we were talking about how this would be named before the show. Shen: Spree Mobile is pretty good. I was going to go with T-Sprint, but I like this more. Kline: There were a lot of operational challenges, but the reality on this is, the best deals are when one company wants out. The Cabela's management knew they weren't coming along with the deal. They were all going to cash out, make some money, go fishing or hunting or whatever it is Cabela's management would do. In this case, SoftBank (NASDAQOTH:SFTBF), which is the parent company of Sprint, wanted to maintain certain rights and control. They were going to give up the CEO post, John Legere would have that, but they still wanted more management than what they were bringing to the table in terms of valuation offered. That becomes a very dicey deal to make. Shen: To be clear, in terms of the parties that have an interest in these deal negotiations, on one side, with T-Mobile, their majority interest stake is held by Deutsche Telekom, about a 65% ownership stake, I believe. And on the opposite side of the negotiation table, you have Sprint, which is over 80% owned by SoftBank and the billionaire Masayoshi Son. He's been a big part of the direction, the vision for Sprint, these various efforts. He actually tried to have Sprint take over T-Mobile back in 2014 -- Kline: When it might have made sense for Sprint. They were still No. 3, they were the bigger company. Shen: And that deal fell through, because the indication, I believe, that they received from the regulatory body that would overlook and scrutinize the deal was, ""This is not going to happen."" Kline: They flat out said, ""We will not accept any deal that takes the U.S. market from four providers to three providers."" Shen: In this case, we have a new administration now, obviously, and I believe that both parties thought they had a situation where regulators might be more friendly to a deal of this nature. Whether that's the case, again, you're going from four to three major players -- Kline: I think the argument they were going to make is that Comcast and Charter are all somewhat in this, or going into this space, with their own wifi-based MVNO networks, which are networks that don't own their spectrum, they lease it from one of the remaining companies. Shen: Essentially piggybacking off of the companies that have actually developed the infrastructure. Kline: Yeah. And I think they were going to give caveats that they would license their spectrum to X amount of payers. They were going to argue that there were legitimately more choices for Americans than the three or four or whatever you want to call it. I don't know that that would have flown. But I do think the reality is, there were a lot of reasons this deal shouldn't happen, and once it wasn't quick, I think you knew it wasn't going to happen. Shen: Then, you mentioned this too, in terms of what the combined entity would look like, 130 million customers, pretty much on par with AT&T and Verizon. They'd have about $75 billion in annual revenue. Definitely a much more formidable player. Kline: The cost savings would be extraordinary. Shen: But the integrations, as you said, would not nearly be that simple or that seamless. And if you're a customer with either Sprint or T-Mobile and this deal had come together, it wouldn't have been so quick for you to see improvements in your service, and that just comes from the challenge of combining two huge national networks, but they're on different LTE technology. Kline: Because there are no contracts anymore, I think there's a very big risk, and I think we saw this with Frontier Communications, which spent $11 billion buying customers from Verizon, and when it didn't very quickly work well, they didn't get billed right, their service didn't work, their internet wasn't good, whatever it was, they just went, ""Oh, I'm going to go to Comcast."" It's easier to switch your wireless phone than it is to switch your cable service. No one has to come to your house. You can just walk into a Sprint store and they'll give you a bag to mail it back to T-Mobile. It's very simple. So you could have spent, whatever it is in terms of stock, billions and billions of dollars, to take Sprint's 50 million customers, it's a little bit more than that, but the 71 million at T-Mobile, and you could lose 10% in the first three months. And I think that's what would have happened. Everybody's prices are too close together. You would also have to deal with, the pricing structures are different at Sprint and T-Mobile. Are they all going to go to one? Are they going to stay two separate brands? That doesn't make sense from a pricing perspective. So to me, it always made more sense for either of these brands to partner with a cable company or someone else in an adjacent space. Shen: And we can get to that idea. You have these two companies, they tried coming together in 2014. At the time, Sprint was the larger player, in more of the power position. Now, the tables have turned, and T-Mobile has more of the leverage. When it comes down to it, SoftBank, what they had in mind for a deal like this, they didn't want to give up too much control of the future of Spree Mobile, as you called it. Kline: It's also the assets. Masayoshi Son has been spending hundreds of billions of dollars, I forget the exact amount in his tech fund, but it's at least $100 billion. And all of the spectrum assets that Sprint owns, he doesn't want to give up control over, because maybe he'll use it to launch a national over the top cable service. I mean, I'm just making that up, but he wants to be able to pick the company clean for parts. It's not necessarily about the wireless subscribers or that business. I think he was perfectly happy to let John Legere decide what the commercials and the pricing were going to be. It's all the future integration of, does T-Mint or Spree Mobile or whatever we're going to call them, do they merge with Comcast? I think those are the things he wasn't willing to let go. And I think John Legere has earned the right to say, ""I don't want to have a boss anymore."" And that was going to be a sticking point. Shen: So differences in terms of what the controlling stake would look like, the ownership between the two companies and their shareholders and this combined entity. And then, also coming down to valuation as well, Sprint's stock took quite a hit in September. I think it went down about 20%. And then, depending on the timing of the deal, it could be that Sprint shareholders didn't see any kind of premium in the merger. Kline: It's all speculation, because they haven't talked about this, but there have been a lot of reports saying they weren't offering a premium, and it was about efficiency and unlocking value. That's a tough one to sell. But Sprint didn't help itself by, before this negotiation started, they had an exclusive negotiating period with Charter and Comcast about a partnership, a merger. They never exactly announced what it was. But it became pretty clear that there weren't two suitors. So T-Mobile did not have to say, ""We'll pay you 40% more,"" because otherwise, you're going to turn around and, I don't know, McDonald's is going to buy you and use it for mobile ordering. And we'll talk about this soon, there could be somebody out there, but the reason prices drive up in these kinds of deals is, ""If you don't buy us, Amazon will."" And Sprint is a complicated asset. Shen: Some other suitor, sure. So let's wrap up our discussion. The deal is no longer happening, off the table as far as we know. These two companies are going to continue to make their investments, operate independently. Let's look at Sprint first. What do you think lies ahead that investors and listeners should be following for this company? Kline: Well, it won't be McDonald's. [laughs] And, Sprintpotle is also not on the table. Sprint, in my opinion, is going to be sold to a cable company. I think it makes a lot of sense if you're already in the subscription business, you already have that infrastructure for this to be another bundle. I don't think Comcast actually wants to offer a leased service, mostly on wifi, vaguely not that good, nobody wants its phone service. Shen: Which they recently had with Xfinity Mobile. Kline: Yeah. And did it, and Altice has now just signed a deal this week to do it using Sprint's lines. I think they're going to want to have a service they can sell nationally. And it may not be a merger, it may be some sort of exclusive partnership with an investment to take some of the pressure off. But they also have all of the spectrum assets, some of which are saleable if they don't need them. So I think that's going to make the most sense, and you just have to see how that industry is going to shake out. Are Charter and Comcast going to merge? Shen: Do you see it as, Sprint is grooming itself for another suitor to come in? Kline: Yeah, I think Sprint has to continue to show -- even if they can eke out a profit, it's a lot easier to buy something that's revenue-neutral than buy something that's revenue-negative. If you're going to sell this to Charter shareholders or Comcast shareholders or whoever it is, I think Sprint could do more to cut costs. They could be more of a position to integrate quickly. And that's probably going to mean a lot of discounting, good for consumers, and a lot of barebones staffing, not so good for consumers. Shen: Let's look at T-Mobile, then. They're still doing incredibly well, claiming a lot of the growth that this industry is seeing overall, no longer combining with Sprint. What are the big next steps for them? Keep going with the Un-carrier initiatives? It seems to be getting harder and harder for them to set themselves apart with that. Kline: Deutsche Telekom would probably rather not have to keep investing. It's spent like $40 billion in the last six years, or something like that. Shen: In terms of the network for T-Mobile. Kline: In terms of the network and building out capacity. And that's not going to change with 5G and all the other things. So, I think they're open to a deal. I think there's also the possibility that someone like an Altice, a company that's European-based or one of the companies in other parts of the world, that there might be some synergy in either merging with T-Mobile or joint operating, and having a more global company. Again, standards and technology become a challenge there. But I think T-Mobile is in a position where they can sit back, and as long as John Legere doesn't retire, they're in a very good position to just wait for the best deal, see if Amazon or Apple wants to buy them. Shen: OK. So for both instances, you see some form of consolidation or M&A deal being potential things to watch. Kline: I don't think it has to be -- Shen: Because, my take was more so for Sprint, for sure. Kline: The Sprint original deal they talked about was Comcast and Charter was an investment plus, essentially, becoming their wireless company. I think that type of deal is actually more logical for T-Mobile, for a healthy company to say, ""Now we're going to offer service in Mexico through Wal-Mart,"" those types of deals, I think, make more sense with a healthy company than they do with an ailing company. But there is so much negative to owning Sprint that there might be big players like Comcast more willing to have it be an investment in a partnership, rather than an outright purchase. Shen: Alright. That wraps up our discussion for this deal. We'll continue to track the progress for Sprint's turnaround, for how T-Mobile decides to proceed with their next Un-carrier initiative, for example, as these two companies make those announcements in due time.

    The Sprint and T-Mobile Merger Falls Apart for a Second Time -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Sprint (NYSE:S), and AT&T (NYSE:T) are three of the big names in the U.S. wireless industry. In recent years, Sprint has been putting pressure on the economics of the two giants -- Verizon and AT&T -- in the form of aggressive pricing and other competitive moves like early adoption of equipment installment plans and smartphone leases. What's more, while AT&T and Verizon are investing in areas outside of their core wireless businesses, Sprint is focused exclusively on wireless. Investors may be wondering whether Sprint makes a better buy than a stalwart like AT&T or Verizon. Or if Verizon and AT&T are better positioned, which of them is best among the three wireless carriers. Let's examine each one a bit more closely to determine which stock is the best buy. Image source: Verizon. Sprint is a big fan of pointing out that the gap between its network coverage and Verizon's has gotten much narrower in recent years. That said, Verizon still consistently earns the highest grades in third-party network quality tests. But even its strong network hasn't stopped it from feeling pricing pressure. It saw 11 straight quarters of declining service revenue before things started turning around last quarter. It was practically forced to start offering an unlimited data plan. Then it quickly moved to offering two tiers of unlimited data to help control its cost of services and compete on price. All of its efforts have paid off. In the first two full quarters since introducing its unlimited plan, Verizon has added over 200,000 postpaid phone subscribers after several quarters of disappointing net additions (and losses). Service revenue is starting to turn around, as management forecast, and subscriber churn levels remain the lowest in the industry. Verizon has taken steps to expand beyond wireless with its digital media business, Oath. It also has a wireline business providing internet, video, and landline service. Still, it hasn't resorted to measures as drastic as AT&T, which has made big acquisitions in the form of DirecTV and Time Warner in recent years. It's still strapped with a boatload of debt from its buyout of a minority stake in Verizon Wireless in 2014. Image source: Sprint. With a wireless network that consistently ranks at the bottom of third-party measurement surveys, Sprint has resorted to aggressive pricing to win over customers. This summer, for example, it started offering free service to new customers, particularly targeting Verizon subscribers. For its efforts, Sprint has started to see new customers come on board. The company's share of gross subscriber additions reached an all-time high last quarter, according to management. Its 367,000 net postpaid phone subscriber additions still fall short of Verizon's, though. What's more, unlike Verizon or AT&T, Sprint is losing postpaid connected device subscribers. Sprint's aggressive pricing is also putting pressure on its service revenue. Through the first half of fiscal 2018, postpaid service revenue is down 7%. That's worse than Verizon, which has notably struggled to sustain its service revenue. Image source: AT&T. AT&T's acquisition of DirecTV and its pending acquisition of Time Warner have put it in a position to offer an aggressively priced entertainment bundle with its wireless service. Unlimited plan subscribers get free HBO and $25 off one of AT&T's video services. The plan hasn't stopped it from losing postpaid phone subscribers, which declined another 97,000 last quarter. Overall, service revenue fell 2.8% year over year last quarter, and average revenue per postpaid subscriber fell 3.5%. Meanwhile, AT&T is bleeding video subscribers as well. The company lost 89,000 video subscribers, with nearly 300,000 U-Verse and DirecTV subscribers replaced by DirecTV Now subscribers -- AT&T's streaming video service. That said, AT&T's been able to continue raising prices for its linear TV services to maintain slight revenue growth. Sprint doesn't have a competitive advantage beyond lower pricing. If the company continues to rely on undercutting AT&T and Verizon to win customers, it will be difficult for it to generate enough cashflow to build out its network and provide a more competitive service. It's currently about break-even on a free-cash-flow basis. Comparatively, Verizon and AT&T are cash-flow giants. Verizon generated $4.7 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, and AT&T produced $16.5 billion. Verizon's free cash flow was negatively impacted by a $3.2 billion tax bill on the sale of some of its wireline assets and the decision to shift to an asset-backed bond to pull forward revenue from its equipment installment plans. Adjusting for those factors, Verizon's cash flow is comparable to AT&T's. The free cash flows of Verizon and AT&T support big dividend yields of 4.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Perhaps the best valuation metric for comparing the wireless carriers is EV to EBITDA. Here's how the three stack up. Company EV to EBITDA Multiple Verizon 6.9 AT&T 6.5 Sprint 5.5 Table source: Yahoo! Finance. Investors should note that Sprint's EBITDA is comparably higher due to the fact that it uses device leasing. Instead of expensing devices, Sprint capitalizes them and then amortizes them over time. This results in a higher EBITDA than if devices showed up in cost of goods sold, like they do with Verizon and AT&T. As such, Sprint's lower EV-to-EBITDA multiple isn't very impressive. Verizon is actually growing its subscriber base and isn't bogged down with a declining pay-TV business. As such, it deserves a slight premium to AT&T. On the other hand, AT&T offers a higher dividend yield, supported by massive free cash flow. For investors looking for more exposure to the U.S. wireless industry, Verizon is the best buy. If you're comfortable with lots of exposure to the declining pay-TV market, AT&T presents better value. I'd stay away from Sprint, though. ","

Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) reported solid third-quarter 2017 results after the market closed on Wednesday. Shares have returned 31.9% in 2017 through Wednesday, versus the S&P 500's 17.1%. Here's how the quarter worked out for the data center operator and global interconnection specialist that's organized as a real estate investment trust (REIT). Metric Q3 2017 Q3 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue Operating income $224.9 million $170.0 million Net income $79.9 million $51.5 million 55% Earnings per share (EPS) $1.02 $0.72 Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)* $391.3 million $284.2 million AFFO per share $4.97 $3.95 Data source: Equinix. *AFFO is a closely watched metric for companies organized as REITs, as it's a driver of payouts to shareholders. It's akin to ""earnings"" for REITs. Reported revenue got a boost from foreign exchange and includes $137 million of revenue from the acquisition of 29 Verizon data centers, which was completed last quarter. On a normalized and constant currency basis, revenue increased 10% year over year -- still quite solid -- and 8% from the previous quarter. Equinix's revenue came in above its guidance range of $1,133 million to $1,141 million. The company doesn't provide a quarterly AFFO outlook. Image source: Getty Images. Here's what CEO Steve Smith had to say in the press release about the quarter: Equinix had a strong third quarter as customers continue to adopt interconnection oriented architectures as the preferred platform for their shift to digital. Robust demand is driving higher utilization levels, and we are investing in support of this momentum with expansions, both organically and through strategic acquisitions, to deliver even greater value to customers through our global platform. As customers embrace hybrid and multicloud as the IT architecture of choice, our interconnection strength is resonating, and Equinix continues to outpace market growth and gain market share. Equinix increased its full-year 2017 guidance. The company said the $37 million (at midpoint) guidance raise is due to better-than-expected operating performance of $8 million in the third quarter, additional foreign currency benefit of $16 million when compared to the prior guidance, and $13 million in revenue from two acquisitions it made early in the fourth quarter. (Acquisitions were Itconic, which has five data centers in Spain and Portugal and a second data center in Istanbul.)

Matthew Cochrane,11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Corning Inc. (NYSE:GLW) is enjoying a very good year. While its stock price is up nearly 30% year to date, nearly doubling the S&P 500's return, its impressive run looks to continue for some time yet, judging by its recently reported third-quarter results. While its core sales and core EPS growth were modest on the surface, at 6% and 2%, respectively, closer inspection reveals a lot for Corning shareholders to be excited about. The market seemed to like the quarter, too, as the company's stock price jumped more than 6% the day it reported. We don't have to look far to see why investors were so impressed. Corning's optical communications division -- which manufactures optical fiber and provides connectivity solutions for some of the world's largest telecom networks and cable providers -- showed strong year-over-year core earnings growth of 13% and this division is Corning's second-largest income-earning division. (""Core"" numbers are management's favored adjusted financial metrics that it believes best express how the company is performing. For instance, it excludes the impact that foreign exchange rates had on the quarter's numbers.) Better yet, management stated that the earnings for this division would have been even higher if it hadn't been reinvesting so much back into the business to increase manufacturing capacity. While Corning's specialty materials division, the home of Gorilla Glass, saw even stronger sales and earnings growth, its optical communications business segment is where Corning might be building a nearly unbreachable moat against competitors. Corning is now the lowest-cost producer of optical fiber and offers a number of award-winning innovations in the market. Image source: Corning Inc. In the company's recent quarterly press release, it announced that it had now produced 1 billion kilometers of optical fiber. That's a whole lot! In fact, according to the company, that's ""one-third of the optical fiber ever produced in the history of the world."" This accomplishment comes on the heels of a major deal with Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) whereby the telecom carrier announced that it will buy more than $1.05 billion of optical fiber over the next three years from Corning. In the company's conference call, Corning CEO Wendell Weeks talked not only about why even better things are still ahead. According to the transcript from S&P Global Market Intelligence, he said: Our dedicated employees have helped us become the world's largest manufacturer of optical fiber, the world's lowest-cost provider, and the home to some of the most precise manufacturing operations of any kind, anywhere in the world. ... We believe that the opportunities ahead of us are much greater than those that are behind us. To capture these opportunities, we're investing to expand capacity, to innovate and to increase our market access. ... These investments are paying off. We are growing at more than twice the rate of the telecommunications industry ... We're well on our way to more than 15% sales growth for 2017, which keeps us on track to achieve $5 billion in optical sales by 2020. That Corning is the lowest-cost producer of optical fiber gives it an impressive economic moat against its competitors. Beyond that, the company also offers a variety of innovative solutions. For instance, the company's EDGE8 solution is a preterminated optical cabling system designed specifically for data centers. EDGE8 allows data center operators to maximize their assets without the need for conversion modules, leading to lower costs. It also provides a straightforward path for data centers to upgrade to 40G, 100G, or 400G ethernet. Corning showed strength in its optical communication division in its recently reported third quarter. Data source: Corning Inc. 2017 Q3 2017 earnings. Some might counter that while Corning's optical communications segment's results were impressive, the company still only managed to increase earnings by 2% companywide. However, this argument misses the larger point: Corning has transformed itself from a cyclical industrial company dependent on commodity pricing to an enterprise with incredible technical prowess and proprietary know-how in diverse areas. The company's largest income-generating division, display technologies, accounted for 52% of the company's core earnings this quarter. This business segment largely manufactures specialized glass substrates used as a key component in liquid crystal displays for devices such as smartphones, computer monitors, and large-screen televisions. Earnings in this business segment are notoriously cyclical and are often based on glass prices, a factor far outside Corning's control. This quarter, core earnings in this department fell 16% year over year. In years past, that would have tanked Corning's quarter. While display technologies still comprises slightly more than half of Corning's earnings, it's not nearly as big, percentage-wise, as it was previously. That core earnings in this division could have fallen by so much while the company still eked out a small core earnings gain shows just how far Corning has come in increasing its other streams of revenue. For shareholders, there's a lot to like not only about Corning's latest quarter, but its incredible transformation as a company. Not the least of things to like is Corning's growing moat in optical fiber manufacturing. With innovative solutions and lowest-cost production capabilities, Corning expects to continue to grow this division at twice the rate of the telecommunications industry and is projecting at least $5 billion in sales in this segment by 2020. Optical communications had about $3 billion in net sales in 2016.  Corning is setting itself up for long-term success. ","

"Jeremy Bowman, Danny Vena, and Daniel Miller",11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Retirees count on safe, dividend-paying stocks for regular income and to protect their wealth. Though they may not necessarily be the most exciting stocks on the market, these types of investments are just what people in their golden years need to avoid risk and reap the rewards of their portfolios. While the market's high valuation has made it harder to find high dividend yields, there are still some good opportunities in the market. Below, three of our analysts discuss their picks for high-yield safe stocks, including National Retail Properties (NYSE:NNN), Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM), and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). Image source: Getty Images. Danny Vena (National Retail Properties): A real estate investment trust (REIT) can be a great addition to a retirement portfolio. These investment vehicles receive special tax treatment, avoiding typical corporate taxes, and in return are required to maintain dividend payout ratios of at least 90%. As a result, REITs typically produce higher yields than many other dividend stocks. National Retail Properties invests in single-tenant net leased retail properties, which requires its tenants to pay for the operating expenses of their locations, including taxes, maintenance, and insurance. With fewer expenses, the company has more profits to return to shareholders. What makes National Retail Properties even more compelling is the composition of its portfolio. You might be concerned about the trend away from brick-and-mortar retail, as more and more shoppers make purchases online. This company avoids shopping centers and strip malls, and its tenants typically offer services that can't be duplicated online, like restaurants, convenience stores, automotive service centers, and fitness centers. National Retail Properties has initial lease terms of between 15 and 20 years, with contractual rent increases built into each lease. This provides reliable growth for its portfolio, which consists of 2,675 properties, with over 400 tenants in 48 states. Its strategy results in higher renewal rates and consistently high occupancy rates, currently at 99.3%. Over the last 25 years the company has produced an average total return of 13.5%. National Retail Properties has increased its dividend in each of the last 28 consecutive years, and is currently yielding 4.5%. Daniel Miller (Iron Mountain): Ironically, retirees looking for a safe investment won't need to look much further than a company built to protect information. Iron Mountain, which received IRS approval to operate as a REIT in 2014, is a global leader in record storage. In fact, it provides its services to roughly 94% of Fortune 1,000 companies, and has more than 1,400 facilities dedicated to storing information for record-intensive industries -- think healthcare, law, and finance-type industries. While Iron Mountain might be a new name to many investors, it's a trusted name in data management and offers consumers a compelling option to reduce the costs and risks of storing and protecting information assets. It's a safe investment due in part to its high retention of customers, low turnover and low maintenance capital expenditures. Going forward, management plans to grow the business by expanding into emerging markets as they begin requiring more data management, as well as adjacent businesses such as art storage. There will always be global demand for secure data management options, and what's even better for retirees looking for stable income is that REITs are required by law to maintain dividend payout ratios of at least 90%. Currently Iron Mountain's dividend yield sits at 5.8%, making it a great option for investors seeking income. Jeremy Bowman (Verizon Communications): There may be no safer sector than telecom, a highly regulated oligopoly with a captive market, and no telecom company is more dominant than Verizon.  The nation's biggest wireless provider offers investors a defensive stock with a 4.8% dividend yield and a low P/E of just 12.3. As a provider of necessary services like phone and data, Verizon will fare considerably better than the broad market in a recession, and the company has plenty of room to raise its dividend as its payout ratio is a reasonable 59%. The company has also increased its dividends for 11 years in a row. While Verizon has struggled to grow earnings in a competitive market, the company continues to add subscribers, with 603,000 additions in the most recent quarter, and is seeing growth in Fios and its new media business Oath, which came from the acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo. As consolidation continues in the telecom and media industries Verizion should benefit, and could add other assets to its media business. The proliferation of wearables like smartwatches should also help grow revenue over the coming years. With a leading position in its industry, a defensive business model, and a strong and growing dividend, Verizon is great choice for retirees in search of safety. ","

Retirement is when most people are assumed to be living on a ""fixed income."" Well, yes, Social Security checks can remain fixed for a few years, though they do rise over time to keep up with inflation. Some other income sources, such as bonds, might also offer fixed income. Fortunately, though, there are plenty of ways that you can increase your retirement income, to make it less fixed. You can even employ a Social Security strategy or two to make your future checks bigger. Image source: Getty Images. Here are eight ways to increase your retirement income. This is probably not the kind of tip you wanted to see, but it's a powerful one. If you can work a few more years than you originally planned to, there are multiple benefits: Your nest egg can grow while you put off starting to tap it -- and it will have to support you for fewer years. You might enjoy your employer-sponsored health insurance for a few more years, too, perhaps also while collecting a few more years' worth of matching funds in your 401(k). The table below shows what a difference an extra year or two can make in your investing -- if you're socking away $10,000 annually and it's growing by an annual average of 8%: Growing at 8% For: $10,000 Invested Annually 15 years $293,243 16 years $327,502 17 years $364,502 18 years $404,463 19 years $447,620 20 years $494,229 21 years $544,568 22 years $598,933 23 years $657,648 24 years $721,059 25 years $789,544 26 years $863,508 27 years $943,388 28 years $1.0 million 29 years $1.1 million 30 years $1.2 million Data source: author. Instead of working longer, or in addition to doing so, you might also ease into retirement by working a little in your first few years of retirement. Working just 12 hours per week at $10 per hour will generate about $500 per month. A part-time job can also give your days more structure and opportunities for socializing. Many retirees find themselves restless and a bit lonely in retirement, and a low-stress job on the side can be quite helpful. Be aware, though, that if you're planning to start collecting Social Security benefits before your full retirement age, which is 66 or 67 for most of us, and you want to work some then, too, your benefits may be reduced. As the Social Security Administration explains: ""If you're younger than full retirement age during all of 2017, we must deduct $1 from your benefits for each $2 you earn above $16,920."" The year you reach your full retirement age, the earning limit jumps to $44,880, and the penalty decreases to $1 withheld for every $3 earned above the limit. Fortunately, though, the money withheld isn't lost. Instead, it's factored into the benefit checks you receive later, which end up increased. The health insurance coverage you choose can have an effect on how much you spend out of pocket on healthcare in retirement. (This is a big deal: According to Fidelity Investments, a 65-year-old couple retiring today will spend, on average, a total of $275,000 out of pocket on healthcare.) Once you're 65, you qualify for Medicare -- and in order to avoid paying a penalty premium every year, you need to not be late signing up. Know that you can choose between original Medicare (Part A and Part B, often with Part D and/or supplemental plans) and Medicare Advantage plans. There are pros and cons to each. For example, original Medicare is accepted across the country by thousands of doctors, whereas Medicare Advantage plans tend to be based in a region, offering access to a certain network of doctors. Medicare Advantage premiums can be lower, plus the plans feature out-of-pocket spending caps. Image source: Getty Images. The more you contribute to tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s, the more money you'll have in retirement. There are two main kinds of IRA -- the Roth IRA and the traditional IRA and for both in 2017, the contribution limit is $5,500 for most people and $6,500 for those 50 and older. (Limits are occasionally increased, to keep up with inflation.) That might not seem like a lot of money, but it's quite powerful if it can grow for many years. The table below shows how much money you can accumulate with annual $5,500 contributions at different average annual rates of growth: Growing For: Growing at 8% Growing at 10% Growing at 12% 15 years $161,284 $192,224 $229,643 20 years $271,826 $346,514 $443,843 25 years $434,239 $595,000 $821,337 30 years $672,900 $995,189 $1.5 million Data source: author. A 401(k) has even more generous contribution limits -- for 2017 it's $18,000 and in 2018 it's 18.500 -- plus an additional $6,000 is allowed in both years for those 50 or older. Give particular consideration to Roth IRAs and increasingly available Roth 401(k)s, as they let you withdraw money in retirement tax-free! Having a portfolio of stocks in retirement means you can sell shares for income at any time. But if you're holding dividend-paying stocks, you can collect income without having to sell any shares! For example, a $300,000 portfolio with an overall average yield of 4% will generate about $12,000 per year -- a solid $1,000 per month. Dividend income isn't guaranteed, but if you spread your money across a bunch of healthy and growing companies, you'll likely receive regular -- and growing -- payments. Here are a few well-regarded stocks with significant dividend yields: Stock Recent Dividend Yield National Grid 6.2% AT&T 5.8% Verizon 4.9% Pfizer 3.7% AbbVie 3.1% Data source: Yahoo! Financial. A dividend-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) can serve you well, too, offering instant diversification. The iShares Select Dividend ETF, for example, recently yielded about 3%. Preferred stock is another way to go. The iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF recently yielded 5.7%. Image source: Getty Images. Another way to boost your retirement income is to get it from the equity in your home -- via a reverse mortgage. A lender will provide (often tax-free) income during your retirement, and the loan doesn't have to be paid back until you no longer live in your home -- such as when you move into a nursing home or die. It has some drawbacks, though, such as requiring your heirs to sell the home unless they can afford to pay off the loan. Still, if you need additional income in retirement and no one is counting on inheriting your home, it can be a solid solution. You can increase your retirement income by spending less of it on home-related expenses. If you downsize and move to a smaller home -- or you move to a region with lower taxes or a lower cost of living -- you can end up spending less on taxes, insurance, home maintenance, utilities, landscaping, and so on. The median home value in California, for example, was recently about $386,000, but it was only $248,000 in Colorado and only $140,000 in South Carolina. Image source: Getty Images. Finally, you can boost your retirement income by being savvy about strategies that can increase your Social Security income. For starters, you can increase or decrease your benefits by starting to collect Social Security earlier or later than your ""full"" retirement age, which is 66 or 67 for most of us. If you're married, you can maximize your benefits by coordinating with your spouse when you each start collecting. If you and your spouse have very different earnings records, for example, you might start collecting the benefits of the spouse with the lower lifetime earnings record on time or as early as age 62, while delaying starting to collect the benefits of the higher-earning spouse. That way, you both get to enjoy some income earlier, and when the higher earner hits 70, you can collect their extra-large checks. Also, should that higher-earning spouse die first, the spouse with the smaller earnings history can collect those bigger benefit checks as survivor benefits instead of their own smaller checks. If you've figured out how much money you'll need in retirement and you're worried about how you'll generate the income you'll need, consider some of the strategies above. They can put hundreds or even thousands of dollars more in your pocket each year. ","

Mayer resigned in June after its acquisition by Verizon closed. She had been in the job for about five years. Mayer hadn’t wanted to testify, declining multiple requests. She appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday after US lawmakers subpoenaed her late last month, according to The Hill. A spokesperson for Mayer contested this version of events to The Hill, saying she was testifying voluntarily. On Wednesday, Mayer was seated in the center of the five-member panel of executives who appeared to testify on data breaches, which also included Richard Smith, the former Equifax CEO who “retired” shortly after the company disclosed a data breach that compromised the personal information of 143 million Americans. US lawmakers have grown increasingly skeptical of the power and intimate user details amassed by big technology companies. Representatives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter answered questions before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week as part of the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. That skepticism was on display as the Senate Commerce Committee questioned Mayer, with a key exchange occurring between her and senator Bill Nelson. Nelson: At this point, I’m wondering that there’s no such thing as data security. When you think of a sophisticated state actor such as China or Russia, your companies can’t stand up against them. The only person or institution that can stand up against them is the National Security Agency. And what we’re going to see in the future for not only personally identifiable information but also the state secrets of our country, many of which are critical infrastructure as represented by companies such as yours, there’s going to have to be a cooperation between the most sophisticated player in the United States, which is the NSA, and you all. Otherwise we, Americans, are not going to have any more privacy. And if we don’t do something, and if you all don’t do something to change this, we’re going to be right back here, on additional hearings, coming up on this same topic. Now Ms. Mayer, what do you think? You had a sophisticated state actor coming after you. How do you really think that you could have protected yourself? Mayer: Even robust defense and processes are not sufficient to protect against a state sponsored attack, especially one that’s extremely sophisticated and persistent. We at Yahoo cooperated with law enforcement and brought these breaches and intrusions to the attention of law enforcement, swiftly each time they were detected. And the DOJ and FBI were of great assistance to the company in identifying the perpetrators and bringing them to justice. Nelson: But that’s an admission that you’re not protected against a state actor. A few minutes later, speaking to an executive from Yahoo parent Verizon, Nelson added that protecting consumer privacy was “going to take an attitude change among companies such as yours.” ",Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer was grilled by a senate committee over its massive data breach — Quartz
John D. McKinnon,11092017,MarketWatch,11022017,"Published: Nov 7, 2017 7:22 p.m. ET Mayer to appear Wednesday in data-breach hearing By WASHINGTON — A Senate committee moved last month to force former Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer to testify in a hearing Wednesday about corporate data breaches, after she initially declined lawmakers’ invitation. The Senate Commerce Committee’s authorization of the subpoena, an unusual move, underscores lawmakers’ growing concern over data breaches. It also highlights the potential stakes for Mayer, once one of the nation’s most celebrated CEOs, in testifying about Yahoo’s massive data breaches and subsequent stumbles in disclosing them. The committee authorized its subpoena late last month after Mayer declined the panel’s invitation to testify voluntarily, according to committee aides. A committee spokesman and a representative for Mayer said Tuesday that she would testify at Wednesday’s hearing.

,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer apologized on Wednesday for two massive data breaches at the internet company, blaming Russian agents for at least one of them, at a hearing on the growing number of cyber attacks on major U.S. companies. “Unfortunately, while all our measures helped Yahoo successfully defend against the barrage of attacks by both private and state-sponsored hackers, Russian agents intruded on our systems and stole our users’ data.” Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless operator, acquired most of Yahoo Inc’s assets in June, the same month Mayer stepped down. Verizon disclosed last month that a 2013 Yahoo data breach affected all 3 billion of its accounts, compared with an estimate of more than 1 billion disclosed in December. In March, federal prosecutors charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers with masterminding a 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts, the first time the U.S. government has criminally charged Russian spies for cyber crimes. Those charges came amid controversy relating to alleged Kremlin-backed hacking of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible links between Russian figures and associates of President Donald Trump. Russia has denied trying to influence the U.S. election in any way. Special Agent Jack Bennett of the FBI’s San Francisco Division said in March the 2013 breach was unrelated and that an investigation of the larger incident was continuing. Mayer later said under questioning that she did not know if Russians were responsible for the 2013 breach, but earlier spoke of state-sponsored attacks. Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, asked Mayer on Wednesday why it took three years to identify the data breach or properly gauge its size. Mayer said Yahoo has not been able to identify how the 2013 intrusion occurred and that the company did not learn of the incident until the U.S. government presented data to Yahoo in November 2016. She said even “robust” defenses are not enough to defend against state-sponsored attacks and compared the fight with hackers to an “arms race.” Yahoo required users to change passwords and took new steps to make data more secure, Mayer said. “We now know that Russian intelligence officers and state-sponsored hackers were responsible for highly complex and sophisticated attacks on Yahoo’s systems,” Mayer said. She said “really aggressive” pursuit of hackers was needed to discourage the efforts, and that even the most well-defended companies “could fall victim to these crimes.” The current and former chief executives of credit bureau Equifax, which disclosed in September that a data breach affected as many as 145.5 million U.S. consumers, said they did not know who was responsible for the attack. Senator Bill Nelson said “only stiffer enforcement and stringent penalties will help incentivize companies to properly safeguard consumer information.” Thune told reporters after the hearing the Equifax data breach had created “additional momentum” for Congress to approve legislation. He said Mayer’s testimony was “important in shaping our future reactions.” The Senate Commerce Committee took the unusual step of subpoenaing Mayer to testify on Oct. 25 after a representative for Mayer declined multiple requests for her voluntarily testimony. A representative for Mayer said on Tuesday she was appearing voluntarily. ","

 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"Supported by Sprint and T-Mobile said on Saturday that they had ended merger talks, marking the second time in three years that the two failed to reach a deal to create a stronger competitor to Verizon and AT&T. The announcement represents a setback to Sprint, T-Mobile and their majority shareholders — Sprint is owned by the Japanese technology giant SoftBank and T-Mobile by Deutsche Telekom of Germany — in their efforts to create a stronger third-place competitor in the American wireless market. But unlike three years ago, when Sprint and T-Mobile called off their last round of merger discussions because of strong opposition from the Barack Obama administration, this time the culprit was control. The final blow to the latest round of talks came Saturday night in Tokyo, when Tim Höttges, the chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, met at the Tokyo home of SoftBank’s founder, Masayoshi Son, according to a person briefed on the matter. There, Mr. Höttges delivered to Mr. Son and Sprint’s chief executive, Marcelo Claure, new terms for a merger of the American companies. Mr. Son and Mr. Claure ultimately rejected the plan because it did not give SoftBank and Sprint enough control over the combined entity, people briefed on the discussions said. Choosing to abandon the deal talks means that Sprint and T-Mobile must now continue on their own paths to challenging their much bigger and better-financed rivals. For consumers, that probably signals a prolonging of a price war among the four wireless providers — one that analysts have said appears unsustainable for the smaller carriers in the long run. In a joint statement, Sprint and T-Mobile said that they could not come to “mutually agreeable terms” for a combination. “We have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile’s shareholders compared to our outstanding stand-alone performance and track record,” John Legere, T-Mobile’s chief executive, said in the statement. Mr. Claure of Sprint added in the statement, “We have agreed that it is best to move forward on our own.” People briefed on the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly, said that a deal always hinged on SoftBank’s comfort with taking a minority stake in the combined business. Deutsche Telekom was expected to be the biggest shareholder of the merged company, given that T-Mobile is the bigger business by market value. T-Mobile’s market capitalization as of Friday’s close was $48.5 billion, while Sprint’s was $26.7 billion. Though the two had been in on-again, off-again talks for months, they appeared to be making progress, with an eye on striking a deal before Thanksgiving. But at a SoftBank board meeting on Friday, several directors of the Japanese company expressed reservations about giving up control of a major telecom service provider, according to one of the people briefed on the matter. Shares in both companies fell last week after Nikkei Asian Review, a Japanese business publication, reported that SoftBank intended to walk away from the transaction. But Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile planned to make one last offer to SoftBank and Sprint. The stakes for Sprint and T-Mobile are perhaps higher now than they were in the summer of 2014, when the two last pursued a merger. While both have waged a price war against their bigger competitors, drawing new customers in the process, few in the industry believe that the Sprint and T-Mobile can sustain the costs of a drawn-out war against better-capitalized opponents. Walking away from a merger with T-Mobile will provide the biggest test yet of Mr. Son’s ability to turn around Sprint after more than a decade of trouble. The billionaire led SoftBank’s takeover of the troubled American telecom in 2012, paying nearly $22 billion for a majority stake. At the time, Mr. Son argued that he could take on Verizon and AT&T — but those ambitions hinged on ultimately combining his new telecom with T-Mobile. Then, Sprint was seen as the stronger company and in position to own a bigger share of the combined business. Three years later, however, T-Mobile has become the better performer, its brash cost-cutting campaign forced Verizon and AT&T into a tough price war. Sprint has largely lagged behind, though analysts praised its third-quarter financial performance as showing signs of promise. Putting the two companies together would have created a business with more scale — and more financial capability to pay for both network upgrades and discounts for service plans. Sprint, in particular, was seen as bearing a bigger financial burden, carrying $34.2 billion in long-term debt on its books as of Sept. 30, while having posted annual losses for years. T-Mobile, while reporting $27.7 billion in long-term debt as of Sept. 30, has been profitable every year since 2013. Combining the two telecom providers would have helped their majority shareholders as well. SoftBank has faced concerns from investors about how it would manage Sprint’s debt load, while Deutsche Telekom has been concerned about the fate of its best-performing business asset. Among the most prominent advocates of a merger of the two companies was Mr. Son of SoftBank. “Three is a real fight, a real competition,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview in September. Both companies had been hoping that, unlike in 2014, a merger of the two would be looked upon more favorably this time around. The Obama administration had strongly hinted that it would fight to oppose a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, arguing that consolidation would hurt consumers. By contrast, the deal makers at both companies said that they believed the Trump administration would let a deal take place. Now, Sprint and T-Mobile will be left on their own to battle Verizon and AT&T — and each other. Executives from both companies appeared ready to wage that fight. “We are determined to continue our efforts to change the wireless industry and compete fiercely,” Mr. Claure said in the joint statement. “We look forward to continuing to take the fight to the duopoly and newly emerging competitors.” And Mr. Legere wrote in a tweet, “We’ve been changing this industry for good for the past 5 years and #WeWontStop!” Advertisement ",Sprint and T-Mobile End Merger Discussions - The New York Times
 ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Corp will accelerate investment in its network as it plots a future as a standalone company, its chief executive officer said on Wednesday, days after the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier and rival T-Mobile US Inc said merger talks had failed. Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said at an investor conference the company could spend more than its previous guidance of $5 billion to $6 billion per year on capital expenditures, and that cash on hand could dip next year as it builds out its network. “We came to the realization that we’re still far away from what the Sprint network can actually deliver,” Claure said on Wednesday. “I don’t think we’ve put all our assets to work.” Sprint and No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile said on Saturday they have called off merger talks to create a combined U.S. wireless company to rival market leaders AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. Claure said on Wednesday that the talks fell through because SoftBank Group Corp CEO Masayoshi Son was not prepared to relinquish control of Sprint. SoftBank owns a majority of Sprint shares. “We’re always going to be open to looking at possible alternatives,” he said, adding that “we believe that eventually there’s going to need to be a tie-up between a telco and a cable company.” Sprint shares rose 4.2 percent to $5.99 in early afternoon trading on Wednesday.

The companies announced the agreement a day after Sprint and T-Mobile US Inc ended merger talks. Under the terms of the agreement, Altice, the fourth-largest U.S. cable operator, will use Sprint’s network to provide voice and data services in the United States. It gave no time line on when it will introduce such services. The deal will allow Sprint to use Altice’s cable infrastructure to transmit cellular data and develop a next-generation network, or 5G. Sprint and T-Mobile on Saturday called off merger talks to create a bigger U.S. wireless company to rival market leaders. That has left Sprint, the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier, to engineer a turnaround on its own. Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, Sprint’s majority owner, said in a separate announcement on Sunday that it intended to increase its stake in Sprint but that it would keep ownership of outstanding common stock under 85 percent, a move that avoids triggering a tender offer for the remaining shares. SoftBank currently owns roughly 82 percent of Sprint. U.S. cable companies have begun venturing into the wireless market as a way to bundle more services to reduce churn, or customer defections, at a time when more consumers are canceling cable subscriptions. Comcast Corp started selling wireless service this year on Verizon Communications Inc’s network, and Charter Communications Inc plans to launch service next year. ","

Rumors are spreading that the merger being negotiated by T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) is hitting a rough patch right now, months after the companies first started talking, and just as the two were expected to expected to seal the deal. According to reports, Sprint majority stakeholder SoftBank Group, and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom AG can't agree on how much control each would receive in the deal; CNBC is reporting Deutsche Telecom's management may visit SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son this weekend to smooth things over. You may remember that Sprint and T-Mobile considered a deal back in 2014 that would have resulted in Sprint buying out T-Mobile, but those talks ended when the prospect of a merger met with strong resistance from regulators. If the Sprint and T-Mobile deal falls apart for good this time, it's unlikely the nation's third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers will try a third time. As Sprint and T-Mobile try to keep their merger talks alive, let's take a quick look at two possible alternatives for Sprint if the deal doesn't work out. Image source: Getty Images. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) could be a strong contender to make a bid for Sprint, mainly because the cable company just jumped into the mobile wireless business earlier this year. Comcast only offers wireless services to its Xfinity Internet subscribers, and buying Sprint would significantly expand the cable company's reach. And even if Comcast doesn't want to become the nation's fourth-largest wireless carrier, the cable company could always purchase some of Sprint's spectrum, and sell it off later. Comcast made a similar move several years ago when it bought up wireless spectrum and later sold it to Verizon. What we do know is that Comcast is looking for new areas of growth as pay-TV subscriber numbers continue to decline. Research from Kagan estimates that by 2021, traditional TV providers will have lost 11 million subscribers nationwide. One hang-up for a potential Comcast deal is that it would need to be approved by Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR). Like Comcast, Charter announced plans for a mobile wireless service for its customers, and the two have teamed up, in a sense, to ensure they can test the mobile waters without competition from each other. To that end, they agreed that neither would make any wireless acquisitions without the other's consent. This could also open up another opportunity for Sprint, where both Charter and Comcast buy some of Sprint, and the mobile carrier uses the cash to continue building out its business. Charter and Comcast had pursued a similar scenario over the summer, but it never materialized as Sprint opted to pursue a deal with T-Mobile. It's also possible that Sprint could get snatched up by DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH). DISH been aggressively buying up swaths of wireless spectrum -- it purchased $6.2 billion worth in the latest wireless auction alone. So there's been lots of talk about DISH either buying or being bought by a wireless provider, and a collapse of the Sprint/T-Mobile deal would only fuel further speculation. DISH is expected to launch an Internet of Things network -- for bringing small, data-sipping devices online -- in the next few years, but a deal with Sprint would instantly make DISH a key player in the mobile market, and give it even greater opportunities to utilize its wireless spectrum. Though it looks like T-Mobile and Sprint are trying to salvage their deal, anything could happen at this point. What's clear, though, is that Sprint is very interested in being bought. The carrier has worked hard to improve its business recently -- Sprint posted its highest operating income in 10 years in its latest quarter -- but the company's position in the U.S. wireless market isn't nearly as strong as it used to be. Sprint isn't likely to give up on the idea of being acquired if its deal with T-Mobile were to fall apart -- again. ","
      
    The T-Mobile and Sprint Merger Isn't a Done Deal: Who Buys Sprint If It Falls Apart? -- The Motley Fool

These days, it's hard to find a stock more beaten down than Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR). The regional telecom's shares have been absolutely hammered over the past few years -- to the point where they're touching the lowest they've been in over three decades. That's quite a dive. Let's take a closer look to determine if Frontier might be able to pick itself up from the floor and get its stock moving higher again. Frontier stock's latest major price swoon began in early 2015, very shortly after the company agreed to pay over $10.5 billion to acquire a big set of Verizon Communication (NYSE:VZ) assets in Florida, California, and Texas. That was the second monster deal between the two companies; in 2009, Frontier parted with $8.6 billion to buy similar assets in 14 states. Image source: Getty Images. When the 2015 deal closed last year, Frontier took over approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband accounts, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers formerly owned by Verizon. At a stroke, Frontier doubled its size, and then some. The company placed this massive bet because, in the words of CEO Daniel McCarthy, ""[i]t significantly expands our presence in three high-growth, high-density states, and improves our revenue mix by increasing the percentage of our revenues coming from segments with the most promising growth potential."" The problem was that this flew in the face of two major trends: cord-cutting and what we can call broadband migration. The former is the well-known practice of ditching traditional pay-TV providers like FiOS for a smorgasbord of streaming services. The latter, which is related to cord-cutting, refers to customers moving to cable internet from the DSL technology delivered over phone lines. This isn't only a Frontier problem; it's been prevalent throughout the telecom industry. Yet the company was particularly vulnerable to it because of its size and scope -- it's much smaller, as you can see below, than top peers Verizon and AT&T (NYSE:T). Compounding that, unlike those giants, Frontier doesn't have other significant business units (like AT&T's DirecTV) that it can mobilize to help make up for the declining revenue. FTR Market Cap data by YCharts. Since the latest Verizon deal closed, the purchased customer base in Florida, California, and Texas has eroded in every quarter. And for more than a year, the company's revenue has dropped from quarter to quarter, with the bottom line landing consistently in the red. A deep (62%) dividend cut earlier this year shored up the finances somewhat; unfortunately, it also gave investors a solid reason to abandon or avoid the shares. A subsequent reverse stock split saved the company from an embarrassing delisting but ultimately couldn't halt the share price slide. It's been quite a tumble. From the start of this year alone, Frontier's stock has plummeted by almost 83%. It's hard to see how Frontier can crawl its way out of this. It invested heavily in technology its customers don't seem to want much these days, and there's no backup revenue source. The dividend, even at the drastically reduced rate, yields an insane 27%. That's not a sign of financial strength, nor does it indicate a deep bargain find -- it's a flashing red light for a company that's in deep trouble. I can't imagine any scenario in which Frontier stock rebounds from even this drastically reduced level. I very much doubt this will be a recovery story. ","

Daniel B. Kline,11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In 2014, regulatory opposition forced Sprint (NYSE:S) to give up on its plan to acquire T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). Three years later, the two companies returned to the negotiating table, coming close to finalizing an agreement before the deal hit roadblocks once again. What happened? And what lies ahead for the No. 3 and 4 wireless providers? A full transcript follows the video. Dan Kline: Nice to be here! Shen: Are you in town this time for any special occasion? Kline: I was speaking to potential college journalists -- well, I guess, they're actual college journalists who want to be professional journalists. I got to give them the scary ""our profession is not as good as it was,"" but there are wonderful places like Motley Fool where, if you can make your way here eventually, it'll be good for you. It was actually organized by a former Fool, as well. Shen: There you go. Today, Fools, for our main subject of discussion, we're branching out into the telecommunications industry for this episode. You'll have a chance, Dan, to share some of your coverage there. It's been a while since we've talked about this space, but I understand that T-Mobile and Sprint have been making headlines in the past several months, this whole ordeal. Those companies are the No. 3 and No. 4 names, respectively, among U.S. wireless providers. Before we dive into the recent news around their potential merger and how that's fallen through, I want to talk about some of the background for the two companies, and I think that will help once we get into the nitty gritty of the recent news, in terms of understanding some of their motivations and the various incentives that are at play here. Let's start with T-Mobile. The company, I think, is probably best known for two things -- its CEO, John Legere, and also its Un-carrier branding, which I think has been very successful for the company. Kline: And it's not just branding. When John Legere took over, and he's a very bombastic guy, I always likened him to a 1980s pro-wrestling manager. He's very in your face, he'll taunt you, he'll call out his opposition, he has nicknames. Sort of a fun version of what the president likes to do. So what they did with Un-carrier is, he looked at every consumer pain point in the mobile process. So the first big one was contracts. You'd be tied into this two-year contract, you would have a device subsidy, you wouldn't know what you were really paying for anything. They got rid of that. The more recent ones are having only unlimited data. Yes, I know there's caveats, they slow you down after 22 gigs, but that's 2% of the audience. For most people, completely unlimited data. And every few months, they come out with something new, and it's silly stuff. T-Mobile Tuesday is just like, this Tuesday I get a free Frosty at Wendy's. But last month, they came out with, ""We're giving all of our customers Netflix."" So they're really trying to find a way to be different, to be a customer first mobile company. And it's worked. T-Mobile has added over a million subscribers for 18 straight quarters. And as John Legere likes to say, they've had all the growth in the wireless space. Shen: Legere started his role at T-Mobile in late 2012. They rolled out the first Un-carrier Initiative 1.0, they called it at the time, not much later, I believe it was March of 2013. So in that time, as you mentioned, the company has seen some pretty strong results. I think customers and listeners will realize that a lot of the things that they enjoy now, maybe even take for granted when they look through their wireless bill, was often a byproduct of the competition coming from these various Un-carrier moves. Kline: T-Mobile has forced AT&T and Verizon, and to a lesser extent Sprint, because Sprint wasn't quite as evil as AT&T and Verizon were acting in some of their no-longer practices, but the big one was overages. It's hard to quantify how much we were paying in overages, because they function in two ways. There's the actual, ""I go over my data allotment and have to pay."" That was billions of dollars. But Legere would always talk about the person who bought a too-big plan, because they didn't want to worry about it, and that was perhaps tens of billions of dollars that was getting sucked out of consumers' pockets. So by being transparent and saying, ""We're not going to do those kind of things"" -- T-Mobile was No. 4 and sinking, and since 2013, now they're No. 3 and rising. And they've been picking up momentum pretty much every quarter. The challenge is, as Verizon, AT&T, everybody's prices have come down, everybody offers unlimited, Sprint is really cheap, the challenge is, how do you keep doing that when maybe a lot of those pain points are gone? Shen: Yeah. At the end of 2013, which was, again, the year the Un-carrier program started, T-Mobile had 46 million customers, they had a churn of about 1.7% per month. Now, as of the most recently reported quarter, that's Q3 for 2017, reported just October 23, they have 71 million customers, great growth there. Their churn is down to 1.2%, seeing very consistent progress with that core metric for this industry. Some other notable highlights, from that approximately four-year period, to note, under the leadership of Legere, they moved, as you said, from the No. 4 to the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier. Of course, that gap -- Kline: It's a huge gap. Shen: -- is a massive one. So it's really AT&T against Verizon at No. 2 and No. 1, respectively, and then T-Mobile and Sprint at No. 3 and No. 4, respectively. They've had 18 straight quarters of more than one million net customer additions, which I think you mentioned, Dan. They've had compound annual top line growth of almost 14% for that period, improving profitability. T-Mobile shares have gained over 200%, so stockholders are pretty happy with the Un-carrier. Let's turn our attention now to Sprint. What have been the big themes or drivers for this company in recent memory? Because they're not doing nearly as well. Kline: Sprint is doing better, but Sprint was a sinking ship. It was losing ground as T-Mobile was gaining ground, because it had no identity. It was just the carrier that's a little cheaper than AT&T and Verizon, but not quite as cheap as T-Mobile. Marcelo Claure, their CEO, who is willing to go toe-to-toe with John Legere, he sort of righted the ship, but the way he's done it is heavy discounting. So Sprint is almost always, at some point, the best deal. And when I say some point, I mean, maybe it's families this week, maybe it's individuals next week. They're not always the lowest across the board for every type of plan you would want. But they generally have some crazy deal that would be good for somebody. They do things like two iPhones for one. So they've returned to slight growth in terms of subscribers, but it's not necessarily sustainable, because a lot of their promotions sunset. So March 2018, you no longer pay $30 a month, now you pay $55. And it's so easy to move now, which makes the T-Mobile churn number even more impressive. It's no longer the days where moving was a big challenge and it was hard to get your number. Now, it's very easy. You could switch cellphone providers every three months if you wanted to, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. So Sprint is on better ground, but they haven't spent a lot of money on their network, which is a problem. They will argue that they're within 1% of the other networks, and that's not really what the data shows. Shen: In terms of the coverage and the network quality. Kline: Yeah. And the reality is, they're the No. 4 network, generally, on most of the accepted standards. There's all sorts of different data and different ways you can parse things, but it's pretty widely accepted that Sprint is the worst, and it's going to get worse as they don't spend money, which is part of why they might like to be for sale. Shen: And as of the most recent quarterly report, Sprint has added postpaid subscribers for nine straight quarters. They did see their highest postpaid additions in company history. So some positive marks, as you mentioned. They also cut a ton of costs year to date. I believe it's yielded savings of $750 million. Kline: It's price, as well, with postpaid. Boost Mobile tends to be the cheapest. So they might be cannibalizing their own customer base, because you can port your Sprint phone to a Boost Mobile phone with zero effort and pay less. Shen: The cost-cutting efforts are definitely a focus for management right now. They're improving their profitability, but at this point, that company has still reported negative earnings for several years running. And on the not so bright side, the stock is down about 30% year-to-date, and quite a bit today, last I checked before we came into the studio, because the negotiations for this T-Mobile-Sprint deal are officially over. The press release from both companies came out on Saturday. The stock in general has been seesawing between $3 to $10 per share, essentially, for the past five years. I feel like the cost-cutting and the slowly improving business, or the gradual turnaround that Claure is working on here, it's one part of the puzzle. As you mentioned earlier, the company needs to generate so much cash -- any company in this industry needs to generate so much cash each year to reinvest in the wireless network, to not only just match your competitors in terms of what service you offer, but then you have, for example, 5G networks on the horizon, people already starting to test the infrastructure for that. Kline: Buying spectrum. Shen: And that's just another demand in terms of resources that you have to satisfy. Kline: If you look at what Sprint is doing, they're cleaning up the asset for a sale, a merger, a partnership, whatever it ends up being. We'll talk about that later. But you're not going to make a deal with something that's bleeding customers, that's losing billions of dollars. So if you can take the loss to pretty much zero, and it was a relatively minor loss in the last quarter, and be putting the subscriber needle in the right direction, you're at least showing, whether it's a partner or a buyer or however it comes down, ""Hey, there's a bottom here. We're not going to go to zero."" And there was a while where it looked like every Sprint customer was just going to become a T-Mobile customer. Shen: We'll take a closer look at the deal negotiations between the two companies and how that panned out. We'll talk about that next. So now you have some high-level perspective of these two companies, where they are and where they've been the past couple of years. So we can talk about the deal that just wasn't meant to be. It's the second time now, right? So on Saturday, November 4, Sprint and T-Mobile pushed out the press releases announcing the end of their merger negotiations. Dan, I feel like on this show, we've talked several times about these long, drawn-out ordeals. We've talked about Viacom, their leadership battle, we've talked about the Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's merger being this long, drawn-out saga. And now, we have this last one here. Can you give us a little bit of an idea of how things progressed in the last few months, how they started up and how they ended? Kline: There are logical reasons for these companies to get together. You put their subscriber bases together, and it's about equal to either AT&T or Verizon. So it gives them scale. You can lay off a lot of customer service people, a lot of accountants. Shen: Redundant functions, yeah. Kline: You don't need two networks. There were also some major drawbacks. I didn't want this deal to happen, because I remember when Sprint bought Nextel, when Nextel was essentially No. 5 in the wireless space. Nextel used a different technology than Sprint. As Sprint and T-Mobile are not on the same network technologies. Your Sprint phone can not become a T-Mobile phone. That was the case with the Nextel phone and the Sprint phone. So you're buying something that's not super easy to integrate. It's not like they can just become Spree Mobile, and all of the sudden it's just one company. [laughs] I got one up on you there, we were talking about how this would be named before the show. Shen: Spree Mobile is pretty good. I was going to go with T-Sprint, but I like this more. Kline: There were a lot of operational challenges, but the reality on this is, the best deals are when one company wants out. The Cabela's management knew they weren't coming along with the deal. They were all going to cash out, make some money, go fishing or hunting or whatever it is Cabela's management would do. In this case, SoftBank (NASDAQOTH:SFTBF), which is the parent company of Sprint, wanted to maintain certain rights and control. They were going to give up the CEO post, John Legere would have that, but they still wanted more management than what they were bringing to the table in terms of valuation offered. That becomes a very dicey deal to make. Shen: To be clear, in terms of the parties that have an interest in these deal negotiations, on one side, with T-Mobile, their majority interest stake is held by Deutsche Telekom, about a 65% ownership stake, I believe. And on the opposite side of the negotiation table, you have Sprint, which is over 80% owned by SoftBank and the billionaire Masayoshi Son. He's been a big part of the direction, the vision for Sprint, these various efforts. He actually tried to have Sprint take over T-Mobile back in 2014 -- Kline: When it might have made sense for Sprint. They were still No. 3, they were the bigger company. Shen: And that deal fell through, because the indication, I believe, that they received from the regulatory body that would overlook and scrutinize the deal was, ""This is not going to happen."" Kline: They flat out said, ""We will not accept any deal that takes the U.S. market from four providers to three providers."" Shen: In this case, we have a new administration now, obviously, and I believe that both parties thought they had a situation where regulators might be more friendly to a deal of this nature. Whether that's the case, again, you're going from four to three major players -- Kline: I think the argument they were going to make is that Comcast and Charter are all somewhat in this, or going into this space, with their own wifi-based MVNO networks, which are networks that don't own their spectrum, they lease it from one of the remaining companies. Shen: Essentially piggybacking off of the companies that have actually developed the infrastructure. Kline: Yeah. And I think they were going to give caveats that they would license their spectrum to X amount of payers. They were going to argue that there were legitimately more choices for Americans than the three or four or whatever you want to call it. I don't know that that would have flown. But I do think the reality is, there were a lot of reasons this deal shouldn't happen, and once it wasn't quick, I think you knew it wasn't going to happen. Shen: Then, you mentioned this too, in terms of what the combined entity would look like, 130 million customers, pretty much on par with AT&T and Verizon. They'd have about $75 billion in annual revenue. Definitely a much more formidable player. Kline: The cost savings would be extraordinary. Shen: But the integrations, as you said, would not nearly be that simple or that seamless. And if you're a customer with either Sprint or T-Mobile and this deal had come together, it wouldn't have been so quick for you to see improvements in your service, and that just comes from the challenge of combining two huge national networks, but they're on different LTE technology. Kline: Because there are no contracts anymore, I think there's a very big risk, and I think we saw this with Frontier Communications, which spent $11 billion buying customers from Verizon, and when it didn't very quickly work well, they didn't get billed right, their service didn't work, their internet wasn't good, whatever it was, they just went, ""Oh, I'm going to go to Comcast."" It's easier to switch your wireless phone than it is to switch your cable service. No one has to come to your house. You can just walk into a Sprint store and they'll give you a bag to mail it back to T-Mobile. It's very simple. So you could have spent, whatever it is in terms of stock, billions and billions of dollars, to take Sprint's 50 million customers, it's a little bit more than that, but the 71 million at T-Mobile, and you could lose 10% in the first three months. And I think that's what would have happened. Everybody's prices are too close together. You would also have to deal with, the pricing structures are different at Sprint and T-Mobile. Are they all going to go to one? Are they going to stay two separate brands? That doesn't make sense from a pricing perspective. So to me, it always made more sense for either of these brands to partner with a cable company or someone else in an adjacent space. Shen: And we can get to that idea. You have these two companies, they tried coming together in 2014. At the time, Sprint was the larger player, in more of the power position. Now, the tables have turned, and T-Mobile has more of the leverage. When it comes down to it, SoftBank, what they had in mind for a deal like this, they didn't want to give up too much control of the future of Spree Mobile, as you called it. Kline: It's also the assets. Masayoshi Son has been spending hundreds of billions of dollars, I forget the exact amount in his tech fund, but it's at least $100 billion. And all of the spectrum assets that Sprint owns, he doesn't want to give up control over, because maybe he'll use it to launch a national over the top cable service. I mean, I'm just making that up, but he wants to be able to pick the company clean for parts. It's not necessarily about the wireless subscribers or that business. I think he was perfectly happy to let John Legere decide what the commercials and the pricing were going to be. It's all the future integration of, does T-Mint or Spree Mobile or whatever we're going to call them, do they merge with Comcast? I think those are the things he wasn't willing to let go. And I think John Legere has earned the right to say, ""I don't want to have a boss anymore."" And that was going to be a sticking point. Shen: So differences in terms of what the controlling stake would look like, the ownership between the two companies and their shareholders and this combined entity. And then, also coming down to valuation as well, Sprint's stock took quite a hit in September. I think it went down about 20%. And then, depending on the timing of the deal, it could be that Sprint shareholders didn't see any kind of premium in the merger. Kline: It's all speculation, because they haven't talked about this, but there have been a lot of reports saying they weren't offering a premium, and it was about efficiency and unlocking value. That's a tough one to sell. But Sprint didn't help itself by, before this negotiation started, they had an exclusive negotiating period with Charter and Comcast about a partnership, a merger. They never exactly announced what it was. But it became pretty clear that there weren't two suitors. So T-Mobile did not have to say, ""We'll pay you 40% more,"" because otherwise, you're going to turn around and, I don't know, McDonald's is going to buy you and use it for mobile ordering. And we'll talk about this soon, there could be somebody out there, but the reason prices drive up in these kinds of deals is, ""If you don't buy us, Amazon will."" And Sprint is a complicated asset. Shen: Some other suitor, sure. So let's wrap up our discussion. The deal is no longer happening, off the table as far as we know. These two companies are going to continue to make their investments, operate independently. Let's look at Sprint first. What do you think lies ahead that investors and listeners should be following for this company? Kline: Well, it won't be McDonald's. [laughs] And, Sprintpotle is also not on the table. Sprint, in my opinion, is going to be sold to a cable company. I think it makes a lot of sense if you're already in the subscription business, you already have that infrastructure for this to be another bundle. I don't think Comcast actually wants to offer a leased service, mostly on wifi, vaguely not that good, nobody wants its phone service. Shen: Which they recently had with Xfinity Mobile. Kline: Yeah. And did it, and Altice has now just signed a deal this week to do it using Sprint's lines. I think they're going to want to have a service they can sell nationally. And it may not be a merger, it may be some sort of exclusive partnership with an investment to take some of the pressure off. But they also have all of the spectrum assets, some of which are saleable if they don't need them. So I think that's going to make the most sense, and you just have to see how that industry is going to shake out. Are Charter and Comcast going to merge? Shen: Do you see it as, Sprint is grooming itself for another suitor to come in? Kline: Yeah, I think Sprint has to continue to show -- even if they can eke out a profit, it's a lot easier to buy something that's revenue-neutral than buy something that's revenue-negative. If you're going to sell this to Charter shareholders or Comcast shareholders or whoever it is, I think Sprint could do more to cut costs. They could be more of a position to integrate quickly. And that's probably going to mean a lot of discounting, good for consumers, and a lot of barebones staffing, not so good for consumers. Shen: Let's look at T-Mobile, then. They're still doing incredibly well, claiming a lot of the growth that this industry is seeing overall, no longer combining with Sprint. What are the big next steps for them? Keep going with the Un-carrier initiatives? It seems to be getting harder and harder for them to set themselves apart with that. Kline: Deutsche Telekom would probably rather not have to keep investing. It's spent like $40 billion in the last six years, or something like that. Shen: In terms of the network for T-Mobile. Kline: In terms of the network and building out capacity. And that's not going to change with 5G and all the other things. So, I think they're open to a deal. I think there's also the possibility that someone like an Altice, a company that's European-based or one of the companies in other parts of the world, that there might be some synergy in either merging with T-Mobile or joint operating, and having a more global company. Again, standards and technology become a challenge there. But I think T-Mobile is in a position where they can sit back, and as long as John Legere doesn't retire, they're in a very good position to just wait for the best deal, see if Amazon or Apple wants to buy them. Shen: OK. So for both instances, you see some form of consolidation or M&A deal being potential things to watch. Kline: I don't think it has to be -- Shen: Because, my take was more so for Sprint, for sure. Kline: The Sprint original deal they talked about was Comcast and Charter was an investment plus, essentially, becoming their wireless company. I think that type of deal is actually more logical for T-Mobile, for a healthy company to say, ""Now we're going to offer service in Mexico through Wal-Mart,"" those types of deals, I think, make more sense with a healthy company than they do with an ailing company. But there is so much negative to owning Sprint that there might be big players like Comcast more willing to have it be an investment in a partnership, rather than an outright purchase. Shen: Alright. That wraps up our discussion for this deal. We'll continue to track the progress for Sprint's turnaround, for how T-Mobile decides to proceed with their next Un-carrier initiative, for example, as these two companies make those announcements in due time.

    The Sprint and T-Mobile Merger Falls Apart for a Second Time -- The Motley Fool

  "
Adam Levy,11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Sprint (NYSE:S), and AT&T (NYSE:T) are three of the big names in the U.S. wireless industry. In recent years, Sprint has been putting pressure on the economics of the two giants -- Verizon and AT&T -- in the form of aggressive pricing and other competitive moves like early adoption of equipment installment plans and smartphone leases. What's more, while AT&T and Verizon are investing in areas outside of their core wireless businesses, Sprint is focused exclusively on wireless. Investors may be wondering whether Sprint makes a better buy than a stalwart like AT&T or Verizon. Or if Verizon and AT&T are better positioned, which of them is best among the three wireless carriers. Let's examine each one a bit more closely to determine which stock is the best buy. Image source: Verizon. Sprint is a big fan of pointing out that the gap between its network coverage and Verizon's has gotten much narrower in recent years. That said, Verizon still consistently earns the highest grades in third-party network quality tests. But even its strong network hasn't stopped it from feeling pricing pressure. It saw 11 straight quarters of declining service revenue before things started turning around last quarter. It was practically forced to start offering an unlimited data plan. Then it quickly moved to offering two tiers of unlimited data to help control its cost of services and compete on price. All of its efforts have paid off. In the first two full quarters since introducing its unlimited plan, Verizon has added over 200,000 postpaid phone subscribers after several quarters of disappointing net additions (and losses). Service revenue is starting to turn around, as management forecast, and subscriber churn levels remain the lowest in the industry. Verizon has taken steps to expand beyond wireless with its digital media business, Oath. It also has a wireline business providing internet, video, and landline service. Still, it hasn't resorted to measures as drastic as AT&T, which has made big acquisitions in the form of DirecTV and Time Warner in recent years. It's still strapped with a boatload of debt from its buyout of a minority stake in Verizon Wireless in 2014. Image source: Sprint. With a wireless network that consistently ranks at the bottom of third-party measurement surveys, Sprint has resorted to aggressive pricing to win over customers. This summer, for example, it started offering free service to new customers, particularly targeting Verizon subscribers. For its efforts, Sprint has started to see new customers come on board. The company's share of gross subscriber additions reached an all-time high last quarter, according to management. Its 367,000 net postpaid phone subscriber additions still fall short of Verizon's, though. What's more, unlike Verizon or AT&T, Sprint is losing postpaid connected device subscribers. Sprint's aggressive pricing is also putting pressure on its service revenue. Through the first half of fiscal 2018, postpaid service revenue is down 7%. That's worse than Verizon, which has notably struggled to sustain its service revenue. Image source: AT&T. AT&T's acquisition of DirecTV and its pending acquisition of Time Warner have put it in a position to offer an aggressively priced entertainment bundle with its wireless service. Unlimited plan subscribers get free HBO and $25 off one of AT&T's video services. The plan hasn't stopped it from losing postpaid phone subscribers, which declined another 97,000 last quarter. Overall, service revenue fell 2.8% year over year last quarter, and average revenue per postpaid subscriber fell 3.5%. Meanwhile, AT&T is bleeding video subscribers as well. The company lost 89,000 video subscribers, with nearly 300,000 U-Verse and DirecTV subscribers replaced by DirecTV Now subscribers -- AT&T's streaming video service. That said, AT&T's been able to continue raising prices for its linear TV services to maintain slight revenue growth. Sprint doesn't have a competitive advantage beyond lower pricing. If the company continues to rely on undercutting AT&T and Verizon to win customers, it will be difficult for it to generate enough cashflow to build out its network and provide a more competitive service. It's currently about break-even on a free-cash-flow basis. Comparatively, Verizon and AT&T are cash-flow giants. Verizon generated $4.7 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, and AT&T produced $16.5 billion. Verizon's free cash flow was negatively impacted by a $3.2 billion tax bill on the sale of some of its wireline assets and the decision to shift to an asset-backed bond to pull forward revenue from its equipment installment plans. Adjusting for those factors, Verizon's cash flow is comparable to AT&T's. The free cash flows of Verizon and AT&T support big dividend yields of 4.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Perhaps the best valuation metric for comparing the wireless carriers is EV to EBITDA. Here's how the three stack up. Company EV to EBITDA Multiple Verizon 6.9 AT&T 6.5 Sprint 5.5 Table source: Yahoo! Finance. Investors should note that Sprint's EBITDA is comparably higher due to the fact that it uses device leasing. Instead of expensing devices, Sprint capitalizes them and then amortizes them over time. This results in a higher EBITDA than if devices showed up in cost of goods sold, like they do with Verizon and AT&T. As such, Sprint's lower EV-to-EBITDA multiple isn't very impressive. Verizon is actually growing its subscriber base and isn't bogged down with a declining pay-TV business. As such, it deserves a slight premium to AT&T. On the other hand, AT&T offers a higher dividend yield, supported by massive free cash flow. For investors looking for more exposure to the U.S. wireless industry, Verizon is the best buy. If you're comfortable with lots of exposure to the declining pay-TV market, AT&T presents better value. I'd stay away from Sprint, though. ","

Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) reported solid third-quarter 2017 results after the market closed on Wednesday. Shares have returned 31.9% in 2017 through Wednesday, versus the S&P 500's 17.1%. Here's how the quarter worked out for the data center operator and global interconnection specialist that's organized as a real estate investment trust (REIT). Metric Q3 2017 Q3 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue Operating income $224.9 million $170.0 million Net income $79.9 million $51.5 million 55% Earnings per share (EPS) $1.02 $0.72 Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)* $391.3 million $284.2 million AFFO per share $4.97 $3.95 Data source: Equinix. *AFFO is a closely watched metric for companies organized as REITs, as it's a driver of payouts to shareholders. It's akin to ""earnings"" for REITs. Reported revenue got a boost from foreign exchange and includes $137 million of revenue from the acquisition of 29 Verizon data centers, which was completed last quarter. On a normalized and constant currency basis, revenue increased 10% year over year -- still quite solid -- and 8% from the previous quarter. Equinix's revenue came in above its guidance range of $1,133 million to $1,141 million. The company doesn't provide a quarterly AFFO outlook. Image source: Getty Images. Here's what CEO Steve Smith had to say in the press release about the quarter: Equinix had a strong third quarter as customers continue to adopt interconnection oriented architectures as the preferred platform for their shift to digital. Robust demand is driving higher utilization levels, and we are investing in support of this momentum with expansions, both organically and through strategic acquisitions, to deliver even greater value to customers through our global platform. As customers embrace hybrid and multicloud as the IT architecture of choice, our interconnection strength is resonating, and Equinix continues to outpace market growth and gain market share. Equinix increased its full-year 2017 guidance. The company said the $37 million (at midpoint) guidance raise is due to better-than-expected operating performance of $8 million in the third quarter, additional foreign currency benefit of $16 million when compared to the prior guidance, and $13 million in revenue from two acquisitions it made early in the fourth quarter. (Acquisitions were Itconic, which has five data centers in Spain and Portugal and a second data center in Istanbul.)

Corning Inc. (NYSE:GLW) is enjoying a very good year. While its stock price is up nearly 30% year to date, nearly doubling the S&P 500's return, its impressive run looks to continue for some time yet, judging by its recently reported third-quarter results. While its core sales and core EPS growth were modest on the surface, at 6% and 2%, respectively, closer inspection reveals a lot for Corning shareholders to be excited about. The market seemed to like the quarter, too, as the company's stock price jumped more than 6% the day it reported. We don't have to look far to see why investors were so impressed. Corning's optical communications division -- which manufactures optical fiber and provides connectivity solutions for some of the world's largest telecom networks and cable providers -- showed strong year-over-year core earnings growth of 13% and this division is Corning's second-largest income-earning division. (""Core"" numbers are management's favored adjusted financial metrics that it believes best express how the company is performing. For instance, it excludes the impact that foreign exchange rates had on the quarter's numbers.) Better yet, management stated that the earnings for this division would have been even higher if it hadn't been reinvesting so much back into the business to increase manufacturing capacity. While Corning's specialty materials division, the home of Gorilla Glass, saw even stronger sales and earnings growth, its optical communications business segment is where Corning might be building a nearly unbreachable moat against competitors. Corning is now the lowest-cost producer of optical fiber and offers a number of award-winning innovations in the market. Image source: Corning Inc. In the company's recent quarterly press release, it announced that it had now produced 1 billion kilometers of optical fiber. That's a whole lot! In fact, according to the company, that's ""one-third of the optical fiber ever produced in the history of the world."" This accomplishment comes on the heels of a major deal with Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) whereby the telecom carrier announced that it will buy more than $1.05 billion of optical fiber over the next three years from Corning. In the company's conference call, Corning CEO Wendell Weeks talked not only about why even better things are still ahead. According to the transcript from S&P Global Market Intelligence, he said: Our dedicated employees have helped us become the world's largest manufacturer of optical fiber, the world's lowest-cost provider, and the home to some of the most precise manufacturing operations of any kind, anywhere in the world. ... We believe that the opportunities ahead of us are much greater than those that are behind us. To capture these opportunities, we're investing to expand capacity, to innovate and to increase our market access. ... These investments are paying off. We are growing at more than twice the rate of the telecommunications industry ... We're well on our way to more than 15% sales growth for 2017, which keeps us on track to achieve $5 billion in optical sales by 2020. That Corning is the lowest-cost producer of optical fiber gives it an impressive economic moat against its competitors. Beyond that, the company also offers a variety of innovative solutions. For instance, the company's EDGE8 solution is a preterminated optical cabling system designed specifically for data centers. EDGE8 allows data center operators to maximize their assets without the need for conversion modules, leading to lower costs. It also provides a straightforward path for data centers to upgrade to 40G, 100G, or 400G ethernet. Corning showed strength in its optical communication division in its recently reported third quarter. Data source: Corning Inc. 2017 Q3 2017 earnings. Some might counter that while Corning's optical communications segment's results were impressive, the company still only managed to increase earnings by 2% companywide. However, this argument misses the larger point: Corning has transformed itself from a cyclical industrial company dependent on commodity pricing to an enterprise with incredible technical prowess and proprietary know-how in diverse areas. The company's largest income-generating division, display technologies, accounted for 52% of the company's core earnings this quarter. This business segment largely manufactures specialized glass substrates used as a key component in liquid crystal displays for devices such as smartphones, computer monitors, and large-screen televisions. Earnings in this business segment are notoriously cyclical and are often based on glass prices, a factor far outside Corning's control. This quarter, core earnings in this department fell 16% year over year. In years past, that would have tanked Corning's quarter. While display technologies still comprises slightly more than half of Corning's earnings, it's not nearly as big, percentage-wise, as it was previously. That core earnings in this division could have fallen by so much while the company still eked out a small core earnings gain shows just how far Corning has come in increasing its other streams of revenue. For shareholders, there's a lot to like not only about Corning's latest quarter, but its incredible transformation as a company. Not the least of things to like is Corning's growing moat in optical fiber manufacturing. With innovative solutions and lowest-cost production capabilities, Corning expects to continue to grow this division at twice the rate of the telecommunications industry and is projecting at least $5 billion in sales in this segment by 2020. Optical communications had about $3 billion in net sales in 2016.  Corning is setting itself up for long-term success. ","

"Jeremy Bowman, Danny Vena, and Daniel Miller",11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Retirees count on safe, dividend-paying stocks for regular income and to protect their wealth. Though they may not necessarily be the most exciting stocks on the market, these types of investments are just what people in their golden years need to avoid risk and reap the rewards of their portfolios. While the market's high valuation has made it harder to find high dividend yields, there are still some good opportunities in the market. Below, three of our analysts discuss their picks for high-yield safe stocks, including National Retail Properties (NYSE:NNN), Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM), and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). Image source: Getty Images. Danny Vena (National Retail Properties): A real estate investment trust (REIT) can be a great addition to a retirement portfolio. These investment vehicles receive special tax treatment, avoiding typical corporate taxes, and in return are required to maintain dividend payout ratios of at least 90%. As a result, REITs typically produce higher yields than many other dividend stocks. National Retail Properties invests in single-tenant net leased retail properties, which requires its tenants to pay for the operating expenses of their locations, including taxes, maintenance, and insurance. With fewer expenses, the company has more profits to return to shareholders. What makes National Retail Properties even more compelling is the composition of its portfolio. You might be concerned about the trend away from brick-and-mortar retail, as more and more shoppers make purchases online. This company avoids shopping centers and strip malls, and its tenants typically offer services that can't be duplicated online, like restaurants, convenience stores, automotive service centers, and fitness centers. National Retail Properties has initial lease terms of between 15 and 20 years, with contractual rent increases built into each lease. This provides reliable growth for its portfolio, which consists of 2,675 properties, with over 400 tenants in 48 states. Its strategy results in higher renewal rates and consistently high occupancy rates, currently at 99.3%. Over the last 25 years the company has produced an average total return of 13.5%. National Retail Properties has increased its dividend in each of the last 28 consecutive years, and is currently yielding 4.5%. Daniel Miller (Iron Mountain): Ironically, retirees looking for a safe investment won't need to look much further than a company built to protect information. Iron Mountain, which received IRS approval to operate as a REIT in 2014, is a global leader in record storage. In fact, it provides its services to roughly 94% of Fortune 1,000 companies, and has more than 1,400 facilities dedicated to storing information for record-intensive industries -- think healthcare, law, and finance-type industries. While Iron Mountain might be a new name to many investors, it's a trusted name in data management and offers consumers a compelling option to reduce the costs and risks of storing and protecting information assets. It's a safe investment due in part to its high retention of customers, low turnover and low maintenance capital expenditures. Going forward, management plans to grow the business by expanding into emerging markets as they begin requiring more data management, as well as adjacent businesses such as art storage. There will always be global demand for secure data management options, and what's even better for retirees looking for stable income is that REITs are required by law to maintain dividend payout ratios of at least 90%. Currently Iron Mountain's dividend yield sits at 5.8%, making it a great option for investors seeking income. Jeremy Bowman (Verizon Communications): There may be no safer sector than telecom, a highly regulated oligopoly with a captive market, and no telecom company is more dominant than Verizon.  The nation's biggest wireless provider offers investors a defensive stock with a 4.8% dividend yield and a low P/E of just 12.3. As a provider of necessary services like phone and data, Verizon will fare considerably better than the broad market in a recession, and the company has plenty of room to raise its dividend as its payout ratio is a reasonable 59%. The company has also increased its dividends for 11 years in a row. While Verizon has struggled to grow earnings in a competitive market, the company continues to add subscribers, with 603,000 additions in the most recent quarter, and is seeing growth in Fios and its new media business Oath, which came from the acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo. As consolidation continues in the telecom and media industries Verizion should benefit, and could add other assets to its media business. The proliferation of wearables like smartwatches should also help grow revenue over the coming years. With a leading position in its industry, a defensive business model, and a strong and growing dividend, Verizon is great choice for retirees in search of safety. ","
      
    3 High-Yield Stocks Safe for Retirees -- The Motley Fool

Selena Maranjian,11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Retirement is when most people are assumed to be living on a ""fixed income."" Well, yes, Social Security checks can remain fixed for a few years, though they do rise over time to keep up with inflation. Some other income sources, such as bonds, might also offer fixed income. Fortunately, though, there are plenty of ways that you can increase your retirement income, to make it less fixed. You can even employ a Social Security strategy or two to make your future checks bigger. Image source: Getty Images. Here are eight ways to increase your retirement income. This is probably not the kind of tip you wanted to see, but it's a powerful one. If you can work a few more years than you originally planned to, there are multiple benefits: Your nest egg can grow while you put off starting to tap it -- and it will have to support you for fewer years. You might enjoy your employer-sponsored health insurance for a few more years, too, perhaps also while collecting a few more years' worth of matching funds in your 401(k). The table below shows what a difference an extra year or two can make in your investing -- if you're socking away $10,000 annually and it's growing by an annual average of 8%: Growing at 8% For: $10,000 Invested Annually 15 years $293,243 16 years $327,502 17 years $364,502 18 years $404,463 19 years $447,620 20 years $494,229 21 years $544,568 22 years $598,933 23 years $657,648 24 years $721,059 25 years $789,544 26 years $863,508 27 years $943,388 28 years $1.0 million 29 years $1.1 million 30 years $1.2 million Data source: author. Instead of working longer, or in addition to doing so, you might also ease into retirement by working a little in your first few years of retirement. Working just 12 hours per week at $10 per hour will generate about $500 per month. A part-time job can also give your days more structure and opportunities for socializing. Many retirees find themselves restless and a bit lonely in retirement, and a low-stress job on the side can be quite helpful. Be aware, though, that if you're planning to start collecting Social Security benefits before your full retirement age, which is 66 or 67 for most of us, and you want to work some then, too, your benefits may be reduced. As the Social Security Administration explains: ""If you're younger than full retirement age during all of 2017, we must deduct $1 from your benefits for each $2 you earn above $16,920."" The year you reach your full retirement age, the earning limit jumps to $44,880, and the penalty decreases to $1 withheld for every $3 earned above the limit. Fortunately, though, the money withheld isn't lost. Instead, it's factored into the benefit checks you receive later, which end up increased. The health insurance coverage you choose can have an effect on how much you spend out of pocket on healthcare in retirement. (This is a big deal: According to Fidelity Investments, a 65-year-old couple retiring today will spend, on average, a total of $275,000 out of pocket on healthcare.) Once you're 65, you qualify for Medicare -- and in order to avoid paying a penalty premium every year, you need to not be late signing up. Know that you can choose between original Medicare (Part A and Part B, often with Part D and/or supplemental plans) and Medicare Advantage plans. There are pros and cons to each. For example, original Medicare is accepted across the country by thousands of doctors, whereas Medicare Advantage plans tend to be based in a region, offering access to a certain network of doctors. Medicare Advantage premiums can be lower, plus the plans feature out-of-pocket spending caps. Image source: Getty Images. The more you contribute to tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s, the more money you'll have in retirement. There are two main kinds of IRA -- the Roth IRA and the traditional IRA and for both in 2017, the contribution limit is $5,500 for most people and $6,500 for those 50 and older. (Limits are occasionally increased, to keep up with inflation.) That might not seem like a lot of money, but it's quite powerful if it can grow for many years. The table below shows how much money you can accumulate with annual $5,500 contributions at different average annual rates of growth: Growing For: Growing at 8% Growing at 10% Growing at 12% 15 years $161,284 $192,224 $229,643 20 years $271,826 $346,514 $443,843 25 years $434,239 $595,000 $821,337 30 years $672,900 $995,189 $1.5 million Data source: author. A 401(k) has even more generous contribution limits -- for 2017 it's $18,000 and in 2018 it's 18.500 -- plus an additional $6,000 is allowed in both years for those 50 or older. Give particular consideration to Roth IRAs and increasingly available Roth 401(k)s, as they let you withdraw money in retirement tax-free! Having a portfolio of stocks in retirement means you can sell shares for income at any time. But if you're holding dividend-paying stocks, you can collect income without having to sell any shares! For example, a $300,000 portfolio with an overall average yield of 4% will generate about $12,000 per year -- a solid $1,000 per month. Dividend income isn't guaranteed, but if you spread your money across a bunch of healthy and growing companies, you'll likely receive regular -- and growing -- payments. Here are a few well-regarded stocks with significant dividend yields: Stock Recent Dividend Yield National Grid 6.2% AT&T 5.8% Verizon 4.9% Pfizer 3.7% AbbVie 3.1% Data source: Yahoo! Financial. A dividend-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) can serve you well, too, offering instant diversification. The iShares Select Dividend ETF, for example, recently yielded about 3%. Preferred stock is another way to go. The iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF recently yielded 5.7%. Image source: Getty Images. Another way to boost your retirement income is to get it from the equity in your home -- via a reverse mortgage. A lender will provide (often tax-free) income during your retirement, and the loan doesn't have to be paid back until you no longer live in your home -- such as when you move into a nursing home or die. It has some drawbacks, though, such as requiring your heirs to sell the home unless they can afford to pay off the loan. Still, if you need additional income in retirement and no one is counting on inheriting your home, it can be a solid solution. You can increase your retirement income by spending less of it on home-related expenses. If you downsize and move to a smaller home -- or you move to a region with lower taxes or a lower cost of living -- you can end up spending less on taxes, insurance, home maintenance, utilities, landscaping, and so on. The median home value in California, for example, was recently about $386,000, but it was only $248,000 in Colorado and only $140,000 in South Carolina. Image source: Getty Images. Finally, you can boost your retirement income by being savvy about strategies that can increase your Social Security income. For starters, you can increase or decrease your benefits by starting to collect Social Security earlier or later than your ""full"" retirement age, which is 66 or 67 for most of us. If you're married, you can maximize your benefits by coordinating with your spouse when you each start collecting. If you and your spouse have very different earnings records, for example, you might start collecting the benefits of the spouse with the lower lifetime earnings record on time or as early as age 62, while delaying starting to collect the benefits of the higher-earning spouse. That way, you both get to enjoy some income earlier, and when the higher earner hits 70, you can collect their extra-large checks. Also, should that higher-earning spouse die first, the spouse with the smaller earnings history can collect those bigger benefit checks as survivor benefits instead of their own smaller checks. If you've figured out how much money you'll need in retirement and you're worried about how you'll generate the income you'll need, consider some of the strategies above. They can put hundreds or even thousands of dollars more in your pocket each year. ","

You can try Quartz membership for free Access your Quartz account Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer appeared distraught at a US Senate hearing Wednesday (Nov. 8) on the unprecedented data breaches at the company during her tenure. “As you know, Yahoo was the victim of criminal, state-sponsored attacks on its systems, resulting in the theft of certain user information,” Mayer said in her opening remarks, rarely looking up from her notes. “As CEO, these thefts occurred during my tenure, and I want to sincerely apologize to each and every one of our users.” Yahoo disclosed in October that a 2013 breach initially thought to have affected 1 billion user accounts had actually compromised every single account that existed at the time, a staggering 3 billion. Mayer resigned in June after its acquisition by Verizon closed. She had been in the job for about five years. Mayer hadn’t wanted to testify, declining multiple requests. She appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday after US lawmakers subpoenaed her late last month, according to The Hill. A spokesperson for Mayer contested this version of events to The Hill, saying she was testifying voluntarily. On Wednesday, Mayer was seated in the center of the five-member panel of executives who appeared to testify on data breaches, which also included Richard Smith, the former Equifax CEO who “retired” shortly after the company disclosed a data breach that compromised the personal information of 143 million Americans. US lawmakers have grown increasingly skeptical of the power and intimate user details amassed by big technology companies. Representatives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter answered questions before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week as part of the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. That skepticism was on display as the Senate Commerce Committee questioned Mayer, with a key exchange occurring between her and senator Bill Nelson. Nelson: At this point, I’m wondering that there’s no such thing as data security. When you think of a sophisticated state actor such as China or Russia, your companies can’t stand up against them. The only person or institution that can stand up against them is the National Security Agency. And what we’re going to see in the future for not only personally identifiable information but also the state secrets of our country, many of which are critical infrastructure as represented by companies such as yours, there’s going to have to be a cooperation between the most sophisticated player in the United States, which is the NSA, and you all. Otherwise we, Americans, are not going to have any more privacy. And if we don’t do something, and if you all don’t do something to change this, we’re going to be right back here, on additional hearings, coming up on this same topic. Now Ms. Mayer, what do you think? You had a sophisticated state actor coming after you. How do you really think that you could have protected yourself? Mayer: Even robust defense and processes are not sufficient to protect against a state sponsored attack, especially one that’s extremely sophisticated and persistent. We at Yahoo cooperated with law enforcement and brought these breaches and intrusions to the attention of law enforcement, swiftly each time they were detected. And the DOJ and FBI were of great assistance to the company in identifying the perpetrators and bringing them to justice. Nelson: But that’s an admission that you’re not protected against a state actor. A few minutes later, speaking to an executive from Yahoo parent Verizon, Nelson added that protecting consumer privacy was “going to take an attitude change among companies such as yours.” ",Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer was grilled by a senate committee over its massive data breach — Quartz
John D. McKinnon,11092017,MarketWatch,11022017,"Published: Nov 7, 2017 7:22 p.m. ET Mayer to appear Wednesday in data-breach hearing By WASHINGTON — A Senate committee moved last month to force former Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer to testify in a hearing Wednesday about corporate data breaches, after she initially declined lawmakers’ invitation. The Senate Commerce Committee’s authorization of the subpoena, an unusual move, underscores lawmakers’ growing concern over data breaches. It also highlights the potential stakes for Mayer, once one of the nation’s most celebrated CEOs, in testifying about Yahoo’s massive data breaches and subsequent stumbles in disclosing them. The committee authorized its subpoena late last month after Mayer declined the panel’s invitation to testify voluntarily, according to committee aides. A committee spokesman and a representative for Mayer said Tuesday that she would testify at Wednesday’s hearing.
