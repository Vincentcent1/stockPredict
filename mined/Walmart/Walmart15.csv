Shares of megaretailer Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) sank on Friday following the blockbuster news that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had agreed to acquire Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) in a $13.7 billion deal. While Whole Foods' focus on the high end doesn't overlap much with Wal-Mart's focus on low prices, Amazon buying its way into the grocery business has investors fearing the worst. News that Wal-Mart had acquired start-up apparel company Bonobos was completely lost in the fray. As of 12:42 p.m. EDT, Wal-Mart stock was down about 4.5%. Wal-Mart is the largest seller of groceries in the United States, with a market share roughly double that of its closest competitor. The company has grown more aggressive with pricing in recent months, aiming to maintain its dominance. This grocery price war has caused problems for traditional supermarket chains, most notably Kroger, which warned yesterday that price deflation would hurt its earnings going forward. Amazon has long been eyeing the grocery business, slowly rolling out its Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service over the past decade. But the acquisition of Whole Foods is a sign that the e-commerce giant is ready to go all-in on grocery. The grocery business is already being shaken up, with delivery and pick-up services gaining popularity. Wal-Mart has rapidly expanded its online grocery ordering service, offering it at over 600 locations. Image source: Wal-Mart. It's unclear what Amazon's intentions are with the Whole Foods acquisition. If the company maintains the premium pricing strategy that earned Whole Foods the ""Whole Paycheck"" moniker, Wal-Mart's grocery business may not be affected at all. But Amazon could use Whole Foods as a starting point for an aggressive land grab, slashing prices to gain market share and using the stores for delivery and pick-up services. The potential for that scenario, or something similar, seems to be what's driving down shares of Wal-Mart. The grocery business is brutal, with razor-thin margins during good times, and the potential for rapidly falling prices due to intense competition during bad times. Whole Foods has been forced to cut its prices in recent years as mainstream competitors began offering more natural and organic items, and Amazon is now tasked with figuring out how to turn the business around. The grocery business, already in upheaval by the growth of pick-up and delivery services, now has Amazon to contend with. Wal-Mart is in a strong position, with a dominant market share, an intense focus on offering the lowest prices, and a head start in online grocery. But Amazon's Whole Foods acquisition is certainly something for Wal-Mart investors to worry about. ","

If you shop at Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) often, either in the company's stores or online, you've probably been offered to apply for a Best Buy credit card. The card comes in two varieties (Visa and store-specific), both of which offer generous rewards on Best Buy purchases but have above-average interest rates. Here's some information on the card, as well as some alternatives that may fit your lifestyle better. Both cards have essentially the same benefits and costs, which I'll discuss in a minute. They also let cardholders take advantage of special financing offers and use exclusive features such as the new Best Buy Pay feature that streamlines the checkout process on Best Buy's website. Image source: Getty Images. For purchases at Best Buy, the cards' reward rate is among the best in the business. Cardholders get 5% back in rewards on in-store and online purchases, and those who qualify for Elite Plus status by meeting spending requirements get a bump to 6%. The promotional financing is another perk. Best Buy offers promotional financing for purchase above certain thresholds, and this benefit alone can make the card worthwhile. When I bought my home theater a few years ago, Best Buy gave me 24 months of interest-free financing -- a longer term than any standard credit card currently offers. For smaller purchases, offers of six- or 12-month financing are common. As an example, Best Buy currently offers six-month interest-free financing on any purchase of $199 or more. It is also important to point out that while generous, the rewards accumulate in the form of Best Buy Rewards certificates and are not redeemable for cash or a statement credit, as is the case with standard rewards-based credit cards. In other words, your rewards are only redeemable toward Best Buy purchases. However, like most store cards, interest is rather high, which is the main problem. As of this writing, both versions of the Best Buy credit card have a variable APR that's currently set at 25.99%. This is roughly 10 percentage points higher than the national average credit card interest rate, which is around 16%. So, if you don't pay off your purchases in full each month, your interest expense can easily offset the value you get from earning rewards. This can be an especially big problem if you take advantage of an interest-free financing offer and fail to pay off the balance before the end of the promotional period. For example, let's say that you purchase a $3,000 home theater system and have 24-month interest-free financing, with a $50 minimum monthly payment. If you just make the minimum payments, not only will you still have a $1,800 balance on your purchase, but you'll have nearly $1,250 in deferred interest charges added to your 25thÂ monthly bill. In a nutshell, the Best Buy credit card is appropriate for people who shop at Best Buy often, and who don't regularly carry a balance outside of a promotional deferred-interest period. For customers who fit this description, it's difficult to make the case against the card. On the other hand, if you tend to carry a balance from month to month on your credit cards, aren't sure if you'll be able to pay off your purchases during the deferred-interest promotional period, or simply don't shop at Best Buy often, you might be better off with another card that is a better fit for carrying debt.

Applying online can net you a $25 purchase credit on your first transaction, but you could be passing up a free 2-liter bottle of soda for applying in the store. Each store may give extra incentives to applicants. But before you let Walmart pull your credit report just for a sip of something sweet, here's some information on how the Walmart credit card stacks up against its competitors. Image source: Wal-Mart There doesn't appear to be a minimum credit limit, as some report limits as low as $75. Others report limits as high as $20,000. It really depends on your credit history, and if you show you can manage your credit line responsibly, you can ask for a credit limit increase and it won't result in a hard inquiry on your credit report. Image source: Costco. Even if you're a heavy Walmart shopper, neither the Walmart Credit Card nor the MasterCard presents a great value unless you primarily do all your shopping online at Walmart.com. But Walmart shoppers who also take trips to Costco (NASDAQ:COST) may be interested in applying for the Costco Anywhere Visa card. It earns 1% on all purchases, as the Walmart cards do, but purchases made at Costco or online at Costco.com earn 2%. What's more, restaurant and travel purchases earn 3% back, and gas purchases at any gas station earn 4% back on the first $7,000 per year. In addition, Costco offers an introductory 0% interest rate for the first seven months of purchases. The Costco Anywhere Visa card is significantly more useful than the Walmart Credit Cards, especially considering they both still earn 1% cash back at Walmart stores. Image source: Getty Images. If you insist on shopping at a Walmart, then you may be able to do better than the 1% the Walmart credit card offers and still pay no annual fee. Image source: Getty Images. The Walmart Credit Card is fairly lenient on who will get approved. Even consumers with no or poor credit history can usually get approved for a small credit limit. But there may be another option if you don't have the credit score to get approved for one of the alternatives already mentioned. In fact, after the first year of membership, Discover will double the total cash back earned over the first 12 months. So you'll earn the standard rate of 1% cash back on every purchase during the year, and then Discover will double the cash back on your card-member anniversary, effectively earning 2% cash back on every purchase for the first year. Before you apply for the Walmart Credit Card, we recommend you consider applying for a more rewarding cash-back credit card first. The Walmart Credit Card (and that free soda) will still be there if you don't have the credit score to get approved for one of our recommendations. Then you can use the Walmart Credit Card, and our helpful advice, to raise your credit score and qualify for a better card next year. ","

Online retailers enjoy a structural advantage compared to traditional retailers: They don't have the burden of a large store base to maintain. Having too many stores in an environment where sales are shifting online has been the main driver behind the surge in retail bankruptcies over the past few years. Many surviving retailers are closing stores in an effort to adjust. But online retail comes with its own set of costs. Shipping is the obvious one. It's more expensive to ship small numbers of items to customers than it is to ship truckloads of items to stores. Overwhelmingly dominant e-commerce specialistÂ Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) spent a whopping $7.2 billion on shipping in 2016, net of shipping-related revenue like Amazon Prime membership fees. There's another cost that drives down Amazon's margins: advertising. Amazon spent $7.2 billion on marketing in 2016, with that spending aimed at driving customers to its websites. Amazon's marketing spending rose 38% in 2016, while total revenue grew 27% and product sales grew 19%. An Amazon fulfillment center. Image source: Amazon. How does that compare to other retailers? Amazon spent more on marketing last year than Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), Target, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Home Depot, and KrogerÂ  combined. Those retailers collectively produced $800 billion of sales, six times Amazon's total sales. Even for Amazon, with tens of millions of Prime members and a staggering e-commerce lead, getting customers to click ""buy"" isn't cheap. One thing to note: These five retailers report advertising spending, while Amazon reports marketing spending. Marketing is a broader term that encompasses more than just direct spending on ads, so this comparison isn't quite apples-to-apples. However, Amazon states in its 10-K that its marketing costs are largely variable, and that the increase last year was due primarily to increased spending on online and television ads. This suggests that advertising costs account for the bulk of Amazon's marketing spending. Here's a chart showing how much revenue each of these retailers produced last year: Data from annual reports. Chart by author. And here's how much each spent on advertising (or marketing, in Amazon's case): Amazon figure is marketing spending. Data from annual reports. Chart by author. As a percentage of revenue, Amazon spends dramatically more on marketing than any of these other retailers spend on advertising: Data from annual reports. Chart by author. Some brick-and-mortar retailers, particularly department stores, spend an Amazon-like percentage of revenue on advertising. Macy's, for example, spent 4.5% of revenue on advertising last year. But discount retailers like Wal-Mart are able to keep prices low in part because they spend so little on advertising relative to sales. Notably, warehouse club Costco spends nothing on advertising, other than sending coupon books to members and pre-opening mailers to prospective members. Of course, Amazon is growing much faster than these other retailers, and the heavy marketing spending is helping to drive that growth. But high advertising costs seem to be a common denominator when it comes to online retail. Wayfair, an online furniture seller, spent a whopping 12.1% of revenue of advertising in 2016, and its long-term goal is to bring that number down to a range of 6% to 8%. One reason to believe that Amazon will need to continue spending heavily on marketing is the newfound focus of traditional retailers on e-commerce. Wal-Mart has become extremely aggressive, launching a free two-day shipping initiative earlier this year and finding ways to remove costs and lower prices for customers. Wal-Mart's online sales grew by 63% year over year during the first quarter, twice its growth rate during the previous quarter. Best Buy has also turned up the heat over the past few years. The company implemented a price-matching policy both in-store and online, and it started shipping some online orders from its more than 1,000 stores. This not only improved the availability of items online, but it reduced shipping times as well. Best Buy turned its store base, viewed as a liability in the age of e-commerce, into an asset. These initiatives helped drive online sales growth in excess of 20% in the first quarter. But for the same reason that Amazon needs to spend so heavily on marketing to drive sales, traditional retailers going after online sales will likely need to do the same in order to drive customers to their own websites. I wouldn't be surprised to see advertising costs as a percentage of revenue creep up in the coming years for retailers like Wal-Mart and Best Buy as they grow their online businesses. That could, in turn, drive up advertising rates for Amazon and lead to even higher spending. Amazon spends a lot of money driving customers to its website. It would likely need to spend even more if its Prime subscription service weren't so popular. The most successful brick-and-mortar retailers are far more efficient, creating greater revenue for each dollar of advertising. Whether they can maintain that efficiency as sales continue to shift online remains to be seen. ","
      
    Amazon Spends More on Advertising Than Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, Home Depot, and Kroger Combined -- The Motley Fool

Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been a thorn in the side of the rest of the retail industry for some time now. The online retailer's competitive pricing and attractive Prime membership benefits have resulted in steady increases in revenue for Amazon while competitors like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) retool and struggle to keep up with inflation. But the competition may be starting to turn the corner. Wal-Mart posted a 63% increase in online sales in the first quarter. While its string of e-commerce acquisitions headlined by Jet.com certainly helped, management says the majority of growth came from Walmart.com. But one quarter of good results shouldn't scare Amazon investors. The company is still at the forefront of an ongoing megatrend, and its share of the online commerce market is only getting bigger. Image source: Amazon. Online sales continue to chug along at a mid double-digit pace year after year. From the end of 2009 through the end of 2016, U.S. online sales grew at an average rate of 15.9%, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Growth was remarkably steady as well, ranging between 14% and 18.5% during that period. There are no signs of a slowdown either. In fact, sales growth accelerated last year from 14% to 14.8%. Amazon is particularly well positioned to capitalize on the growth of e-commerce. 55% of online shoppers begin their product search on Amazon.com, according to a survey by BloomReach last fall. Importantly, that number is climbing, up from 44% the year before. With top line growth outpacing the overall growth of online sales, it's clear Amazon is grabbing market share even as the market leader. Last year, Amazon accounted for 43% of online sales in the U.S. and 53% of the growth in online sales, according to data from Slice Intelligence. And there's a big security blanket on Amazon that means those numbers probably aren't going anywhere. It might sound dumb, but the reason so many shoppers are starting their product searches on Amazon is because they'd prefer to buy things from Amazon. That's because they're probably a member of Amazon Prime, which includes unlimited two-day shipping on over 50 million items. There's not really an alternative in online retail. Wal-Mart introduced free two-day shipping on orders over $35 earlier this year after its $50 per year ShippingPass program failed to compete with Prime. Still, there's a minimum order requirement and it only applies to 2 million items on Walmart.com. Amazon has attracted over 80 million Americans to Prime, according to the Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Globally, that number is even bigger. Amazon is investing heavily in benefits to lock Prime members into the program. From video and music streaming rights to Prime-exclusive items, the value of Amazon Prime continues to improve. What's more, Amazon is taking steps to increase Prime membership by making it easier to afford for those that need it. It started offering monthly payment plans last year, and it announced plans to offer discounts for customers on government assistance earlier this month. That's a direct appeal to one of Wal-Mart's prime target demographics. Prime membership growth isn't showing any signs of slowing down. As Amazon invests in new benefits and makes it easier for everyone to afford, there's a long runway for growth, especially internationally. As online retail continues booming, Amazon is well-positioned to continue grabbing share of the market even as competitors like Wal-Mart keep trying to pick away at it. ","
      
    Why Amazon.com Inc. Shareholders Have Nothing to Worry About -- The Motley Fool

By now, most of the country has probably heard thatÂ Amazon.com, Inc.Â (NASDAQ:AMZN) is buyingÂ Whole Foods Market, Inc.Â (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion. The deal announced last Friday set off waves throughout the food retail industry as competitor stocks, includingÂ Wal-Mart,Â CostcoÂ Wholesale,Â Target, andÂ Kroger,Â all plummeted. Clearly, the market fears what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos will do with one of the country's best-known supermarket chains. But while it's clear that the market approves of the deal, and some have even speculated that another offer could emerge as shares have risen past the buyout price, the question of how Whole Foods will change under Amazon's guidance remains open. Image source: Whole Foods. Here are three areas that investors and Whole Foods customers can expect to change soon after the deal closes, which is planned for the second half of the year. In addition to its e-commerce might, Amazon is no slouch in the technology realm. It has become a respected innovator with its leading cloud computing service, Amazon Web Services, and devices such as the Echo, driven by the voice-activated Alexa technology. Amazon's most ambitious designs on physical retail came with theÂ Amazon Go cashierless convenience store, which relies on a network of cameras and other sensors to determine what items a customer takes off the shelves and charge them accordingly. The technology is still being fine-tuned as the store is only open to Amazon employees for the time being, but it could potentially revolutionize the industry. Whole Foods' biggest problem has been its reputation for high prices. The company has gained the moniker ""Whole Paycheck,"" and when the deal was reported many joked on TwitterÂ that the price was nothing for a Whole Foods shopper. WHO AMONG US can leave a Whole Foods without spending $13.7 billion.  What Whole Foods needs most, then, in order to break its streak of seven straight declines in comparable sales and return to profit growth, is to bring its prices more in line with those of competitors and erase the perception of being a ripoff. Amazon can help with that in two ways. First, by combining its own supply chain, logistics, and buying power, the company should be able to lower supply chain-related costs at Whole Foods and negotiate lower price on goods. Second, and more importantly, Amazon is an expert at price manipulation. Its prices online change constantly to react to competitor moves and other factors like supply and demand, and the company often prices popular items competitively to create the perception that everything it sells is low-priced. Such a strategy and pricing algorithm could help Whole Foods overcome its pricey reputation. The company is already using digital price tags at its new 365 stores. I'd expect Amazon to roll those out at all Whole Foods location so that the company can experiment with customer responses to different prices and quickly adjust them as needed. Ten years ago Amazon launched AmazonFresh, its first attempt to break into groceries. The company tested that format for six years before expanding it to other cities, and like the rest of its e-commerce business, it's entirely dependent on delivery. Despite the company's purchase of brick-and-mortar supermarket chain with more than 400 locations nationwide, Amazon and Bezos likely see delivery as a way to differentiate itself from competitors and bring value to its customers. Amazon can use Whole Foods stores as a staging ground for its own AmazonFresh deliveries, or a combined delivery program. Whole Foods currently partners with, and is also an investor in, Instacart, and it's unclear what will happen to that partnership once Amazon takes over. Still, Whole Foods has hundred of stores close to the affluent customers Amazon targets for its Fresh program. Shortening the distance between it and its customers will make delivery easier and allow Amazon to lower costs. That could lead to the company lowering the $15/month premium on Fresh membership to $10/month or less. Either way, it's clear that the Whole Foods-Amazon combination will make delivery more powerful. ","
      
    3 Things Whole Foods Gains From Amazon -- The Motley Fool

Jeremy Bowman,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon.com, Inc.'sÂ (NASDAQ:AMZN) $13.7 billion acquisition ofÂ Whole Foods Market, Inc.Â (NASDAQ:WFM) last week was a shot across the bow for the grocery industry. Food retailers, includingÂ Wal-MartÂ (NYSE:WMT),Â CostcoÂ (NASDAQ:COST), andÂ KrogerÂ (NYSE:KR), all fell by 5% or more, with Kroger stock down double-digits that day. The combination of the world's foremost e-commerce business with the most respected brand in organic and natural groceries creates a threat unlike anything the industry has ever seen, but even before that news broke, the sector was already struggling. Grocery stocks plummeted last Thursday after Kroger reported disappointing first-quarter results and lowered its earnings guidance for the year. The S&P 500Â food retail sub index fell by more than 15% that day as the news weighed heavily on peers likeÂ Sprouts Farmers MarketÂ (NASDAQ:SFM),Â SupervaluÂ (NYSE:SVU), and Whole Foods. Below are three factors that are challenging the industry, even before the Amazon-Whole Foods deal. Image source: Getty Images. Lower commodity food prices may sound like good news for supermarkets, but they've weighed on revenue, compressed profits, and accelerated a price war. Food prices have fallen for the longest sustained period in 50 years as egg prices recovered from an avian flu epidemic and beef, poultry, and dairy prices have largely been down. A number of chains, including Sprouts and Kroger, noted deflationary pressures when they lowered their guidance last year, and lower prices were largely responsible for the end of Kroger's 52-quarter streak of same-store sales growth earlier this year. At the same time, higher labor costs resulting from minimum wage hikes and a tighter labor market have forced supermarket chains to pay workers more. Wal-Mart lifted its base wage to $10/hour last year, and Kroger said on its earnings call last week that it was lifting its pay in some competitive markets. Deflationary pressures are expected to ease up later in the year, but the damage to grocery stocks has already been done. Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods is the most obvious example of the tightening competitive landscape in the industry, but even before the Whole Foods deal, Amazon was stepping up its investments in groceries. It expanded AmazonFresh to a number of cities last year, and opened the first two AmazonFresh pick-up stations earlier this year in Seattle. It's also testing the cashierless Amazon Go convenience store, also in Seattle, which has the power to revolutionize the whole industry if the technology behind it proves successful. Elsewhere, German discounter Lidl just opened the first of as many as 600 stores in the US. The chain known for rock-bottom prices is expected to pressure Wal-Mart, having leveled its Asda subsidiary in the U.K., and also dollar-store chains. Its fellow German discounter says it will add another 800 stores over the next five years, upping the pressure on downscale stores.Â Meanwhile, entrenched chains likeÂ Wal-Mart, Costco, and Target continue to add new stores, and meal-kit concepts likeÂ Blue ApronÂ (NYSE:APRN)Â have popped up, taking billions of dollars in sales from traditional grocery stores. The rub with all this additional competition is that someone has to lose. Unlike other industries, volume sales of groceries are essentially fixed as individual appetites aren't growing and the U.S. population expands by only about 1% annually. In other words, room for growth is very limited in the market. Supermarkets haven't experienced the upheaval that, say, department stores have, but the changing retail landscape is affecting storefronts of all kinds as falling traffic is bad for any brick-and-mortar business. Notably, while supermarkets are struggling, so are many restaurant chains, though pizza delivery continues to be one of the few food concepts that have thrived since the recession, asÂ Domino's PizzaÂ andÂ Papa John'sÂ shares have soared. As Americans get used to shopping online and streaming movies and TV shows, it only makes sense that they would want their food delivered as well, which also explains the growing popularity of meal kit services. Supermarkets are adapting -- many have partnered with Instacart or other delivery services, and chains likeÂ Wal-Mart and Kroger have invested heavily in grocery pick-up kiosks as a compromise between delivery and in-store shopping. But there's a cost to these adjustments. Wal-Mart doesn't even charge for its pick-up service, yet it still has to pay for the additional level of service involved, as well as the buildout costs for the kiosks. As consumer habits change, grocery chains will have to continue to adapt, and that likely means increased costs, at least in the near-term. With Amazon's reputation for crushing industry margins, a challenging situation now only looks worse. ","
      
    3 Reasons Grocery Stocks Are Toxic Right Now -- The Motley Fool

Rich Duprey,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Trying to assign a word like ""best"" or ""top"" to department stores these days may seem like a (small-f) fool's errand. Investors appear to be waiting for the other shoe to drop on mid-tier chains like J.C. Penney, Macy's, and Sears HoldingsÂ asÂ Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)Â steals away most of their customers. Even at the high end, there's trouble, withÂ Nordstrom considering going private and privately held Neiman-Marcus entering merger discussions with Canada's Hudson's Bay (a deal that reportedly fell through). If you really want to find the top department stores, you've got to look at the discount end. Indeed, Macy's CFO has called off-price chains a bigger threat than e-commerce. For all of Amazon's vaunted retail prowess, which is considerable, it has been unable to appreciably beat the value consumers find at Burlington Stores (NYSE:BURL), TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Burlington Stores is not just coats anymore. Image source: Burlington Stores. Despite a rare first-quarter miss, Burlington Stores remains on an upward swing. Sales were up 5% for the period, but that was mostly because of new stores opening; comparable sales growth was only 0.5% higher, below not only Wall Street's expectations, but management's as well, as it had been looking for a 1% to 2% increase. Burlington admitted it had a rough March-April period, but it said May was strong, with comps running 4.5% higher. It's had a good run over the past few years, with full-year comps rising 4% or more in three of the last four years, a time when most retailers were seeing same-store sales fall. That led to rising gross margin rates, which have widened from 38.8% in 2012 to almost 41% last year. Even in the first quarter, gross margins expanded by 80 basis points.Â The company continues to see its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization grow, too. Burlington's success comes from selling a broad selection of current brand-name apparel at everyday low prices. Maybe it's because of the internet and Amazon conditioning shoppers to only accept discounted prices, but Burlington has tapped into that mindset and made it a successful play. Image source: Marshall's. Similarly, the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshall's, and Home Goods has benefited from the consumer wanting top-brand clothes at a good price. While Burlington Stores stock has outperformed TJX Companies over the last 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods, TJX has come to epitomize the discount retail experience. Like its rival, T.J. Maxx and Marshall's aren't selling closeout goods, but rather today's fashions. And it has a speedy inventory turnaround that makes it more like fast-fashion stars H&M and Zara, which take fashion trends from the runways and put them onto store racks in a matter of weeks. According to Morningstar, TJX turns over its inventory in under 59 days, compared with 84 days at Burlington and 134 days at J.C. Penney. And by also offering everyday low pricing on its merchandise that is some 20% to 60% below its mid-tier competition, the discount chain creates a treasure-hunt experience that draws in shoppers. TJX data by YCharts. That's why, over the past two-and-a-half decades, TJX Companies stock has appreciated more than 6,400%. Sure, Amazon is stealing customers from Macy's and the others, but so is TJX, and it will likely continue doing so. Image source: Wal-Mart. Increasingly, Wal-Mart has its feet in both camps. Obviously, its 11,700 brick-and-mortar stores around the world comprise the lion's share of its revenues -- $117.5 billion in just the first quarter alone -- but e-commerce is becoming an ever more critical component of the company's operations. U.S. e-commerce sales surged 63% in the fiscal 2018 first quarter, and with its acquisition of Jet.com last year, it's only going to grow even more, and faster. That move is also a wedge in blunting the impact Amazon will have on its business. Recently Wal-Mart made the decision to carry more of its store brand merchandise on the e-commerce platform, a strategically important decision because it helps grow profit margins. It's also a competitive one since Jet.com just dropped Costco's private-label Kirkland brand, which is a blow to its rival because it was the third largest online seller of Kirkland products behind Amazon and Costco itself, accounting for 5.5% of the total. But Wal-Mart knows how to do discounting very well, and it has recommitted itself to its everyday low pricing model. It's turning away from being promotional and looking to offer shoppers good value all the time. As a result, its CEO is asking its vendors for less ad funding and to focus instead on giving better off-invoice pricing. Wal-Mart's stock has risen sharply from its 52-week lows, gaining more than 20% since hitting a low of $65 a stub back in February. Now its stock is up 13% for the year, and with better sales and a cohesive online strategy gaining traction, Wal-Mart is one of the top department-store stocks today.

    The 3 Best Department Store Stocks to Buy in 2017 -- The Motley Fool

  "
Motley Fool Staff,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Aldi plans to spend $3.4 billion to add or renovate stores in the United States while Lidl has begun opening its first stores here. Both chains offer limited selections and low prices. Their expansion into the U.S. has been noticed by major players like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), which has made efforts to bring its own prices down. A full transcript follows the video. Vincent Shen: The news is Aldi is spending about $3.4 billion to expand its store network, hit about 2,500 locations over the next five years. TheÂ company currently has about 1,600Â stores. They will add 400 in 2017, and it well spend another $1.6 billion to remodel aÂ significant number of them. On top of that, to throw another player into this, fellowÂ German low-cost competitor Lidl will beÂ opening its stores this month, June 15th, as it plans anÂ initial base of 100 locations. The first ones are opening up in theÂ Carolinas and Virginia. These are definitely some first shots in thatÂ price war that I mentioned among the grocery stores and supermarkets. Lidl has touted prices up to 50% lower than competitors.Â Aldi says they will be at least 21% lower. Do you think that the entry of theseÂ companies and the expansion of some of these German competitors is going to really shake things up like they've managed to do in Europe? Daniel Kline: I think it's great for the American consumer on a number of levels. There'sÂ already been pricing pressure in the grocery game,Â because you have Amazon and other players who can deliver youÂ some items, if not all items in certain markets. ButÂ Wal-Mart has already come out and saidÂ it's going to invest in pricing. Costco, when they raised their membership fees, said, ""We'reÂ going to put most of this increase back into lowering pricing,""Â which is what they have traditionally done, it'sÂ not necessarily a response here. ButÂ if you are in a market -- andÂ I live in Southern Florida,Â we haveÂ Publix. Pretty much that's all we have. There's a lot of Publix, there'sÂ occasionally aÂ Whole Foods,Â and sometimes there's aÂ Trader Joe's. There isn't a Trader Joe's near me. If a Lidl or an Aldi comes in and it's conveniently located in the same realm as the Publix, Publix is going to have to go, ""OK, myÂ prices, I have to think about that."" So,Â just the presence of competition is great for consumers. TheÂ other really important thing about this, andÂ it's partly why these companies are moving now, is that we have a glut ofÂ available retail space. So these companies -- andÂ these are small stores, 12,000 to 20,000 square footÂ stores between the two chains -- they're going to snap up space in strip malls and mallsÂ that needs to be filled. And that's going to be good for other businesses. Even some businesses that are doing well, but are being hurt by the fact that, maybe theÂ SearsÂ that anchored theirÂ strip mall went out of business. So there's going to be a ripple effect by all these stores coming in. Shen: Dan,Â I would like to add a little bit of detail on exactly how these companies operate, so that they're able to offer such competitive pricing. Kline: A lot of house brands. Shen: Exactly. WhenÂ it comes down to it, for a place like Aldi,Â to put up these prices where they can claim, ""OurÂ prices will be at least 21% lower than any competitor out there,"" the first thing is whatÂ you mentioned in terms of the smaller stores -- 12,000 to 20,000 square feet,Â versus a traditionalÂ KrogerÂ orÂ Harris Teeter, for example, might be around 50,000 square feet or more. The smaller stores means less SKUs, which are essentially, theÂ stock keeping units, or the code,Â assigned to each item. That gives you a small footprint, it'sÂ less of an investment there, and also just a simpler supply chain with these in-house brands which, for Aldi,Â make up about 90% of their merchandise. This allows the company to work directly with the food producers, and they avoid a lot of the costs of marketing, andÂ also the premium that you get that you have to pay for the big branded products out there when you have these in-house offerings. Kline: It'sÂ also a varied merchandise. When you go to Publix,Â obviously there's a certain amount of seasonal merchandise. WhenÂ Valentine's Day is coming up,Â they're going to have a Valentine's Day section, andÂ that switches to Mother's Day when it's appropriate. But both Aldi and Lidl do things like sell flip flops when it's going to be summer, in a market where that's appropriate. And even their core food offering changes based on pricing. I'veÂ often joked that you can't go to AldiÂ knowing what you plan to make for dinner. You have to go to AldiÂ and see what they have,Â and then make your choices, whichÂ I have always found is a frustrating shopping experience. But that's how they drive value. If their buyer looks at the chain and says, ""I was going to bring in lamb this week, but the prices are too high,"" they may not have that on their shelves at a given time, andÂ you sort of have to go with the flow, but it does mean you'reÂ always going to get a better value. Shen: Wrapping upÂ a little bit of our discussion, I wantÂ to provide a little bit of context here, forÂ what exactly this market looks like, what Aldi and Lidl are diving into, and what the competition and the size and scale of this market is. For U.S. grocery food and beverage industry, we'reÂ looking atÂ hundreds of billions of dollars, about $800 billion. At this point, even with its 1,600 locations, reports I could find put Aldi share at single digits, low single digits at that. But it'sÂ growing very quickly,Â whereas if you go to the leader of the pack, which is Wal-Mart, they haveÂ closer to about a 20% share of the groceries business in this country.Â I was speaking to Sarah Priestley,Â another analyst here at The Motley Fool,Â before the show, and she brought up anÂ interesting point in that, at this moment, especially with Lidl's entry this month into the market as well, I think a lot ofÂ American grocery chains, she mentioned, areÂ getting the warning signs because Aldi and Lidl have madeÂ such a big splash in Europe, they'reÂ grown their market share very quickly,Â double-digit rates. From her personal experience back in the U.K.,Â they forced major chains likeÂ TescoÂ toÂ really bring down their prices andÂ changed the competitive landscape there. So when it comes down to it,Â you have the giants out there like Wal-Mart and Kroger, but these guys can really induce some of those price savings for consumers overall, and change the expectations of what our grocery stores look like. Kline: AndÂ I think it's going to force consolidation. ThroughÂ the past couple decades, you've already seenÂ not the total demise, but largely, the veryÂ small regional chains have gone away,Â or the single mom and pop grocery stores,Â a lot of those are gone. So some of these regional chains areÂ going to have to combineÂ to have the buying power. AndÂ you'll probably seeÂ some traditional grocery stores not beÂ able to make the transition. You now have, in addition to Aldi and Lidl, you have Wal-Mart, Costco, Amazon,Â prices are being forced down. AndÂ unless you're Whole Foods,Â which has built up a premium audience, and they are having their struggles as well,Â it's going to be very hard to compete if you can't buy these items at the sameÂ prices as these much bigger companies. Shen: Yeah.Â My last point here,Â it's a little bit on competition, going back to Wal-Mart. TheirÂ grocery business makes up over half of their revenue. I was reading about a test that they started earlier this yearÂ in over 1,000 stores, where they'reÂ doing a lot of pricing comparison to beat out places like Aldi and Kroger, in anticipation of this increasing competition, the more stores moving into the U.S. that they'll have to face off with. The hope is that they can lower their prices enough thatÂ Wal-Mart thinks they've won over customersÂ pretty definitively,Â and then they can adjust their pricing as necessary. There were some leaks thatÂ Wal-Mart is going to some of their big suppliers,Â especially for some of the packaged goods --Â think companies likeÂ UnileverÂ andÂ Procter & GambleÂ --Â and basically telling them, ""We needÂ the prices that you charge us to be 15% lower,"" the idea being that Wal-Mart wants to reclaim the title of low-cost leader -- Kline: And that's a general big box practice. I've done some selling to big boxes, and if you get a SKU in, they will come back to you every year, every 18 months, and say, ""How can you make it 3% cheaper?"" AndÂ in some cases, they will even help you build a new factory,Â or do whatever it is you have to do, or, you could say, ""Yeah,Â if you placed an order that was twice as big,Â here's what the price could be."" So, they'reÂ going to work every angle. I think it's also worth notingÂ that I had a story earlier this week that, atÂ Sam's Club, the Wal-Mart version of Costco, their warehouse club, they consolidated their in-house brandÂ from a whole bunch of different labels under one name. AndÂ I think that's something we're going to see more of, where Wal-Mart uses itsÂ Member's Mark brand andÂ really tries to compete with these people. That's going to put some pressure on some of these name brands, to either lower prices or find new ways to compete. ","
      
    America Should Get Ready for a Grocery Price War -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Not every item sold at a warehouse club is a good deal. Image source: Costco. When you spend the money to join a warehouse club like Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) Sam's Club, or BJ's Wholesale Club, it's tempting to buy a ton of stuff to justify the membership cost. The problem is that many items sold in these stores come in bulk quantities that exceed what you will logically use. Buying a ""deal"" like that leads to waste, or to have to find ways to consume the item. There are definitely items never to buy at a warehouse club and many that you should only buy under special circumstances. There are, however, some items that are almost always a good deal at Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's. These six make that list and can help make your membership worth it. Liquor prices for house brands tend to be well below those for major names. Image source: Getty Images. Not every warehouse club location has a liquor store. The ones that do offer tremendous deals on name brands, but even better prices on high-quality house liquor brands. These are spirits made for the membership-based shopping clubs by major manufacturers, which sell at prices well below the name brands. You may have to try a few to find your favorites, but the potential savings makes that well worth it. Hearing aids usually cost less at warehouse clubs. Image source: Getty Images. The same hearing aids that are sold for thousands of dollars at brand-name or local mom-and-pop shops cost much less at Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's. Again, not every location has a hearing center (and in those that do, its hours may not be the same as the full store's). The ones that do, however, will have trained technicians offering hearing tests and customer fittings. Who says romance can't be done on a budget? Image source: Getty Images. ""Costco is one of the best places to get a smart deal on diamond engagement rings,"" CreditDonkey's Charles Tran told The Motley FoolÂ in an email interview. ""The $55 membership fee can save you thousands on a ring."" It's a case of volume. Costco and Sam's Club (and to a lesser extent BJ's) have more buying power than local jewelry stores and chains. They further extend that by only carrying a narrow line of rings. That will limit your choices, but help keep your cost in check. Accounting software can be found at warehouse clubs or on their websites. Image source: Intuit. These deals vary during the course of the year and by the chain, but in general, the warehouse clubs offer the lowest prices around for popular business accounting software including Intuit's QuickBooks Online. This is the same software you can subscribe to directly from the manufacturer, but at a better price. Buying a discounted gift card is essentially getting free money. Image source: Getty Images. In a case where selection will vary seemingly day by day, Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's often have gift cards at deal prices. This could be something like three $25 cards for a restaurant chain for $60. These deals won't just be for eateries, but sometimes also for stores or even gym memberships. The warehouse clubs sometimes have discount tickets for Universal Studios (home of the various Harry Potter attractions). Image source: Universal Studios. Some of the biggest theme parks in the country will sometimes offer better prices through warehouse clubs than they do at their own gates. This can be especially true for some of the major attractions in the Orlando area; the companies who own them assume that once a person has traveled there, they're not going to cancel a visit to the attraction because the tickets cost too much. Of course, look at blackout dates, the rules regarding expiration, and how long you have to use remaining days purchased after you use the first one. ","
      
    6 Things You Should Always Buy at a Warehouse Club -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In the next five years, German low-cost grocery chain Aldi is planning to spend billions expanding its U.S. footprint and revamping existing stores. Meanwhile, its fellow German rival, Lidl, is also taking steps to make its debut in the States. A full transcript follows the video. Dan Kline: Hey, Vince!Â Thanks for having me! Shen: Sure thing. Kicking off, because we have a lot to talk about today,Â let's start with Microsoft. Back in March,Â I covered major developmentsÂ in the video game industry,Â one of those was the expected launch of a console update from Microsoft, whichÂ at the time was just called Project Scorpio.Â I want to circle back on that storyÂ since the Electronic Entertainment Expo hasÂ officially started this week, and Microsoft made its bigÂ announcement, giving Project Scorpio an official product name,Â the Xbox One X. AÂ lot of the rumors and projections for the new console have borne out. It toutsÂ 4K graphics,Â backwards compatibility, so your One XÂ will play many of your oldÂ Xbox, Xbox 360, andÂ Xbox One titles, whileÂ also working with your Xbox One accessories.Â Microsoft claims on its productÂ page that the Xbox One X is ""theÂ world's most powerful console, withÂ 40% more power than any other console."" Dan, what are your first impressions here? Kline: It'sÂ really expensive, and nobody is going to buy it.Â [laughs] But,Â I don't think that's what Microsoft is going after. It's $499. AndÂ Microsoft has already shown that people will buy aÂ cheaper console rather than spend $499. TheyÂ tried that last timeÂ when they introduced Xbox One,Â or the Xbox, and it hadÂ the motion detector, I don't even remember what it was called -- Shen: The Kinect. Kline: The Kinect. AndÂ basically, people waited until they sold an unbundled version,Â and that gaveÂ SonyÂ (NYSE:SNE)Â a little bit of a lead. But,Â Microsoft still has those products. This is a lot like what AppleÂ does with theÂ iPad Pro. They don't think aÂ huge percentage of their audience is going to go buy the iPad Pro, butÂ they want to capture the small percentage that want that, andÂ have a building block for the future. So,Â this is the next XboxÂ that only a very small percentage of people are going to buy, and then, if the prices come down,Â they will eventually be the $399 Xbox or the $349,Â and it will be the one that ties in really well with HoloLens andÂ all the other things that require processing power thatÂ Microsoft is building, and will become norms,Â maybe not this year but over the next few years. Shen: Yeah.Â I think that's a very good point. I was thinking about who this console isÂ really targeted forÂ with the release, the price tag, the specs. Obviously, you have your die-hardÂ Xbox fans out there. But,Â ultimately, this is stillÂ just an improved rehashÂ of the Xbox One S thatÂ came out last August. So it's not a true next generation release. Kline: Yeah. And we're probably seven or eight years from a true next generation. So this is really an answer to Sony having a similar high-end console,Â although I believe it's a little cheaper, andÂ it's really building the platform soÂ they can start to build outÂ virtual and augmented reality. ItÂ doesn't add very much new,Â except a faster processor and 4K support. TheÂ previous Xbox One had the backwards capability, as well. So it's meant to be exciting,Â but the reason you announce this at E3 isÂ because it's for hardcore gamers. It's not, right now, aÂ mainstream product. Shen: AndÂ the thing is, you have the Xbox One X, but I think the big thing thisÂ console lacks is theseÂ new titles that are coming out along with it that areÂ exclusive and will gen up a lot ofÂ interest in the product. You have these Xbox One X Enhanced titlesÂ that will be able to take advantage of the more powerful hardwareÂ and specs in this release. Otherwise, theÂ technology in the One X is supposed to make existing titles look better,Â and there might be updates to existing titles to helpÂ bolster their graphics with the 4K support. Kline:Â DoÂ you have an Xbox One? Shen: I do not. Kline: I do. AndÂ I've never looked at any game and thought, ""Wow,Â this isn't really awesome."" AndÂ I'm older than you, I remember playing Pac-ManÂ on an Atari 2600, whereÂ it was amazing because it kind of looked like an arcade, soÂ admittedly I'm somewhat easy to amazeÂ when it comes to games, given when I started. ButÂ I don't think there's any person who's going to spend anÂ extra $150Â just for those enhancements,Â especially because you have to have a 4K TV to takeÂ advantage of them. This is really for the people who have that,Â they bought the 4K TV,Â they understand the difference, they watched the little bit of programmingÂ that's available. It's really just a niche audience, butÂ eventually it will be a bigger audience. Shen: I will add that 4KÂ televisions are expected to make up about one in four TVs shippedÂ worldwide in 2017. So the penetration is still limited,Â but a lot of the forecasts out there do say thatÂ 4K TVs are expected to grow in popularity, andÂ become a bigger portion over time. Kline: Sure. Shipped is not sold, though. They shippedÂ a lot of 3D TVs as well. Shen: Fair enough. FinalÂ takeaways for me, at least,Â I think the point you made about how thisÂ feels a little bit like history repeating itself. So you go back to 2013,Â a little bit of context, Sony and Microsoft unveiled theirÂ actual next generation consoles --Â being the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One -- andÂ Sony priced the PS4 at $399,Â Microsoft charged $500 paired with that Kinect that you mentioned, Dan. AndÂ that ended up hurting the company, I think, with a little bitÂ slower momentum in the beginning. And four years later, theÂ divide in terms of sales performance between these two consoles has widened. SonyÂ has led this generation with about 60 million units sold, and whileÂ Microsoft does not report numbers for the Xbox One,Â estimates put sales at approximately 25 to 30 million. So today, we have this similar situation, theÂ PlayStation 4 Pro,Â which is the closest competitor,Â released last year by Sony to thisÂ Xbox One X, runs $399. Then,Â the Xbox One X, you mentioned, it's $500,Â $100 more expensive. It might have stronger specs, but really,Â are they enough to get mostÂ consumers to buy in? AndÂ based on the experience so far, SonyÂ hasn't released any specific sales numbersÂ for their PlayStation 4 Pro butÂ said it made up about 20% ofÂ PlayStation 4 salesÂ since the release, soÂ estimates of around 2.5 to 3 million. So not a blockbuster seller by any means. It will beÂ interesting to see how they compete,Â $500 for the Xbox One X versusÂ $400 for the Pro. The console is beingÂ officially released on November 7th. MovingÂ onto our next topic, we have Wal-MartÂ sales associates taking to the road. Dan, you pointed out this news to me recently. We oftenÂ hear about how major brick-and-mortar retailersÂ want to leverage their extensive geographic footprintsÂ as an advantage over online competitors. You have all these storesÂ located across the country, whereas more pure play e-commerce players might have more limited networks of distribution fulfillment centers. These efforts, though, take various forms. And Wal-Mart is taking anÂ interesting approach, announced earlier this month, whereÂ they want to have store employeesÂ actually deliver some of their online orders toÂ nearby customers. This is a small test, withÂ just one store in ArkansasÂ near the company headquarters, and two in New Jersey,Â which is closer to the base for Jet.com, whichÂ Wal-Mart acquired for about $3 billion recently. TheÂ number of orders fulfilledÂ this way with employeeÂ deliveries, it's only in the hundreds so far, soÂ a very small test. What do you think, Dan? IsÂ this another innovative idea? OrÂ is this another dart in the wallÂ among many efforts? Kline: It's a mindset. When they bought Jet.com -- andÂ I've written about this a lot of times -- they bought themÂ largely from Marc Lore, the CEO, theÂ serial entrepreneur. I saw Marc Lore speak at Shoptalk, and he talked a lot about infusing a start-up mentality into Wal-Mart. I used to run a piece of myÂ family business, aÂ ladder and scaffolding company,Â and if a customer called and said, ""I need two braces or myÂ scaffolding can't get up,""Â because we were a family business,Â we had an all-hands-on-deck mentality. If that meantÂ throwing it in the back of my station wagon andÂ driving it out there in the middle of the night orÂ on my way home or whatever it was,Â that's what you did. AndÂ that's what Wal-Mart's doing here.Â I don't think they expect that a large percentage of their orders areÂ going to be delivered by store employees on their way home. But this is just creating a mechanism. YouÂ can't do it willy nillyÂ at a big company the way you can at a small company. This is creating a system where,Â if an order needs to go out, a manager could say, ""Hey,Â anyone going home in this direction?"" Someone can raise their hand, the employee can get compensated for it. It's a failsafe. It's a start-up logic. At Jet.com in the early days, when you'reÂ trying to ship orders, anything goes. Marc Lore was probably stuffing boxes, that's just how it works. So this is really about getting Wal-Mart to think, ""We are not aÂ physical store, we are in the business of getting products to peopleÂ however they want them."" Shen: OK,Â fair enough. SomeÂ numbers I will throw out there, though,Â to put this into perspective --Â I know right now it's a limited test,Â and you're right, whether or not it becomes thisÂ major avenue through which they can bolster their e-commerce business, which has been growing quite well since their Jet.com acquisition, since Marc Lore has taken over the online sideÂ of the business. The company has 1.5 million U.S. employees. They mention this in the blog post about thisÂ initiative -- 90% of the U.S.Â population lives within 10 miles of a Wal-Mart store. So how this essentially works,Â in terms of the details, the employees only need to haveÂ their own car,Â they need to pass a background check,Â and then they get outfitted with a mobile app that essentially plans their deliveries based on a route that's convenient to their commute. Then,Â they can deliver up to 10 packages daily, and there's some weight and size limits of their choiceÂ so that they can handle it. You mentioned thatÂ the company says that the employees are paid for their time,Â although there are very little details released regarding how,Â whether it's the number of packages you deliver orÂ the amount of time you spent delivering them. But when it comes down to it, this touches on a topic, I think, that Dan, you and I covered quite some time ago,Â probably a year ago or more, whenÂ we were talking about last mile delivery and logistics,Â the idea that you might be getting your package from across the country,Â but that last mile often accounts for 50% orÂ even more of the actual expenses of the delivery. Kline: It'sÂ the big challenge, it's whyÂ AmazonÂ has putÂ warehouses in different markets,Â and they're working on crazy things like drones or trucks that can 3D print your item as you order, andÂ pretty much every way possible working with partners to get it to your actual house. This, for Wal-Mart, becomes another arrow in the quiver. They'reÂ not going to stop using planes and trucks and distribution warehouses for online orders. ButÂ there's going to be times when you go to order something and the only one of what you order is in a warehouse or a Wal-Mart store three miles from your house,Â and the logical way to do it is pick it offÂ the shelf and bring it to you. And that's something that Wal-Mart has been working on with internal apps and different tools so that their logistics get better, so they don't have one inventory for the store and one inventory for the digital operation. They'reÂ trying to make everything one operation. HavingÂ been a retailer myself,Â in a much smaller way, it is a big challenge when you have customers shopping in the store, and even someone who calls you up and says, ""Do you have a so-and-so, can you set it aside for me?"" whenÂ multiple people want the same thing at the same time. So this is a big headache for Wal-Mart, butÂ they're figuring out how to get it done, andÂ they're throwing a lot of technology at it and matching it with, ""Hey, who's willing to help out?"" which should be good for morale. And when a Wal-Mart worker shows up at your door to deliver your package, that's going to be good for brand loyalty, as well. Shen: I will add, we talk a little bit about the expense side with last-mile delivery, and also the turnaround time. Obviously, you have the Amazons of the world competing with one-hour delivery, two-day standard. Wal-Mart noted thatÂ a lot of these employee-delivered packages made it toÂ customers the day after they placed the order, so essentially an overnight fulfillment. This is, I think, another example, when it comes down to it, of how the company has tested partnerships. They went with ride-hailing services likeÂ Lyft and Uber delivering packagesÂ previously. You have companies likeÂ DoorDashÂ andÂ InstacartÂ offering similar services. ButÂ this is just a little bit more efficient,Â instead of having the drivers from those companiesÂ come to your store, pick up the package, and deliver it, you have employees doing it on the way home. I think it will be really interesting to see, going forward, what other ideas like this Marc Lore will bring to the table, now that he's running the online business. It shows, the way you mentioned, this mindset, and how they are willing to experiment and grow that part of the company as necessary. Kline: Yeah,Â I think everything is in the mix. If you're in a market where delivery via sled dog makes sense, or hot air balloon, orÂ whatever it happens to be, or putting it on a raft andÂ floating it out to the iceberg, all of these things, in some tiny way, are going to figure in -- OK,Â probably not the last one, but mostÂ of these things are going to figure in. And Lore is just building this culture of, we have promised a customer two-day delivery, how do we meet or beat that? And that's a very Amazon way of looking at things. I'll point out, as someone who orders five or six things at minimum a week from Amazon, it's pretty often that the two-day delivery shows up in one day. Shen: Onto the AldiÂ expansion,Â with the expected price war that's heating upÂ among the various players in the grocery industry in the U.S., the news is Aldi is spending about $3.4 billion to expand its store network, hit about 2,500 locations over the next five years. TheÂ company currently has about 1,600Â stores. They will add 400 in 2017, and it well spend another $1.6 billion to remodel aÂ significant number of them. On top of that, to throw another player into this, fellowÂ German low-cost competitor Lidl will beÂ opening its stores this month, June 15th, as it plans anÂ initial base of 100 locations. The first ones are opening up in theÂ Carolinas and Virginia. These are definitely some first shots in thatÂ price war that I mentioned among the grocery stores and supermarkets. Lidl has touted prices up to 50% lower than competitors.Â Aldi says they will be at least 21% lower. Do you think that the entry of theseÂ companies and the expansion of some of these German competitors is going to really shake things up like they've managed to do in Europe? Kline: I think it's great for the American consumer on a number of levels. There'sÂ already been pricing pressure in the grocery game,Â because you have Amazon and other players who can deliver youÂ some items, if not all items in certain markets. ButÂ Wal-Mart has already come out and saidÂ it's going to invest in pricing. Costco, when they raised their membership fees, said, ""We'reÂ going to put most of this increase back into lowering pricing,""Â which is what they have traditionally done, it'sÂ not necessarily a response here. ButÂ if you are in a market -- andÂ I live in Southern Florida,Â we haveÂ Publix. Pretty much that's all we have. There's a lot of Publix, there'sÂ occasionally aÂ Whole Foods,Â and sometimes there's aÂ Trader Joe's. There isn't a Trader Joe's near me. If a Lidl or an Aldi comes in and it's conveniently located in the same realm as the Publix, Publix is going to have to go, ""OK, myÂ prices, I have to think about that."" So,Â just the presence of competition is great for consumers. TheÂ other really important thing about this, andÂ it's partly why these companies are moving now, is that we have a glut ofÂ available retail space. So these companies -- andÂ these are small stores, 12,000 to 20,000 square footÂ stores between the two chains -- they're going to snap up space in strip malls and mallsÂ that needs to be filled. And that's going to be good for other businesses. Even some businesses that are doing well, but are being hurt by the fact that, maybe theÂ SearsÂ that anchored theirÂ strip mall went out of business. So there's going to be a ripple effect by all these stores coming in. Shen: Dan,Â I would like to add a little bit of detail on exactly how these companies operate, so that they're able to offer such competitive pricing. Kline: A lot of house brands. Shen: Exactly. WhenÂ it comes down to it, for a place like Aldi,Â to put up these prices where they can claim, ""OurÂ prices will be at least 21% lower than any competitor out there,"" the first thing is whatÂ you mentioned in terms of the smaller stores -- 12,000 to 20,000 square feet,Â versus a traditionalÂ KrogerÂ orÂ Harris Teeter, for example, might be around 50,000 square feet or more. The smaller stores means less SKUs, which are essentially, theÂ stock keeping units, or the code,Â assigned to each item. That gives you a small footprint, it'sÂ less of an investment there, and also just a simpler supply chain with these in-house brands which, for Aldi,Â make up about 90% of their merchandise. This allows the company to work directly with the food producers, and they avoid a lot of the costs of marketing, andÂ also the premium that you get that you have to pay for the big branded products out there when you have these in-house offerings. Kline: It'sÂ also a varied merchandise. When you go to Publix,Â obviously there's a certain amount of seasonal merchandise. WhenÂ Valentine's Day is coming up,Â they're going to have a Valentine's Day section, andÂ that switches to Mother's Day when it's appropriate. But both Aldi and Lidl do things like sell flip flops when it's going to be summer, in a market where that's appropriate. And even their core food offering changes based on pricing. I'veÂ often joked that you can't go to AldiÂ knowing what you plan to make for dinner. You have to go to AldiÂ and see what they have,Â and then make your choices, whichÂ I have always found is a frustrating shopping experience. But that's how they drive value. If their buyer looks at the chain and says, ""I was going to bring in lamb this week, but the prices are too high,"" they may not have that on their shelves at a given time, andÂ you sort of have to go with the flow, but it does mean you'reÂ always going to get a better value. Shen: Wrapping upÂ a little bit of our discussion, I wantÂ to provide a little bit of context here, forÂ what exactly this market looks like, what Aldi and Lidl are diving into, and what the competition and the size and scale of this market is. For U.S. grocery food and beverage industry, we'reÂ looking atÂ hundreds of billions of dollars, about $800 billion. At this point, even with its 1,600 locations, reports I could find put Aldi share at single digits, low single digits at that. But it'sÂ growing very quickly,Â whereas if you go to the leader of the pack, which is Wal-Mart, they haveÂ closer to about a 20% share of the groceries business in this country.Â I was speaking to Sarah Priestley,Â another analyst here at The Motley Fool,Â before the show, and she brought up anÂ interesting point in that, at this moment, especially with Lidl's entry this month into the market as well, I think a lot ofÂ American grocery chains, she mentioned, areÂ getting the warning signs because Aldi and Lidl have madeÂ such a big splash in Europe, they'reÂ grown their market share very quickly,Â double-digit rates. From her personal experience back in the U.K.,Â they forced major chains likeÂ TescoÂ toÂ really bring down their prices andÂ changed the competitive landscape there. So when it comes down to it,Â you have the giants out there like Wal-Mart and Kroger, but these guys can really induce some of those price savings for consumers overall, and change the expectations of what our grocery stores look like. Kline: AndÂ I think it's going to force consolidation. ThroughÂ the past couple decades, you've already seenÂ not the total demise, but largely, the veryÂ small regional chains have gone away,Â or the single mom and pop grocery stores,Â a lot of those are gone. So some of these regional chains areÂ going to have to combineÂ to have the buying power. AndÂ you'll probably seeÂ some traditional grocery stores not beÂ able to make the transition. You now have, in addition to Aldi and Lidl, you have Wal-Mart, Costco, Amazon,Â prices are being forced down. AndÂ unless you're Whole Foods,Â which has built up a premium audience, and they are having their struggles as well,Â it's going to be very hard to compete if you can't buy these items at the sameÂ prices as these much bigger companies. Shen: Yeah.Â My last point here,Â it's a little bit on competition, going back to Wal-Mart. TheirÂ grocery business makes up over half of their revenue. I was reading about a test that they started earlier this yearÂ in over 1,000 stores, where they'reÂ doing a lot of pricing comparison to beat out places like Aldi and Kroger, in anticipation of this increasing competition, the more stores moving into the U.S. that they'll have to face off with. The hope is that they can lower their prices enough thatÂ Wal-Mart thinks they've won over customersÂ pretty definitively,Â and then they can adjust their pricing as necessary. There were some leaks thatÂ Wal-Mart is going to some of their big suppliers,Â especially for some of the packaged goods --Â think companies likeÂ UnileverÂ andÂ Procter & GambleÂ --Â and basically telling them, ""We needÂ the prices that you charge us to be 15% lower,"" the idea being that Wal-Mart wants to reclaim the title of low-cost leader -- Kline: And that's a general big box practice. I've done some selling to big boxes, and if you get a SKU in, they will come back to you every year, every 18 months, and say, ""How can you make it 3% cheaper?"" AndÂ in some cases, they will even help you build a new factory,Â or do whatever it is you have to do, or, you could say, ""Yeah,Â if you placed an order that was twice as big,Â here's what the price could be."" So, they'reÂ going to work every angle. I think it's also worth notingÂ that I had a story earlier this week that, atÂ Sam's Club, the Wal-Mart version of Costco, their warehouse club, they consolidated their in-house brandÂ from a whole bunch of different labels under one name. AndÂ I think that's something we're going to see more of, where Wal-Mart uses itsÂ Member's Mark brand andÂ really tries to compete with these people. That's going to put some pressure on some of these name brands, to either lower prices or find new ways to compete. Shen: Well, thanks, Dan. Any final points,Â takeaways with this expansion that's coming up for Aldi, and also for the openings expected from Lidl, before we wrap up here? Kline: I think the next time I come toÂ Virginia, I would like to see a Lidl.Â I've been to Aldi, I've been to Whole Foods 365, andÂ I think as an American consumer --Â frankly, as someone who cooks dinner every night --Â this is an exciting time, and it's something that's going to be interesting to see how this all shakes out.

Amazon could tie the service to its Prime membership model, which could make membership even more attractive and enhance the average customer lifetime value for Amazon. It could also boost Amazon Dash and Amazon Echo usage, especially if in-store pickup were incentivized by a slight price advantage. Read: Hereâs one major way Amazon could lure more shoppers to Whole Foods A bigger emphasis on experience shopping. Efficient, convenient online shopping can save time and hassle for shoppers, especially for replenishing grocery and household staples, but grocers still want customers to come to their stores to inspire purchases, simplify the last mile, and strengthen customer relationships. Amazon and Whole Foods complement each other by offering the best of both worlds. Physical stores provide a rich shopping experience through appealing food displays, the smell of freshly made foods, samplings, and social interaction. Whole Foods has recently worked on making its stores more of a destination and place to dwell by adding such amenities as in-store beer and wine bars, and it offers store events such as cooking classesâall initiatives to enhance the appeal of store visits and potential for additional business. The AmazonâWhole Foods deal could encourage valuable multichannel shopping, promoted by a cross-brand membership/loyalty program. Faster, more convenient in-store shopping. Amazon and Whole Foods could build out a faster, tech-based checkout process for those who prefer to walk the aisles rather than ordering online. This would use Amazonâs âJust Walk Outâ checkout technology, launched half a year ago in its pilot Amazon Go test store in Seattle. Novel high-tech sensors throughout the store eliminate the checkout processâa pain point for many grocery shoppers, especially at a time when people are pressed for time and convenience is a top priority. Read: Why I hate grocery shopping â and what Amazon can do to make me stop No more shopping secrets. Customers are used to being tracked and have willingly, in many cases, swapped privacy for loyalty discounts and personalized offers. Amazonâs data prowess means even more tracking of how we shop, including offline if Amazon deploys the Amazon Go high-tech sensor technology to Whole Foods stores. Customersâ mobile phones would enable monitoring of in-store movements as well as store check-in and checkout. Just as with online shopping, Amazon could track what items a customer has looked at, for how long, which ones he or she decided to put in the basket or abandoned, and more. That is valuable not just for later re-targeting and linking to Amazon Prime membership and Whole Foodsâ customer rewards data but could also give Amazon great leverage with grocery suppliers. Donât miss: As Amazon goes big in brick and mortar, it has tech to fight the monster it created A shift in attention away from price. Pricing has been an important topic in the grocery category of the retail industry because of consumersâ growing price sensitivity and increased competition, including from discount grocers with a focus on quality private-label items such as those at Trader Joeâs, Aldi and new U.S. entrant Lidl. In response, large traditional retailers such as Kroger and Wal-Mart, as well as Whole Foods, have reduced prices recently, and Whole Foods launched its lower-priced, private label-focused 365 store chain last year. The AmazonâWhole Foods deal could create higher perceived value for customers of these brands through more convenience, benefits of loyalty to both brands, and a better shopping experience, thus diverting attention from price, especially for individual items. Denise Dahlhoff is the research director of the Wharton Schoolâs Baker Retailing Center, a think tank in the retail, fashion and e-commerce space.

Amazon is ready to integrate Whole Foods in a way that few other â perhaps no other â acquirers can match. The not-so-hidden secret superpower behind Amazon is that it isnât a retailer. It isnât an e-commerce company. Itâs a platform. Since 2002, Amazon has used a pioneering approach that makes its technology infrastructure not simply a powerful back-end, but perhaps the most impressive computing platform in the industry today. This is because developers inside Amazon build every bit of software as a service â one that can be used by other developers at Amazon to build something new. And since 2006, Amazon has been systematically making these services available to developers outside of Amazon through AWS. Amazonâs work has been, essentially, a kind of business-wide user testing: Amazon gets firsthand, immediate feedback on how their software works in the broader marketplace. Who is using it? How? That gives Amazon the ability to sense and respond â to market test, benchmark, and improve â all of its internal services to make them extremely flexible, responsive to new needs and able to withstand competitive pressures. Amazonâs back-end systems are like no other systems in the retail world. Theyâre not closed, proprietary systems, but open, widely supported and well-suited to the integration work thatâs coming. The bottom line is that today, Amazonâs systems are the dominant commercial platform powering huge swaths of the modern online economy.

But Whole Foods will have to embrace Amazonâs experiment-driven approach, and itâs unclear how open its culture is to risk-taking and learning from failure. And experimentation in the bricks-and-mortar world is different from the digital world. Itâs slower, more expensive, and requires a workforce that is willing to embrace change. So a key question is can Whole Foods reimagine itself as a platform for retail experimentation? If it can, the disruption is unlikely to stop with a transformed Whole Foods. Look for Amazon to experiment and respond to customer needs until it gets the formula right, then take what it has learned to dominate the rest of the market, just as it has done countless times in the rest of the retail segment. And watch to see how Whole Foods responds, and if they can keep pace with Amazonâs relentless drive forward.

The deal is expected to close toward the end of the second quarter or the beginning of the third quarter. Andy Dunn, founder and chief executive of Bonobos, will report to Marc Lore, chief executive of Walmart U.S. e-commerce. Dunn will oversee Bonobos and ModCloth, Wal-Mart's collection of digitally-native brands. In recent months, Wal-Mart has also acquired other online fashion companies including Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.

Daniel B. Kline,06222017,MarketWatch,06152017,"Returns as of 11/13/2018 Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Returns as of 11/13/2018 While some Costco (NASDAQ:COST) members shop at the warehouse club for the joy of discovery, or even the free samples, it's fair to say that most pay for a membership in order to save money. The same can be said of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime members. In fact, the roughly 80 million Prime Members and just-over 88 million Costco cardholders globally are both almost certainly largely made up of people driven by the search for value. One of the two companies does actually offer better prices, according to two recent reports. The difference may not be enough to get devoted fans of the second-place retailer to switch, but it's a surprisingly decisive win. Costco and Amazon are competitors that co-exist surprisingly well. Image source: Costco. BMO Capital Markets analystsÂ KellyÂ Bania and DavidÂ Lantz recently completed a price study comparing shopping in-store at Costco, Costco.com, and Amazon, Barron's reported. The two looked at a basket of 54 items and found that shopping in a Costco was the best deal while Costco.com still beat Amazon, but not by as much. That matches the results of a similar study done by SFGate.com. The website compared shopping at a Costco warehouse to buying from Amazon examining a range of essentials and basic items including toilet paper, party snacks, and some basic pharmacy purchases including Advil. ""The bottom line? Costco is cheaper nearly across the board (but not by a ton)."" The results from SFGate concluded that buying the staple items at Amazon would set you back $329.43, whereas the same purchase at Costco would be $313.14. Amazon and Costco have a lot of overlap in members because both appeal to consumers looking to save money. Recent research from GfK first reported on by eMarketer, showed that the people willing to pay Amazon $99 a year for Prime's free shipping (and other perks) join warehouse clubs including Costco in higher numbers than non-members. That backs up an October report from Morgan Stanley  covered by The Seattle Times. The financial firm surveyed 2,700 people and found that nearly half (45%) of Costco members also had an Amazon Prime membership. ""Members of both Costco and Prime have not and generally do not intend to spend more with one retailer/e-tailer at the expense of the other,"" according to the report, which noted brand loyalty being a boon to both. While Costco and Amazon do not generally threaten each other's business, the warehouse club does have a clear edge in pricing, at least when it comes to staples. That's an advantage the chain has been working to press as it has been exploring ways to make it easier for consumers to pop into its stores. Of course, Amazon sells tens of millions more items than Costco does. That protects its value to consumers who can justify paying for memberships to both, in order to save money.

Tonya Garcia,06222017,MarketWatch,06152017,"The first iteration of Amazonâs Dash Wand wasnât long for this world. The company trialed the barcode scanner with select Prime Fresh customers in California, but the hardware didnât seem to really go anywhere. Instead the company switched tactics, moving to those now familiar single product buttons. Now that Amazonâs all bullish about hardware, thanks to the Echoâs stratospheric success, the companyâs bringing back the Dash Wand with Alexa built-in. Itâs a nice bit of synergy. All of the barcode scanning and Amazon Fresh purchasing is still there, and now Alexa can do her thing as well, ordering items with voice, pulling up recipes, finding out the nutritional content of an item. You know, Alexa being Alexa. At the moment, the item is available for Prime Members only. And itâs essentially free (for a limited time), priced at $20 and shipping with a $20 rebate off your first Amazon purchase after registering the thing. It also comes with a free 90-day trial of AmazonFresh. So the device is a gateway to both Amazonâs $15 a month grocery service and a free new back door for getting the companyâs smart assistant into more homes. That price point will probably be a pretty solid method for turning whatâs essentially a niche device into a lot of usersâ first Alexa experience. Most of us probably never considered bringing a barcode scanner into our homes, but hey, freeish is freeish, right?Â A promotional video shows a group of yuppies more or less recreating The Big Chill devoid of the death and Motown soundtrack. Like AmazonFresh, this probably isnât quite a mainstream market at the moment, but it should help get Alexa into even more homes. Not that the company has been having much of an issue on that front. Numbers from last month put Amazonâs smart assistant at around 70-percent of the voice-controlled speaker market. That number was no doubt helped along with the low-priced Echo Dot, and sticking Alexa on an essentially free device should help the assistantâs home penetration rate event more. This is Amazonâs loss leader model in perhaps its purest form. The devices have always been less about hardware than locking users into it e-commerce ecosystem. You can run, but you canât hide from Alexa. ",Amazonâs Dash Wand barcode scanner returns with Alexa and is now essentially free â TechCrunch

The Dash Wand can be put on the fridge, hung in the bathroom or placed just about anywhere in the house â and when shoppers say âtoothpasteâ or ânails,â it puts those items in their online shopping cart to be reviewed and ordered later. Items include those on AmazonFresh, the companyâs local grocery division, as well as many other products sold on Amazon. It sells for $20, but people who purchase it get $20 back in store credit after registering the device. Along with grocery shopping, the tool â backed by Amazonâs personal assistant technology, known as Alexa â also helps homebodies convert measurements (such as âhow many teaspoons are in a tablespoon?â), learn how many calories are in certain foods and find recipes. See:  Amazon Prime just got cheaper for millions of Americans â but is it a better deal than Costco? Amazon has its sights set on revolutionizing grocery shopping â AmazonFresh is still relatively fresh itself, but by 2025, online grocery shopping could be as much as 20% of all grocery shopping, according to the Food Marketing Institute and Nielsen. The company introduced AmazonFresh Pickup in March at two Seattle locations, where Prime members (who pay an annual $99 fee for two-day shipping, movies, TV shows, music and more) can order their groceries online and pick them up, with service to their cars, at a local store in 15 minutes or more. Earlier this year, the New York Post reported the company was looking into a 10,000-plus-square-foot automated grocery store, though Jeff Bezos, Amazonâs chief executive officer, rebutted that story on Twitter.

Thomas H. Kee Jr.,06222017,MarketWatch,06152017,"Published: June 15, 2017 10:24 a.m. ET As the Fed tightens monetary policy, the ECB is printing money at a fast pace By The Federal Reserve is tightening monetary policy aggressively, but not many seem to care. There is a rational reason for that, and it has to do with liquidity. First, in an increasing interest-rate environment, we would expect bonds, which are of course interest-rate sensitive, to react negatively when interest rates increase. This is the inverse relationship between price in yield. However, on Wednesday the double-short ETF for long-term U.S. Treasury bonds, ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury

Mark Hulbert: Stock market risk is much greater than we thought Typically, there are two reasons why investors flock to Treasury bonds. One is related to interest rates and the other to a relative degree of fear in the market. If investors are worried about the stock market, they often flock to safe-haven investments, such as Treasury bonds.

                                  Â are not high enough to warrant the aggressive increase in U.S. Treasury bond prices Wednesday. Basically, bond market investors are telling us that the aggressive moves by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to tighten monetary policy do not matter to their decision to buy, at least not yet. Why is that? Why donât investors seem to care about tighter monetary policy by the Federal Reserveâs policy committee? The answer is directly related to the central bank across the pond that continues to buy $60 billion a month in assets. The European Central Bank (ECB) is actively engaged in a stimulus policy that immediately impacts liquidity. In other words, the monies are still flowing like clockwork from the ECB, and when they flow, they find their way into all asset classes, including Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and the trickle-down effect brings money to the stock market and other asset classes as well. Unless this money flow comes to an end, investors will consider the FOMC to be second fiddle to the ECB. This is a role that the FOMC is not used to. The FOMC is used to leading the worldâs central bank policy, and arguably they are leading because the FOMC is tightening while the ECB is still printing money. But the primary objective of investors is to identify liquidity flows, and the infusions of capital by the ECB outweigh the tightening of monetary policy by the FOMC. Eventually this will matter, and the tightening of monetary policy by the FOMC will adversely impact economic conditions, but that is not likely to happen until the ECB has stopped printing money. Until they do, investors will prioritize the ECB over the FOMC. Thomas H. Kee Jr. is a former Morgan Stanley broker and founder of Stock Traders Daily. Kee managed the fourth-best-performing strategy in the world in 2016, according to HedgeCo. ",The Federal Reserve is playing second fiddle to the European Central Bank - MarketWatch
Maria LaMagna,06222017,MarketWatch,06152017,"Published: June 20, 2017 4:44 p.m. ET A new study shows why many Americans donât use a bank account By âYou ever get so broke that the bank starts charging you for not having enough money?â the comedian Louis C.K. asks in one of his stand-up acts. âThey call me up because I donât have enough money. Iâm like, âI know.ââ He talks about one particularly low moment, when he only had $20 in his bank account, and his bank charged him $15 for âinsufficient funds.â âThatâs like going to the movies, you buy your ticket, and they say âGet the f*** out of here.ââ The audience at C.K.âs show laughed, but for many Americans, itâs a harsh reality. It turns out that in places where people could most benefit from free checking accounts, it is much harder to find them. Thatâs according to a new analysis out Tuesday of more than 3,800 large financial institutions, and more than 1 million consumers, from Moebs Services, a firm that researches financial services companies including banks and credit unions. Moebs analyzed how many free checking accounts were available in areas where people are âfully banked,â meaning they have bank accounts and do not use any alternative financial services such as check-cashing, and compared those findings to how many free checking accounts are available in areas where people are âunderbankedâ or âunbanked,â meaning they do use alternative financial services. Those who are âunbankedâ have no bank account at all. In cities where a large percentage of people are âfully banked,â free checking accounts are offered 65% of the time, Moebs found. In areas where cities have lower percentages of fully banked households, free checking accounts are only offered about 51% of the time. Moebs also found that free checking was more likely available in areas where the cost of living is above average. The conclusion: Financial institutions donât seem interested in offering free checking to consumers in the âunderbankedâ or âunbankedâ categories, Moebs found. âThe ultimate factor relies on risk,â economist and CEO Michael Moebs wrote. Financial institutions view unbanked and underbanked households as risky because those households have the potential to hold negative account balances, which drives up the cost of checking, he said. For consumers who have low incomes and are unable to keep minimum balances in their accounts, a checking account that charges monthly fees can be harmful to family finances. If consumers are unable to find free checking accounts close to them, they can also use free accounts at online-only banks. Several websites including NerdWallet and Bankrate keep track of which checking accounts are free, as well as which offer the highest savings rates. With that said, many households that avoid banks entirely have different concerns. Many say they distrust banks, or they just donât have enough money to keep in an account without facing low-balance fees. Previous research about the unbanked and underbanked population has shown that many avoid traditional bank accounts because they are afraid of overdrawing their accounts, which can be costly About 7% of all U.S. households, or nearly 9 million households, are âunbanked,â according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That number has dropped in recent years, as socioeconomic conditions have improved; people most likely to be unbanked are black and Latino families, lower-income households, younger households and unemployed households, according to the FDIC. Not using a bank can actually cost more, especially because alternatives including check-cashing services and prepaid debit cards charge fees for each transaction. Although Moebsâs research seems to show that banks and credit unions havenât yet begun offering free checking in large numbers to people who could benefit from it, and many households still donât take advantage of the free checking accounts that are offered, major companies have offered new services to low-income populations in recent months.

Near-term support technically spans from 2,440 to 2,445, an area matching the breakout point. Conversely, an intermediate-term projected target â the 2,480 area â is increasingly within view.

                                  Â has gapped to record territory. In its case, near-term support matches the top of the gap (21,436) and is closely followed by the bottom of the gap, also last weekâs close (21,384). Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite is digesting the mid-June FAANG-fueled downdraft. (The downturn fueled by large-cap technology names, including Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, formerly Google. Separately, Amazon is also vying for grocery-sector status, as detailed in the next section.) Still, the index has maintained its range bottom (6,107) rising respectably from support. Slightly more broadly, a notable floor matches the breakout point (6,164) an area better illustrated below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaqâs bearish key reversal (the mid-June long red bar) has clashed with the breakout point, circa 6,164. The shaky, but still successful, retest is constructive. Delving deeper, the 50-day moving average, currently 6,100, closely matches the June low, and is followed by more important support nominally under the 6,000 mark. The Nasdaqâs intermediate-term uptrend is intact barring a violation. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has taken flight, extending the June breakout. Its first notable support matches the breakout point â Dow 21,115 â an area also illustrated on the hourly chart. A posture higher supports a firmly-bullish intermediate-term bias. More broadly, the prevailing leg higher builds on the initially steep February rally. Similarly, the S&P 500 has reached uncharted territory. The breakout punctuates a bull flag defined by the relatively tight June range. To reiterate, the former range top â the 2,440 area â pivots to first support. As detailed above, the U.S. benchmarksâ bigger-picture technical backdrop remains bullish. On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials have reached all-time highs â uncharted territory â while the Nasdaq Composite is digesting the mid-June downdraft, amid thus far limited technical damage. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is holding the range top. Its recent pullback from record territory has been flat, fueled by decreased volume, improving the chances of an eventual breakout. More broadly, the small-cap benchmark is rising from a continuation pattern, pinned to the steep 2016 breakout, illustrated on the three-year chart. A bullish longer-term backdrop. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 is rattling the cage on record territory. Technically, the mid-cap benchmark is rising from a bullish cup-and-handle defined by the March and May lows. An intermediate-term target projects to the 332 area on a breakout. Here again, the MDYâs longer-term backdrop remains bullish, as illustrated on the three-year chart. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has extended its uptrend amid still constructive sector rotation. A biotech and health care sector resurgence has contributed to very recent strength, partly detailed in the next section. Tactically, a near- to intermediate-term target continues to project to the S&P 2,480 area. (Take, 2,401 - 2,322 = 79 points. Then, add back to the March peak: 2,401 + 79 = 2,480.) Conversely, the breakout point â S&P 2,440 â pivots to first support, a level matching the former record close. This is followed by the 2,405 support, in the broad sweep, an area closely matching the ascending 50-day moving average, currently 2,398. Broadly speaking, a posture atop the 2,400 area supports a firmly bullish intermediate-term bias. See also: FAANG-fueled market whipsaw stirs bullish U.S. sector rotation.

As illustrated, the shares have extended a recent violation of support, reaching 14-month lows. An intermediate-term downside target continues to project to the 8.70 area, and is increasingly within view. More broadly, the USOâs longer-term technical bias remains firmly bearish. The 2017 downturns remain technically damaging, fueled by volume spikes, and punctuated by comparably flat rally attempts. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF, most recently profiled Thursday, has knifed to 20-month highs. Technically, the breakout resolves a double bottom, the W formation defined by the April and May lows. An intermediate-term target projects to the 78 area.

More broadly, the recent downdraft has inflicted damage in the form of a strong-volume break from the May range. The immediate rally attempt has been comparably flat, though the successful retest of support is constructive.

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The family of an Illinois Uber driver who was stabbed to death filed a wrongful death lawsuit on Monday against Wal-Mart Stores Inc for failing to stop the teen suspect in the incident from stealing a machete and knife from one of its stores. The lawsuit was filed in the Cook County Circuit Court by the family of Grant Nelson, 34. Nelson was killed early on May 30 after picking up 16-year-old Eliza Wasni outside a Wal-Mart in Skokie, Illinois, around 16 miles (26 km) north of Chicago. Wasni, a high school student, was arrested shortly after the attack and charged in June with first-degree murder. She is being held without bail, the Chicago Tribune reported. The family is seeking unspecified financial damages. In addition to Wal-Mart, the lawsuit names Allied Universal and Monterrey Security Consultants as defendants, according to court documents. Both companies provided security services to the store. Wal-Mart said in a statement that it would respond âappropriatelyâ with the court, âbut we can say that we believe our associates acted properly, including alerting third-party security to a possible shoplifting incident.â Allied Universal and Monterrey Security Consultants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Privately held Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] has grown from startup to a global ride service valued at $68 billion in less than a decade but has faced criticisms on issues ranging from corporate culture to driver payment. An attorney for Nelsonâs family, Robert Bingle, said in a statement that it was âvery obvious that this young girl with a machete in one hand and a knife in the other hand, with no receipt, was not going to do anything good.â He said the tragedy could have been avoided âif WalâMart and its agents had simply followed their own procedures.â He said Wasni was not stopped, questioned or asked to show a receipt at the storeâs exit door. After shoplifting the machete and knife, Wasni called an Uber and Nelson drove to pick her up, according to court documents. Two minutes into the ride, she attacked Nelson from behind,  Cook County Assistant Stateâs Attorney Michelle Cunningham said. Nelson was able to exit the car and made his way to a nearby condominium building where he yelled for help, the Chicago Tribune reported. Wasni fled in Nelsonâs car before crashing and fleeing on foot. She was then apprehended by police. The motive for the killing remains unknown. ","

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinaâs top online retailers and U.S. superstore giant Walmart are scrambling to satisfy the voracious appetites of consumers excited about the first American beef to arrive in the worldâs most populous nation in 14 years. âI am a frequent buyer of steak so I can tell the quality by its colour and marbling,â said one woman on Thursday at a Sams Club store in Beijing owned by Walmart. She selected a 211 yuan ($31.13) pack of newly arrived U.S. steak over her usual choice from Australia. âThis looks tasty, worth a try,â she said, declining to be named. Other shoppers at the store said imported beef was superior in quality and worth its hefty price. Beef is the fastest-growing meat sector in China, outstripping stagnant demand for more widely eaten pork, with consumers seeking healthier sources of protein and adopting Western eating habits. Chinaâs beef imports hit $2.6 billion last year, making it the worldâs fastest-growing overseas market for the meat. Consumer excitement about the lifting of a 2003 ban due to a scare over mad cow disease looks set to help U.S. beef grab a significant share of that demand. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue is in Beijing to mark the return of U.S. beef to China, and is expected on Friday to meet his Chinese counterpart, Agriculture Minister Han Changfu, as well as Vice Premier Wang Yang. Some of the millions who buy food online are expected to join the woman in the Sams Club store as some of the first to buy U.S. beef in China in more than a decade. Social media has been buzzing for weeks with those ready to tuck into American steak. âAmerican steak is delicious,â said one user on Chinaâs Twitter-like Weibo service. âIt doesnât have the mutton smell of domestic beef.â Womai.com, owned by food giant COFCO [CNCOF.UL], said it had received more than 1,605 orders for beef from U.S. meat giant Tyson by late Wednesday. JD.com, one of the countryâs biggest online retailers, has started pre-sales of U.S. beef ahead of the productâs availability from mid-July. Online meat is typically around 10 percent cheaper than it is in stores, according to Euromonitor. Imported meat accounted for more than 30 percent of JD.comâs meat sales last year, with Australian beef the top category and the most searched-for item, the company said. Still, food safety fears linger, despite Beijingâs stringent import requirements. One Sams Club shopper, surnamed Huang, was worried about more than beautiful marbling: âWe should not only stick to foreign beef. They have food safety issues, like growth hormones and GMOs (genetically modified organisms) in the U.S.â (This version the story is corrected to show the store was Sams Club, owned by Walmart, not a Walmart supermarket in 2nd, 7th and 13th paras) ","

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, June 26 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Haitian textile workers took to the streets on Monday to demand a higher minimum wage as managers of textile factories threatened to leave the country if the government did not clamp down on demonstrations. Haiti has pinned some of its economic growth hopes on the textile industry, which accounts for 90 percent of its exports, according to export.gov, a website managed by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The United States has granted Haiti a preferential trade deal, creating some 40,000 jobs, the Association of Haitian Industries said last November. Products made there are shipped to major U.S. retailers like Walmart and Target. However, spurred by a recent hike in fuel prices and surging inflation, textile workers have begun protesting over pay. On Monday, they marched across town from an industrial park near the airport to the Ministry of Social Affairs in downtown Port-au-Prince, singing and waving signs with slogans like âLong live the independent fight for factory workers.â Workers in textile factories currently earn 300 Haitian gourdes ($4.77). They are demanding a raise to 800 gourdes a day. An annual report seen by Reuters from the High Council of Salaries, which is tasked with recommending changes to the minimum wage, had proposed an increase to 400 gourdes a day. But it was never released due to a dispute within the council. Last week, six companies wrote to the office of Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant, demanding the government stop the protests, in letters that became public on Monday. âTotal cost competitiveness, quality production and the proximity (to) the U.S. were the reasons we selected Haiti while betting on major improvements on salary predictability and political stability,â the companies wrote in identical letters. âIf those benefits no longer (exist), we will have to make other strategic (arrangements to) move from Haiti to other places where there is a clear state strategy to boost investments and protect investors while creating and protecting decent jobs,â they added. The six companies that signed the letters were MGA Haiti S.A., Astro Carton dâHaiti S.A., Haiti Cheung Won S.A., Textile Youm Kwang S.A., Pacific Sports Haiti S.A. and Wilbes Haitian S.A. Earlier this month, Roosevelt Bellevue, minister of social affairs and labor, expressed a similar view. âIf the salary becomes too high, companies will leave and go to the Dominican Republic or Nicaragua,â he told reporters. Representatives from MGA Haiti and Astro Carton dâHaiti confirmed they had sent the letters, and said they had lost between $50,000 and $60,000 due to the protests. The other four textile companies could not be reached immediately for comment. (Additional reporting by Robenson Sanon; Editing by Leslie Adler) ","

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"They argue the Whole Foods acquisition will give Amazon an unfair advantage over traditional grocers and new players that might emerge in the market, potentially grounds for the deal to be blocked for antitrust reasons. âAs a matter of policy, should this be blocked? ...There should be a challenge to this because there should be a strong presumption against growth by acquisition and in fact there is supposed to be such a presumption in our law. Itâs what Congress intended,â said Chris Sagers, a professor of antitrust law at Cleveland State University. Amazon declined comment. Sagers and other critics urge regulators to prevent dominant firms from buying a major foothold in an adjacent industry. Founded as a bookseller in 1994 and now the worldâs biggest online retailer that sells everything from paper towels to designer clothing, Amazon sent grocery stocks into a tailspin Friday when it announced it planned to buy Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. U.S. antitrust enforcement has generally looked favorably on deals that reduce consumer prices, and Amazon supporters contend the deal will be good for consumers.    The drop in grocer share prices the day the deal was announced - No. 1 U.S. grocer Kroger fell more than 9 percent - demonstrates the threat investors feel Amazon poses to traditional grocery chains. âCompetitors can be expected not to like a merger that puts more pressure on them. If their share price goes down, itâs a sign theyâll be under more competitive pressure,â said Alden Abbott, antitrust expert at the Heritage Foundation. Amazon was accused of crippling book retailers like Borders in part through price cutting. At $480 billion, Amazonâs market value equals 90 percent of all the stocks in the S&P 1500 food and staples index, which includes Walmart. Sagers argues, however, that it would be legal for Amazon to independently develop its grocery sales rather than leapfrog ahead through acquisition.    A Republican former antitrust enforcer, who asked not to be named to protect business relationships, agreed. âThe notion of leveraging your power in market A to enter into market B has a been around for a long time as a basis for enforcement,â the ex-enforcer said. Some deal experts warn the proposed transaction could hurt companies that supply a combined Amazon and Whole Foods with organic flour, milk and other goods. Excessive âbuyer powerâ worried Darren Bush, a veteran of the Justice Departmentâs Antitrust Division who teaches at the University of Houstonâs Law Center. Bush said Amazonâs success in offering a massive array of products at low prices masks a business model that succeeds by pushing producer prices down. Food producers could soon face the sort of pressure that booksellers faced from Amazon, which for example removed the âbuyâ button in 2010 from books sold by a publisher it was embroiled in a dispute with. Historically, changes in the economy - say from horse and buggies to cars - has always led to anxiety as corporate giants fall into decline to be replaced by dynamic upstarts, said Herb Hovenkamp, who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. âI always take the long view of these things. Over time, we have always had these big firms that somebody said, âWe have to do something about these guys,ââ said Hovenkamp. âBusinesses cycle in and cycle out. Thereâs no question in my mind that this will happen to Amazon.â ","

(WMT) andÂ Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) benefit from key advantages that will allow their shares to outperform even as the broader retail industry struggles with the headwinds created by the rise ofÂ Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), according to a guest feature written by broker dealer Cowen & Co. and reported on by Barron's. (For more, see also:Â 7 Retailers Immune to Amazon's Dominance.) In the feature, the broker dealer outlined several factors that would help make Wal-Mart stores competitive, according to Barron's. The major retailer has invested billions into cutting its prices, and it continues to focus on providing appealing cost-savings. Further, Wal-Mart's customers have a lower average income than those of other companies in the grocery space, making Wal-Mart less susceptible to competition, according toÂ CowenÂ & Co. Finally, roughly 90% of the people in the United States live within 10 miles of a Wal-Mart store. When speaking to the advantages ofÂ Costco, theÂ CowenÂ & Co. feature emphasized the company's low prices and modest margins, asserting that these help give the retailer a competitive advantage, Barron's reported.Â CowenÂ & Co.Â is not the only financial institution that has rated Costco outperform, asÂ Budd Bugatch, an analyst at Raymond James, recently changed his rating of the major retailer from market perform to outperform, according to MarketWatch. After closing at a more-than six-month low of $157.13 on Friday, June 23, Costco shares have recovered somewhat, climbing 2% through the close of trading on Monday, June 26, according to Google Finance. The company's stock has risen little year-to-date (YTD), but could enjoy notable upside going forward.

Sarah Whitten,06292017,CNBC,06222017,"Wal-Mart is not actively considering making an offer for Whole Foods Market, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. The retail giant was among those that analysts said could potentially make a counter bid for the grocery chain as the company has been focusing its deal making on bulking up its digital business. However, Reuters reported that Whole Foods, which has accepted a $13.7 billion offer from Amazon.com, has not received any rival bids as of Friday. A Wal-Mart spokesman declined to comment on whether the company is considering a bid for Whole Foods. Whole Foods and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Although Wal-Mart's name had been mentioned as a rival suitor, some felt expected that the deep-pocketed Amazon would have countered any offer with a sweeter bid. Whole Foods shares have been trading above Amazon's $42 bid since the deal was announced last Friday, as stock market investors have speculated about the possibility of a higher offer. Shares of Whole Foods and Walmart both remained unchanged in aftermarket trading Friday. JAB Holdings was also been flagged as a potential bidder for Whole Foods by retail analysts. The private equity player has been shifting its focus to restaurants and food and beverage businesses, most recently it said it would purchase Panera Bread in a deal valued at about $7.5 billion. Whole Foods has been under pressure from activist investor Jana Partners and money manager Neuberger Berman, which have called on Whole Foods to sell itself. The investors have criticized Whole Foods for its poor performance and have suggested the chain could be merged with another grocer. ",Wal-Mart not considering Whole Foods bid: Reuters
Courtney Reagan,06292017,CNBC,06222017,"2017 has not been kind to retailers, and if one of the Trump administration's budget cuts takes hold, there will be more pain to come. The current Trump administration budget calls for a $191 billion cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program â commonly referred to as food stamps â between 2018 and 2028. The Congressional Budget Office said the average food stamp benefit is $252 per month, the lowest level in five years as several rounds of cuts began in 2013. If the Trump administration's SNAP budget proposal passes, the monthly amount will fall by 31 percent to an average $173 a month. CNBC has exclusive estimates to quantify just which retailers will take the biggest hit if food stamp benefits are cut. Retail consultancy AlixPartners estimated retail collectively stands to lose $70.7 billion over the decade if the proposed cuts take place. ""For about every dollar of benefit reduction or spending, there's about a 37-cent loss in grocery sales,"" said Ted Stenger, managing director at AlixPartners. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the government agency that runs the food stamp program, supermarkets and superstores received 81 percent of the SNAP benefits in 2016, even though that subsector only represents 14 percent of the total companies authorized to accept food stamps. But that means the group is poised to be the hardest hit. AlixPartners estimated the size of the impact would be about $57.5 billion at supermarkets and superstores over the next 10 years if the budget item passes as proposed. No one retailer redeems more food stamp benefits than Wal-Mart. The discount retailer makes up the largest share of superstore redemptions. In 2013, Wal-Mart disclosed it gets an estimated 18 percent, but it hasn't given any updated figures. Using that information as a part of its equation, the retail consultancy estimates Walmart would take a $12.7 billion hit to U.S. sales over the next decade. Target sees the second-largest food stamp redemption in the superstore and supercenter category, with an estimated $4.8 billion to $5.3 billion sales drag. ""Target is committed to supporting the communities we serve by accepting SNAP benefits that provide nutritional assistance to those in need. We are watching the budget process and proposals around SNAP funding, knowing it could have an effect on our guests and their families,"" Target said in a statement. ""Overall, we anticipate the impact of this proposal on Target's business to be small and significantly lower than industry reports. We'll continue to monitor the budget process closely moving forward."" Low-priced grocery store chain Aldi would see the third-largest impact, estimated to fall between $4.4 billion and $4.9 billion. Kroger comes in fourth, with an estimated $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion sales hit from proposed SNAP reductions. Stenger said the economic demographics in the areas around retail stores that accept SNAP factor into the estimates, along with the stores that actually accept the food stamp payment cards (commonly referred to as EBT or electronic benefit transfer). About half of Kroger's stores are not enrolled in the program. ""That's probably because those stores have a very low content of customers who are using the card,"" Stenger said. In response to the AlixPartners estimates, Kroger spokeswoman Kristal Howard said, ""The SNAP program was never intended to fully replace families' grocery bills, but to supplement it. SNAP and WIC [the Special Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants, and Children] customers in our stores spend some of their own cash on food. When program spending has been reduced in the past, customers shift to spending more of their cash on food and less cash on other things. We look forward to the legislative process."" Kmart has been facing years of hardships when it comes to sales and traffic, as more than 150 of its stores have closed or are closing this year. The proposed food stamp benefit cuts could mean a sales loss of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, according to AlixPartners. But the potential reduction in the government's SNAP program will likely have ripple effects beyond those retailers that sell food and drinks, it's just harder to pinpoint and quantify. ""If you look at food spending as a whole, it's not discretionary, it's necessary. So, you reallocate budget dollars to spend on food if you have to,"" explains Diana Sheehan, Kantar Retail grocery analyst and director of retail insights. The SNAP program benefits swelled during the Great Recession as the economy faltered and the unemployment rate surged. The Obama administration began instituting cuts to the program once the economy was in recovery, which began in 2013. But Sheehan pointed out that for the last several years the reduction in benefits has been coupled with deflationary trends in food prices and lower gas prices. ""So while those receiving the food stamp benefits were getting less, food costs and gas prices to get to the store were lower too,"" she said. But some expect both those trends could be abating, which could mean the proposed deeper cuts will be more painful to those consumers, Sheehan said. Doug Hermanson, senior economist at Kantar Retail, said its ShopperScape index showed these consumers ""tend to cut back on small indulgences like eating at restaurants, followed by using more coupons, and buying more private label products."" The impact takes some time for retailers to manage through, he said. ""We do see households cut back on everyday expenses when they face these challenges, especially in the short term. It takes a couple quarters for all of these behaviors to have impacts on retailers."" Hermanson also noted there can be some benefits too as shoppers switch from one retailer to another to find bigger discounts. ""In some cases, these shoppers trade into a Walmart or discounter by shopping a supermarket less,"" he said. In perspective, when amortizing the estimated sales impact over 10 years, based on the retailers' most recent full-year sales, the sales impact looks less intense. For example, the estimated $12.7 billion sales impact to Wal-Mart is over 10 years. Wal-Mart's most recent full-year sales hit $485.9 billion, so $12.7 billion over 10 years is $1.27 billion a year, or 0.26 percent of sales, based on its most recent fiscal year. Kmart would see the largest percentage hit based on its most recent full-year sales report;665trqgwzy+ the high-end of the impact range could represent 2.5 percent of annual sales. Wal-Mart, Target, Kmart and Aldi have declined to comment on the AlixPartners estimates. ",Retailers that take the hardest hit if food stamp benefits are cut
Lora Kolodny,06292017,CNBC,06222017,"People buy a bigger share of their groceries online each year, which seems to bode well for meal-kit makers. However, Slice Intelligence analyst Ken Cassar expects at least half of meal-kit companies to die off following Blue Apron's market debut on Thursday, and the acquisition of Whole Foods by Amazon, which is expected to close later this year. ""There's going to be a lot of competition to win customers, and a lot of spending on advertising and marketing here,"" Cassar said. ""The companies that aren't already established will have to entice folks who have tried competing services and decided meal-kits are not for them. At least half of them aren't going to make it."" Dozens of meal-kit companies are still operating in the U.S., and many have raised venture funding to support their growth, such as Plated, Hello Fresh, Green Chef, Sun Basket, Chef'd, which is backed by Campbell Soup, and Purple Carrot, which has partnered with NFL star Tom Brady to develop recipes. Those who have a chance at survival, Cassar said, should be thinking about partnering with major brick-and-mortar groceries such as Kroger, which might stock their kits, and help them reduce costs by making pickups a possibility and alternative to delivery. ""My bet is the winning model right now for food-commerce companies is more defined by Walmart than Amazon,"" Cassar said. ""This is where you buy online and pick up at the store, especially where there is a convenient option for pickup, and where you do not have to get out of your car."" CircleUp COO and food investor Rory Eakin agreed that meal-kit brands should be willing to strike up partnerships that will increase their reach. He also said remaining meal-kit companies have to develop a specialty to survive. One company he's invested in, Good Eggs, delivers meal kits made from food produced locally (it got its start delivering groceries). Others, such as Green Chef and Sun Basket, make meals of organic ingredients and offer recipes for people following a gluten-free, vegetarian, or paleo diet. Eakin also said food e-commerce companies need to become data-obsessed. ""Amazon makes data available to brands on its platforms about their customers' purchase behavior, core demographic and more,"" he said. ""Brick-and-mortar groceries don't do that. You only know if a product is doing well when they re-order it. Leveraging data will help startups keep vendors around, connect with new customers, master pricing, and just generally get to scale.""

Rachael Abrams,06292017,CNBC,06222017,"Every couple of days, Sinclair Browne fights through traffic in Times Square, squeezes his delivery truck into a parking spot, walks up four flights of stairs and delivers groceries to a guy whose order he knows by heart. ""I'm fast,"" said Mr. Browne, slicing his hands in the air, ninja style. ""In and out, in and out."" Delivering food requires military precision: Bananas can't get cold. Produce can't get warm. Eggs, of course, must not get broken. And people expect their food to arrive at specific times. Mr. Browne, 40, is a driver for the online grocery business Peapod. He plays the most important role in solving the biggest problem vexing the online grocery industry: moving food, undamaged and unspoiled, from the warehouse to the customer's house. It's known as the last-mile problem. Delivering perishables is much trickier than delivering T-shirts, books or pretty much anyt hing else people can buy online. The biggest challenge is that groceries must stay cold for hours at a time. But there are myriad other complications, too. Bananas and apples give off fumes that can hurt loose leaf lettuce, so they can't be stored too close. Tomatoes lose flavor when they cool to below 55 degrees. Milk always has to be packaged upright. More from the New York Times:Easiest path to riches on the web? An initial coin offeringGoogle will no longer scan Gmail for ad targeting The tech billionaires remaking US schools All the complexity adds costs in an industry where profit margins are already thin. Few businesses have attempted these kinds of gastronomic acrobatics on a large scale, and numerous start-ups have failed trying, making groceries the last frontier of online shopping. Even Amazon, which built a multi-billion-dollar business by perfecting its delivery logistics, hasn't quite mastered the art of profitably delivering perishable food in big metropolitan areas. But it just made a big bet, purchasing Whole Foods in a $13.4 billion deal that will give it access to more than 400 stores concentrated around major population centers â places that may have walk-up apartments, aggressive taxi drivers and other urban obstacles that Mr. Browne navigates five days a week. Amazon's deal sets up a face-off with Walmart, the nation's largest grocery store. Walmart itself is struggling to become as dominant in the virtual world as it is in the physical one. Jennifer Carr-Smith, Peapod's chief executive, says she hopes Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods will ultimately encourage more people to shop for groceries online, where about 10 percent of all shopping in the United States happens now. The numbers for food are less than half that, according to data from FMI-Nielsen. As the competition heats up, Amazon and others will be relying on drivers like Mr. Browne, who makes $13 an hour, plus tips, to handle the biggest challenges of succeeding in the online grocery business. ""What's up, boss?"" Mr. Brown greets the doorman at his first building, who tells him he'll need to take his cart to the service entrance. He takes the elevator down one flight, but it's the wrong entrance. He tries another floor. No go. When he asks for directions, the man working at the service entrance yells at him: ""You don't know, you should tell me you don't know!"" But rudeness, Mr. Browne says, is just one of the things he has to deal with. He's still got to get in and out, in and out. Nineteen stops to go. Every second counts. Grocery delivery companies like Peapod have to calculate exactly how long each individual order will take, and monitor traffic patterns and car accidents for any disruptions. Mr. Browne gets alerts on his phone; on Sunday, he'll have to avoid crossing Fifth Avenue, because of the Pride parade. Today, some of his orders are allotted 10 minutes, others 12. Urban areas tend to take longer per stop: 12 to 20 minutes on average, compared with eight to 14 minutes in the suburbs, where Mr. Browne can pull right up to people's homes. For all 20 of his orders on this day, Peapod has allotted nine hours and 20 minutes. Mr. Browne thinks he can do them all in eight. ""The first guy slowed me up by having to go through the loading dock. I never really went through there before,"" Mr. Browne says as he drives to the next stop. ""Usually I'd be in and out of that building."" His truck was loaded at Peapod's warehouse in Jersey City, a massive 400,000-square-foot facility that services New York and New Jersey. About 425 people bustle in and out of the meat room, the produce room, a rotisserie room filled with dozens of rotating chickens. Workers wearing thick freezer suits retrieve frozen foods from the coldest room, loading items into bright green temperature-controlled bins that workers refer to as ""totes."" Anyone who has shopped for groceries online has probably thought to themselves something like, ""Who will be squeezing my tomatoes, and will I get the good ones this time, or not?"" That's why, despite the vastness of the industrial automation here â there are about 7 miles of conveyor belts in Peapod's warehouse â people like Amal Afifi are important. As she loads the totes, Ms. Afifi personally inspects some of the 14 million bananas Peapod sells each year. Her guidelines are relatively simple: Trust your gut. Literally. ""I shop for customers like I shop for myself,"" Ms. Afifi said, pointing to a box of unappetizing-looking, reject bananas. They may get donated to a local zoo, where the animals are less picky than people are about bruised fruit and smushed bread. Once perishable items make it into the tote, the clock starts ticking. Keeping food cold until it gets to customers is the single most difficult and important thing about delivering groceries. There are many opportunities for things to go wrong. For all the impersonal convenience that online shopping brings â no crowds, or lines, or chatty cashiers â no company has figured out how to automate away the care that a live human like Mr. Browne needs to show toward the food. Carrying a box of sodas and two bags of cold food, he walks into the lobby of a building about halfway through his shift. The doorman tells him to leave the order, but he refuses. What if the doorman forgets about it, and the fruit stays out for hours? ""For every hour that you break that cold chain, you lose one day of shelf life,"" said Tony Stallone, Peapod's produce guru, who is described on the company's website as claiming that ""his lettuce talks to him."" (When asked about it, Mr. Stallone laughed it off.) Peapod has 19 to 21 hours to get totes to customers, and everything has to stay at the right temperature that whole time. If you break the cold chain on the way to a customer's refrigerator, Mr. Stallone said, even the healthiest-looking berries could rot too quickly. That potentially undermines one of the main selling points of delivery: the convenience. ""If you have a bad apple or a spoiled gallon of milk or broken eggs, we suddenly become inconvenient,"" he said. Mr. Browne goes around to the service entrance instead, where two maintenance men tell him that he can't use the elevator because they're doing repairs. ""I can't leave it with just anybody,"" he says, and doesn't agree to leave until one of the men offers to bring it up to the customer. ""You'll do it right now?"" he asks. ""O.K."" Not every item needs to be cold. In fact, a temperature below 58 degrees will destroy the bananas that Ms. Afifi picked out. FreshDirect, one of Peapod's competitors, wraps its bananas in little sleeves to keep them warm. (FreshDirect cools its entire trucks, while Peapod relies on dry ice, gel packs and other methods of controlling the temperature in each individual tote.) ""When it leaves the store, when it leaves the warehouse to get to you, that's the issue,"" said Phil Lempert, a grocery retailing expert. ""They can estimate within seconds of how long it takes to get from the truck to your house for a delivery."" Mr. Browne knows which doormen will let him use the bathroom, which customers tip well and which buildings will force him to use the service entrance, even if he's only carrying a couple of bags. Delivering perishable groceries is still largely an urban business, where logistics can be a nightmare. There are fewer places to park, more steps to climb and more garage doors to accidentally block. Mail carriers have offered some lessons for Peapod's competition; FreshDirect, for example, copies the UPS model of parking in one spot all day, and using multiple people to make multiple deliveries at a time. On his way into one building, Mr. Browne passes a cart full of FreshDirect groceries on the sidewalk. Unlike FreshDirect deliverymen, Mr. Browne works alone in his truck, and he has to move it for each delivery. Parking tickets are a cost of doing business, and Peapod even has a line item on the budget for fines and tolls. But moving around in a dense urban area has other challenges. ""It's a lot of traffic, real tight spaces, a lot of people, people will just cross right in front of the truck sometimes,"" Mr. Browne says. ""Working in the city is very difficult, that's why they say it's not for everyone."" As he drives, Mr. Browne scans the road for buses, cabs, pedestrians and even horses. Peapod drivers get a couple of hours of defensive driving training, and Mr. Browne keeps an eye on a camera that shows what's happening directly behind him. That helps him spot skateboarders who sometimes try to catch a free ride by grabbing his bumper. ""That's dangerous, because if I turn,"" he said, ""that guy is basically dead."" Once he makes it through Times Square, things get a little easier. Today he's mostly going to residential buildings with elevators, where people tend to tip better, inexplicably, than people who live in walk-ups. ""You have some customers where they have an elevator, they have a doorman, and they could have three bags, give you $20,"" says Mr. Browne, who has been working overtime to save up for a birthday party for one of his three children. ""I say, 'Thank you, this goes to my daughter's sweet 16.'"" Mr. Browne likes interacting with customers. He has families, college students, older people who he feels he's helping, because they can't easily shop for themselves. There's the woman who lives directly above a grocery store, but still orders online. There's the man who orders Froot Loops or cold cuts every couple of days, the woman who tips $20 every time. Today, he'll deliver to a couple of college students who must meet the truck outside. For security reasons, their dorm won't let delivery drivers upstairs. Younger people are especially important to grocery delivery companies. Millennials and Generation Y make up about a quarter of Peapod's customers, but in a few years those young people will likely begin spending more money on food; maybe they'll have families, or get a pet, or start making a little more money. They have grown up in an environment where everything is available online, and digital grocers want to get them hooked early. Peapod, for example, has added more organic, international and bulk items to its offerings, because those products tend to be popular among its younger customers. Generation X makes up about half of Peapod's customers, and the remaining 25 percent are older. In total, Peapod's customers are fairly evenly divided between the city and the suburbs, where Mr. Browne prefers to work. There are no horses or walk-ups, and he doesn't need to walk past the garbage at a service entrance. Though the distances are longer, non-metro areas tend to be cheaper places for Peapod to work, according to Ken Fanaro, the company's senior director of transportation planning and development. Fuel efficiency is better, and there are fewer parking tickets and tolls. But because customers are farther away and more widely spaced, drivers can do fewer orders per shift. (Tips, however, tend to be better outside the most densely populated areas, Mr. Browne says. One time he went to Staten Island â part of New York City, but largely suburban in layout â and made $200 over two days.) ""Every day, you're coming home with money,"" he says. ""I've never had a job like that before."" About half of Mr. Browne's customers today chose to tip him online when they placed their orders. Some will tip him in cash. Some, like the college students, won't tip at all. Today, the man in the fourth-floor walk-up who orders every couple of days tips Mr. Browne for the first time, giving him $3. ""What's up, boss?"" Mr. Browne says to the man at the top of the stairs, slightly out of breath. Mr. Browne has lost 15 pounds since he started this job about a year and a half ago. Today he is carrying a gallon of milk, laundry detergent and a couple of bags with his left arm, and holds a carton of eggs in his right hand. He tries to do everything in one trip, if he can. He opens the carton to show the eggs aren't broken â eggs must always be presented to the customer â and heads back downstairs. In and out. ""What's up, buddy?"" he says to a woman's cat, for whom he's carrying two big containers of litter. ""This is for you."" He chats with the cat's owner for a minute as he carries the bags into her apartment, but the small talk can't take extra time. Being late isn't as often a problem for Mr. Browne as is being early. Because the city is so unpredictable, the company frequently allots him more time than he needs. He is one of the fastest drivers who works out of Peapod's Jersey City warehouse, but he thinks he could do more deliveries. When he shows up early, he can't contact the customers directly. Instead, he has to call someone back at the office, who then calls the customer, to see if he can drop off the order ahead of time. If not, he has to wait. When the opposite happens â when people aren't home â Mr. Browne can wait only 15 minutes. The other day he had to wait for a woman in a fourth-floor walk-up, carrying three bags in each hand. ""Seven minutes, I could have done another delivery,"" he says. ","A street fight among grocers to deliver your milk, eggs, bananas"
Seema Mody,06292017,CNBC,06222017,"India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi met on Sunday with the creme de la creme of corporate America, in a CEO roundtable that contrasted sharply with a U.S. President Donald Trump's recent tech roundtable. Modi, who was expected to meet with Trump on Monday, attended the high-profile meetings set up via the Indian embassy, in which executives were said to have expressed concerns over India's current regulatory environment, which has made it difficult to invest and expand on the subcontinent. Some mentioned bureaucracy and a tough business climate as concerns as well. In the World Bank's annual report for 2017 on the ease of doing business globally, India ranked at 130 out of 190, with poor scores on factors including starting a business, resolving insolvency and paying taxes. Silicon Valley was well-represented at the meeting, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook, Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos, Google's Sundar Pichai and Adobe's Shantanu Narayan attending. When CNBC asked Cook how the meeting went, the Apple CEO responded by saying ""fantastic."" Other sectors were represented as well. Walmart's Doug McMilon also attended. McMillon was said to have sought a 1:1 meeting with Modi after the roundtable to convey his interest in continuing to expand his company's retail presence across India. Other attendees included Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld, Mastercard's Ajay Bhanga, Carlyle Group's David Rubenstein, IHS Markit's David Yergin and JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon. Dimon, who after the meeting with Modi was spotted having lunch with former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, was also positive about his interactions with the Indian leader. ""He [Modi] is always very receptive, he is open. He is very smart, very receptive, very actuaryâ¦.I don't think there were any sticking points,"" said Dimon to CNBC. JPMorgan, Uber and Kalanick didn't immediately return CNBC's emailed requests for comment, sent outside office hours, on the topics discussed at that meeting. The CEOs' praise of Modi was a sharp contrast to Trump's meeting last week with tech CEOs. Photographs of that event spread across social media, largely because Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos all looked less than happy to be there.

Jane Wells,06292017,CNBC,06222017,"Pickle juice has long been a summer thirst quencher in parts of the South, especially Texas. It's low calorie and may be better than plain water at relieving cramping from dehydration. Some people even freeze it. But no one had ever turned pickle juice into a business until John Howard fell on hard times. He co-founded Bob's Pickle Pops with his in-law, David Millar, and they now sell up to 7 million units a year. It all started when Howard found himself in a bit of a pickle... His San Antonio contracting business collapsed in the financial crisis, so he and his wife decided to borrow some money and buy a roller skating rink for about $200,000. They sold pickles at the snack bar, which were very popular with kids, and when the pickles ran out, ""we started giving them juice."" Soon the kids wanted the juice rather than the pickles, and Howard bought a machine to juice the pickles and create as much liquid as possible. He'd freeze the juice in two-ounce salsa containers. It was a hit. ""Before long, we were doing 300 or 400 a night,"" he says. ""We would sell more pickle juice than we would rent skates."" Howard and his wife couldn't make a go of the skating rink, so they shut it down after a year and a half. The pickle juice idea, however, stuck. ""It's very Texas,"" he says. ""It's very, very humid here, and so athletes, baseball players, little league, football teams, they all started drinking pickle juice."" Even NFL teams like the Philadelphia Eagles have embraced it. In 2008, Howard decided to start selling pickle juice to local stores and online. Millar, his in-law, created a website for their new product, which they named Pickle-sicle. They bought a machine to put juice in small plastic sleeves, and eventually they were shipping thousands of them. ""It was very, very difficult, a lot of hard work, and we were doing it all by hand,"" Howard says. He and his father would spend up to 14 hours a day filling packages. They also had to change the name of the product. Howard says Popsicle owns the trademark to any variation of ""sicle,"" and even though there is no pickle Popsicle, ""when we went to try to trademark our little pickle-sicle, we got shut down."" They renamed the company Bob's Pickle Pops, after a cartoon pickle created for the website. The frozen pops ended up on a segment of the Food Network's ""Unwrapped,"" which sent so much traffic to their website that it crashed. ""By the end of the day, we were over 10,000 orders,"" Howard says. ""We didn't sleep for about a week and a half."" But they were losing money. ""We had a lot of problems with shipping and cost overrides. Packaging was way too expensive."" A manufacturer near Dallas who read about the company reached out to help, and they came to an agreement. The manufacturer eventually took over the company, paying Howard and Millar royalties and keeping them involved in marketing and product development. Revenues have grown more than 1,000 percent, from $20,000 in 2008 to $230,000 in 2016. Howard's sales goal for 2017 is $500,000. Bob's Pickle Pops are now on Amazon and in Walmart. In fact, Walmart approached the company about buying the product, something that almost never happens. ""We had tried to get in with Walmart a year before that, and we just weren't on anybody's radar at the time,"" Howard says with a smile, adding that they'd originally bought jars of pickles for juicing at Sam's Club. Now Bob's Pickle Pops hopes to go national by targeting athletes, especially cyclists. It's expanded by adding flavors like lemon and lime to the juice (""grape and pickle juice don't go very well together""). It's also selling premium juice called Bob's Picklebacks for cocktails, capitalizing on a new trend of chasing a shot of Jameson with a shot of pickle juice. Howard says drinking pickle juice is more popular than a lot of people realize. ""Probably 50, 60 percent of every person I've talked to about pickle juice will admit they drank it out of the jar as a kid."" The company is popping out millions of pickle packets a year, and Howard's stress level is now cool as a cucumber, but he does miss the old days. ""Probably the funniest story was the very first time we ran product in a machine to put (juice) in a package. We had to supply juice for 150,000 units,"" he says. ""We worked days and days and days to get enough pickle juice to drive all the way up from San Antonio to Dallas in the back of a trailer for the packaging process."" It was the trip from hell. ""The lids were falling off the containers, the tires went flat on the way up, there were just so many problems,"" he says, ""but it was fun, because it was just us and all the family.""

Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) might be the world's largest retailer, but it takes a lot of people to support the company and its 11,723 stores around the world -- 2.3 million people, to be exact. That's how many employees Wal-Mart had at its latest update. By comparison, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) ended its first quarter with just 351,000 employees. Such are the advantages of a retail operation without cashiers or stockroom workers. Amazon workers still have to deal with massive warehouses full of over 50 million different items, but Amazon gives them help through the use of automated robotics systems. As a result, Amazon employees generate twice as much revenue as Walmart workers. Image source: Amazon I put together a nice little table breaking down Wal-Mart's and Amazon's latest quarter. Company Revenue Employees Revenue/Employee Amazon $35,714,000,000 351,000 $101,749 Wal-Mart $117,542,000,000 2,300,000 $51,105 Data source: Company quarterly earnings report and company facts page. It's important to note, however, that Amazon's workers are becoming less efficient. The company's been on a hiring spree lately, with its employee count growing 43% year over year in the first quarter. That drastically outpaces its consolidated revenue growth of 23%. In fact, Amazon's employee count has increased more than 40% in five of the last six quarters. Sales growth hasn't topped 30% in that same period. One of the big reasons for the ramp in employment is that Amazon is undergoing significant investments to bring new fulfillment centers online. That requires a lot of overhead (including labor) upfront while it ramps up the usage of its new warehouses. Amazon opened 26 new fulfillment centers in 2016, most of which came in the second half of the year, just ahead of the holiday shopping season. As Amazon's sales continue growing in 2017 and beyond, these warehouses ought to become even more labor efficient than Amazon's previous warehouses. Amazon's newest fulfillment centers are its eighth generation, and they rely heavily on robotics. Robots can more quickly pick items out of the warehouse and can bring them to workers to package. Amazon President of Worldwide Operations Dave Clark said the robots help cut order processing time from an hour-and-a-half to as little as 15 minutes. Additionally, the robots allow Amazon to store more items in the same amount of space since there's no need for aisles if the shelves can just move themselves. Clark says capacity in eighth-generation warehouses is 50% greater than the previous generation. So, not only do the robots help make workers more productive, since they do half the job for them, but they also help drive sales on Amazon.com for customers who want same-day or next-day delivery. Amazon has agreed to buy Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion. Like Wal-Mart, Whole Foods relies on brick-and-mortar storefronts full of people stocking shelves and checking out customers at registers. And with a more customer-focused workforce than Wal-Mart -- which is more efficiency focused -- it's no surprise that Whole Foods generates less revenue per employee than Wal-Mart. Last quarter, the company generated just about $43,000 per employee. Amazon may bring some changes to Whole Foods stores that positively impact worker efficiency. It's been experimenting in Seattle with a convenience store with no cashiers, called Amazon Go. It uses machine vision and other artificial intelligence to track which items shoppers place in their basket, and automatically charges their Amazon accounts after they walk out. That would enable staff to walk around and help customers more, or slash jobs, as was rumored over the weekend following the deal announcement. Additionally, Amazon is expected to use Whole Foods as a stepping stone to reach more customers through online grocery delivery. Online ordering can help increase the average number of tickets per hour, but may require someone to physically go pick out items. On the other side of the equation, however, Amazon is expected to try to lower prices at Whole Foods in order to help it compete with Walmart and other grocers. That could drive average ticket value lower, offsetting the efficiencies gained through technology. Overall, investors should expect Amazon to institute some of its employee-efficiency magic to help make the combined Whole Foods/Amazon more efficient than Walmart. ","

There doesn't seem to be a lot that Amazon.comÂ (NASDAQ:AMZN)Â can't do these days. The dot-com darling is on top of the world, padding its lead in online retail and now with a $13.7 billion deal in place to have a significant bricks-and-mortar presence. Amazon's the belle of the growth investor ball at the moment, but the one club it can't seem to get invited into is the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Amazon has been a component of theÂ S&P 500Â and Nasdaq 100 for years, but it hasn't made the cut in the exclusive and seemingly elusive Dow 30. It's just a matter of time, and it won't be a surprise if it replacesÂ Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) orÂ Home Depot (NYSE:HD) on the iconic market gauge. Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon is certainly worthy of being one of the market's 30 bellwethers, and it wouldn't be a shock if it replaced Wal-Mart or Home Depot as the two other retailers in the oft-cited stock index. The online retailerÂ surpassed Wal-Mart in terms of market cap two summers ago, and it flashed its high-beams and overtook Home Depot well before that. Amazon's $478.7 billion enterprise value is now more than the $475.9 billion in enterprise value that Wal-Mart and Home Depot command combined.Â Amazon belongs in the index, and the real question here is if it will replace one of the two existing retailers in the Dow 30 or if will just become its third component. None of this will happen, of course, until Amazon declares a stock split. With its stock north of $1,000 again, there's no way it's getting into theÂ price-weighted index. Unlike the market-weighted S&P 500, the Dow moves based on dollars instead of percentage points, and there's no way that Amazon is getting inducted into the elite squad of market tastemakers when its stock price is more than four times higher than the Dow 30's highest-priced component. Amazon's stock price is higher than the Dow's 15 lowest-priced stocks, so it's not going in if it can offset half of the index. An Amazon stock split is inevitable, even if it has nothing to do with pining for inclusion in the Dow 30. Let's fast-forward to the days following Amazon's stock split. Can the Dow justify keeping Wal-Mart and Home Depot but not the country's most valuable retailer? Probably not. It's true that Wal-Mart generates more net sales than Amazon, but the market feels that Amazon is the superior company because of its headier growth and heartier growth prospects. Amazon's growth -- especially once its organic grocery deal goes through -- will also be coming at Wal-Mart's expense even more in the future, and the Dow doesn't want to be stuck with a losing race ticket. Home Depot generates lower revenue than Amazon or Wal-Mart, but it's not in the Dow 30 just because it's a retailer. The retailer behind the orange aprons is a measuring stick for the housing and home improvement industries. Amazon is more likely to replace Wal-Mart than boot Home Depot, though when you get down to it Amazon is so much more than just a retailer. It can replace the weakest of the Dow 30 components and the move would still make sense. ","

Amazon'sÂ (NASDAQ:AMZN)Â acquisition ofÂ Whole FoodsÂ last Friday drowned out news of another major retail deal. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.Â (NYSE:WMT) said it would acquire upscale men's clothing retailer Bonobos for $310 million. The move was puzzling to many Bonobos customers, some of whom left angry responses to the announcement on Twitter, saying they would boycott the brand and thought Wal-Mart, which is known for cheap clothing and low prices, would ruin it. But those protesters misunderstand the nature of the deal. Rather than being lumped in with Wal-Mart and everything it stands for, Bonobos will be overseen by Jet.com founder Marc Lore on the Jet.com side of the business as it becomes the latest ""digitally native vertical brand"" to join Wal-Mart along with ModCloth. Both ModCloth and Bonobos products will be sold on Jet.com in addition to their own websites. Wal-Mart has also acquired e-commerce sites ShoeBuy, Hayneedle, and Moosejaw, though the distinction between those and ModCloth and Bonobos is that the latter two sell their own branded products. Lore has been focused on adding e-commerce brands in ""long-tail"" sectors like apparel, which he sees as the next big growth market in e-commerce, as does Amazon with its focus on fashion. According to Wal-Mart's own statement, the company aims to add ""best-in-class owned, vertical consumer brands"" and build expertise in key long-tail categories like apparel and home. Expertise may be the key in that statement, as Wal-Mart, after dominating the low-end retail market for so many years, is now focused on more premium products through Jet.com as it looks to expand its market. Wal-Mart e-commerce chief Marc Lore (right) pictured with Bonobos CEO Andy Dunn. Image source: Andy Dunn/Medium Just as Wal-Mart acquired Jet.com in part to bring e-commerce mastermind Marc Lore into its ranks, the Bonobos acquisitions brings founder and CEO Andy Dunn on board at Wal-Mart, where he will oversee the company's collection of digitally native vertical brands. It seems like Lore is looking to build a team, rather than just a stable of brands. In a blog post, Dunn said that Lore had been a mentor of his for a long time, and called him ""the most ambitious and innovative e-commerce entrepreneur on the planet."" Dunn was optimistic about what he and Lore could accomplish with Wal-Mart's backing, saying the two had a ""mind meld"" on how brands and platforms will develop in the fast-evolving e-commerce space. Bonobos is the fifth e-commerce brand acquisition Lore has spearheaded in less than a year with Wal-Mart. His mission is to drive e-commerce growth and challenge Amazon.com. The value Jet.com brings to Wal-Mart is that while the retail giant has dominated groceries and commodity goods, its brand image has undermined its website with more premium brands, which are reluctant to sell on Wal-Mart. Jet.com gives the company the opportunity to do that, and it is notably searching for brands that have not sold on Amazon. In addition to accelerating delivery on Wal-Mart and offering new promotions like a pickupÂ discount, and even testing employees making deliveries, Lore seems focused on building the Jet.com site into its own e-commerce powerhouse. Adding a popular brand like Bonobos that's exclusive to Jet is a good first step in that mission. But Amazon's blockbuster deal in the grocery industry and its decision to lower Prime rates for those on public assistance shows that Amazon could become Wal-Mart -- a mass merchandiser selling everything including groceries -- before Wal-Mart can turn into Amazon -- a dominant e-commerce retailer with the competitive advantages that go with it. One thing is clear for Lore and Wal-Mart: The company can't stand still and expect to keep Amazon at bay.Â Look for more acquisitions like Bonobos in the near future. ","

A moat, or competitive advantage, is an essential part of a good company. Without it, a company is more likely to see profits shrink during periods of competitive pressure. One industry undergoing extreme competitive pressure right now is retail. With the growth of e-commerce led by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), many retailers are struggling to keep stores open. Target (NYSE:TGT) is weathering the storm, but it's been selling off assets like its pharmacies, credit card portfolio, and Canadian operations to help. It also announced plans to forego profit growth for three years and invest $7 billion in reinvigorating its stores and improving its e-commerce operations. But that investment is only going to pay off in the long run if Target has a moat that will help it produce a good return on that investment. Let's take a closer look at Target to see what its competitive advantage is. Image source: Target One of the best indicators that a company has a strong moat is if it has a higher gross margin than its competitors. Target has an extremely high gross margin compared to Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST). Company Gross Margin (latest fiscal year) Target 29.7% Wal-Mart 24.9% Costco 11.4% Data source: 2016 Target annual report. But while these stores are generally compared to each other, they all operate drastically differently. Importantly, both Wal-Mart and Costco derive a significant portion of their sales from consumables. Wal-Mart is the United States' largest grocer, with groceries accounting for more than half of its sales. By comparison, food, beverage, and pet supplies accounted for just 22% of sales at Target last year. Food carries a much lower margin than most other categories because people always come back for more. Categories where Target has relatively strong sales, like apparel and home furnishings, generally have higher margins. In fact, those categories are what Target calls its ""Signature"" categories. Targets strong apparel sales may be indicative of the company offering some sort of differentiation from the competition. Indeed, its apparel sales gained market share last year, according to the company's annual report. But as more shoppers opt to buy clothes online, Target stands to lose a lot of sales. Target's online sales are significantly lagging those of Wal-Mart and Amazon. Wal-Mart specifically has been investing heavily in expanding its ability to sell high-margin apparel online with its various e-commerce acquisitions like ShoeBuy and Bonobos. Amazon, meanwhile, is investing in its own private labels, similar to Target's strategy. Importantly, as competitive pressure increases, other retailers will look to expand sales in high-margin categories like apparel. Wal-Mart and Amazon are likely willing to take a lower margin than Target because apparel sales would both increase overall profit margin by leveraging existing infrastructure and drive more traffic to their stores. Target will be on the other end of the equation, feeling pricing pressure. Target might have considerable brand equity, economies of scale, and good store locations, but that just gets it a seat at the table in a fierce retail environment. Wal-Mart has Target beat on all of those fronts, and nobody can touch Amazon's online operations (not to mention it just added a whole bunch of grocery stores). Without a meaningful competitive advantage, Target's plan to invest $7 billion may take a long time to produce results for investors. That's especially true as big competitors start encroaching on its high-margin product categories. While investors shouldn't expect profit growth for the next three years, it's still unclear whether they can expect much more in the next decade, either. ","

Obamacare is struggling. Trumpcare is...well, who knows what's really happening with it? But if you think the U.S. will just have to wait for any healthcare reform, think again. Several large companies are taking matters into their own hands. Boeing (NYSE:BA), General Electric (NYSE:GE), JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU), Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW), and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are moving forward with a major change in how healthcare is reimbursed. Here's what they're doing -- regardless of what the federal government does about healthcare reform. Image source: Getty Images. Aircraft manufacturer Boeing began contracting directly with healthcare providers in 2014. The company gave employees an option to stay with their existing health plan or switch to a more limited provider network with which Boeing negotiated prices. This was a key step to implementing a new way of paying for healthcare known as bundled payments. What are bundled payments? It's a model where healthcare providers are paid for an ""episode of care"" -- everything involved in a patient's care, including all tests, procedures, medications, and services -- in one bundle. Currently, most healthcare costs are paid in a kind of ""a la carte"" fashion, with each individual healthcare provider receiving payment for their part of a patient's care. General Electric is another leader among employers in advancing use of bundled payments. In 2014, GE contracted with hospitals in different cities to provide hip and knee replacement surgeries under a bundled payment model. The big conglomerate had previously used bundled payments with other providers forÂ for organ transplants, weight-loss surgeries, and some types of care for cancer patients. In 2013, Lowe's, Wal-Mart, JetBlue, and other companies, in collaboration withÂ the Pacific Business Group on Health (PBGH) and Health Design Plus (HDP), launchedÂ the Employers Centers of Excellence Network (ECEN). ECEN assists employers in setting up bundled payment deals with healthcare providers. ECEN started out with bundled payment arrangements for only hip and knee replacements. The organization later added spine procedures. More recently, ECEN has established a bundled payment deal for weight-loss surgery. Boeing, GE, Lowe's, Wal-Mart, JetBlue, and other companies are interested in bundled payments for the same reason that Medicare has experimented with the idea: It holds the potential to save money. Research has found huge variations between the cost for the same procedure at one healthcare provider compared to another. Use of bundled payments presents an opportunity to address this problem. But do bundled payment actually reduce healthcare costs? Based on what Lowe's has found with its participation with ECEN, the answer is yes. Image source: Lowe's. What about the financial impact on healthcare providers from bundled payments? Some don't like the idea, because they're afraid they'll make less money. Others see opportunities. Geisinger Health System, for example, has worked with Wal-Mart and with ECEN for several years. Geisinger found that the re-engineering of its processes to work with the bundled payment model led to improvements in other areas as well. Trumpcare -- or at least the American Health Care Act version of it passed by the U.S. House of Representatives -- doesn't include any references to bundled payments. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon, has been adamantly opposed to mandating of bundled payments by Medicare in the past, stating in a letter last year that it's ""experimenting with Americans' health."" At this point, it doesn't seem likely that the federal government will be championing the approach. American businesses, on the other hand, seem likely to forge ahead. These companies must answer to boards of directors and shareholders who demand continued improvement on the bottom line. With healthcare costs becoming an increasingly larger burden for employers, bundled payment models will probably grow in popularity in the corporate world. The potential for reducing healthcare costs is too attractive of an opportunity to pass up. ","

Amazon, anÂ e-commerce powerhouse, has disrupted a large swath of the retail industry and has been testing the waters in the grocery industry for nearly a decade with its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Pantry concepts, and its concept store without checkout lines. Is Kroger doomed by Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods? Image source: Kroger. Website Quartz calculated that Whole Foods' 440 U.S. stores are within three miles of 75 million U.S. shoppers. The company struggled from growing competition in its core organic fare, but adding these locations to Amazon's already powerful arsenal of unrivaled pricing power and growing delivery network may create an indomitable force in the grocery arena. Still, difficulties remain regarding fresh groceries. Items like milk, eggs, and frozen foods require refrigeration to keep from spoiling, and require shorter delivery times and a person available to accept delivery. Produce is tricky, and choice in the area is subjective. Consumers may want to consume that avocado today, or a few days from now, so the level of ripeness comes into play. Kroger was already facing increased competition on the home front, from German grocers Aldi and Lidl. Both discount grocery chains are well known in Europe and have been expanding their footprints in the U.S. Their operations are most comparable to Trader Joe's -- stocking a limited selection of items at lower prices. They rarely stock name brands, preferring to sell their own private-label products, instead. The locations are also typically smaller than comparable U.S. stores, with only six aisles versus 24 for their U.S. counterparts. Kroger's Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman said that competition is just part of the business: This industry has always been highly competitive. I've been around Kroger -- it will be 32 years in October -- and year-in, year-out it's a competitive industry. Each year has been more competitive than the last. Competition is nothing new to Kroger. Image source: Getty Images. This may all seem like an eerie bit of deja vu to Kroger. Similar pressures occurred in 2002 when Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) first entered the grocery business. Investors feared that Walmart's state-of-the-art inventory management and increased pricing competition might make it difficult for Kroger to compete. In the 15 years since those dire prognostications, both have endured, and Kroger has even thrived. Kroger has been preparing for the German invasion by cutting prices in competing locations. In its most recent quarter, Kroger reported sales of $36.3 billion, up from $34.6 billion, an increase of 4.9% over the prior-year quarter. Excluding fuel sales, revenue increased only 2.9% year over year. Net income fell to $546 million from $696 million in the prior-year quarter, while earnings per share fell to $0.58 compared to $0.72 year over year, excluding one-time items. The headline, though, was the decrease in same-store sales -- which fell by 0.2%, excluding fuel -- the third consecutive quarterly decline. Kroger also lowered its guidance for the remainder of the year to a range of $2.00 and $2.05 from its previous estimates of $2.21 to $2.25, as the competition was already taking its toll. Prices on key items like milk and eggs were lowered to match those of competitors, temporarily depressing results. The news wasn't all bad. Kroger has been beefing up its online sales capabilities and saw 30% in new digital customers and a 30% increase in online sales visits year over year. More importantly, digital revenue more than doubled over the prior-year quarter. Kroger has also been aggressively buying back shares for years. During the last 12 months, the company reduced its diluted shares outstanding by 3.5%, and by nearly 50% since January 2000. In the wake of its stock swoon, Kroger announced an opportunistic $1 billion share buyback, along with an increase in its dividend to $0.50 from $0.48, further benefiting shareholders over the long term. There's little doubt that the level of competition has escalated, but Kroger has been down this road before. No one really knows Amazon's plans for integrating Whole Foods into its operations. The future just became a bit more uncertain for Kroger investors, but it's still too early to call the game in Amazon's favor. ","

Many of its retailing peers are setting multiyear lows right now, but Costco (NASDAQ:COST) seems to be trading in a different market. Its most recent dip caused the stock to fall below the broader S&P 500 for the year, but it is still up solidly over the trailing five-year period. On one hand, that relatively strong performance reflects the fact that Costco isn't as exposed to many of the awful business trends that are pinching peers like Target (NYSE:TGT) and Kroger (NYSE:KR). On the other hand, its steep price premium means the stock has a long way to fall if the business stumbles. Below, we'll look at whether that pricing risk is worth signing up for as an investor. Image source: Getty Images. Costco's operating results are less volatile than most retailers for a simple reason: It isn't actually a retailer. Most of the company's earnings come from subscription sales, not product markups, after all. And those fees, unlike prices for goods like groceries and apparel, tend to rise regardless of the competitive selling environment. Yes, Costco can go years in between membership fee hikes, but it hasn't yet needed to lower its core subscription fee to keep attracting new customers. Kroger and Target both recently slashed their annual earnings forecasts as they moved to increase price investments in a bid to protect market share. Costco, in contrast, just raised its membership fee by 10%. The warehouse club setup translates into small but steady earnings growth that makes Costco an unusually dependable investment. Net income hovers around 2% of sales and has doubled over the last decade. Rival retailers have endured both more volatility and lower growth over that time. COST Net Income (TTM). Data by YCharts. Costco has $5 billion of long-term debt on its books, which amounts to a comfortable two times the past year's net profits. Its annual operating cash flow is $4 billion and provides plenty of resources to fund an aggressive store expansion strategy in addition to any other important priorities like e-commerce. So far, management has decided to take a conservative approach to the online sales threat. But recent moves by AmazonÂ to elbow deeper into the grocery market might force the warehouse giant to dedicate more cash to this sales channel, and that could result in lower earnings over the short term. The retailer's dividend policy isn't as generous as some of its peers, but Costco still ultimately delivers most of its excess cash to investors -- usually through sporadic special dividends. Management is taking advantage of the low interest rate environment to fund these payouts through added debt. An important risk to owning a high-performing business like this is paying too high a price. There's no denying that Costco is valued at a huge premium to other big retailers. Its price-to-earnings multiple is more than double Target's and Kroger's and far ahead of Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT). The premium holds on a revenue basis, too, given that investors have to pay 0.56 times revenue for Costco's shares compared to 0.47 times for Wal-Mart. COST PE Ratio (TTM). Data by YCharts. That valuation gap implies more modest returns for Costco shareholders ahead that could turn yet lower -- if membership renewal rates fall from their perch at near 90%. In exchange for that premium, though, shareholders get to own a retailing business that's better insulated from e-commerce threats and less susceptible to short-term swings in shopper behavior.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Based on its promised payout, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) isn't a strong dividend stock. The warehouse retailer's $2-per-share annual payment amounts to a paltry one-third of its earnings and the yield is below 1.3%. Compare that to broader market averages that yield 2% and pay about half of all profits out in dividends. Investors don't even need to leave the retailing industry to find bigger yields and more generous payout ratios. In fact, most of its peers, including Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT), promise to return 50% or more of their earnings as dividends. Home Depot's (NYSE:HD) target payout is 55% and it yields 2.3% today. Yet Costco has supplemented that small dividend with surprise, one-time cash payments to investors. The most recent special dividend hit shareholders' accounts in late May and was worth just over $3 billion, which pushed its total special payout past $8 billion since 2012. Metric 2012 2015 2017 Per-share value $7 $5 $7 Total value $3.1 billion $2.2 billion $3.1 billion Data source: Costco financial filings. That's a massive amount of cash. The retailer earned a total of $12 billion over the six fiscal years that span these payouts, which means the special dividend alone accounted for 70% of its earningsÂ during that time. Costco has no shortage of initiatives that require hefty cash investments. Unlike big-box peer Home Depot, it is still actively expanding its store base, for one. Costco plans to add 26 new warehouses to its base this year to come in just shy of its most aggressive annual addition yet. That's the single biggest component in capital expenditure spending that amounts to about $3 billion per year. Image source: Getty Images. On the other hand, Costco's more conservative approach to the e-commerce challenge saves it cash relative to the competition. Home Depot, Wal-Mart, and Target are all bulking up their fulfillment infrastructure in a race to get shipping times to within one or two business days and counteract declining customer traffic at physical shops. In Costco's case, management sees a much more limited role for the online segment since its subscription business provides cover against online-focused rivals. ""We still are a brick and mortar entity,"" Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti told investors earlier this year, ""and we want to get you into the store because you're going to buy more in the warehouse."" Costco has opted to rely heavily on debt to fund the special dividends over the years. Its long-term liabilities were just over $5 billion as of the end of fiscal 2016, making it easy to see the rising debt levels that corresponded with the increased dividend payments. COST Total Long Term Liabilities (Annual). Data by YCharts. And while the retailer has made progress pushing that figure down over the past nine months, it's set to jump higher again once the most recent payout hits the books. In their May announcement, executives highlighted the fact that returning cash to shareholders in this way allows it to preserve its ""financial and operational flexibility to continue to grow our business globally."" As a shareholder, though, I'd prefer Costco just boost its quarterly payout to bring it more in line with industry averages. A 50% payout ratio would still leave plenty of resources to devote to the retailer's expansion plans while giving income investors the kind of steady cash returns they already receive from peers in the space.

"Matthew DiLallo, Daniel Miller, and Rich Duprey",06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. While large-cap stocks might not have as much upside potential as smaller companies, these behemoths can still be excellent wealth generators over the long term. More importantly, that value creation often comes with less risk for the investor because these companies have established themselves as market leaders. While there are several large-cap stocks to choose from, three that caught our eye as having the potential to deliver outsized gains in the years ahead areÂ Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), and Enbridge (NYSE:ENB). Rich Duprey (Amazon.com): Because Amazon.com has altered the retail landscape and redefined how an e-commerce company should operate -- as well as changing even how we think about such businesses -- it's a good bet that we'll continue seeing the online retail king transforming itself and its industry well into the future. Image source: Getty Images. When considering an Amazon investment, though, it's necessary to toss out all standard valuation models. You can't look at price-to-earnings ratios or similar metrics because almost since its appearance on the public stage 20 years ago, it has seemed overvalued.Â And because it continues to shift and evolve over time, knowing what to look at becomes exceedingly difficult. For example, who could have predicted that a simple online bookseller would become a critical cloud-based web services provider powering the businesses of major corporations worldwide; would operate its own fleet of aircraft to handle the logistics of delivery; would become the biggest apparel retailer; and would be able to buy the foremost organic food retailer, Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM)? What does seem clear is that stasis is not in Amazon's DNA, and that the one constant is change. But even so, its position as the premiere online retailer will only grow. During the holiday season, for example, Slice Intelligence reported that the e-commerce site accounted for half of all U.S. online sales on the Monday before Christmas, and it had a 38% share for the holiday season overall. That's going to grow as sales continue to move online and the death of the shopping mall becomes more apparent. Amazon's importance to the fabric of the economy will become further ingrained and its stock will continue to rise, regardless of current valuation. Daniel Miller (Wal-Mart):Â It's pretty incredible to think how quickly the world -- and business in general -- moves these days. Because of that, it's easy to forget how dominating and cutting-edge Wal-Mart'sÂ scale, pricing power, and distribution were two decades ago when it was crushing every chain in its path. Since then, the world has surged in terms of technology and e-commerce, and many investors now consider Wal-Mart outdated. But you shouldn't make that mistake. We already know that Wal-Mart is the largest retailer in the world by revenue. That simply means that few retailers can even compete with the company's scale and pricing power. We already know that Wal-Mart is essentially a one-stop option in the brick-and-mortar world. But to be successful for the long term, Wal-Mart needs to focus on its e-commerce, and it's absolutely doing that. With its acquisition of Jet.com and free two-day delivery on qualified products, Wal-Mart is attempting to take a page out of Amazon's book in hopes of drastically boosting user traffic to the company's e-commerce websites. With Wal-Mart's massive locations, which number around 11,700, it has the network to competitively distribute products from its stores to nearby customers for its online sales, as long as it creates the technology to effectively and efficiently connect the dots. If it can, it shouldn't be out of reach for Wal-Mart to drive its online sales around 30% annually through the remainder of this decade. Wal-Mart used to be a massive retailer with a simple online website. That's no longer the case -- and it's trying new concepts as well. Its e-commerce struggles are turning around quickly, and with its scale and distribution advantages already in hand, the company is well-positioned to succeed over the long term. Image source: Getty Images. Matt DiLalloÂ (Enbridge):Â While most companies focus on short-term goals, such as meeting quarterly earnings guidance, energy infrastructure giant Enbridge sets its gaze on the long term. That's evident by the length of its current growth projections. While many of its pipeline rivals don't provide investors with a dividend growth forecast, Enbridge expects to increase its payout by double digits all the way through 2024, which is by far the longest forecast in the sector. Driving that forecast is the company's sector-leading backlog of growth projects, which includes 26 billion Canadian dollars ($19.6 billion) in execution and another CA$48 billion ($36.2 billion) under development. Since these are primarily fee-based and regulated assets, Enbridge anticipates that its cash flow will steadily rise as these projects enter service. Furthermore, it's worth noting that while many of those projects are oil pipelines, Enbridge has been focusing more attention on investments in cleaner energy solutions, including natural gas pipelines and offshore wind farms, which make up more than half of the projects it has in development. Enbridge's recent focus on wind investments is particularly noteworthy because these facilities generate returns that are as good as new oil pipelines -- if not better. Meanwhile, the sector is expected to grow at a faster pace than fossil fuels, providing Enbridge with plenty of potential growth opportunities in the years ahead. As Enbridge captures more of these opportunities, it could allow the company to continue growing faster than rivals, which makes it an excellent stock to own for the long term. ","
      
    3 Large-Cap Stocks for the Long Term -- The Motley Fool

Rich Duprey,06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In a stock market that seemingly hits new highs daily, finding stocks that offer a good value becomes increasingly difficult. Still, you can't base an investment decision on stock price alone, as oftentimes, a cheap stock is cheap for a reason. Yet combining a good business and a good valuation means investors can have a winning combination on their hands. Here, we'll pluck outÂ Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS), and Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS)Â from the universe of stocks as being representative of stocks that are ridiculously cheap. Image source: Best Buy. While the concept of showrooming -- visiting a local store to see and test a product before buying it online -- almost doomed Best Buy, it turned that liability into a competitive advantage by investing heavily in its own digital efforts. Today, online sales are among its strongest attributes, with comparable online sales surging 22.5% in the first quarter, not much different from the 23.5% gain it registered a year ago. Coupled with hewing away $1.35 billion in costs over the past few years as part of its Renew Blue InitiativeÂ that created a firmer, more stable financial position, no one talks about Best Buy as being the next Circuit City or Radio Shack implosion. Indeed, in areas such as appliances, it is expected to soon surpass Sears Holdings (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ) as the third biggest major appliance retailer. Image source: Getty Images. Audio-chip specialist Cirrus Logic has had a similarly strong run-up over the past year, with its shares gaining 63% in the past 12 months but also pulling back from recent highs. While that was partially the result of investor worry about just how much Cirrus still generates from sales of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones, the decline from 85% to 78% indicates it will undoubtedly start getting more money from Samsung and its Galaxy S8. But with Cirrus anticipating its technology to start trickling down to mid-tier phones as well, the chipmaker could see a profusion of sales in its future. Sure, having the best-selling, top-of-the-line smartphone makers as your prime moneymakers is good, but tastes can sometimes be fickle and one or the other will fall out of favor. A broad swath of the buying public owns these other feature-rich, lower price phones, and tapping into that market can be a huge benefit. Moreover, not only is Cirrus introducing its chipsets to new clients in smartphones, but it's also looking to apply them to completely different markets, such as smart-home systems and infotainment platforms in cars. Cirrus Logic also has a very discounted valuation considering the gains its stock has already made, as well as those sure to come. Like Best Buy, it stock trades at a discount across measures such as its market multiple, earnings estimates and their growth, and its free cash flow. Image source: Getty Images. Like the other stocks discussed here, Dick's Sporting Goods stock is also deeply depressed on valuation, but it also hasn't had the same kind of performance as the other two, and that makes it the riskiest of the three. Its shares have fallen 7% in the past year, but they've lost almost 40% of their value from recent highs. That's because investors remain concerned about the bricks-and-mortar retail space. Amazon.comÂ has, of course, upended much of the landscape, but Wal-Mart and other mass-merchandise retailers have made significant headway in the sporting-goods space, too. Add in bankruptcies from Gander Mountain and Sports Authority, as well as the retail woes atÂ Cabela'sÂ and its pending buyout by Bass Pro Shops, and you have a lot of uncertainty circling the leading industry player. Yet that's the very key to the company's future. While other lesser retailers may be stumbling, Dick's Sporting Goods remains on firm financial footing. Much as Best Buy became the last man standing in consumer electronics following the demise of its rivals, and ultimately ended up better for it, Dick's Sporting Goods could fare equally well, though it may have to go through some pain in the meantime. Still, analysts are expecting it to grow earnings at 12% annually for the next five years, and it trades at a bargain-basement price of just 11 times its free cash flow. Dick's isn't immune to the vortex swirling around retail, but it's not in danger of being sucked into it, either. Rich has been a Fool since 1998 and writing for the site since 2004.

    These 3 Stocks Are Ridiculously Cheap -- The Motley Fool

  "
Francine McKenna,06292017,MarketWatch,06222017,"Published: June 28, 2017 12:43 p.m. ET Gift-card change could result in big bottom-line impact By Big-name retailers including Amazon, Starbucks and Wal-Mart should see a major benefit from the landmark new revenue-recognition standard that will hit bottom lines directly starting in the first quarter of 2018. The largest retailers are still evaluating the final overall impact of the new Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, revenue-recognition rule called ASC 606, which is effective for public companies in 2018. One significant positive impact of the new rules for retail businesses could be how revenue from the unredeemed portion of company-issued gift cards, called breakage revenue, is recognized. âUnder the new standard, hundreds of millions of gift-card breakage revenue may get recognized earlier,â says Olga Usvyatsky, the vice president of research at Audit Analytics. Read: $1 billion in gift cards go unused every year â hereâs how to avoid that Most companies will be able to accelerate breakage revenue rather than holding on to it until the likelihood anyone cashes in the balance becomes remote or until the card expires. The accounting change will affect everyone who issues gift cards, from classic bricks-and-mortar grocery and fashion retailers to restaurants to Amazon and other online stores. The new accounting standard is intended to make revenue recognition consistent between U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and International Financial Reporting Standards. The converged standard, jointly prepared by FASB, which is responsible for GAAP, and the International Accounting Standards Board, which is responsible for IFRS, will change the timing of the recognition of some revenue and may impact the gross amount of revenue presented for certain customer contracts. The new rule requires companies to spread breakage income over the expected gift-card redemption period. In 2009, Congress passed the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act, which prohibited the expiration of gift cards within five years from the date they were activated and generally limits inactivity fees on gift cards except in certain circumstances, such as if there has been no transaction for at least 12 months. In the past, companies recorded a potential liability to customers when gift cards were sold. The liability was reduced and revenue recognized as cards were redeemed. Companies have been recognizing the income impact of gift cards that are never redeemed under multiple scenarios based on their own experience with redemption patterns. Retailers that currently use five years as the time when the probability of redemption finally becomes remote will see the biggest positive impact from the change. Those that use between 24 and 60 months will still feel the impact of a change to a redemption period that will likely be a year or less. Companies will also feel the positive impact of recognizing the breakage revenue proportionately over their typical redemption period.

                                  gift cards do not impose any expiration dates on their cards. Starbucks recorded $60 million in breakage income in 2016, a significant jump from 2015âs addition of $39.3 million. Home Depot recognized $34 million in gift-card breakage income on 2016, about even with 2015âs $27 million, while Bloominâ Brands took $26 million into income. Dunkinâ Brands booked $22.3 million last year. None of these companies reported their overall gift-card liability in recent SEC filings, and they are all still evaluating the impact of the new standard and their method of adoption.

                                  had outstanding gift-card liabilities of $389 million at the end of 2016 and recognized gift-card breakage income of $12 million for the year, according to its annual report filed with the SEC. Nordstrom reported that it was changing its estimate of breakage in 2017 to 2% of the amount initially issued from 3% in 2016, which was probably immaterial to its reported income. The company also disclosed it will begin recognizing gift-card breakage income at the point of sale when the rule become effective in the first quarter of 2018. Based on these disclosures, Usvyatsky estimates that Nordstrom could have a positive impact of approximately $5.5 million from the change in treatment of gift-card breakage in fiscal 2016. The company previously known as CEBTower Group, now Gartner, estimates the gift-card marketâs value to be $149 billion in 2017. A recent report indicates breakage declined from 7% in 2008 to 0.75% in 2015, so Nordstromâs 2% figure may not be unreasonable but may not be an appropriate estimate for other retailers, says Usvyatsky.

                                  total liability for unredeemed gift cards at the end of 2016 was $2.4 billion. The rule change will allow Amazon to de-recognize at least 15 monthsâ worth of its breakage liability as income, because the company can move from waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote, generally two years, to its expected typical customer redemption period, or about nine months. Usvyatsky estimates the impact will be positive for Amazon but likely not material, and putting a number on it at this time âwould be pure speculation.â When companies adopt the new standard â for public companies, in the first quarter of 2018 â the adjustment will be made to the beginning balance of retained earnings, according to Jack T. Ciesielski, the publisher of the Analystâs Accounting Observer. Companiesâ first-quarter revenues will include the application of the new method of accounting for breakage, and they will also have to disclose the amount by which the revenue changed due to the accounting change, says Ciesielski.

Emma Court,06292017,MarketWatch,06222017,"Published: June 27, 2017 9:12 a.m. ET Pharmacies need to do more if they want to compete with Amazon By In November of 2015, Quest Diagnostics Inc. and Safeway Inc. joined to do something new and unusual: offer lab services like blood tests in Safeway pharmacy locations. By now, the companies have opened 65 such locations, and theyâre aiming for 200 by the end of this year. Consumers can already fill prescription drugs at pharmacies and even get diagnoses at increasingly widespread pharmacy clinics. Why not lab work, too? The concept, which is fairly new, has taken on a new urgency.

An Amazon pharmacy entry isnât a sure thing â the company told MarketWatch it has âa practice of declining to comment on rumors and speculationâ â and some on Wall Street are skeptical about the retail giantâs interest in pharmacy or ability to break into the highly regulated industry.

                                   has also said itâs interested in partnerships. See:  Amazonâs Whole Foods deal pummels pharmaceutical stocks  This type of partnership offers big benefits for both pharmacy chains and lab service providers. Lab services can give pharmacies an edge up in a competitive market and get more people in their stores, Goldwasser said. Those with in-house clinics would especially benefit from lab services being available, she noted. âCVS is well positioned with 1,081 MinuteClinics,â she said. âWalgreens, with 374 clinics, can still catch up,â but will need to partner with more health care providers to do it. Meanwhile, Rite Aid has just under 100 clinics in a handful of states, she said. Having lab services located conveniently should also mean more tests get done, a boon for lab services companies. Quest labs in Safeway pharmacies can do routine blood tests and more complex gene-based and molecular testing, for example. Working with pharmacies also makes more sense than striking out on their own, since âpharmacies already have an established premier retail footprint and sharing overhead expense could yield incremental savings,â Goldwasser said. Quest shares have risen 11.1% over the past three months, compared with a 4% rise in the S&P 500

Also impacting markets were Republicans in the U.S. Senate, who opted to postpone a vote on a controversial bill to replace Obamacare with a conservative alternative. Some investors have viewed health-care reform, a major legislative priority for President Donald Trump, as a symbol of how easily Trump can get his economic initiatives through Congress. As markets spiked following his election, in large part on expectations for his agenda, many analysts view getting his bills passed as necessary for justifying current valuations.

                                  surged 2%, after closing at a 6Â½-month low on Friday. The stock had plunged 12.7% since the AmazonâWhole Foods deal was announced through Friday, the worst six-session stretch since November 2008. âIt seemed like a bit of an overreaction,â said Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti in a phone interview with MarketWatch. âAt the end of the day, we have to perform.â Analyst Budd Bugatch at Raymond James raised his rating on Costco to outperform from market perform, a rating which had been in place since at least June 26, 2014. He established a stock-price target of $173, which was 7.9% above current levels. Bugatch said that, though the AmazonâWhole Foods deal introduces a competitor in the grocery business and will likely accelerate delivery and other technology innovations, Costcoâs grocery business is a âvastly different styleâ business than Whole Foods, with customers tending toward bulk purchases. Donât miss:  Amazon âwill be a top 5 grocer in the U.S.â with Whole Foods acquisition. Also: Amazonâs Whole Foods deal makes online grocery âprimeâ for acceleration. The âtreasure huntâ aspect of a Costco shopping trip âis unique to its business model and creates a very loyal customer following,â Bugatch wrote in a note to clients. âSo, while Amazonâs agreement to buy Whole Foods, when consummated, will add a new dimension to the grocery business, it does not materially impact Costcoâs unique business model, and we would be buyers on [the stockâs] recent weakness.â In fiscal 2016, which ended last August, foods, including dry foods, packaged foods and groceries, accounted for the biggest portion of revenue at 22%; sundries, which at Costco include snack foods, candy, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages and cleaning supplies, were second at 21% of revenue; and fresh foods, including meat, produce, deli and bakery goods, placed fourth at 14%, according to Costcoâs annual report. Bugatch did caution investors, however, that even with the recent tumble in price, the stock still traded at a premium valuation relative to its large-capitalization retail peers and the S&P 500. That is why he didnât turn fully bullish by raising his rating to strong buy, which for Raymond James means a stock is expected to produce a total return of at least 15% over the next six to 12 months. Costcoâs price-to-earnings ratio, a valuation metric based on earnings-per-share over the past 12 months, was at 27.76, according to FactSet. That compares with P/E ratios of Kroger Co.

Hereâs what I learned after doing a deeper analysis that is far from exhaustive, but can provide some pointers to income investors on how not to get burned chasing current yield. Company Ticker YTD Return 12-month dividend/ share 12-month FFO/ share Stock price Price/ FFO Div. yield Dividend Payout Ratio (Dividend/ FFO) DDR Corp. DDR -40.67% $0.76 $1.02 $8.68 8.51 8.76% 0.75 Kimco Realty KIM -27.42% $1.05 $1.31 $17.99 13.73 5.84% 0.80 National Retail Properties NNN -11.67% $2.00 $2.24 $38.13 17.02 5.25% 0.89 Weingarten Realty WRI -14.78% $1.50 $2.33 $29.73 12.76 5.05% 0.64 Realty Income O -1.99% $2.46 $2.91 $55.28 19.00 4.46% 0.85 Regency Centers REG -9.93% $2.03 $2.16 $61.07 28.27 3.32% 0.94 Federal Realty FRT -10.63% $3.88 $5.73 $125.05 21.82 3.10% 0.68 Sources: Morningstar and company filings, Prices and yields as of close on 6/23/2017 The first thing I checked after current yield was whether the yield could be covered by âfunds from operations, or FFO, a REIT cash-flow metric. FFO takes net income and adjusts it for properties sold and depreciation. It turns out, to my surprise, that DDRâs dividend is soaking up 75% of FFO. That means current cash flow is covering the dividend. Read more: Another part of the real estate market is starting to crumble Youâd expect a company with a yield as big as DDRâs to be having trouble covering the dividend with FFO. In that case, the company would have to borrow to cover the dividend, and, if business didnât improve, eventually cut it. Â Thatâs not the case with DDR, although it could be in the future if cash flow declines. Still skeptical, I looked at DDRâs current debt load. The company has more debt than its peers, but at 54% of gross real estate assets, not enough to send up warning flags. The firm is also covering its interest payments and preferred stock dividends comfortably since it generates nearly three times as much as those payments in pre-tax cash flow. Moreover, DDR reduced roughly $1 billion of debt maturities over the next two years to less than $600 million, according to its recent NAREIT presentation, with new debt issuance maturing in 2027. If the firmâs debt structure isnât perfect, its tenant mix looks fine at first glance. DDRâs main tenants are similar to those of its competitors â TJX Companies

That said, DDRâs tenant mix doesnât seem to justify a lower valuation and higher dividend yield than its peers. While getting a handle on its tenant roster, I also learned that DDR had experienced three tenant bankruptcies recently â sporting goods retailers The Sports Authority and Golfsmith, and electronics outlet HHGregg. Still, DDRâs cash flow and 2017 guidance remains high enough to cover its dividend. Finally, after looking harder at the tenant list and listening to the most recent earnings call, I realized that more than 10% of DDRâs revenues come from its holdings in Puerto Rico. DDR has been trying to sell its Puerto Rico properties, given the economic problems of the island, which has declared a form of bankruptcy in an attempt to restructure more than $70 billion in debt. People with means are leaving Puerto Rico for the U.S. mainland in an attempt to flee an economy that has little to spend on basic services. Completing a negative feedback loop, that, in turn, lowers Puerto Ricoâs tax base, making it even less able to fund basic services. One analyst said earlier this year that the firmâs Puerto Rico properties were causing it to grow at a slower clip than its competitors. But if DDR is only growing at 1%, is it still a bargain with its current yield of nearly 9%? It may well be â if the Puerto Rico properties donât deteriorate too much and the firm can maintain its dividend payments. Looking underneath DDRâs impressive dividend yield shows you what challenges the company faces. Understanding those challenges doesnât necessitate avoiding the stock altogether, but it should make you a more intelligent investor. ",Putting retail REITs to the Buffett test - MarketWatch
,07062017,Reuters,06292017,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinaâs top online retailers and U.S. superstore giant Walmart are scrambling to satisfy the voracious appetites of consumers excited about the first American beef to arrive in the worldâs most populous nation in 14 years. âI am a frequent buyer of steak so I can tell the quality by its colour and marbling,â said one woman on Thursday at a Sams Club store in Beijing owned by Walmart. She selected a 211 yuan ($31.13) pack of newly arrived U.S. steak over her usual choice from Australia. âThis looks tasty, worth a try,â she said, declining to be named. Other shoppers at the store said imported beef was superior in quality and worth its hefty price. Beef is the fastest-growing meat sector in China, outstripping stagnant demand for more widely eaten pork, with consumers seeking healthier sources of protein and adopting Western eating habits. Chinaâs beef imports hit $2.6 billion last year, making it the worldâs fastest-growing overseas market for the meat. Consumer excitement about the lifting of a 2003 ban due to a scare over mad cow disease looks set to help U.S. beef grab a significant share of that demand. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue is in Beijing to mark the return of U.S. beef to China, and is expected on Friday to meet his Chinese counterpart, Agriculture Minister Han Changfu, as well as Vice Premier Wang Yang. Some of the millions who buy food online are expected to join the woman in the Sams Club store as some of the first to buy U.S. beef in China in more than a decade. Social media has been buzzing for weeks with those ready to tuck into American steak. âAmerican steak is delicious,â said one user on Chinaâs Twitter-like Weibo service. âIt doesnât have the mutton smell of domestic beef.â Womai.com, owned by food giant COFCO [CNCOF.UL], said it had received more than 1,605 orders for beef from U.S. meat giant Tyson by late Wednesday. JD.com, one of the countryâs biggest online retailers, has started pre-sales of U.S. beef ahead of the productâs availability from mid-July. Online meat is typically around 10 percent cheaper than it is in stores, according to Euromonitor. Imported meat accounted for more than 30 percent of JD.comâs meat sales last year, with Australian beef the top category and the most searched-for item, the company said. Still, food safety fears linger, despite Beijingâs stringent import requirements. One Sams Club shopper, surnamed Huang, was worried about more than beautiful marbling: âWe should not only stick to foreign beef. They have food safety issues, like growth hormones and GMOs (genetically modified organisms) in the U.S.â (This version the story is corrected to show the store was Sams Club, owned by Walmart, not a Walmart supermarket in 2nd, 7th and 13th paras) ","

Michael J. Kramer,07062017,Investopedia,06292017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Target Corp. (TGT) shares have come under considerable pressure in 2017, and if expectations for future growth are any indication, the stock could still have more room to fall. Target shares thus far in 2017 are down nearly 30 percent as competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) are starting to pressure the retailer. Target is another example of a value trap sucking unsuspecting investors in with its ""cheap"" forward P/E ratio of around 12. But as we see time and time again, just because a stock has a low P/E doesn't mean there is value. And Target shares are no different. Target's revenue growth for now âÂ and at least for the foreseeable future âÂ may have peaked based on what analysts are projecting. TGT Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts AnalystsÂ are looking for Target's earnings to decline over the next couple of years as well. TGT Annual Actual EPS data by YCharts With no top-line revenue growth to maintain analysts' current EPS trends, the company will have to operate a very tight ship. Meaning, Target cannot afford to get into a pricing war with Amazon or Wal-Mart. Target's gross margins run at around 30 percent, while Amazon is at 36 percent. Given its growth profile, Amazon has room to sacrificeÂ its margins because it can make up higher costs with faster revenue growth. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, is so huge it can squeeze its suppliers and get every last penny out of them. The difference in revenue among the three companies is astounding. TGT Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts So Target finds itself in an awkward position because it does not have the sheer size of Wal-Mart, and it doesn't have the margins or growth profile of Amazon. This puts Target in a toughÂ spot, because if it does go down the road of raising its expenses to boost sales, it risks hurting its bottom line, thus hurting its stock price. If Target chooses to do nothing, it potentially risks falling even further behind its competition. The one thing Target does have over Wal-Mart and Amazon is net income margin.Â (See also: Target Focusing on Margins, Not Aquisitions.) Fundamental Chart data by YCharts Net Income comes after cost of sales on an income statement, and below gross margins. Target, in theory, if executed correctly, could cut selling, general, and administrative costs just enough to free up some room to make an adjustment, and either market more aggressively or cut prices to battle Amazon or Wal-Mart. In doing this, they could sacrificeÂ gross margins without jeopardizing its bottom line entirely. Obviously, this would be a risky endeavor, but one that might pay off in the long run. The whole situation makes Target a risky bet for the short-to-medium term until it can solve its competition problems, making the stock just as dangerous. Of course, Target could go in an altogether different direction and just sell itself to Wal-Mart, which wouldÂ be a whole lot easier and certainly less risky.

Courtney Reagan,07062017,CNBC,06292017,"2017 has not been kind to retailers, and if one of the Trump administration's budget cuts takes hold, there will be more pain to come. The current Trump administration budget calls for a $191 billion cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program â commonly referred to as food stamps â between 2018 and 2028. The Congressional Budget Office said the average food stamp benefit is $252 per month, the lowest level in five years as several rounds of cuts began in 2013. If the Trump administration's SNAP budget proposal passes, the monthly amount will fall by 31 percent to an average $173 a month. CNBC has exclusive estimates to quantify just which retailers will take the biggest hit if food stamp benefits are cut. Retail consultancy AlixPartners estimated retail collectively stands to lose $70.7 billion over the decade if the proposed cuts take place. ""For about every dollar of benefit reduction or spending, there's about a 37-cent loss in grocery sales,"" said Ted Stenger, managing director at AlixPartners. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the government agency that runs the food stamp program, supermarkets and superstores received 81 percent of the SNAP benefits in 2016, even though that subsector only represents 14 percent of the total companies authorized to accept food stamps. But that means the group is poised to be the hardest hit. AlixPartners estimated the size of the impact would be about $57.5 billion at supermarkets and superstores over the next 10 years if the budget item passes as proposed. No one retailer redeems more food stamp benefits than Wal-Mart. The discount retailer makes up the largest share of superstore redemptions. In 2013, Wal-Mart disclosed it gets an estimated 18 percent, but it hasn't given any updated figures. Using that information as a part of its equation, the retail consultancy estimates Walmart would take a $12.7 billion hit to U.S. sales over the next decade. Target sees the second-largest food stamp redemption in the superstore and supercenter category, with an estimated $4.8 billion to $5.3 billion sales drag. ""Target is committed to supporting the communities we serve by accepting SNAP benefits that provide nutritional assistance to those in need. We are watching the budget process and proposals around SNAP funding, knowing it could have an effect on our guests and their families,"" Target said in a statement. ""Overall, we anticipate the impact of this proposal on Target's business to be small and significantly lower than industry reports. We'll continue to monitor the budget process closely moving forward."" Low-priced grocery store chain Aldi would see the third-largest impact, estimated to fall between $4.4 billion and $4.9 billion. Kroger comes in fourth, with an estimated $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion sales hit from proposed SNAP reductions. Stenger said the economic demographics in the areas around retail stores that accept SNAP factor into the estimates, along with the stores that actually accept the food stamp payment cards (commonly referred to as EBT or electronic benefit transfer). About half of Kroger's stores are not enrolled in the program. ""That's probably because those stores have a very low content of customers who are using the card,"" Stenger said. In response to the AlixPartners estimates, Kroger spokeswoman Kristal Howard said, ""The SNAP program was never intended to fully replace families' grocery bills, but to supplement it. SNAP and WIC [the Special Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants, and Children] customers in our stores spend some of their own cash on food. When program spending has been reduced in the past, customers shift to spending more of their cash on food and less cash on other things. We look forward to the legislative process."" Kmart has been facing years of hardships when it comes to sales and traffic, as more than 150 of its stores have closed or are closing this year. The proposed food stamp benefit cuts could mean a sales loss of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, according to AlixPartners. But the potential reduction in the government's SNAP program will likely have ripple effects beyond those retailers that sell food and drinks, it's just harder to pinpoint and quantify. ""If you look at food spending as a whole, it's not discretionary, it's necessary. So, you reallocate budget dollars to spend on food if you have to,"" explains Diana Sheehan, Kantar Retail grocery analyst and director of retail insights. The SNAP program benefits swelled during the Great Recession as the economy faltered and the unemployment rate surged. The Obama administration began instituting cuts to the program once the economy was in recovery, which began in 2013. But Sheehan pointed out that for the last several years the reduction in benefits has been coupled with deflationary trends in food prices and lower gas prices. ""So while those receiving the food stamp benefits were getting less, food costs and gas prices to get to the store were lower too,"" she said. But some expect both those trends could be abating, which could mean the proposed deeper cuts will be more painful to those consumers, Sheehan said. Doug Hermanson, senior economist at Kantar Retail, said its ShopperScape index showed these consumers ""tend to cut back on small indulgences like eating at restaurants, followed by using more coupons, and buying more private label products."" The impact takes some time for retailers to manage through, he said. ""We do see households cut back on everyday expenses when they face these challenges, especially in the short term. It takes a couple quarters for all of these behaviors to have impacts on retailers."" Hermanson also noted there can be some benefits too as shoppers switch from one retailer to another to find bigger discounts. ""In some cases, these shoppers trade into a Walmart or discounter by shopping a supermarket less,"" he said. In perspective, when amortizing the estimated sales impact over 10 years, based on the retailers' most recent full-year sales, the sales impact looks less intense. For example, the estimated $12.7 billion sales impact to Wal-Mart is over 10 years. Wal-Mart's most recent full-year sales hit $485.9 billion, so $12.7 billion over 10 years is $1.27 billion a year, or 0.26 percent of sales, based on its most recent fiscal year. Kmart would see the largest percentage hit based on its most recent full-year sales report;665trqgwzy+ the high-end of the impact range could represent 2.5 percent of annual sales. Wal-Mart, Target, Kmart and Aldi have declined to comment on the AlixPartners estimates. ",Retailers that take the hardest hit if food stamp benefits are cut
Lora Kolodny,07062017,CNBC,06292017,"People buy a bigger share of their groceries online each year, which seems to bode well for meal-kit makers. However, Slice Intelligence analyst Ken Cassar expects at least half of meal-kit companies to die off following Blue Apron's market debut on Thursday, and the acquisition of Whole Foods by Amazon, which is expected to close later this year. ""There's going to be a lot of competition to win customers, and a lot of spending on advertising and marketing here,"" Cassar said. ""The companies that aren't already established will have to entice folks who have tried competing services and decided meal-kits are not for them. At least half of them aren't going to make it."" Dozens of meal-kit companies are still operating in the U.S., and many have raised venture funding to support their growth, such as Plated, Hello Fresh, Green Chef, Sun Basket, Chef'd, which is backed by Campbell Soup, and Purple Carrot, which has partnered with NFL star Tom Brady to develop recipes. Those who have a chance at survival, Cassar said, should be thinking about partnering with major brick-and-mortar groceries such as Kroger, which might stock their kits, and help them reduce costs by making pickups a possibility and alternative to delivery. ""My bet is the winning model right now for food-commerce companies is more defined by Walmart than Amazon,"" Cassar said. ""This is where you buy online and pick up at the store, especially where there is a convenient option for pickup, and where you do not have to get out of your car."" CircleUp COO and food investor Rory Eakin agreed that meal-kit brands should be willing to strike up partnerships that will increase their reach. He also said remaining meal-kit companies have to develop a specialty to survive. One company he's invested in, Good Eggs, delivers meal kits made from food produced locally (it got its start delivering groceries). Others, such as Green Chef and Sun Basket, make meals of organic ingredients and offer recipes for people following a gluten-free, vegetarian, or paleo diet. Eakin also said food e-commerce companies need to become data-obsessed. ""Amazon makes data available to brands on its platforms about their customers' purchase behavior, core demographic and more,"" he said. ""Brick-and-mortar groceries don't do that. You only know if a product is doing well when they re-order it. Leveraging data will help startups keep vendors around, connect with new customers, master pricing, and just generally get to scale.""

Karen Gilchrist,07062017,CNBC,06292017,"Japan and the European Union have formally agreed an outline free trade deal which will ease the movement of goods between two of the world's largest economies. The pact, though still requiring some further negotiation, is scheduled to come into effect in early-2019 and will guarantee tariff-free trade between businesses within the two regions. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels, Belgium, Thursday to sign the deal. It is expected that the deal will liberalize 99 percent of trade between Japan and the EU, benefiting Japan's autos industry and the EU's farming sector in particular, according to BBC reports. It will also see the regions co-operate on other issues, including climate change and terrorism. Plans for a deal had been underway for four years but were stalled by varied demands from either side. However, talks gained a new urgency amid growing protectionist policies to emerge from the U.S. and Thursday's agreement will send a clear message to other global leaders ahead of this weekend's G20 summit. The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday urged leaders of the Group of 20 major economies to avoid ""myopic"" nationalistic policies and to work together in agreed forums to resolve their trade and economic differences. ""We did it,"" Tusk announced following the signing Thursday morning. ""We concluded EU-Japan political and trade talks. EU is more and more engaged globally.""

Matt Maley,07062017,CNBC,06292017,"If you want to know where the broad market is going, you have to keep an eye on tech stocks. Wednesday should be relatively quiet, given the timing of the Fourth of July this year. For that matter, we might see rather muted activity this whole week. But investors should continue to focus on the action in tech stocks. The XLK ETF, which tracks the S&P 500 tech sector, underperformed yet again on Monday's short session. It has broken and remained below its 50-day moving average, which acted as a supportive trend line from November. And the ETF made a key ""lower low"" on Monday, meaning that it slipped below its prior intraday low. This is the first ""lower high""/""lower low"" sequence we've seen since November. Unless this group can see an immediate and strong bounce, the action is going to be a big yellow flag for the broader market as we move through the rest of the summer. Tech has obviously been an important leadership group this year, so if it continues to decline, we believe it's going to be negative for the broader market as well â eventually. That said, we do have to admit that the S&P 500 is holding up very well so far. Despite the 5.4 percent decline in the XLK, the SPX remains only 1 percent below its all-time highs. It is also holding above its own 50-day moving average. The S&P did break below that indicator (which, as a reminder, is simply an average of the 50 most recent closes) a couple of times in April and once in May. However, those ""breaks"" were very slight ones. So while we could see another break below the moving average, I'm going to have to see a substantial one before I become concerned about this broader index. Finally, it's worth mentioning that the 50-day moving average has been key support for the Nasdaq composite in recent months as well, and the index did break below that line on Monday. It is only a very slight break so far, but given how the larger-cap Nasdaq 100 Index has already broken its own 50-day average in a significant manner, it raises some concerns.

Lauren Thomas,07062017,CNBC,06292017,"Retail stocks are only going to get uglier, former department store executive Jan Kniffen said Monday. ""I said last year the fourth quarter is going to be the toughest quarter for retailing,"" the CEO of consulting firm J. Rogers Kniffen Worldwide Enterprises told CNBC. ""It's not better this year."" The S&P consumer discretionary sector has fallen about 2.6 percent from one month ago versus the S&P 500's loss of less than half a percent. Kniffen said on ""Squawk on The Street"" that many stores will post bad traffic and same-store sales comparisons this year. Even Black Friday won't be enough to save many struggling companies, he said. All of this is being driven by ""things going online,"" Kniffen added. Kniffen said he expects many more bankruptcies, including Sears as early as next month, and said more strategic mergers are likely. In response, Sears said in a statement: ""We remain committed to and have taken steps to reduce costs and continue to execute against our transformation."" The statement also said the company is making progress to improve operational performance and to enhance liquidity and financial flexibility. With the Amazon-Whole Foods deal in the works, retailers are preparing for a ""huge battle,"" Kniffen said. ""We're going to see online and brick and mortar merge into one big entity."" ""It's not like Whole Foods was a great business, and yet it still got bought by Amazon,"" he added. The next big disruption in retail may be pharmaceuticals, he said. Just last week, Walgreens announced plans to buy more than 2,000 Rite Aid locations. It remains to be seen how Amazon might respond, if at all, he said. ""Wouldn't you go to Amazon to let them full your drugs?"" Kniffen asked. ""[There's] no reason that can't be done online."" Amazon did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.

David Spiegel,07062017,CNBC,06292017," The CNBC IQ 100 Index gained 9.13 percent in the first half of 2017, outpacing the S&P 500's 8.24 percent gain. As part of its rules-based methodology, the index has been re-weighted for the third quarter. 3M and Oracle are now the two highest-weighted companies in the index. Microsoft lost its spot as the top-weighted company and is now tied for fifth-highest weight with C R Bard and International Paper. MCAM International, the firm whose proprietary algorithms power the CNBC IQ 100, executed the re-weighting for CNBC. ""What you have in Oracle is a focus on cloud accessibility, interoperability, and more importantly, security,"" MCAM founder David Martin said on CNBC's Squawk Alley Monday. ""The more we hear about cybersecurity, the more we hear about those internal issues around how people are managing and interacting with data, the more Oracle is going to be in a very compelling position going forward."" Oracle shares gained more than 30 percent in the first half of the year. On Wednesday, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital suggested the stock had more room to run. 3M's weighting may have been helped by a recent FDA decision to allow expanded usage of its Tegaderm wound care brand. According to MCAM, this is an example of how a company can deploy its intellectual property to open up new market opportunities. The companies in the CNBC IQ 100 Index are weighted according to each one's ability to invest in, develop, control and deploy intellectual property to achieve strategic advantage over competitors. Companies with the highest weighting maintain this type of advantage across multiple industries. 3M is considered one of the most diverse companies in the index, with strong competitive advantages in chemicals, materials, electronics, medical, and consumer products, according to MCAM. With the re-weighting, Boeing moves from fourth place to third, while chipmaker Micron Technology slipped from second to fourth. JPMorgan Chase and Dow Chemical are now out of the top five. The CNBC IQ 100 Index is re-weighted quarterly, and components are rebalanced annually. CR Bard was the biggest second-quarter gainer among the 100 stocks in the index. Shares of the medical device maker jumped 27 percent in the second quarter, with most of the gain coming on news that broke in April that it will be acquired by Becton Dickinson, also an IQ 100 component. Oilfield services company Nabors Industries was the IQ 100's biggest loser in the second quarter, tumbling more than 37 percent. Boston Scientific is added to the CNBC IQ 100, an index weighted according to a company'sÂ  intellectual property, which gives it a strategic advantage over competitors.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.Â (NYSE:WMT) andÂ Amazon.com, Inc.Â (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been on a collision course for years, but this month offered the best confirmation yet that both companies were targeting the other's market. Amazon shocked the business community with its $13.7 billion acquisition ofÂ Whole Foods Market, Inc.Â (NASDAQ:WFM) weeks ago. It's the clearest sign yet that the e-commerce giant has made groceries its biggest priority, setting it up for a direct clash with Wal-Mart, the nation's largest grocery seller. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is specifically directing those suppliers to not run any applications for Wal-Mart on AWS. Scott Webb, president of Avionos, a digital consulting firm, said that Wal-Mart rationalizes the move as a legitimate concern for privacy since it doesn't want Amazon to have access data. But the decision also serves to take away business from Amazon, the market leader in cloud computing, and prop up No. 2 playerÂ MicrosoftÂ (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has its own cloud service, Azure. Azure is the preferred choice for Wal-Mart and is what it wants its tech suppliers to use. There's a reason beyond privacy that Wal-Mart would seek to take business away from AWS. Amazon derives the vast majority of its profits from its cloud-computing division despite the fact that it contributes far less in revenue than its retail operations. In its first quarter, AWS made up 89% of total operating income, and at $890 million, profits nearly 50% higher than its North American e-commerce operating profit -- International e-commerce still operates at a loss. That means that the best way for Wal-Mart to slow down Amazon and damage its ability to do things like buy Whole Foods may be to put a dent in AWS. Amazon denies that AWS supports its retail business, but the cloud-computing division's growth has driven the stock to more than triple since 2014, and Amazon is AWS's biggest customer. The two divisions are inextricably linked. It's hard to see the breakeven Amazon of old being able to justify an acquisition the size of Whole Foods. With billions of annual profits now thanks to AWS, the deal got cheers from investors. This is far from the first time Wal-Mart has leaned on its suppliers. Webb noted that Wal-Mart was elemental in pushing its suppliers to adopt technologies like inventory management systems in the 1990's. The retailer is also known to push suppliers to lower prices by cutting back on marketing, changing its packaging, or making other changes in line with Wal-Mart's goals. As the world's biggest retailer, it has a lot of sway as a customer. Webb thinks the only chance Wal-Mart has to slow down Amazon's growth is if other retailers follow suit. But even so, knocking AWS off its pedestal won't be easy. It has 44% share of the infrastructure cloud market and is growing fast with 43% growth in its most recent quarter. He also thinks Wal-Mart could soon cut a deal with Microsoft orÂ AlphabetÂ to host its cloud service as it mostly uses its own services right now. Whatever the outcome, Amazon's cloud service is likely to serve as a source of growing competitive advantage as its on track for around $4 billion in operating profit this year. It's a smart strategic move by Wal-Mart to try to slow it down, but it's unlikely to be enough. ","
      
    Wal-Mart Aims to Hit Amazon Where It Hurts -- The Motley Fool

  "
Adam Levy,07062017,Fool,06292017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a problem: Too many companies are trying to sell products on its marketplace. Amazon counts over 2 million different sellers on its marketplace, many of which use its Fulfillment by Amazon service to qualify their items for Prime's two-day shipping. Over 50 million items are now eligible for free shipping on the program. That makes it tough for merchants to stand out. Some have ponied up for advertising on Amazon's website, which has gained a lot of traction with smaller brands over the past year or so. But some have decided to split their inventory between Amazon and rival Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Image source: Wal-Mart. Walmart.com's product selection has improved tremendously over the last year. In the first quarter of 2016, Wal-Mart had just 10 million items on its website. With its latest quarterly update, management said it has 50 million items for sale through its online marketplace. The greater selection has been a huge boon for Wal-Mart's online sales, which were waning at the beginning of last year, with year-over-year sales growth sinking into the single digits. Last quarter, however, online sales increased a whopping 63%. While e-commerce acquisitions like Jet.com and Modcloth helped, management says the majority of growth came from Walmart.com. Nearly all of that growth can be attributed to relatively small third-party sellers instead of Wal-Mart bringing in new wholesale vendors. Wal-Mart offers better financial terms for its third-party merchants than Amazon, which is somewhat ironic considering the retailer's reputation for being a tough negotiator with its suppliers. But considering it's still playing catch-up with Amazon online, it makes sense to be aggressive in courting third-party merchants. If you do a search for Nike (NYSE:NKE) shoes on Walmart.com, all you'll find is a list of third-party merchants selling shoes at marked-up prices. Nike just signed a deal with Amazon to fix those kinds of problems, so it can exercise more control over its brand and gain access to Amazon's massive customer base. Despite Wal-Mart's size, Nike has neglected to sign a deal to distribute through Wal-Mart due to its low-value brand perception. That's a challenge that will be tough for Wal-Mart to overcome. To that end, however, it's buying up high-end e-commerce brands like Bonobos and Moosejaw. Jet.com has also managed to attract some high-end brands. But without big brands like Nike, Wal-Mart is missing out on a huge percentage of sales. What's more, customers unable to find the products they really want may abandon shopping on the website altogether. And the next stop for most of them (if they haven't checked already) is usually Amazon.com. For Amazon, having so many merchants that it's hard to stand out in its marketplace is a high-quality problem. It's already benefiting in the form of increased advertising spending from its merchants. Amazon's other revenue, which is mostly driven by ad sales, increased 56% year over year last quarter. Additionally, Amazon has the leverage to ask for a larger share of revenue from merchants as demand for its Fulfillment by Amazon program continues to grow. Third-party seller services revenue increased 36% year over year last quarter. So, while sellers are offering their products on Walmart.com, they're not abandoning Amazon, either. And with Amazon's 300 million active shoppers and tens of millions of Prime members, they'd be foolish to do so. Meanwhile, Amazon can barely build out fulfillment centers fast enough to accommodate the influx of inventory from all of its merchants. The company built 23 fulfillment centers in the second half of last year alone. The increase in capital spending is weighing on earnings in the short term, but ought to pay off in the long run as third-party merchants continue to send products to Amazon. Wal-Mart may be winning merchants over from Amazon's marketplace, but Amazon is still in the driver's seat as far as online retail and merchant services go. ","
      
    Wal-Mart Is Winning Over Amazon's Merchants -- The Motley Fool

Jeremy Bowman,07062017,Fool,06292017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon.com, Inc.'sÂ (NASDAQ:AMZN) $13.7 billion acquisition ofÂ Whole Foods Market, Inc.Â (NASDAQ:WFM)Â weeks ago set off alarm bells across the supermarket industry. Grocery stocks plummeted on the news, withÂ KrogerÂ (NYSE:KR),Â Supervalu,Â Sprouts Farmers Market,Â Wal-MartÂ (NYSE:WMT),Â Costco, andÂ Target falling by at least 5%, with some down well into the double-digits. Image source: Kroger. The blockbuster deal made clear Amazon's long-held ambitions in the grocery industry, and with Whole Foods' 444 domestic stores soon to be under its umbrella, the greatest disruptor of the 21st century is ready to take aim at the $800 American food retail industry. Kroger shares took the news hard, with the stock falling as much as 17% after the announcement. The nation's largest traditional grocer could be the biggest potential loser in the deal since 60% of Whole Foods stores are located within 10 miles of a Kroger location, and Kroger is already struggling after two straight quarters of comparable sales declines following a 52-quarter streak of comparable sales growth. While it would seem natural for Kroger to be wary of theÂ Amazon-Whole Foods combination, at least one company executive isn't bothered by it. At the Oppenheimer Consumer Conference last week, CFO Mike Schlotman said, ""I actually fell great about it,"" when discussing Kroger's competitive position amid the Amazon-Whole Foods deal. ""Something we're doing continues to resonate with the customer,"" he said, noting that Kroger has been gaining market share, despite falling comparable sales as food deflation has weighed on comp sales across the industry. Schlotman seems to think that the threat of delivery and Amazon along with it is overblown, saying, ""Part of me refuses to believe that everybody is just going to sit at home and everything is going to be brought to their doorstep and nobody is ever going to leave home to do anything again."" Schlotman is right, of course, about grocery delivery. Everybody isn't going to sit at home and never leave the house again, but e-commerce overall is growing by about 15% annually, and it looks set to continue at that pace, especially as Amazon pushes into new frontiers like groceries. Even Wal-Mart has gotten on board with its Jet.com acquisition and the rapid expansion of its grocery pick-up program. In its most recent quarter, domestic online sales surged 63%. What Schlotman seems to be missing, though, is that grocery is a low-margin industry, and losing even 2% of its sales to the e-commerce channel is enough to damage its bottom line. Kroger stock also plummeted when it reported earnings the day before the Amazon news broke, as investors punished it for lowering full-year earnings guidance, a sign that the company is already facing steep competition. It's a mistake to underestimate a juggernaut like Amazon. CEO Jeff Bezos famously once said, ""Your margin is my opportunity,"" and the company has a way of pressuring industry margins wherever it goes, whether it be book publishing, shipping, or video streaming. Unlike traditional grocers, Amazon doesn't need to make a profit selling produce and dairy. It just wants more customers and more sales as it aspires to build a monopoly-like power by becoming a one-stop shop for everything online, and now in the real world, too. In 2010, Time WarnerÂ CEO Jeff Bewkes famously dismissed NetflixÂ as the ""Albanian army."" Today, the video streamer's market cap is nearly as high as Time Warner's, which owns HBO, Cinemax, the Turner group of cable networks, and Warner Bros. Studios. Amazon's entry into groceries may not turn the industry upside-down, as some anticipate, but it will almost certainly affect competitors like Kroger. At the very least, I'd expect Whole Foods to lower prices significantly. Kroger isn't standing still. The company's acquisition of Vitacost.com in 2014 gave it a valuable e-commerce platform, and it's been rapidly expanding its Clicklist grocery pickup program. It also partners with Instacart to make delivery available from some stores. Still, at a time when the stock is at a two-year low and comparable sales and profits are falling, hubris is a bad look. Kroger has a lot of work to do recoup the stock's losses over the last month. Blowing off the threat from Amazon isn't going to help. ","
      
    Kroger CFO ""Feels Great"" About Amazon-Whole Foods Combination, but Should He? -- The Motley Fool

Rich Duprey,07062017,Fool,06292017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In a stock market that seemingly hits new highs daily, finding stocks that offer a good value becomes increasingly difficult. Still, you can't base an investment decision on stock price alone, as oftentimes, a cheap stock is cheap for a reason. Yet combining a good business and a good valuation means investors can have a winning combination on their hands. Here, we'll pluck outÂ Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS), and Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS)Â from the universe of stocks as being representative of stocks that are ridiculously cheap. Image source: Best Buy. While the concept of showrooming -- visiting a local store to see and test a product before buying it online -- almost doomed Best Buy, it turned that liability into a competitive advantage by investing heavily in its own digital efforts. Today, online sales are among its strongest attributes, with comparable online sales surging 22.5% in the first quarter, not much different from the 23.5% gain it registered a year ago. Coupled with hewing away $1.35 billion in costs over the past few years as part of its Renew Blue InitiativeÂ that created a firmer, more stable financial position, no one talks about Best Buy as being the next Circuit City or Radio Shack implosion. Indeed, in areas such as appliances, it is expected to soon surpass Sears Holdings (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ) as the third biggest major appliance retailer. Image source: Getty Images. Audio-chip specialist Cirrus Logic has had a similarly strong run-up over the past year, with its shares gaining 63% in the past 12 months but also pulling back from recent highs. While that was partially the result of investor worry about just how much Cirrus still generates from sales of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones, the decline from 85% to 78% indicates it will undoubtedly start getting more money from Samsung and its Galaxy S8. But with Cirrus anticipating its technology to start trickling down to mid-tier phones as well, the chipmaker could see a profusion of sales in its future. Sure, having the best-selling, top-of-the-line smartphone makers as your prime moneymakers is good, but tastes can sometimes be fickle and one or the other will fall out of favor. A broad swath of the buying public owns these other feature-rich, lower price phones, and tapping into that market can be a huge benefit. Moreover, not only is Cirrus introducing its chipsets to new clients in smartphones, but it's also looking to apply them to completely different markets, such as smart-home systems and infotainment platforms in cars. Cirrus Logic also has a very discounted valuation considering the gains its stock has already made, as well as those sure to come. Like Best Buy, it stock trades at a discount across measures such as its market multiple, earnings estimates and their growth, and its free cash flow. Image source: Getty Images. Like the other stocks discussed here, Dick's Sporting Goods stock is also deeply depressed on valuation, but it also hasn't had the same kind of performance as the other two, and that makes it the riskiest of the three. Its shares have fallen 7% in the past year, but they've lost almost 40% of their value from recent highs. That's because investors remain concerned about the bricks-and-mortar retail space. Amazon.comÂ has, of course, upended much of the landscape, but Wal-Mart and other mass-merchandise retailers have made significant headway in the sporting-goods space, too. Add in bankruptcies from Gander Mountain and Sports Authority, as well as the retail woes atÂ Cabela'sÂ and its pending buyout by Bass Pro Shops, and you have a lot of uncertainty circling the leading industry player. Yet that's the very key to the company's future. While other lesser retailers may be stumbling, Dick's Sporting Goods remains on firm financial footing. Much as Best Buy became the last man standing in consumer electronics following the demise of its rivals, and ultimately ended up better for it, Dick's Sporting Goods could fare equally well, though it may have to go through some pain in the meantime. Still, analysts are expecting it to grow earnings at 12% annually for the next five years, and it trades at a bargain-basement price of just 11 times its free cash flow. Dick's isn't immune to the vortex swirling around retail, but it's not in danger of being sucked into it, either. Rich has been a Fool since 1998 and writing for the site since 2004.

    These 3 Stocks Are Ridiculously Cheap -- The Motley Fool

  "
Matthew Cochrane,07062017,Fool,06292017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In the past year, PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) has completed a number of deals and agreements with other financial institutions and fintech companies. PayPal's management team believes these partnerships best position the company going forward in a fiercely competitive industry. In any industry, of course, competition is inevitable, but it is especially noteworthy when the world's largest publicly traded company, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), formally announces it is planning to launch a platform that will compete with one of your company's core services. This is exactly the position PayPal found itself in recently when Apple announced at its WWDC 2017 developer conference that it would be integrating a peer-to-peer (P2P) payment option into Messages when iOS 11 is released. This is simply the latest P2P participant in an already crowded field. In recent months Alphabet announced mobile Android users could now send money to others via Gmail while large banks jointly launched a new P2P platform called Zelle. With all of the deep-pocketed new competition, who could blame PayPal for worrying about competition for its core platform or Venmo, the popular P2P app with millennials? On the surface, however, PayPal does not appear to be fazed by the new entries in the space. Venmo's P2P payment platform is extremely popular with millennials. Image source: PayPal Holdings Inc. We own the full value proposition, Apple can never do that because they don't do the risk associated with it, they don't do the onboarding, they can only provide what they hope is a good user interface. We try to provide that end to end value proposition and very importantly we do it across operating systems. Shulman's comments are telling because they directly address the weaknesses of several of the competing payment platforms. However, the main weakness, as I see it, is that Apple's P2P platform cannot work with people who reside outside the Apple ecosystem. One of the unique features about PayPal is that account holders can use its services across devices, operating systems, retailers, or banks. This not only gives it a leg up on competition in the P2P space from Apple and Zelle, but other competitors' payment platforms like Samsung's Samsung Pay, Alphabet's Android Pay, Amazon.com's Pay with Amazon, and Wal-Mart's Walmart Pay as well. In the P2P payment space, this directly affects how useful the service is. For instance, if a dinner party wants to split a restaurant bill, every person paying would have to have an iPhone to use Apple's service. With Zelle, everyone would need to be a member of a participating bank or credit union. Not so with PayPal. In other words, PayPal is completely agnostic about what phone its account holders use or where they bank and shop; a claim few of its rivals can make. Venmo has experienced explosive growth over the past two years. In its most recently reported quarter, Venmo processed $6.8 billion in total payment volume, an approximate 114% increase year-over-year. This growth shows that there is a huge market for this type of service; a market that undoubtedly has room for more than one player. Indeed, the more consumers become accustomed to these types of payments, the more they might stop using cash or checks in such situations. After all, a rising tide lifts all ships. Josh Criscoe, Venmo's head of corporate affairs and communications, echoed a similar sentiment when he recently made the following statement on the launch of Zelle: We don't see it as a winner-take-all scenario. We welcome any effort to move folks to more digital payments and move toward the smartphone as the central point of financial life. The common enemy is cash. Apple's new P2P service could drive user engagement for Apple Pay. Image source: Apple Inc. Apple's new P2P platform and Zelle will almost assuredly accomplish one of their primary goals: Increase customer engagement with their existing products. For iPhone owners, this means incorporating the use of the smartphone into yet another aspect of their lives. From Apple's perspective, I am sure the company is also hoping the move will give a shot in the arm to Apple Pay, a service still struggling to gain real traction with customers. For the banks behind Zelle, this means getting account holders to engage with financial services and products through their own bank accounts first and not wander off looking for greener pastures via others' services. PayPal has good reason for the confidence it shows in its core platform and Venmo. Both have what I believe amounts to a sustainable moat from newcomers in the payments space because of PayPal's agnostic platform, making it accessible to all potential customers in this space. It also has a nice head start in the space with more than 200 million (and growing) active accounts, creating a nice network effect. For PayPal shareholders, there seems to be little reason to worry that the competition is about to steal the company's thunder. ","

Jeremy Bowman,07062017,Fool,06292017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There's never been a company likeÂ Amazon.com, Inc.Â (NASDAQ:AMZN) before. It has already become the second-biggest American retailer, with $136 billion in revenue last year. With a growth rate above 20%, that figure is likely to top $160 billion and shows no signs of slowing down, especially with its recent acquisition ofÂ Whole Foods Market, Inc., which will add $15 billion in revenue to Amazon's total and give it a platform of more than 400 stores with which to break into groceries. Investors clearly recognize Amazon's market power. Even with slim profits, it's become one of the most valuable companies in the world. But the $136 billion in revenue does not adequately measure its impact on the global retail market. Instead, investors would be better off considering its gross merchandise volume, or the dollar value of all the items sold through Amazon, which include third-party sales on its website. Image source: Amazon. Amazon does not provide its total gross merchandise volume, but it does share the fees it collects from third-party sellers. In 2016, revenue from that group, which includes commissions, fulfillment and shipping fees, and other seller services, was $23 billion, nearly double its 2014 total at $11.7 billion. The marketplace, or the part of Amazon's website that's open to third-party retailers, has become one of the biggest reasons for the company's success. It's helped increase the breadth and depth of selection on Amazon, which reinforces its status as the first place online shoppers go when they need something. As the growth rate of third-party revenue can attest, Amazon has by far the biggest marketplace, which acts as a competitive advantage. Sellers want to be where customers are and vice versa. As e-commerce continues to take share from physical retail, the importance of third-party sellers will grow. Not only does the marketplace add to Amazon's competitive advantage, increase sales, and make it more attractive to customers, it's also more profitable. Amazon's commissions vary, but the company generally takes referral fees ranging from 8-20% of third-party sales depending on the category of goods being sold.Â As a result, third-party retail has become a high-margin business. Since it already has the infrastructure in place for e-commerce, the operating costs associated with each sale and the commission it generates are low. According to estimates, sales generated from Amazon's Marketplace are now about double Amazon's direct sales, meaning the company's gross merchandise volume from e-commerce is set to top $300 billion this year. The success of the marketplace was also elemental in bringing NikeÂ to the table, which agreed to sell on Amazon for the first time ever this month in order to block third-party sellers, which were selling thousands of Nike products. The marketplace has also allowed Amazon to branch into new businesses like Home Services, providing things like cleaning, moving, and furniture assembly. Amazon doesn't report marketplace profits, but the third-party channel has been key in driving North American e-commerce profits higher recently. Operating income in Amazon's home market has gone from $360 million in 2014 to $2.36 billion last year. With Amazon set to control $300 billion in global retail sales this year, the company's influence on the greater retail industry is much larger than its revenue figure represents. Its buying power will soon rival that of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., long known for using its economies of scale to squeeze supplier margins so it can offer its customers the lowest prices. Vendors will have to play ball with Amazon the same way, which will give the e-commerce giant even more market power. With sales still growing by more than 20% and the company about to dive into groceries, Amazon is only going to get that much stronger. ","

Dan Caplinger,07062017,Fool,06292017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Investors gravitate to technology stocks because of their exposure to the fast-paced innovative tech sector. Some of the best-known and best-performing stocks of all time have come from the technology industry, and many investors still believe that there's plenty of potential for even bigger gains going forward. Funds with good track records have attracted considerable assets, and that's why the following five technology mutual funds stand out among the elite of the industry. Technology Mutual Fund Assets Under Management Expense Ratio Columbia Seligman Communications & Information (NASDAQMUTFUND:SLMCX) $5.4 billion 1.35% T. Rowe Price Global Technology (NASDAQMUTFUND:PRGTX) $4.9 billion 0.77% Vanguard Information Technology (NASDAQMUTFUND:VITAX) $14.0 billion 0.10% Fidelity Select Technology (NASDAQMUTFUND:FSPTX) $5.5 billion 0.76% T. Rowe Price Science & Technology (NASDAQMUTFUND:PASTX) $4.7 billion 1.06% Data source: Fund providers. If you want exposure to the top technology stocks, then both the Vanguard and Fidelity technology mutual funds deliver. In both funds, you'll find the stalwarts of the industry among the top 10 holdings, and they make up a relatively large portion of the overall assets of the fund. For instance, more than 40% of the Vanguard fund's assets are tied up in five stocks, and two of those holdings are different share classes issued by the same company. You'll find some companies in adjacent sectors with technology leanings, but for the most part, the Vanguard fund's holdings are squarely within technology. Moreover, with expenses of just 0.10%, the price is right for this index mutual fund. The Fidelity fund goes a bit further afield, including some companies that aren't strictly tech stocks but that have cutting-edge applications in areas like electric vehicles. You'll pay up for management with this fund, but a greater exposure to companies with a global scope might be worth the extra cost for some tech investors. Image source: Getty Images. Two funds from T. Rowe Price make the list, and they have different ways to attack the tech sector. The Science and Technology Fund looks a lot like the Fidelity and Vanguard funds above, with many names from the top ranks of the tech sector. Yet the weightings are much different, with a greater emphasis toward the more innovative companies in the social networking, cloud computing, and internet services industries. You'll also find a greater exposure to high-technology healthcare names, especially those producing cutting-edge medical devices that have had dramatic impacts on the quality and sustainability of healthcare with certain applications. Even with this fund, an international exposure to the sector adds some diversification. The Global Technology Fund goes a step further, casting its net across the globe in search of the best companies with high-technology aspirations. From pure cloud computing and internet services companies to consumer and industrial stocks with the know-how to bring transformative change to their respective industries, the Global fund makes a slightly different play on where tomorrow's leadership in technology will come. Finally, the Columbia Seligman fund looks a lot different from its peers. Big tech stocks play a much less important role in this fund, with outsized bets on smaller stocks providing some differentiation from the crowd. That has earned the fund a five-star rating from Morningstar, and long-term performance has also been relatively impressive. The downside of the fund is that it charges a sales load of up to 5.75%, and expenses of 1.35% per year for the Class A shares of the fund are quite high. That means that money will come out of your pocket when you first buy shares and never get invested into the fund at all, instead going directly to your financial professional. These top technology mutual funds have attracted considerable amounts of assets, and they each take different tacks toward capturing returns from technology stocks. By looking more closely at these five stocks, you'll be able to pick the one that best fits your own particular investing strategy. ","

Peter Morici,07062017,MarketWatch,06292017,"Published: July 5, 2017 6:07 a.m. ET Technology is creating new opportunities, but government stands in the way By As the economic recovery completes its eighth year, economists expect gross domestic product growth to accelerate to about 2.3%, but jobs creation is actually slowing. The economy added 250,000 and 226,000 jobs a month in 2014 and 2015, but only 187,000 in 2016 and 168,000 so far this year. Either the economy is slowing down â and 2017 growth comes in below the 2.1% scored over the first eight years of the recovery â or productivity growth, so far lackluster in this decade, is picking up. New technologies are reducing the demand for workers but government policies are not adequately facilitating the deployment of displaced workers to new and better purposes.

The tractor replaced the farmer plowing 40 acres with one who could manage 400 acres, and farmers displaced went to the cities to work in factories and stores. We have been enhancing the productivity of clerical workers with machines since the typewriter, but now computers and apps have extended this trend into the professional ranks. Machines that can think â analyze big data to read shopper preferences to aid fashion designers and programs like Watson that reduce the time doctors need to make tough diagnoses and design treatments â make the transition of workers to new occupations more daunting. We face two critical issues todayâthe economy is not growing at the pace it did during prior waves of automation. And more and more of the jobs created require complex technical skillsâthe kind we associated with very skilled trades in the past and sophisticated technicians nowadaysâor the executive and critical thinking skills associated with a college education. High business taxes, health-care costs, and cumbersome regulation are constraining investment, but trade agreements that permit other nations to boost exports into U.S. markets without accepting comparable amounts of American-made goods and services drag on aggregate demand too. Overall the $500 billion dollar trade deficitâincluding multiplier effectsâkills as many as 6 million jobs. However, even if the Trump administration were able to fix trade with China, Mexico and others, more than 6 million jobs are already unfilled in significant measure because of a disconnect between the skills needed by employers and those possessed by job seekers. The presidentâs initiative to improve apprenticeship programs through public-private partnerships is critical, but it will be years before we have the kind of sophisticated training network available to employers in Germany and elsewhere in northern Europe. More troubling, the big push during the Obama years to raise high school graduation rates has severely lowered standards â only about half of high school graduates complete a career- or college-ready curriculum. Consequently, a significant share of students lacks the background to effectively absorb technical training for either a blue- or white-collar position. Not surprising, standardized tests administered in studentsâ freshman and senior years indicate that many colleges are accomplishing very little value added. Too many college graduates lack the critical-thinking skills necessary for many entry-level managerial positions, or technical preparation in fields like accounting, engineering and education. As older workers leave the labor force, those that replace them often have lower productivityâimportant reasons why productivity has been growing so slowly and average wages are not rising, overall, even with unemployment at only 4.3%. Getting the economy growing robustly again will require attacking the problem from multiple angles and levels of government. Tax cuts, regulatory reform, and better trade deals are clearly a federal responsibility but better focusing schools and colleges on needed skills falls squarely on the shoulders of the states.

Nike says just announced a program to sell some of its sneakers through e-commerce giant Amazon.(Photo: Mary Altaffer, AP) Nike has confirmed that it will begin selling its products directly on Amazon, bringing another one of retailing's best-known brands into a relationship with the online giant. Nikeâs partnership with Amazon is a pilot deal to sell shoes, clothing and accessories on the site straight from the source. Previously, NikeÂ products were sold through third-party vendors and challenged the company's earnings. For now, the famous footwear and apparel company will only sell a limited selection of its merchandise on Amazon. âWeâre looking for ways to improve the Nike consumer experience on Amazon by elevating the way the brand is presented and increasing the quality of product storytelling,â Nike CEO Mark ParkerÂ said Thursday in the call with investors. âWeâre in the early stages, but we look forward to evaluating the results of the pilot.â Despite having lacked a direct partnership, Nike is one of the top-selling brands on Amazon through third-party sellers. Experts say the decision to officially partner with Amazon comes as the third-parties weaken control of the brands pricing and distribution, and Nike wants to take back control of its products on the site. The Wall Street Journal this week reported that in exchange for selling directly, Amazon agreed to crackdown on counterfeits and restrict unofficial sales. The deal also comes as Nike has been looking at ways to sell directly to consumers through various channels including social media and e-commerce sites like Amazon.Â The initiative is called ""consumer direct offense,"" and as part of it, Nike also announced on Thursdayâs call a venture to sell through the Instagram smartphone app. âClearly, we are boosting our ability to create new ways to serve consumers,â Parker said. Nike's announcement about Amazon didn't come as a complete surprise.Â Goldman Sachs analystÂ Lindsay Drucker Mann hinted to it in a note to clients on June 21. The report said Nikeâs revenue could rise by $300 million to $500 million in the U.S. with the deal if the pilot turns into a larger partnership. âTaking this step would give Nike direct economic exposure to a large and fast growing distribution channel, while improving the brand presentation and expanding access to Millennial shoppers,â Goldman Sachs stated. The report also stated the deal will allow Nike better access to Millennials âwho call out Amazon.com as their preferred shopping platform for fashion products, including apparel, shoes, and athletic gear.â Nike announced the deal on the same day as disclosing its fourth-quarter results, ended May 31.Â Revenue wasÂ $8.7 billion, up 5%Â compared to the same quarter a year ago.Â Nike's net income was $1 billion, a 19% increase.Â Earnings per share increasedÂ 22% toÂ 60 cents per share.

Susquehanna Financial Group said a âfull-scale dealâ could include the elimination of third-party Nike listings âgiven how protective Nike is over its brand.â But, thatâs probably not part of the deal. âRemoving unauthorized third-party Nike product sales would help enhance Nikeâs brand presentation and prevent counterfeit sales,â Susquehanna wrote in a Friday note. âGiven Amazonâs reputation as a transactional retailer with no interest in brand building, we have doubts as to whether Amazon will ever agree to the removal of an unauthorized third-party Nike sales from the site.â See:  Nike confirms deal to sell shoes through Amazon Should the partnership grow, there is a major sales opportunity, said Susquehanna, among others. But that brand risk persists. âAmazon would be the only customer that Nike wouldnât have significant leverage over given Amazon is about three times larger than Nike from a sales perspective,â Susquehanna wrote. âSo if Nike ever felt that Amazon was not presenting its brand properly, Nike would have very little ability to apply pressure in order to force Amazon to improve presentation.â Nike reported fourth-quarter revenue of $8.7 billion on Thursday.

,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"(Reuters) - Guitar Center Inc, the largest U.S. retailer of music instruments and equipment, is looking for ways to restructure its $1.3 billion debt burden as music lovers move their shopping online, according to people familiar with the matter. The sources asked not to be identified because the companyâs plans to cut its debt have not been made public. Ares declined to comment. The musical instrument industry grew 9 percent to $7.1 billion in retail sales over the past five years, but remains well below its 2005 peak of $7.7 billion, according to data from The Music Trades magazine. The industryâs challenges have been compounded as the newest generation of teens has shifted its focus from guitars to consoles, smartphones and sports. The electric guitar has been virtually absent from the Top 20 music charts in the past five years. Based in Westlake Village, California, Guitar Center has more than 280 stores across the United States. Its sister brand Music & Arts runs 150 stores focused on band and orchestral equipment for schools and educators. It has sought to draw shoppers into its stores by offering music lessons, instrument rentals and free workshops. Guitar Center began in 1959 as a store selling home organs in Hollywood. In the 1980s, the company started its Rockwalk on Sunset Boulevard, a hall of fame that pays homage to musicians including Alanis Morissette, Aerosmith and Van Halen.  After a period of explosive growth, it went public in the 1990s. Guitar Centerâs debt is trading at a significant discount to its face value. Its $325 million in unsecured bonds due in 2020 are trading at about 59 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data. The companyâs $615 million in secured bonds due in 2019 are trading at about 87 cents on the dollar. Credit ratings agency Moodyâs Investors Service Inc said in April that it did not expect that Guitar Center will generate enough free cash flow in the next 12 to 18 months to materially reduce its debt and improve leverage. This would not be the first time Guitar Center would undergo a debt restructuring. In 2014, Ares, which was the companyâs creditor at the time, swapped its debt in the retailer for a controlling equity stake, cutting the retailerâs debt by about $500 million. ","

,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"(Reuters) - PepsiCo Incâs PEP.N second-quarter profit topped estimates, as the company sold more higher-margin healthier foods such as baked chips and raised prices on its drinks in North America. Revenue from the companyâs North American Frito-Lay business, under which it sells snacks such as Layâs chips, rose 3 percent in the quarter ended June 17. Sales volumes rose 1 percent and net pricing climbed 3 percent. Demand for snacks was boosted by the launch of premium products such as Layâs Poppables - chips that have relatively less sugar content. Poppables cost more as well: a 5-ounce pack sells for $2.48 on Walmart.com versus a 10-ounce pack of Layâs Classic chips that sells for $2.50. PepsiCo isnât the only company promoting foods perceived as healthier than its traditional products. PepsiCo shares, however, fell nearly 1 percent to $113.19, in sync with broader market. The company said on Tuesday that North America beverage sales rose 2 percent in the quarter. While volume sales were flat, net pricing rose 1 percent. PepsiCo and Coke have for the past few years focused on selling smaller soda servings such as 7.5 ounce cans in developed markets to cope with falling demand for bigger-sized bottles. The smaller servings can cost more than twice as much per ounce. PepsiCo earned $1.44 per share, excluding one-time items and a 6 cents per share gain on an asset sale, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.40, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 2.1 percent to $15.71 billion, beating the $15.60 billion expected by analysts. The company raised its adjusted profit forecast for 2017 to $5.13 per share from $5.09, citing lower impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. ","

,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Consumers expect to boost spending in the months ahead and voiced confidence they are more likely to find a job and less likely to lose one in a strong labor market, the New York Federal Reserve reported Monday in its latest monthly survey of consumer expectations. Nearly 35 percent of the 1,300 heads of household included in the June poll said they were better off economically than a year go, a record in the four years the survey has been conducted. The results bolster the current Fed outlook of an economy that continues to generate jobs despite tepid overall growth and some concern about a recent dip in inflation, improving chances the central bank can follow through with plans for a further interest rate increase later this year. Though household expectations of inflation for the year ahead did dip slightly from the May survey, to 2.5 percent from 2.6 percent, respondents expect strong price increases of 2.8 percent over the coming three years. Thatâs consistent with the Fedâs current outlook that the recent weakness in inflation will prove temporary. The survey also bolstered the view of continued strong consumption growth. Half of those polled said they expected to spend at least 3.3 percent more in the coming year, compared to median expected spending growth of 2.6 percent in the May survey. One-year-ahead expected earnings growth increased to 2.5 percent in the June survey from 2.2 percent in May. Respondents also showed broad faith in the strength of the labor market, with a slight dip to 13.5 percent from 13.6 percent in the perceived probability of losing a job in the next year, and a jump to 59.2 percent from 56.7 percent in the probability of finding employment. More than a fifth of respondents said they might leave a job voluntarily in the next year, up from 19.4 percent in May. Voluntarily job exits are considered a sign of a strong labor market that offers employees choices. The online poll is designed to be a representative sample of the U.S. population. The New York Fed did not provide the margin of error for the  poll. ","

,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"LITTLE HOCKING, Ohio (Reuters) - While revelations that Donald Trump Jr. welcomed Russian help in last yearâs presidential election roil Washington, asking about it along southern Ohioâs Appalachian Highway can draw some pretty strange looks. In the mostly rural, heavily Baptist and predominately Trump-supporting terrain, the collective reaction ranges from   ignorance about the Russia investigation, to a belief that some media want to destroy Republican President Donald Trump and his  family, to complete disinterest. Many of the 20 people interviewed in several Ohio towns were dismissive of the barrage of headlines about a June 2016 meeting between Trumpâs eldest son Donald Jr. and a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton. The revelation was made when Trump Jr. released a series of emails on Tuesday amid investigations of U.S. intelligence agency conclusions that Moscow sought to help Trump win. Russia has denied allegations of interfering in the election and Trump has denied his campaign colluded with Russian officials, sometimes dismissing the notion as âfake news.â In Little Hocking, Ohio, Lisa Walker, 54, runs a small thrift shop. Wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the American flag, she says her husband has expressed fears that somebody is going to try and assassinate Trump. She and her husband voted for Trump. She has followed the revelations about the younger Trump on the news. She sees the Russia investigation as proof that âpeople are out to get Trump. I would hope they have better things to do than play games and attack Trump.â Similarly, in Jackson and Piketon, Ohio, Donald Trump Jr.âs troubles appeared to strengthen support for his father and Trump family members who many in the area see as embattled victims. In Hillsboro, the county seat of Highland County, the editor of the Hillsboro Times Gazette, Gary Abernathy, says many people in the county believe the media is trying to destroy Trump. âIt just plays into the belief here that the media is fixated on all things Russia,â said Abernathy, whose newspaper was one of only six in the United States to have endorsed Trump for president during the election campaign. âI donât mind Donald Trump being treated critically or aggressively, but not in a way that is an effort to drag him down. Donald Trump Jr. had one 20 minute meeting with a lawyer from Russia and itâs wall-to-wall coverage.â Trump won Highland County with more than 76 percent of the vote, 12 points more than the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney won, part of a surge in votes for Trump in many Midwestern rural counties that was a significant factor in his victory. Donald Jr.âs meeting stirred more questions and reporting about possible collusion or whether any U.S. laws were broken. Under the U.S. Federal Election Campaign Act, it is illegal for a foreign national to contribute to a U.S. political campaign. Before the latest disclosures, Americans overall were  sharply divided on what to make of reports about Trump and Russia. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll in June, 50 percent agreed âthat President Trump or someone from his campaign worked with Russia to influence the 2016 electionâ while 33 percent disagreed and the remainder were unsure. Republicans, however, mostly expressed the opposite view: 66 percent said they disagreed that Trump or his campaign worked with Russia while 20 percent agreed and the rest were unsure. In the Bob Evans diner in Jackson, three workers from Walmart were sitting down for lunch. They were Trump supporters. Asked about the Russia investigation, they stared back blankly. âI have never heard anything about it,â said Chastity Banks. Neither had her two colleagues. ","

Lauren Thomas,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"On Amazon's Prime Day, Wal-Mart and its digital arm, Jet.com, were seen matching many of the internet giant's discounts on an assortment of items, according Market Track. The market tracking firm reviewed price comparisons between many of the major retailers â Target, Best Buy, Wal-Mart and its Jet.com â throughout the day, finding that Wal-Mart's efforts to stay competitive clearly stood out from the rest. Both Wal-Mart's website and Jet.com were ""the closest in terms of price parity"" on Prime Day, matching more of Amazon's deals than other retailers, Market Track said. Still, Wal-Mart and Jet.com didn't come close to matching all discounted prices, Market Track added, and in some instances the firm found prices significantly higher on Wal-Mart.com than on Amazon.com. Representatives from Amazon and Wal-Mart did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on this data. Ahead of this week's Prime Day, which ended early Wednesday, neither Wal-Mart nor Jet.com had announced any official plans to compete with Amazon directly this year. In 2016, Wal-Mart offered a free 30-day trial for ShippingPass, its competitor at the time to Amazon Prime, around the event. Wal-Mart has since shuttered the program, replacing it with a promise that shoppers will receive free two-day shipping as long as they spend at least $35 online. In an email, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman told CNBC the company offers ""great deals every day."" ""[In 2017], we launched free, two-day shipping with no membership fee. ... And, customers can often get even lower prices at Walmart through the Pickup Discount,"" the spokeswoman said. A representative from Jet.com, which Wal-Mart acquired in late 2016 in order to boost the big-box retailer's online presence, did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. But from the looks of Jet.com's homepage, the e-retailer didn't offer any exclusive deals around Prime Day. Marc Lore, Jet.com's co-founder, is no stranger to e-commerce and Amazon. He was the co-founder of Quidsi, the company behind Diapers.com and Soap.com, which Amazon bought for $550 million in 2010. Recently, however, Amazon decided to shut down its Quidsi unit as it failed to make money. When it first opened for business, Jet.com was already promising cheaper prices than Amazon, aiming to deliver bigger savings to its customers who buy multiple items in a single order. On Prime Day this year, Wal-Mart had the greatest overlap in its online product assortment compared to Amazon's, Market Track found. Among the retailers that the firm tracked, 82 percent of the 52 Amazon products observed were also stocked at Walmart.com on Prime Day. Jet.com and Target had 50 percent of those items stocked, and Best Buy had 38 percent, Market Track added. The table above shows a detailed price comparison for select items at the various retailers on Prime Day, according to Market Track's research. ""There's only one person really geared to fight back, and it's called Wal-Mart,"" retail consultant Jan Kniffen of J. Rogers Kniffen told CNBC's ""Worldwide Exchange"" on Wednesday morning. ""I think [Wal-Mart] is doing a great job,"" Kniffen said. ""I think they're the biggest threat to Amazon. I think the two of them battle it out in grocery, they battle it out in the rest of retailing, they battle it out online, and they're going to battle it out in brick-and-mortar now."" Kniffen said he expects Prime Day to be a bigger and bigger event in the coming years â not running out of momentum anytime soon. ""I kind of think for retailing [this] is hilarious and scary, both. Nobody does any business in July."" ""Amazon intends to take over the world, and they're doing a pretty darn good job of it.""

A key feature of his plan was to pay for business tax cuts by sharply raising sales taxes. Because our data source excludes sales taxes in computing prices for many goods and services, it is possible that merchants have been forced to hold the line on prices somewhat in order to keep items affordable. But we don't know that for sure yet. So for now, Kansas is a bit of a moving target. 2017 Cost of Living score: 43 out of 50 points Most expensive area: Dodge City Average home price: $303,778 Half gallon of milk: $1.01 T-bone steak: $10.86 Monthly energy bill: $143.29 Doctor visit: $97.89 Tennessee gets its nickname, the Volunteer State, from its long tradition of military service. But historians disagree on which war made the nickname stick â the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War 34 years later or something else. They do agree the nickname does not come from the health-care professionals, even though some providers work really cheap. But they are not volunteers. It will cost just under $100 to get your eyes examined in Chattanooga. That is less than half of what the same service would cost in Fairbanks, Alaska. A strong economy has pushed prices up a bit in the past year, but you can still volunteer to pick up the check at dinner. A 12-inch cheese pizza at Pizza Hut, for example, is less than $9. 2017 Cost of Living score: 44 out of 50 points Most expensive area: Chattanooga Average home price: $314,197 Half gallon of milk: $1.99 T-bone steak: $11.26 Monthly energy bill: $148.10 Doctor visit: $127.67 A 5-pound sack of this state's most famous product will cost you just $1.40 in Boise. The same potatoes â considerably more traveled â will cost you nearly four times that in Sarasota, Florida. Okay, you are thinking: But I bet I can get orange juice a lot cheaper in Sarasota. And you are wrong. Juice prices in Idaho are roughly the same as in Florida, maybe a little lower. Want a steak with your potatoes? You can pick up a nice T-bone for under $10. It would cost you one and a half times that in New York City. And a nice bottle of wine can be had in Idaho for around $5. In some places you'll be lucky if that buys you a fairly awful glass. 2017 Cost of Living score: 45 out of 50 points Most expensive area: Boise Average home price: $267,833 Half gallon of milk: $1.53 T-bone steak: $9.96 Monthly energy bill: $133.56 Doctor visit: $125.34 They say that in the Sooner State the waving wheat can sure smell sweet when the wind comes right behind the rain.

That's not always walking distance, however. Fortunately, you're in the home of the American auto industry. The cost to run your vehicle here is appropriately cheap. Last year, when gasoline prices were hitting $3 a gallon in some parts of the country, the average in and around Detroit was around $2.04. Michigan's economy has been going through a complex transformation. The auto industry rebounded and is now leveling off, Detroit is on the comeback trail after its historic bankruptcy, high-tech jobs are supplanting manufacturing, and health care is booming. While it all shakes out, the state, on average, is enjoying some of the most affordable real estate prices in the country. 2017 Cost of Living score: 48 out of 50 points Most expensive area: Detroit-Dearborn-Livonia-Troy Average home price: $274,355 Half gallon of milk: $1.76 T-bone steak: $13.37 Monthly energy bill: $175.87 Doctor visit: $97.06 Hit the McDonald's drive-through here at the Crossroads of America, in the state that's famous for the Indianapolis 500, and your Quarter Pounder with Cheese will cost you just $3.93 plus tax.

While you are out and about, maybe you want to run a few errands: A haircut will run you around $12 if you are a man; a trip to the salon for a woman is also a bargain, at around $32. At the grocery store a head of lettuce costs just $1.04, while a pound of coffee will set you back just $4.43. And ground beef? At $3.74 a pound, you could make four of your own burgers for nearly the same price as one McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese. 2017 Cost of Living score: 49 out of 50 points Most expensive area: Elkhart-Goshen Average home price: $270,204 Half gallon of milk: $1.74 T-bone steak: $13.28 Monthly energy bill: $144.39 Doctor visit: $105.83 Coca-Cola may have been invented a couple of states over in Georgia, but they first bottled it where?

Also, little did he know they would sell Coca-Cola by the liter. Not only is Coca-Cola inexpensive in Mississippi, pretty much everything is. But that is not necessarily a good thing. The Magnolia State has had a run of economic hard luck, including high unemployment, loss of population and serious state fiscal woes. It also has among the lowest personal income in the nation. In short, Mississippi is such a cheap state to live in because that is what its citizens can afford. 2017 Cost of Living score: 50 out of 50 Most expensive area: Gulfport-Biloxi Average home price: $199,028 Half gallon of milk: $2.02 T-bone steak: $10.57 Monthly energy bill: $128.68 Doctor visit: $82.37 ",America's 10 cheapest states to live in 2017
Scott Cohn,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"We rank all 50 states in our annual America's Top States for Business study, so if there are going to be top states, there must also be bottom states. We know that every state â regardless of its rank â offers its own unique business advantages. But based on our methodology, these states don't offer the broad appeal that it takes to be a top state. Be sure to check out the full Top States for business ranking to see how your state did. These 10 states bring up the rear this year. Let's start with the good news. The Natural State is one of America's least expensive states to live and do business in â a good match for its marquee corporation, ""low prices"" leader Wal-Mart. The bad news is that you get what you pay for. Arkansas finishes near the bottom in Technology & Innovation and Quality of Life. Its workforce is among America's least educated and least productive.

The state enjoyed a brief economic boom, thanks to the oil-rich San Juan Basin in the northwest and Permian Basin in the southeast. But then the oil boom deflated, taking crude prices and the New Mexico economy down with it, and leaving the state with a missed opportunity to fix its broken educational system. Overall score: 1,110 out of 2,500 pointsWorst categories: Education (No. 45), Business Friendliness (No. 45)Best categories: Infrastructure (No. 16), Cost of Doing Business (No. 19)2016 rank: No. 39 With the nation's fifth-highest rate of premature death and the fifth-highest rate of uninsured residents, Oklahoma scores poorly in Quality of Life. But that is just the start of its problems. The state also does poorly in Technology & Innovation and Education. The state does offer the nation's fifth-lowest Cost of Living, but remember that bit about getting what you pay for.

But that grade might mean more if it didn't come from a state with the third-worst education system in the nation. In metric after metric, Louisiana finishes near the bottom, proving that tax breaks and incentives alone are not enough to put a state on top.

Let's put this in perspective. Finishing in 45th place would be nothing to crow about were it not for the fact that this is Rhode Island's best finish since we began rating the states in 2007. Just one year ago the Ocean State finished dead last. The improvement is no accident. Every time we rank Rhode Island at or near the bottom, state officials take it to heart. ""Take a fresh look at Rhode Island,"" Gov. Gina Raimondo urged us last year, pointing to a slate of reforms. Sure enough, Rhode Island's economy notched a solid improvement this year. Other things â like the nation's worst infrastructure â will take more time, but baby steps. Baby steps.

How about a lobster roll? You can get them everywhere. Yes, the quality of life in Maine is wonderful. But does it outweigh one of America's worst business climates? Maine has America's worst workforce, according to our study. By the numbers, Maine workers are unproductive, and low unemployment makes it hard to find good help. The state does finish in the top half for education. But once they get their diplomas, too many Maine graduates choose to leave the state.

The state has endured the one-two punch of competition from lower cost shale oil in the Lower 48 followed by lower oil prices in general. Dragged down by a giant budget shortfall thanks to lower oil tax revenue, Alaska's economy is the third worst in the nation by our measure, and the flow of business capital has frozen like an Arctic glacier. If there is a silver lining, it is the fact that there is a ready supply of skilled workers.Overall score: 1,033 out of 2,500 pointsWorst categories: Access to Capital (No. 49), Economy (No. 48)Best categories: Business Friendliness (No. 20), Quality of Life (No. 22)2016 rank: No. 45 The costs of living and doing business in the Magnolia State are the lowest in the nation. Here's what that buys you: the 4th worst economy, the 5th worst workforce, and the 5th worst schools. Long considered downright hostile in its regulatory structure, Mississippi has made strides in Business Friendliness. But it still finishes 43rd in the category. All together, it spells tough times in M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.

We need to qualify that. The most expensive costs in the nation do buy you the best quality of life, but they don't do much for Hawaii's business climate. Hawaii has one of the lowest-ranked workforces, with a heavy union presence and a limited supply due to low unemployment. While some of Hawaii's disadvantages are beyond its control due to the state's location, others, like the regulatory regime and the roads, are not.

Karen Gilchrist,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"Japan and the European Union have formally agreed an outline free trade deal which will ease the movement of goods between two of the world's largest economies. The pact, though still requiring some further negotiation, is scheduled to come into effect in early-2019 and will guarantee tariff-free trade between businesses within the two regions. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels, Belgium, Thursday to sign the deal. It is expected that the deal will liberalize 99 percent of trade between Japan and the EU, benefiting Japan's autos industry and the EU's farming sector in particular, according to BBC reports. It will also see the regions co-operate on other issues, including climate change and terrorism. Plans for a deal had been underway for four years but were stalled by varied demands from either side. However, talks gained a new urgency amid growing protectionist policies to emerge from the U.S. and Thursday's agreement will send a clear message to other global leaders ahead of this weekend's G20 summit. The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday urged leaders of the Group of 20 major economies to avoid ""myopic"" nationalistic policies and to work together in agreed forums to resolve their trade and economic differences. ""We did it,"" Tusk announced following the signing Thursday morning. ""We concluded EU-Japan political and trade talks. EU is more and more engaged globally."" Prime Minister Abe added that the pact provided a ""win-win"" for both parties and said he hoped it would encourage the early enactment of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and the U.S. ",EU and Japan strike free trade deal
Lauren Thomas,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"Tuesday might be known universally as Amazon's Prime Day, but other retailers aren't going to miss out on the heavier-than-normal online shopping traffic. In fact, a survey shows 76 percent of Prime Day shoppers will visit other major online stores to research product ratings and reviews before making a purchase on Amazon.com, according to consumer research firm Bazaarvoice. The top other sites that shoppers will search include Wal-Mart, which draws the most clicks; consumer electronics websites â such as Best Buy â in second place; Target, in third; and home improvement websites â those of Home Depot and Lowe's â also proving to be popular outlets, Bazaarvoice found. Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, told CNBC it offers ""great deals every day,"" choosing not to launch anything special on Prime Day this year. ""[In 2017], we launched free, two-day shipping with no membership fee. ... And, customers can often get even lower prices at Walmart through the Pickup Discount,"" a Wal-Mart spokeswoman said in a statement. A representative from Jet.com, which Wal-Mart only just acquired in late 2016 in order to boost the big-box retailer's online presence, did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. But from the looks of Jet.com's homepage, the e-retailer wasn't offering any out-of-ordinary deals as of Tuesday morning. In 2016, Wal-Mart offered a free 30-day trial for ShippingPass, its competitor at the time to Amazon Prime, in connection with Amazon's Prime Day. Wal-Mart has since shuttered its ShippingPass program, replacing it with a promise that shoppers will receive free two-day shipping as long as they spend at least $35 online. Although representatives from both Home Depot and Lowe's also said they did not have any deals to announce related to Prime Day, not all retailers are following these retailers' example. There are plenty of rival deals to be found. This year, Target said it is featuring back-to-school bargains at its stores and online during the week of July 9. This includes ""season-long low prices"" on school supplies and apparel, a Target spokeswoman told CNBC. ""As always, Target guests that have a REDcard will also receive free shipping on most Target.com orders and 5 percent off all purchases throughout the year,"" the spokeswoman added. Dell is another retailer that decided to roll out its so-called Black Friday in July the week of Amazon's Prime Day. Discounts on Dell's XPS Tower Desktop and Inspiron Desktop, for example, come ahead of back-to-school shopping season, when many students are searching for new computers. Other examples of rival retailers rolling out their own discounts this week include department store chain J.C. Penney, which is holding its ""Penney Palooza"" sale online again this year. Around Prime Day last year, Penney's event brought roughly a 13 percent increase in the number of visitors to its website that became buyers, compared with the retailer's daily average, according to a report from Multichannel Merchant. Macy's, meanwhile, is offering free shipping on all online orders until midnight Tuesday, with no minimum purchase required. There was a countdown clock running at the top of Macy's website, informing shoppers immediately of the limited-time offer. Department store chain Kohl's is offering 30 percent off some of its summer clothes, swimwear, sandals, accessories, beach towels, outdoor toys and patio furniture on Kohls.com for 30 hours straight. Toys R Us announced Monday that all of its customers will receive 20 percent off purchases made on Toysrus.com and Babiesrus.com, for 36 hours, starting at 6:00 pm ET on Monday and running through Wednesday. The toy retailer also said in its press release that no membership is required. Notably, in 2016 Amazon said it sold more than 2 million toys on Prime Day. Best Buy has also rolled out its competitive deals â which include $200 off a Dyson vacuum and $70 off an Apple Watch Series 2 â and is keeping those prices in effect all week long. Notably, while Amazon will be promoting its Echo device during Prime Day, its rival Google's Home will be sold at Best Buy for $99, which started Monday. The device usually sells for $129. The landing page of Best Buy's website read ""Big Deals Day: Huge savings for everyone."" Another e-retailer with a message for Amazon this week on its website is eBay. A banner at the top of eBay's website says ""Their Prime Deal Is Our Everyday Deal: No membership, just smiles."" Like Best Buy, and also Target, eBay was featuring the Google Home on sale for $99. Early Tuesday, Amazon touted that ""millions of members"" had shopped the Prime Day deals and boosted sales to ""record levels."" But it didn't provide more specific detail regarding how the record was being tallied. The e-commerce giant did say that as of the statement, which was released at 4 am ET, the Amazon Echo was the best-selling item so far in the U.S.  The Echo usually sells for $179.99, but was being sold for $89.99 on Tuesday. Alibaba also used the occasion as an opportunity to tout its own shopping event, Singles Day, by starting a four-month countdown to Nov. 11. The company has turned a Chinese folk holiday for young singles into the world's biggest shopping day. ""We are seeing other big-box retailers use Prime Day as an opportunity to capture shoppers' appetite for deals and as a way to compete against Amazon for share of wallet and mindset,"" PwC's consumer markets lead, Steve Barr, told CNBC. ""But the only way they will draw attention away from Amazon is through great deals,"" Barr said. ""July is becoming equivalent to November with monthlong discounts to entice shoppers. ...

Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) revolutionized the retail industry with its emphasis on low prices, and its actions had a huge competitive impact on smaller local retailers that have since struggled to survive. Now, though, Wal-Mart is the one facing tough competition, this time from internet retailers who don't have the extensive store network and its attendant costs that Wal-Mart has to pay. Dividend investors are happy with Wal-Mart because of its long track record of regular dividend increases, but they want to be sure that the retail giant doesn't do anything to endanger the sustainability of its quarterly payouts in the future.  Current Quarterly Dividend Per Share $0.51 Current Yield 2.7% Number of Consecutive Years With Dividend Increases 44 years Payout Ratio 46% Last Increase March 2017 Source: Yahoo! Finance. Last increase refers to ex-dividend date. Wal-Mart has done a good job of rewarding shareholders by increasing its dividend steadily over time. The big-box retailer's increases haven't always been huge, but they've been consistent, and only a few dozen companies can boast longer streaks of raising dividends every year than Wal-Mart. Yet the pace of Wal-Mart's dividend growth has slowed recently. During the 1980s and 1990s, Wal-Mart's quarterly payouts climbed at a healthy pace that often included double-digit percentage increases. That growth pace only accelerated in the 2000s, with a couple years in which dividends rose by 30% to 40%. Yet since a nearly 20% increase in 2013, Wal-Mart has given shareholders only $0.01 quarterly dividend increases, slowing dividend growth to just 2% per year. WMT Dividend data by YCharts. There shouldn't be any immediate concerns among investors about Wal-Mart's ability to keep paying its dividend. The retailer has a payout ratio of less than 50%, and that should give the company ample opportunity to keep making the minimal increases it has used in recent years to keep its dividend-increase streak alive. That's roughly in line with what some of its retail peers pay, and it gives Wal-Mart breathing room in considering future capital allocation decisions. The bigger question for Wal-Mart is whether it can keep moving forward in the long run. The big-box giant reeled after the biggest internet retailer decided to make a big push into the brick-and-mortar grocery space. Wal-Mart has used its grocery supercenter store offerings to pull more customers into its stores on a regular basis, where they'll typically do additional shopping for non-grocery items at the same time. Any threat to its grocery stores would pose a larger problem for Wal-Mart, and signs of a price war could hurt profits at a time when the retailer would prefer to get growth from the segment. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is doing its best to fight fire with fire. E-commerce sales for the company jumped 63% in the first quarter of its new fiscal year, and that helped pull overall revenue up slightly. With such an extensive store base, Wal-Mart hopes to use its local locations as distribution centers, offering local delivery and store pickup options to customers who need items as quickly as possible. Wal-Mart is likely to keep its dividend growth to a token amount for the next several years as it works on its overall strategic vision for a changing retail world. With current yields at reasonably attractive levels, dividend investors have to decide whether they believe Wal-Mart can evolve along with the retail industry. In the long run, Wal-Mart's dividend payments will rely on its resourcefulness going forward. ","
      
    Will Wal-Mart's Dividend Yield Climb From Here? -- The Motley Fool

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dow giants Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) have each, in their own way, used the big-box retailing concept to devastate their competition over the years. Wal-Mart employs a focus on low prices to protect its dominant market share while Home Depot's product authority keeps it growing faster than national threats like Lowe's. Judging by the gap in stock valuations, investors are far more optimistic about Home Depot's business today. Below, we'll look at why the home improvement giant looks like the better stock toÂ buy right now. Here are a few key statistics to get us started: Metric Wal-Mart Home Depot Market cap $223 billion $181 billion Sales growth 1.4% 5.6% Net profit margin 2.8% 8.4% Dividend yield 2.8% 2.3% Return on invested capital 15% 31% Price-to-sales ratio 0.47 1.92 Price-to-earnings ratio 17 23 52-week price performance (1%) 13% Data sources: Company financial filings.Â Operating data is for the past complete fiscal year. Home Depot wins the operating trends matchup across the board. Its nearly 6% jump in comparable-store sales growth last year was four times the 1.4% boost that Wal-Mart managed. The company is far more profitable, too, as it turned 8.4% of its sales into net income, compared to 2.8% for the retailing titan. Image source: Getty Images. The most recent business results paint a similar picture, but suggest Wal-Mart may be gaining a slight edge in terms of momentum. Customer traffic improved by 1.4% in its U.S. locations last quarter to nearly match Home Depot's 1.6% uptick. Wal-Mart's traffic growth has been accelerating for two years whereas Home Depot's is headed in the other direction, falling from the 4% rate the retailer enjoyed in 2015 to 3% last year and now to below 2% so far in 2017. Home Depot has more than made up for that decline through far higher spending per visit, and that's a big reason why the company is outgrowing its industry peers by a wide margin and soaking up market share. Wal-Mart can't say the same thing about its own growth pace. Neither company is a slouch on capital allocation, and direct cash makes up a significant chunk of overall shareholder returns. Yet Home Depot comes out ahead in important ways here, too. Its 31% return on invested capital makes it one of the most efficient businesses on the entire market and is more than double Wal-Mart's result. HD Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts. That gap has helped the company hike both share repurchase spending and dividend payouts at a faster pace, although Wal-Mart currently sports the fatter yield of almost 3%. Home Depot's recent stock price growth is likely a reflection of its brighter growth outlook. A wide range of metrics, including home prices, home improvement spending, and household formation rates all point to an above-average expansion rate for its industry. And, as the clear leader, it is well positioned to grab more than its fair share of those gains. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, is far more exposed to a broader retailing industry that's slowing as consumers move their shopping to online channels. In exchange for that weaker outlook, investors are being quoted a sharp discount for Wal-Mart shares today. In fact, its price-to-earnings ratio of 17 makes it one of the cheapest on the Dow by that metric. Thus, if your biggest concern is overpaying for a stock, you'll want to stay away from Home Depot, especially given the potential that its streak of market-thumping growth could come to a surprising end over the next few quarters. But if you're willing to pay a premium for businesses with stellar operating and financial trends, then Home Depot is the stock to buy today. ","

Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) stock has gone on a mini-slump since it became public that Amazon.comÂ (NASDAQ:AMZN) planned to buy Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM). That news sent many supermarket and grocery-chain stocks moving in the wrong direction. Basically, the market assumes that Amazon will be able to take a bigger piece of the grocery pie by integrating its technology and customer base with Whole Foods' brick-and-mortar business. It's very possible that will happen. Amazon has buying power that surpasses all but its largest rivals. Smaller supermarket chains may well lose customers to whatever in-store and delivery options the online leader brings to Whole Foods. Wal-Mart, however, has less to fear. The company has more than 5,000 locations in the United States, dwarfing Whole Foods' 400 or so. It also has a growing digital business, as well as the purchasing power to meet or beat Amazon's prices and the cash to compete with its efforts at innovation. Image source: YCharts. Wal-Mart shares closed at $78.91 on June 15, the day before the Amazon/Whole Foods deal was announced. They sank to $75.24 at close on June 16, and shares were trading around that range, settling in at $75.33 at market close on July 7. That's not a huge drop -- some chains fell much farther -- but it shows that at least some investors believe Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods changes things for Wal-Mart. It's easy to see why someone would have that knee-jerk reaction, but in the long run it's hard to see how this deal will have a major impact on Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart and Amazon already compete in the grocery space. Image source: Wal-Mart. Amazon may use its purchasing power to lower prices at Whole Foods. It may also use the supermarket chain's stores and warehouses to enhance its own efforts at same-day grocery delivery. In theory, the online retailer could make every Whole Foods a hub for drones, and a base for faster delivery. Wal-Mart can do all of those things as well, and from a much larger store base. In fact, the company already has an edge in that area, as it's been aggressively testing pushing customers to order online but pick up in stores. Amazon could change Whole Foods and introduce some of its house brands while bringing overall prices down. It could even use the chain for delivery under the Amazon Prime brand name, allowing it to offer a value play without compromising the Whole Foods brand. What Amazon almost certainly won't do is take the upscale grocery chain and make it a downmarket, price-based competitor. The online retailer may go cheaper, but it's not going to sacrifice the premier brand it has purchased. Wal-Mart and Amazon are competitors fighting for some of the same customers. Their battle, however, will be a lot like when Godzilla faces Mothra or some other giant monster. The two companies will pummel each other, but the real damage will be done to lesser players in the space. Even if the two giants target each other, it's more likely they'll gain share from regional supermarket chains that won't have the resources to match prices or technology. Amazon is encroaching on Wal-Mart's brick-and-mortar stronghold, but that's happening at the same time the physical retailer has upped its digital game. Sales will shift, battles will be fought, and there will be losers in the grocery/supermarket space as Amazon takes over Whole Foods. Expecting Wal-Mart to be one of those losers is unrealistic. The company will have to respond and react to whatever Amazon does, but the same is already true in reverse. Wal-Mart shares are down because of Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, but they will recover. That creates a buying opportunity for people who believe that the retailer can protect its brick-and-mortar business while continuing to grow its online business. Those are both things Wal-Mart has been successful in doing, with online growth being spectacular at 63% in the most-recent quarter and same-store sales growing for 11 straight quarters. The pairing of Amazon and Whole Foods is a game changer, but it doesn't really change the game for Wal-Mart. Both companies should be able to continue to grow taking share from smaller rivals that simply won't be able to keep up. ","

"Todd Campbell, Dan Caplinger, and Demitrios Kalogeropoulos",07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Stock-market crashes can take a toll on just about any stock portfolio, but investors might come out of a market crash a bit better off if they add Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) to their holdings. According to our Motley Fool investors, demand at these companies will hold up in a downturn, giving them a chance to deliver market-beating returns. Dan Caplinger (Wal-Mart): Market crashes are scary because they often take stocks down even if there's no good fundamental reason for doing so. Yet there are a few stocks that investors look to for stability even under the toughest of conditions. During the most recent market crash in 2008, Wal-Mart was one of the only winners to come out of the financial crisis and Great Recession, and investors couldn't have asked for better performance. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The key to Wal-Mart's ability to weather crashes has everything to do with the cause of the plunge in 2008. When the economy is strong, consumers feel good about their economic circumstances, and they feel more comfortable spending money. That's generally good for most retailers, but the big-box giant's emphasis on low prices and discount goods holds less appeal for confident consumers than shopping at higher-end luxury stores. What the 2008 recession and market crash did was to show American shoppers that they needed Wal-Mart and its price focus. In the end, the retail giant fared much better than most of its competitors, largely because many customers moved down from higher-end stores in search of more affordable options. The stock finished 2008 with a 20% gain, beating the S&P 500's return by more than 55 percentage points. There's no guarantee that the next market crash will come with a recession, so Wal-Mart might not benefit from the same positive impact. The competitive landscape has also shifted, and Wal-Mart's benefit from expanding its grocery business could come with new risks in the near future. Yet with a history of solid performance even in tough markets, Wal-Mart has convinced many investors that it can thrive even in the next market crash. Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Johnson & Johnson): Healthcare titan Johnson & Johnson has lived through more than a few market slumps in its over 120 years of doing business, yet these ups and downs don't get between income investors and their quarterly checks. In fact, with 55 consecutive annual payout raises, Johnson & Johnson boasts one of the longest-running dividends on the market today: JNJ Dividend data by YCharts. Shareholders can't bank on a perfect record of sales and earnings growth; after all, revenue has declined in two of the last ten fiscal years. Investors occasionally endure painful profit environments, too. The most recent was a two-year stretch that was marked by severe economic decline around the world, the patent expiration for two blockbuster drugs, and a costly product recall. ""Our company was severely tested,"" Johnson & Johnson's CEO said in its 2011 annual report. Yet the operation excelled through this period, thanks, in part, to a well-diversified portfolio of market-leading products. In fact, it gets 70% of its sales from products that are ranked either No. 1 or No. 2 in their respective markets. Johnson & Johnson's aggressive focus on the future is another competitive strength that's nearly impossible for rivals to match. It plowed $7.5 billion into research and development spending in 2011; that number rose to $9.1 billion last year, equivalent to 13% of sales. The aggressive pace of innovation ensures that around one-quarter of the company's revenue comes from products released in just the past five years. In that way, the owner of iconic healthcare brands like Band-Aid demonstrates that constant adaptation is the surest path to market-beating business results over the long term. Todd Campbell (Bristol-Myers Squibb): While ""thrive"" might be a stretch, a defensive stock like Bristol-Myers Squibb can certainly survive a market crash better than most, and that alone might make it worth owning. Bristol-Myers Squibb is one of the largest drugmakers in the world, and thanks to Opdivo and Yervoy, it's one of the fastest-growing developers of drugs used to treat cancer. A larger, longer-living population means its medicines are increasingly being used. And because Opdivo and Yervoy treat advanced cancers, where there are fewer treatment options, demand for them is pretty insulated against recession. Last year, Bristol-Myers Squibb's shares fell after the failure of a first-line advanced lung cancer study evaluating Opdivo. But I think other studies can still allow it to compete in the first-line setting someday, and that dozens of Opdivo studies in other indications should fuel future growth. Opdivo's sales were $1.1 billion in the first quarter, up 60% from one year ago, and while Yervoy's sales didn't grow as quickly, they still increased by a healthy 25% year over year to $330 million. Also, the company is benefiting from growing use of Eliquis, an anticoagulant that's displacing warfarin in many indications. It shares Eliquis with Pfizer, but with $1.1 billion in Q1 sales, there's plenty of money to go around, especially since its sales grew 50% in the past year. Bristol-Myers Squibb's share-price drop last year means its dividend yield has increased to 2.8%, and with a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 18, you aren't paying through the nose to own this company. Given that Bristol-Myers Squibb's shares declined just 13% in 2008 while the S&P 500 lost more than one-third of its value, I think a good argument can be made for owning this stock the next time a bear market comes knocking.

    3 Dividend Stocks That Thrive in Market Crashes -- The Motley Fool

Danny Vena,07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There's no denying that that the trend toward internet retail is changing the way consumers do business. Many purchases once made in stores are now being made online, and the biggest beneficiary of that trend has been Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Deloitte's Global Powers of Retailing 2017 report reveals that the e-commerce juggernaut has become not only the largest online seller in the world, but also the 10th largest retailer of any kind. The company has made many ingenious decisions that have contributed to its dominance, including such moves as offering free shipping on orders over a certain dollar amount, adding third-party sellers, and using data and algorithms to suggest other items you might like to purchase. There are two tactics, however, that stand out as Amazon's crown jewels and will continue to pay dividends for years to come. Amazon continues to dominate online and physical retail. Image source: Getty Images. Customer loyalty program Amazon Prime has been successful beyond imagination. A subscription to the program costs $99 per year or $10.99 per month and offers a variety of benefits. The most touted is two-day free shipping, which can also be same-day delivery for certain products in eligible ZIP codes. This benefit lowers a key barrier for members making continuing purchases on the site. Members also gain access to a host of other benefits. Amazon Prime Video provides unlimited video streaming from its library of movies and TV shows, similar to the serviceÂ Netflix, Inc.Â provides. Customers can also stream unlimited ad-free music from its library of more than a million songs. Many consumers now expect free shipping or two-day shipping based solely on their experience with Amazon, which has put pressure on many other retailers, including competitor Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Wal-Mart has countered by offering free shipping on orders over $35 and offering discounts for items that aren't available in stores if they're ordered online and scheduled for in-store pickup. While Amazon itself doesn't provide metrics on Prime subscribers, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP)Â reports that Amazon Prime subscriptions have soared to 85 million -- double the amount from two years ago and equal to 70% of the U.S. population of 126 million households. Another key finding in the report is that Amazon Prime members spend $1,300 a year on average, nearly double the $700 non-member customers spend per year. This finding shows why Amazon has a vested interest in increasing the roles of Prime customers. Amazon's release of a smart speaker in late 2014 was a stroke of pure genius. It might be tempting to downplay the significance of the rise of virtual assistants, but for Amazon this was serious business. With no smartphone to showcase Amazon's digital darling, the development of the smart speaker was inspired. The Echo has become a hit with consumers and spawned a host of imitators, with virtually every major tech company developing its own. Many investors have questioned how these novelty items could produce much in the way of revenue, but Amazon has already cracked the code. Amazon Echo is the company's Trojan horse and should not be underestimated. Image source: Amazon. CIRP estimates that 10.7 million homes have one of the Echo family of products in their home, providing Amazon with a Trojan horse that has gone largely unrecognized. A recent analyst note from RBC Capital Markets reveals that an estimated 17% of Echo owners have already used the device to purchase products. As familiarity with the devices increases, consumers will become more comfortable making voice-initiated purchases. The Alexa-based devices will continue to proliferate, if last holiday season is any indication. Amazon revealed that sales of the Echo family of products were up more than ninefold over the previous holiday season and that Alexa voice-controlled devices were the top-selling products across all categories at Amazon.com. Amazon Prime Day 2017 is upon us, the day when customers are encouraged to sign up for a 30-day free trial of Prime to take advantage of the 30-hour sale. While Amazon is usually vague on specifics, the results from last year's event may provide insight into what we can expect this year. In the 2016 press release at the close of the event, Amazon revealed that it was the biggest sales day in the company's history, as well as the biggest day ever for Amazon devices. This year's event is likely to add to the growing list of Prime members and place more voice-controlled products in the homes of the faithful. This one-two punch of increasing Prime members and the growing installed base of Echo smart speakers will provide a continuing catalyst for the online retailer's dominance in the field. ","
      
    Amazon Is Using This One-Two Punch to Knock Out Retail -- The Motley Fool

Rich Duprey,07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP) should be very happy its rival Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) is being acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a $6.9 billion deal. The retail landscape is obviously no longer the same as it once was, and the U.S. Department of Justice really bungled the opportunity to bring some clarity to the industry when it squashed the merger of the two competitors. Yet the plans Sycamore holds for Staples once it's taken private suggest that Office Depot may finally be able to not only survive on its own, but thrive. Image source: Getty Images. Like many retailers today, Staples and Office Depot found themselves over-stored. As brick-and-mortar rivals like Wal-Mart and Costco threatened them on one side, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other e-commerce suppliers attacked on the other. To improve its competitive response, Staples sought to merge with Office Depot in a $6.3 billion bid to create a single national office-supplies retailer. However, the federal government objected. Whatever the merits of the merger were on the retail level, trade regulators were more concerned about the commercial contract market from which Staples and Office Depot each derived about 40% of their revenues. They said the former held a 47% share of the business-to-business market for Fortune 100 companies, while the latter owned 32%; the government worried that giant global corporations might end up paying more for paper, pens, and ink if the merger went through, even though 99% of customers wouldn't be affected. The Federal Trade Commission sued to block the merger and the district court judge hearing the case agreed, siding with the government's argument that Amazon, in particular, wasn't a worrisome competitor. The collapse of the merger doomed Staples and Office Depot to mediocrity and bleak financial outlooks. Last year Staples' sales fell 3%, while adjusted operating earnings fell 4% from the year-ago period. It sold its retail business in the U.K., as well as its European operations; saw its contract business sales go flat; and closed 48 stores in North America. Image source: Getty Images. Office Depot's results weren't any better. Its sales fell 6%, with adjusted earnings falling 4%. It shuttered 123 stores, also sold its European business, agreed to divest its operations in Australia and New Zealand, and recently sold its South Korean business. Both companies had their CEOs quit, and both anticipate 2017 being little better than last year. Yet Office Depot should take heart from its rival's deal to go private. Sycamore Partners reportedly plans to divide Staples into three separate entities -- U.S. retail, Canadian retail, and the business-to-business (B2B) operation -- because bond and loan investors, who are crucial to helping the firm complete the leveraged buyout, aren't keen about the retail businesses; they're only interested in the corporate contract piece. That suggests Staples may see its retail footprint sold off, or markedly decreased, as it focuses on its B2B business, which is mostly done online and via telephone. Already Staples has begun rethinking its stores, shrinking actual retail space, and dividing up the floor plan to create conference rooms and ""co-working"" spaces. Called Workbar, the program is a reimagining of the retail layout, similar to how Sears Holdings is trying to reduce its footprint by leasing out space in its stores to other retailers. Image source: Office Depot. As Staples focuses less on retail, it could very well give Office Depot a chance to gain more business for itself. While also reducing the expansive sprawl of its stores, Office Depot is focusing on smaller-format stores of around 15,000 square feet (currently they're around 20,000 sq. ft.), and is converting a number of existing stores to this smaller size. In 2016, 25 stores were downsized, and the chain plans to have as many as 100 stores changed to this format this year. Office Depot's ""store of the future,"" which features more areas to try out products and more tech support like that found at electronics retailers, will also focus more on services. There's talk that Amazon.com might want to buy Office Depot. While this is a rumor that has surfaced before, especially immediately after the failed merger attempt with Staples, there could be new interest, especially since Amazon bought Whole Foods Market. Analysts think such a deal would face tough scrutiny from the FTC, but has the marketplace changed so much in a year that Amazon Business would now be seen as a competitive threat? It was because the government blocked Staples' attempt to buy Office Depot 20 years ago that the retailers were in such a weakened state they sought to do it again. The FTC failed to adequately predict how the market would change, and repeated its mistake again last year. There may still be a chance for Office Depot to find a silver lining in going through the paper shredder, and Staples' going private may be what allows it to do so.

    Staples Is Going Private -- Good News for Office Depot? -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Realty Income (NYSE:O), one of the largest real estate investment trusts, is well known for its focus on retail properties and for its reliable monthly dividends. However, there are some things about the company you may not be familiar with. How many of these seven things did you already know? William and Joan Clark founded Realty Income in 1969 and acquired their first property, a Taco Bell, in 1970. Here are some things you might be surprised to learn about Realty Income. Image Source: Getty Images. With nearly 5,000 properties, Realty Income is the largest net-lease REIT in the market. If you're not familiar with the net-lease structure, it generally refers to freestanding single-tenant properties that are leased to their tenants on a long-term basis. Tenants agree to cover variable expenses such as property taxes, building insurance, and certain maintenance costs, and also typically agree to annual rent increases, or ""escalators."" This structure results in minimal vacancies and a predictable, growing income stream. And as the largest REIT of its kind, Realty Income has the advantages that come with scale, such as more efficient operations and better financial flexibility. Because of its net-lease strategy, and its low debt level, Realty Income is well positioned to not only survive but also to thrive during tough times. During the Great Recession, for example, Realty Income's occupancy never dropped below 96%, and the company continued to increase its dividend several times per year. And thanks to its high credit rating and financial flexibility, the company was able to complete $700 million in opportunistic acquisitions in 2010 while property values were depressed. As of this writing, Realty Income has paid 563 consecutive monthly dividends to shareholders, over almost 47 years. The company has increased its payment at an annualized rate of 4.7% since its NYSE listing in 1994 and has increased the dividend for 79 consecutive quarters. In fact, Realty Income is a member of the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index for its excellent dividend history. Since listing on the NYSE, Realty Income has generated 16.4% annualized total returns for investors -- handily beating the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq, which returned an average of 10.2%, 9.6%, and 9.5%, respectively. Perhaps even more impressive, the company produced these high returns without excessive volatility. In fact, the standard deviation of Realty Income's returns was less than that of all three indexes. Image source: Realty Income investor presentation. Realty Income is known as a retail REIT, and for good reason. Most of its properties are occupied with some of the best-known retail businesses in the U.S., such as Walgreens, Dollar General, AMC Theaters, and Wal-Mart, just to name a few. In fact, nearly 97% of the company's properties are retail-oriented. Many investors are therefore surprised to learn that retail properties account for less than 80% of Realty Income's rental revenue. Roughly 20% comes from a combination of industrial, office, and agricultural properties. Even though these properties make up just over 3% of the company's total, they are typically larger facilities and therefore generate more revenue per property. This adds a nice element of diversification to Realty Income's revenue stream. Realty Income went into 2016 expecting to make about $750 million in acquisitions. However, through a combination of low interest rates and a high stock price, the company's cost of capital fell to record low levels and stayed there. In fact, Realty Income increased its full-year acquisition guidance in every quarter and still ended up beating its most optimistic projections by investing $1.86 billion in more than 500 properties, making 2016 the company's highest-growth year yet in terms of investment volume. The company is projecting $1 billion in acquisitions for 2017, but with $371 million in the first quarter alone, Realty Income could be in for another busy year. ","

Shares of Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) are trading near all-time highs right now, setting new records on nearly a daily basis. The stock has gained a total of 65% so far in 2017, or 77% over the last year. Is Alibaba's stock getting overheated at these levels, or would it still make sense to buy the stock right now? Let's find out. Image source: Alibaba. The China-based e-commerce giant has been in business since 1999, but joined the American stock markets as recently as 2014. It's the Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) of China, the eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) of China, and whole lot more. Measured by roughly $550 billion in gross merchandise volume, this is already the largest retail business in the world: bigger than Amazon, bigger than eBay, bigger even than Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). That being said, Alibaba's business model is a closer match to eBay than to Amazon or Wal-Mart. The company doesn't directly make or sell products, but acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers across China. That model is expanding beyond the borders of the Middle Kingdom, too. The next time you're buying a fidget spinner or an off-brand USB charger, chances are very good that Alibaba had a hand in that transaction. Yes, even if you bought it from Amazon or eBay -- those are our American gateways to the Alibaba universe via independent sellers in China and America. You bet it is. In other words, this gigantic business is still growing like a hungry start-up. Alibaba is leaving American growth phenom Amazon in the dust. Yes, Alibaba is still growing. And don't forget that the vast majority of this company's sales are generated right at home, in the Chinese market. The revenue contribution from international commerce stopped at just 10% in 2017, up from 8% in 2016. Expect the international business to pick up steam over the next few years -- Alibaba's management is currently ""laying the foundation for long-term growth"" in the international segment, according to the fourth-quarter report. There's a whole lot of untapped growth outside of China, and Alibaba is only getting started. Image source: Getty Images. This is not a cheap stock today. Alibaba shares are trading at 58 times adjusted earnings and 31 times free cash flows, and these valuation ratios have been rising relentlessly in 2017. If you're looking for a deep-discount value stock, Alibaba isn't your bag. Furthermore, the company doesn't pay a dividend, so this is where we say goodbye to single-minded income investors. For pretty much anybody else, this is an exciting growth stock with acres of greenfield opportunity ahead of it, both in China and around the world. It might make sense to wait for a big share-price drop before building an Alibaba position in your portfolio, but you just can't say for sure that the stock price will be this low again. I mean, if you gave up on Amazon when it traded at record prices seven years ago, waiting on the sidelines for a plunge that never came would have lost you an 800% return. As an Alibaba investor myself, I'm betting that the stock is a good deal even at today's sky-high prices. Sometimes you get what you pay for, and it looks like Alibaba will continue to crush the market for years to come. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

    Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.: Buy at the High? -- The Motley Fool

Rich Duprey,07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. As if Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn't already dominate the Christmas shopping season, UPS (NYSE:UPS) is helping to drive even more customers to it at the expense of smaller retailers. The package delivery leader is imposing new surcharges on delivery during two key periods of the holiday season: the Black Friday start of Christmas gift buying and the week before Christmas itself. While UPS was first to make the move to hike fees, and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has yet to announce its plans, it is expected that Big Brown's rival will follow suit. The companies typically follow one another when it comes to raising rates. Image source: UPS. On the surface, the higher UPS fees are negligible and certainly understandable. The carrier announced last month that between November 19 and December 2, it was imposing a $0.27 surcharge on residential ground deliveries with another per-piece peak surcharge getting added between December 17 and December 23. Other forms of delivery such as next-day air, second-day air, or third-day select won't have a surcharge added around Black Friday, but they will get one for the week before Christmas, with fees ranging from $0.81 per piece to $0.91 per piece. Not that the additional fees aren't warranted. As e-commerce has grown to comprise ever greater percentages of Christmas shopping, let alone non-holiday times, the carriers have come under greater pressure during the peak periods to get the orders delivered on time. Four years ago, UPS suffered anÂ infamous collapse in on-time delivery performance as it was overwhelmed by last-minute demand for Christmas gifts as retailers made outlandish promises for last-minute shoppers. Amazon ended up giving out $20 gift certificates and refunding shipping costs to mollify irate customers. Both UPS and FedEx ended up hiking shipping rates, changing how they calculate rates for packages, hiring thousands of temporary seasonal employees -- last year, it hired about 95,000 temporary workers -- and investing hundreds of millions in infrastructure improvements. Yet the debacle also convinced Amazon.com that it needed to take greater responsibility for its own deliveries, and it now has its own fleet of aircraft and delivery trucks, though the national carriers still play a large role in package delivery. But it is Amazon that could benefit the most by this holiday rush surcharge, even though it, too, will be paying the higher fees. Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon.com owns the online shopping world at Christmas. Last year, it accounted for 44% of all the e-commerce sales made during the last two weeks of the holidays, and 38% of total Christmas sales.Â It already accounts for half of all e-commerce sales made, holiday or otherwise, and analysts say it could soon drive as much as 80% of all online sales. Holiday e-commerce sales hit record levels last year, with so-called Cyber Monday sales surging 12% from the year-ago period to hit $3.45 billion, blowing past analyst expectations of just $3.36 billion. Adobe Digital Insights notes it was the first time ever online sales exceeded $3 billion for the day, ""and the first day ever to drive over $1 billion in mobile revenue."" The second-day air surcharge of $0.97 per piece that UPS is imposing -- the highest of the surcharges -- seems specifically targeted at Amazon because of its Prime membership program and its two-day delivery guarantee. Yet, because of Amazon's size and scope, it has the financial wherewithal to absorb the fee increases, whereas small and medium-sized businesses trying to compete with the e-commerce king do not. If they absorb the fees, these smaller rivals risk their profitability; if they pass them on to customers, they risk losing sales. Finding shipping alternatives might not be easy, particularly if the competition follows suit.Â With its own air and ground fleets handling a greater percentage of deliveries, the impact on Amazon will be mitigated. Image source: UPS. One Amazon competitor likely not hurt isÂ Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), which could be a big winner from the increase as well. The surcharges only apply to residential deliveries, so those orders shipped to stores can avoid the fees. Wal-Mart has been pushing its free ship-to-store option heavily for the past few years, and it could get a bigger shove this year as shoppers seek to save money. Another distortion that might occur is that it will push retailers to advertise even earlier in the year to be able to book sales before the surcharges go into effect. While the boundaries are already being pushed further back as retailers scramble for every dollar they can get, it really only serves to pull sales forward as opposed to expanding the opportunity. Amazon.com has done a significant amount of preparation to ensure all sales and profits stay within its ecosystem, and although it could pay a bit more because of the UPS surcharges, it may find even more sales coming its way as they inadvertently push even more customers to it.

    Is UPS Pushing Shoppers to Amazon? -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Some call it the retail apocalypse. That name reflects the massive turmoil in the sector, where many brick-and-mortar chains have been struggling in the face of ever-growing digital competition. Through the first six months of 2017 Target (NYSE:TGT), GameStop (NYSE:GME), andÂ Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS) have all fallen victim to the trend, and their shares have plummeted due to the changing operating environment. Consumers behavior is changing, which has impacted all three of these retailers in different ways. The underlying theme, though, is that shopping going digital has hurt them all. Target has been testing new store layouts and sizes. Image source:m Target. Shares in the discount store have sunk fairly steadily since the new year began, but they took a further hit when news broke that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was buying Whole Foods. Target stock closed 2016 at $70.80; it closed on June 30 at $52.29, a 26% drop,Â according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. That share price slide can be traced largely to the company's struggles to hold its ground against bigger rivals including Amazon and Wal-Mart. Though it's theÂ second-largest discount chain in the country, investors are likely wary about the chain's ability to keep up in this evolving marketplace. Those are concerns that Target is trying to address. The company has begun revamping many of its stores to make them more customer-friendly and has also begun adding more custom merchandise. This includes fashion-forward clothing lines and household goods that have proven popular in initial tests. The bookstore chain has been reeling pretty much since Amazon became a factor in the book business. As a larger share of book sales have moved to the e-book format -- an area where Barnes & Noble has a limited presence with its failed NOOK line -- the chain has struggled to remain relevant. Even though it has shown signs of stabilizing its business recently, shares remain down for the first half of the year. After closing 2016 at $10.60, they fell to $7.45 on June 30, a 29% drop, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Barnes & Noble has been making significant changes in search of a workable business model. These have included diversifying its merchandise into specialty toys and niches like vinyl records. It has also been testing serving alcohol in some of its cafes and has experimented with adding full-service restaurants in select locations. The book market has partially gone digital, but many readers still prefer physical books. But a desire for physical ownership of media may not translate into the video game space, where digital downloads now allow companies to bypass retailers altogether. That's good new for the publishers and consumers, since in theory, by cutting out the middleman, a game publisher could charge less while making more -- but it's very bad news for Gamestop. That's a slowly developing story, as internet connection speeds and console storage capacities will keep some percentage of game sales in physical discs and cartridges for at least a while. Long term, though, this trend is and will remain a major problem for Gamestop, which saw its shares close at $21.61 on June 30, an 11% drop from the $24.46 where they ended 2016, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Like the other two retailers discussed above, Gamestop is not sitting idly by while its business goes away. Instead, the company has fought to build its own digital download platform and has expanded into the wireless device business, a niche in which people still tend to shop in stores. All three of these chains have been struggling for years, not just a quarter or two, and they are all making big changes. Barnes & Noble and Gamestop may survive -- and recent results suggest they will -- but they will emerge from the crisis as smaller companies. Target's future remains a major wild card. The company has to keep up with two massive competitors in Amazon and Wal-Mart, which will be a serious challenge for a brand that has lost some of its identity and cachet in recent years. The changes the retailer is making to its model and its efforts to improve its digital offering seem promising, but they have yet to be proven out in actual application. ","

See also: Amazonâs ability to dominate multiple industries scares competitors like Netflix In the past, these companies were able to dominate their sector by controlling how the goods were distributed and placed on the shelf at retail stores. With prime presentation in stores, the companies would spend heavily on marketing, which made up 20% to 25% of their budgets, to influence consumersâ buying decisions. Now, instead of fighting for shelf space, Cakmak says the companies appear to be scaling back spending. In his quarterly check with major advertising agencies, he found that consumer packaged-goods companies were spending less on marketing. More worrying were reports that these companies were more focused on protecting the bottom line, rather than investing in growth and new innovative strategies to combat the online models. âWe donât know where the bottom is, but itâs not looking good,â Cakmak wrote.

                                  Â  2014 case can move forward. Twitter and other technology companies are barred from releasing the exact number of requests they get related to national security, and Twitter is arguing that this violates its First Amendment rights. Twitter has been publishing transparency reports since 2012 on both the governmental and nongovernmental requests its receives to remove content or disclose information about an account, among other requests. In the reports, Twitter can only use broad number ranges related to national security requests, which is an administrative subpoena from the government, and FISA warrant, which are surveillance warrants granted under the United State Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. See also:  Twitter considers adding feature to flag fake news: Washington Post The government has argued that technology companies need to use broad number ranges because releasing data on the number of requests âwould impair national security interests and is properly classified.â However, the judge found that the government has not yet proved that the disclosure would be a âgrave and serious threat of damage to national security,â and allowed the case to move forward. âThe Governmentâs restrictions on Twitterâs speech are content-based prior restraints subject to the highest level of scrutiny under the First Amendment,â the order states. The case began in 2014 under then-Attorney General Eric Holder, but has since been transferred to current Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

                                  Â  third annual Prime Day will begin and the online retailer will reveal more than 100,000 deals, with new ones posted every five minutes for 30 hours straight. The flash deals are available to subscribers to Amazonâs Prime membership, which costs $99 a year. The company also offers a free trial of the membership for 30 days, but users have to sign up before or on July 11 to use it. If youâre hoping to score some cheap products from the sale, here are six things to keep in mind: 1. Let AI be your personal shopper Amazon is investing more than ever in artificial intelligence technologies, and consumers are in turn seeing more highly personalized deals. This year, Amazon will let Prime members customize their deals based on most-shopped-for themes like âshutterbugsâ and âsports enthusiasts,â a spokeswoman from Amazon said. This is good news for customers looking to save, said David Steinberg, founder and chief executive officer of retailer analytics company Zeta Global. âInstead of going through hundreds of thousands of products you are going to find those that are most right for you based on what youâve purchased, what youâve reviewed positively, and whatâs in your cart,â he said. âThere are few companies out there that do a better job of finding what you want to buy.â 2. If something you want is sold out, wait 15 minutes If a product you hoped to buy runs out, or shows it is â100% claimedâ donât be afraid to jump on the waiting list to be alerted if it returns. With âlightning deals,â products will be moved to the cart of the next person online if another shopper has them in their cart for longer than 15 minutes. Similarly, if you have a product in your cart, be sure to check out within 15 minutes to clinch in the deal. 3. Use online tracking machines Plug purchases into online tracking machine CamelCamelCamel to see if youâre really getting the cheapest price for your goods. The free search engine tracks the history of a productâs price on Amazon as well as whether other companies sell the same product for cheaper. Similarly, shoppers can plug links into Fakespot.com to find the quality and authenticity of reviews based on language and reviewer history. 4. Ask Alexa Amazon is pushing its voice-activated assistant this Prime Day with a number of special deals. In fact, Alexa owners have already had exclusive access to more discounts than other Amazon customers and will continue to throughout the next few days. Prime users who shop using Alexa will be given more discounts and shopping privileges. âIf you have an Alexa device, youâre going to get access before everyone else,â CouponFollowâs Chief Strategy Officer Michael Parrish Dudell said. 5. Give back while you buy Amazon is often accused of picking on the little guy, but this year 40% off its lightning deals during Prime Day will come from small businesses. Users can also donate a portion of the profit generated from their purchases to a charity of their choice by shopping through Amazon Smile, which donates 0.5% of customerâs purchases to a charity of their choice. âThis is a good way to shop and make it not just about you on Prime Day, but make it about supporting small businesses and non-profits youâd like to get behind,â said Dudell. 6. Look for deals at Amazonâs competitors While the best deals from Amazon are reserved for those who have a Prime membership account, there are ways for non-Prime customers to leverage the retail holiday for their own benefit, said Dudell. Major retailers like J.C. Penney

Shoshanna Delventhal,07202017,Investopedia,07132017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs After Amazon.com Inc.âs (AMZN) major swoop into the retail food industry with its $13.7 billion bid forÂ Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM) last month, traditional industry players have seen their shares take a hit. As investors questionÂ brick-and-mortar retailersâ ability to stay afloat in a space disrupted by the rapid expansion of ecommerce, analysts indicate it is time for companies such as Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and the Kroger Co. (KR) to prove they have a viable strategy to combat the Seattle-based giant. One former Amazon executive makes the case that a megadeal between Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart and membership-only wholesale chain Costco could slow the online retail leader. Ex-Amazon exec Brittain Ladd told The Street, âa player like Walmartâs Jet.com has the potential to affect Amazon, but no one has the potential to dethrone Amazon.â After the AMZN-WFM deal, Ladd, who most recently served as senior manager of Amazon Global Logistics Special Projects Unit, says Wal-Martâs best option could be an outright acquisition of Costco. The industry executive says Walmart has been struggling even harder in the recent period as rivals Target Corp. (TGT), Amazon and Costco attract the bulk of wealthier shoppers. As Amazon steals the spotlight and dominates Street sentiment, a shocking bid could be just what Wal-Mart needs to garnerÂ renewed enthusiasm. âThe main difference between Walmart and Amazon is that Walmart sells groceries, while Amazon changes consumer behavior,â Ladd told The Street. Ladd echoes Wall Street sentiment in warning that Amazonâs recent growth is just the beginning. He proposes that traditional retailers muster up the courage to make bold M&A moves to hedge against Amazonâs momentum. If not, the former Amazon manager says the firm will undoubtedly become the largest company on earth and dominate retail and many other areas, including banking and pharmaceuticals.

Thomas Franck,07202017,CNBC,07132017,"Fears of a death by Amazon may be overstated in shares of the few companies that can effectively resist the Jeff Bezos-led juggernaut, according to a team of Jefferies analysts. ""Amazon's planned purchase of Whole Foods further widened the valuation spread between consumer stocks the markets views as resistant to the AMZN threat and those viewed as vulnerable,"" the analysts wrote. ""That's opened up opportunities."" They cited stocks including Wal-Mart and Foot Locker as ""overly discounting the [Amazon] risk."" Amazon recently announced a $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods, sending shock waves across the grocery and retail sectors as fears of competition from the e-commerce giant swept the markets. But Jefferies analyst Dan Binder suggests that Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods is a concession that physical storefronts are actually important. ""The Whole Foods acquisition as a tacit admission by Amazon that a brick and mortar retail foot print is important in retail,"" according to Jefferies. ""Walmart's prices are currently more competitive and the company is planning for additional price investment in the coming years and is raising the quality of its private label offering."" Binder noted that only 12 percent of domestic Walmart stores are within five miles of a Whole Foods. Walmart shares are off by 5 percent since the Whole Foods-Amazon deal was announced. In the grocery industry, analyst Chris Mandeville notes that Amazon's involvement in Whole Foods is likely to play out slowly, focused on reducing unit growth and gradually lowering shelf prices to test consumer demand. If Mandeville is correct, he believes ""Kroger is capable of minimizing its margin risk through operational efficiencies in the intermediate term while M&A is a longer term option. Additionally, a less aggressive AMZN/WFM combo should provide Kroger with greater time to further roll out its ClickList concept as well as explore alternative delivery programs."" Kroger shares have lost nearly a quarter of their value since the Whole Foods deal. Wal-Mart, Kroger, Foot Locker, Sprouts in June The analyst also points out that Sprouts Farmers Market  (SFM) may be well-positioned to continue capturing market share. ""While in its nascent stages, the news of AMZN/WFM should accelerate SFM's online/digital and force greater adoption of utilizing data analytics,"" he added. Specialty retail analyst Randy Konik believes worries around Foot Locker are ""overblown,"" creating an irrational sell-off in the shares. The shoe store is ""insulated from the threats of Amazon â¦ as it is a destination in the mall and one of the few retailers that has been experiencing largely positive traffic,"" the team wrote. Foot Locker's stock price has fallen over 30 percent year to date with the decline accelerating after news of a direct selling partnership between Nike and Amazon.

Paayal Zaveri,07202017,CNBC,07132017,"The city of Tracy, California, is flanked by clusters of warehouses on its east and west sides. The names on the buildings are familiar: Amazon, Costco, FedEx, Safeway, Crate and Barrel and others. Located in California's Central Valley, Tracy's proximity to the San Francisco Bay Area has turned it into a prime spot for distribution hubs, and it's not alone. With the boom in e-commerce and online shopping, companies have flocked to areas like the Central Valley, the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania, central New Jersey and Dallas, Texas, to build their distribution and fulfillment centers. All these regions are close to major metropolitan areas and major roadways. For the residents of these regions, it means new job opportunities as an entire industry around e-commerce takes shape. Tracy Mayor Robert Rickman said the benefits of this boom are widespread. ""The people who come to our jobs here in Tracy are not just from Tracy, but all throughout the region, and it increases our daytime population and in turn attracts other businesses here â restaurants, retail and commercial,"" Rickman said. ""It's a trickling effect."" Tracy is close to major highways, the Port of Oakland and a nearby airport, making it an ideal location for e-commerce facilities, Rickman said. ""The distribution centers and fulfillment centers can ship their goods pretty much anywhere from here in a very short amount of time."" Over the last five years, fulfillment and distribution centers have created about 10,000 new jobs in San Joaquin County, according to research from Dr. Jeffrey Michael at the University of the Pacific's Center for Business and Policy Research. In the past, agriculture and food manufacturing were Tracy's main industries. City officials expect the growth in fulfillment jobs to continue, largely led by Amazon. Amazon's plan to create 100,000 new jobs over the next year has a tangible impact in Tracy; a second Amazon fulfillment center is currently under construction. The existing facility is the largest in California and also runs a management training program, creating some management level positions. These new centers are much different than traditional warehouses, and require much more manpower, said Richard H. Thompson of JLL, a commercial real estate firm. Jobs here often offer better pay and require more technical skills than more traditional jobs in warehousing and distribution since more precision is needed to meet customers' orders versus large bulk orders. Don Cunningham, the President & CEO of the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation, says average pay for a fulfillment job in cities in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley is about $15 per hour, much higher than retail or fast food jobs in the region. ""This new industry requires a lot of labor right now,"" he said. The economic benefits are pouring into the cities as well. In Tracy, sales tax revenues went up 35 percent, helping the city build parks and improve infrastructure. Large warehouses like Amazon and Walmart also generate a lot of property tax revenue for the cities they're located in, said John Boyd of The Boyd Company. Tracy's not alone. Fresno, another city in the Central Valley of California, has gotten more requests from companies wanting to set up facilities in the last two years than over the past 10 years combined, according to Lee Ann Eager from the Fresno Economic Development Corporation. ""It's putting thousands of people to work who are either unemployed or underemployed,"" she said. ""It's essentially a new industry for people in this region.""

Rebecca Ungarino,07202017,CNBC,07132017,"Ahead of Microsoft's quarterly earnings report due out on Thursday after the market close, one macro strategist is marking the stock as a buy. The legacy technology company has seen a strong long-term trend, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management. Even if Microsoft sees a short-term decline here, it's still going to present a good buying opportunity as a good ""relative value bet,"" he said Wednesday. ""One of the key things to watch for is how successful Microsoft is going to be in the future in converting consumers to a subscription model. Generally, most of the analysts expect Microsoft to come in strong in this quarter, but we're going to be watching the numbers. And, the more important point here is that the longer-term trend for Microsoft is very positive,"" Schlossberg said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation,"" adding that the stock is quite cash-heavy and is still very undervalued relative to its peers. Bolstering Schlossberg's bullish outlook is the company's ability to evolve in recent years from a software enterprise business to one reliant on subscription revenue and cloud services. ""Instead of trying to capture revenue all the way up front, they made a very astute business decision to try to capture revenue every single year by locking customers in to their Office 365 product,"" he said. Persuading consumers to upgrade to a subscription model for Office 365 services has been a weak spot for the company, though, Schlossberg said, as Google's suite of office tools could present competition. ""Microsoft appears to be a very strong trade still for the next several years as this business change continues to develop,"" Schlossberg said. The stock was trading modestly higher on Wednesday.

 ,07202017,CNBC,07132017,"The U.S. Consumer Price Index was forecast to rise 0.2 percent in June, after edging up 0.1 percent a month earlier. U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in June as the cost of gasoline and mobile phone services declined further, pointing to benign inflation that could cast doubts on the Federal Reserve's ability to increase interest rates for a third time this year. The Labor Department said on Friday that the unchanged reading in its Consumer Price Index followed a 0.1 percent dip in May. The lack of a rebound in the CPI in June could trouble Fed officials who have largely viewed the recent moderation in price pressures as transitory. In the 12 months through June, the CPI increased 1.6 percent - the smallest gain since October 2016 - after rising 1.9 percent in May. The year-on-year CPI has been softening steadily since February, when it hit 2.7 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI edging up 0.1 percent last month and climbing 1.7 percent from a year ago. The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, edged up 0.1 percent in June, rising by the same margin for three straight months.

Forget the difference in market caps. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are fierce rivals. The fact that Wal-Mart is valued nearly four times greater than CVS doesn't change that fact one bit. You can also forget that Wal-Mart stock has racked up solid gains so far this year, while CVS Health stock hasn't. When it comes to investing, the past isn't nearly as important as the future.Â Which of these two stocks is the better choice for investors over the long run? Here's how CVS Health and Wal-Mart compare. Image source: The Motley Fool. These aren't the greatest times for CVS Health. The pharmacy services company had its lunch handed to it by rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) in the second half of 2016. Walgreens took two big pharmacy contracts away from CVS Health. In a way, though, these setbacks make CVS Health a more intriguing investment option. As a direct result of the Walgreens wins, CVS stock sank like a brick. Its share price still hasn't rebounded much. That's not good, but it makes CVS Health's valuation look more attractive than it's been in a while. Shares now trade at only 12 times expected earnings. While losing business caused CVS Health to cut its revenue outlook, the company's long-term prospects seem to be solid. CVS is probably best-known as the nation's largest pharmacy retail chain. It also owns Omnicare, the largest provider of pharmacy services to long-term care organizations. These businesses should grow over the long run as more Americans age and require more prescription drugs. CVS Health also ranks as the second-largest pharmacy benefits manager (PBM). The company's PBM business segment help control prescription drug costs for employers, insurers, and government agencies. Demographic trends in the U.S. along with increasing prescription drug spending should help drive demand for CVS Health's PBM services. Wall Street analysts project that CVS Health should be able to grow annual earnings by nearly 8% over the next five years. The company itself is shooting for average earnings-per-share growth of around 10% over the long term, boosted by share buybacks. On top of this growth, CVS Health offers a solid dividend with a current yield of 2.57%. The company has expressed its commitment to dividend hikes in the future. With a low payout ratio of 37%, CVS Health should be able to deliver on its promise. Image source: The Motley Fool. While CVS Health stock has stumbled, Wal-Mart stock has marched steadily ahead. And it's done so despite relatively slow revenue growth and earnings declines over the last three years. There were two key reasons why earnings have dropped. First, Wal-Mart restructured the wage structure for its associates. Second, the company has invested in digital retail and information technology. However, both of these factors should help Wal-Mart compete more effectively in the future. Wall Street expects Wal-Mart will indeed return to earnings growth in the years ahead, with projections of average annual earnings increases of nearly 6%. That investment in technology already appears to be paying off to some extent. In the first quarter of this year, Wal-Mart reported a 69% increase in e-commerce sales worldwide and 63% growth in the U.S. Wal-Mart's latest acquisition shows how seriously the company is taking e-commerce. In June, the company announced its plans to buy upscale men's clothing retailer Bonobos for $310 million. This move will give Wal-Mart another foot into a premium market that's much different from its core low-price market. If you're looking for perhaps the best reason to buy Wal-Mart stock, check out its cash flow. Last year, the company generated free cash flow of $20.9 billion -- up 31% from the previous year. That strong cash flow not only allows Wal-Mart to fund acquisitions and reinvest in improving operations, but it also enables the company to fund a solid dividend. Wal-Mart's dividend yield currently stands at 2.67%, with a low payout ratio of less than 46%. As big as CVS Health is, compared to Wal-Mart, the matchup looks like David versus Goliath. We know who won that battle. The two companies stack up fairly evenly on their dividends. However, CVS Health should enjoy higher growth in the next few years. It's also more attractively valued right now.Â I think CVS Health is the better pick for investors. There's one thing to keep in mind with CVS and Wal-Mart, though: Both companies have to watch out for competition from a certain e-commerce company named after a South American river. While Wal-Mart faces the greater threat right now, CVS Health won't be immune from competition should Amazon.com enter the pharmacy market. ","

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,07202017,Fool,07132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dow giants Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) have each, in their own way, used the big-box retailing concept to devastate their competition over the years. Wal-Mart employs a focus on low prices to protect its dominant market share while Home Depot's product authority keeps it growing faster than national threats like Lowe's. Judging by the gap in stock valuations, investors are far more optimistic about Home Depot's business today. Below, we'll look at why the home improvement giant looks like the better stock toÂ buy right now. Here are a few key statistics to get us started: Metric Wal-Mart Home Depot Market cap $223 billion $181 billion Sales growth 1.4% 5.6% Net profit margin 2.8% 8.4% Dividend yield 2.8% 2.3% Return on invested capital 15% 31% Price-to-sales ratio 0.47 1.92 Price-to-earnings ratio 17 23 52-week price performance (1%) 13% Data sources: Company financial filings.Â Operating data is for the past complete fiscal year. Home Depot wins the operating trends matchup across the board. Its nearly 6% jump in comparable-store sales growth last year was four times the 1.4% boost that Wal-Mart managed. The company is far more profitable, too, as it turned 8.4% of its sales into net income, compared to 2.8% for the retailing titan. Image source: Getty Images. The most recent business results paint a similar picture, but suggest Wal-Mart may be gaining a slight edge in terms of momentum. Customer traffic improved by 1.4% in its U.S. locations last quarter to nearly match Home Depot's 1.6% uptick. Wal-Mart's traffic growth has been accelerating for two years whereas Home Depot's is headed in the other direction, falling from the 4% rate the retailer enjoyed in 2015 to 3% last year and now to below 2% so far in 2017. Home Depot has more than made up for that decline through far higher spending per visit, and that's a big reason why the company is outgrowing its industry peers by a wide margin and soaking up market share. Wal-Mart can't say the same thing about its own growth pace. Neither company is a slouch on capital allocation, and direct cash makes up a significant chunk of overall shareholder returns. Yet Home Depot comes out ahead in important ways here, too. Its 31% return on invested capital makes it one of the most efficient businesses on the entire market and is more than double Wal-Mart's result. HD Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts. That gap has helped the company hike both share repurchase spending and dividend payouts at a faster pace, although Wal-Mart currently sports the fatter yield of almost 3%. Home Depot's recent stock price growth is likely a reflection of its brighter growth outlook. A wide range of metrics, including home prices, home improvement spending, and household formation rates all point to an above-average expansion rate for its industry. And, as the clear leader, it is well positioned to grab more than its fair share of those gains. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, is far more exposed to a broader retailing industry that's slowing as consumers move their shopping to online channels. In exchange for that weaker outlook, investors are being quoted a sharp discount for Wal-Mart shares today. In fact, its price-to-earnings ratio of 17 makes it one of the cheapest on the Dow by that metric. Thus, if your biggest concern is overpaying for a stock, you'll want to stay away from Home Depot, especially given the potential that its streak of market-thumping growth could come to a surprising end over the next few quarters. But if you're willing to pay a premium for businesses with stellar operating and financial trends, then Home Depot is the stock to buy today. ","

A full transcript follows the video. Chris Hill: Let's get to the stocks on our radar this week. Our man, Steve Broido, will hit you with a question from the other side of the glass. David Kretzmann, you're up first. What are you looking at? David Kretzmann: I'm looking at Camping World Holdings, ticker CWH. RV sales in the U.S. are actually hitting the highest levels they've ever been at in about 40 years. As more baby boomers are retiring and younger people are trying to travel more while they're still young and working, RV sales are continuing to increase each year here in the U.S. Camping World Holdings is essentially the largest national retailer of RVs. They have 130 stores in 36 states, and they also own the Good Sam Club, which you can think of as the RV industry's membership club, kind of the AAA for RVs, and they have 1.7 million members in the Good Sam Club, which provides some high-margin recurring revenue for the company and keeps that relationship with their customers over time. There's a lot of mom-and-pop operators in this space, so what Camping World can do is acquire those mom-and-pop brands, rebrand them, and build this national RV brand under Camping World. So a lot of things to like here. It's a small cap, but I'm keeping a close eye on it. Hill: Steve, question about Camping World Holdings? Steve Broido: I'm legitimately fascinated with RVs. I have looked at them online. It's an interesting, interesting, interesting place to look, by the way. Would you go with a fifth wheel or a motor home? What are you going with? Kretzmann: Man, I am not an expert there, Steve. It depends on your respective circumstances. Broido: I'm going fifth wheel. Kretzmann: Fifth wheel, that sounds good. Hill: Jason Moser, what are you looking at? Jason Moser: Yeah, looking at Wayfair earnings coming out on Aug. 8. Ticker is W. I've been covering this business since it IPOed in 2014. It continues to perform, and all of the metrics seem to be going in the right direction. They're growing sales; they're growing users; margins are actually pretty steady. The big metric there is the percentage of orders from repeat customers, and that continues to appreciate over time. So then it's going to be a question of whether they can pull back on that acquisition at some point and really unleash some profitability in the business. There was a report of AmazonÂ jumping into this line of work a month or so ago. It doesn't seem like that may be the Wayfair killer others thought it might be. But very interested in their quarter here. Hill: Steve, question about Wayfair? Broido: Is there a membership model in place here? Maybe like Restoration HardwareÂ has done, where you become a member and you get a discount? That kind of thing? Moser: There is not yet. I do believe they have something in the mix there to try to develop a little bit more loyalty. Hill: Matty Argersinger, what are you looking at? Matt Argersinger: One stock recently on my watch list is Live Nation Entertainment. The ticker is LYV. Yes, music streaming has been around for years. We talk about things like virtual reality. But in my mind, you just can't replace the experience of going to a live concert or sports event. Live Nation is the largest events, promotion ticketing company in the world. Last year, they promoted 26,300 events; 71 million fans came and attended. They also own Ticketmaster, by the way, which is the largest ticketing company in the world -- 480 million tickets last year. I just think there's a lot going for this company, and I like the idea of a live events business in this Amazon-disrupted world we're living in right now. Hill: Steve, question about Live Nation Entertainment? Broido: It's a question for Matt. What's the best concert you've ever attended? Argersinger: Oh my gosh. I'm going to go old school. I went to Bruce Springsteen about 15 years ago, right out of college. It was one of the best times I've ever had. Hill: What about you, Steve? Broido: I'm going with The Cure. I saw The Cure in 1989, Disintegration Tour, it was really solid. Hill: Three stocks. You got one you want to add to your watch list? Broido: I'm going camping, man. Kretzmann: All right! Broido: I'm buying an RV. Let's do it. Kretzmann: Sounds good, Steve. Hill: Kretzmann going to do the cooking for you on that trip? Broido: I hope so. Kretzmann: We'll go to Chipotle. ","

Motley Fool Staff,07202017,Fool,07132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Jeff Bezos and company keep steamrolling ahead, and not just in the United States. The Fools talk international, the Echo Show, Target's (NYSE:TGT) upgraded guidance, and e-commerce more broadly. Plus, they discuss the direction of commercial real estate, and one company picking up a fair amount of the space that was left empty with so many retailers shrinking their brick-and-mortar footprints. A full transcript follows the video. Chris Hill: From big banks to big retail, in this case AmazonÂ (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Target, Amazon Prime Day resulted in the biggest single day of sales ever for Amazon. This comes the same week that Target CEO Brian Cornell raised guidance for the retailer, citing higher traffic in their stores. Matty, let's start with Amazon. Forget Black Friday, forget Cyber Monday. It really does seem like Prime Day is the most important day for them. Matt Argersinger: Right. Based on the expected growth rate of 60%, Amazon probably pulled in almost a billion dollars. Not bad for a random Tuesday in July. No, this has become a big event. It started out a couple years ago as, ""It's the 20th anniversary of Amazon; let's have some special discounts for Prime members."" Hill: And by the way, it didn't go that well. Argersinger: No, not initially. I remember the site being down for several hours during that first time they did it. But it's now become this phenomenon. Of course, for Amazon, it really is about getting people to join Prime, experience what they can get on Prime. And for me, I'm really watching how people are interacting with Amazon Fresh and the household-staples part of the business. I think Amazon's goal is to get more and more people into that, realizing that's how they can steal a lot more market share from grocery stores, et cetera. David Kretzmann: Yeah, I remember in previous years, other retailers, I think Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT)Â and Target included, tried to have their own competition against Prime Day on Prime Day to try to steal some of that share from Amazon, and that didn't really happen this year, but I'm just thinking back to the first quarter of this year, where Wal-Mart's online sales grew 69%, Target's online sales grew 22%, which pales in comparison to what Wal-Mart and Amazon are putting up. I would be curious to see what those online numbers look like for retailers like Wal-Mart and Target coming up. Hill: Again, you go back two years to when they first did this, as you said, Matty, the site was down, they got some criticism, and I think it was fair, in terms of a little bit of bait-and-switch going on, in terms of the products they were promoting that sold out very quickly, that sort of thing. But Jason, in just two years' time, as we should expect with Jeff Bezos and his team, they've really got it down pat now. You look at what they're promoting this time around; it's very much the Echo, and it really does telegraph where they see that device in people's homes and what it means for Amazon's business. Jason Moser: Yeah, and the pace they're rolling out in new apps and skills for the Echo, it's very impressive. I really feel like we're going to need to get an Echo show at our house just to test it out, for sheer selfless market research, Chris, I may have to buy one of those and come back and tell you how that thing works. Because I do like the Echo in our house. We have a Dot as well. It's neat to see its functionality. I think the Echo Show gives them an opportunity to incorporate a bit more e-commerce. I think that's maybe one of the holdups there in making purchases with the Echo -- you're not quite sure what exactly you're getting; you can't make that visual confirmation. But I also think with Prime Day, it's really important to note that this is beyond just our domestic economy. It's very easy for us to look at it from a U.S.-centric perspective. But really, this rolled out Prime Day to 13 countries this year. This is where I think the real opportunity for Amazon still exists. They're investing so much in those international operations, and they're delivering those operating losses today. But remember 10 years ago, that's what it looked like here. So it's not too big of a leap to think that in 10 years, they're going to have a very impressive global e-commerce infrastructure and operation going that could reward shareholders for many years to come. Argersinger: You could see, as big as Prime Day was, maybe a billion in sales for Amazon, it pales in comparison to Singles Day in China, which is an Alibaba phenomenon on Nov. 11 every year, where they did $18 billion in sales. And I'm just wondering if Jeff Bezos was thinking to himself, ""Prime Day, eventually I think could be this worldwide thing where we pull in tens of billions of dollars in sales, and this is just the start of it."" Moser: It's a nice lever to pull! Hill: In some ways, probably not as surprising that they had this big of a day when you think about what Target did, just in terms of retail, David. Target's news this week, the guidance raise, the subsequent pop in Target's stock, it was almost like a sigh of relief on Wall Street, because for all of Amazon's success, Target is still a big player in this space, as is Wal-Mart, as is Costco. So you look at Costco's recent June sales, Target raising their guidance -- Amazon has a bright future, but these bricks and mortar power players are doing pretty well. Kretzmann: I think Wal-Mart especially, they've made numerous acquisitions, including Jet.com and Bonobos, another fashion online retailer that they bought within the last couple months. As I mentioned, their online sales in the latest quarter were up almost 70%, which is phenomenal. And they have almost the same amount of items on their platform online compared to Amazon, so they're making a lot of progress there. Target is more treading water, I think, even though their online sales were up 22% in the latest quarter. Compared to what Amazon in Wal-Mart are dealing with, Target is going to have to step up their game, and I think there's still a lot of questions there, even with their slightly raised guidance for this upcoming quarter. Argersinger: So Target is all excited about their restock program, which is, essentially, next-day delivery service that they're rolling out or testing in Minneapolis. Compare that to Prime, where you get same-day delivery in 5,000 cities around the world, and here's Target, ""We're testing next-day delivery in Minneapolis."" Kretzmann: Revolutionary! [laughs] Argersinger: ""We're excited about what this could do for our business."" You guys are 10 years behind by now. Hill: They get a lot of snow up there, though. You can't expect everything the same day. Argersinger: That's true. Hill: David, you and I were talking before we started taping today. One of the ripple effects -- and we don't really get into it all that much on this show -- you think about commercial real estate, when we look at the big retail trends, and a lot of well-known retailers closing stores and, in some cases, going out of business. In some cases, all of a sudden, that commercial real estate becomes really cheap. You mentioned something that really surprised me, which is that T-Mobile, of all companies, has opened a thousand locations so far in 2017. How have they done that? Kretzmann: Apparently they're finding someplace to put those stores. Maybe they're filling up the space that's opening up as all these other retailers and restaurants close up shop. They initially had guided to open a thousand new stores total in 2017. This is coming off a base of 2,000 stores at the end of last year. But they hit that mark earlier this week. By the middle of the year, essentially, they reached that mark, and now they're saying, ""We're going to open 1,500 total stores this year."" Their existing store base now covers about two-thirds of the U.S., and now this will really help boost their store coverage outside of the main metro areas in the country. This is a company that has, over the past four years, each quarter they've added at least one million new customers, stealing customers from VerizonÂ and AT&TÂ bit by bit. They also have a record low churn rate as of the latest quarter. So, a lot of things going well for T-Mobile. They're in full-on expansion mode. ","
      
    Prime Day Was Amazon's Best Day Ever, but Target and Wal-Mart Aren't Hurting -- The Motley Fool

Kline,07202017,Fool,07132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Some brick-and-mortar retailers seem fascinated with the idea that people want to drive to their stores, but don't actually want to leave their cars in order to pick up their order. It's a concept Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has slowly added to its grocery business and oneÂ TargetÂ (NYSE:TGT) has already tried once, then dropped.Â Now, despite the initial failure, the fast-evolving department store has begun testing curbside pickup once again. Image source: Target. ""We certainly see the potential in a broader rollout,"" he said. ""In the coming months, we hope to make it guest facing."" Brick-and-mortar retailers are trying to leverage the one advantage they have over digital-only rivals: physical stores. The advantage of having stores is that people can get immediate gratification. The problem is that online retailers, specifically Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), have steadily decreased how long it takes an order to arrive. The online shopping leader has made two-day shipping a standard and it offers one-day delivery for a modest fee on many items. In some markets Amazon even offers one- and two-hour delivery. Fast delivery times plus a customer not having to leave the comfort of their home removes incentive for people to visit stores. Because of that, brick-and-mortar chains have tried to come up with ways for shoppers to have their cake and eat it, too. Wal-Mart specifically has increased its efforts to facilitate in-store pickup of online orders with its new Pickup Tower. Business Insider describes the towers as large kiosks; ""To use the tower, customers scan a barcode on their purchase receipt. Within 45 seconds, a door on the machine opens, and the items appear on a conveyer belt."" The tower and Target's designated parking spots aim to take the confusion out of where to pick up digital orders in their stores. As Amazon, Wal-Mart, and maybe even Target speed up how fast online orders are delivered to customers' homes, the value of wringing incremental convenience out of stores becomes smaller. It's mildly more convenient to pick up an order curbside than it is to leave the car and pick it up in the store, but both remain much harder than letting the post office or another delivery service do the work for you. This isn't fast-food chains offering online ordering. That service solves a number of actual pain points. It eliminates waiting in line and it removes the possibility of human error in order taking. A digitally ordered half-caf, soy, two-pump, sugar-free vanilla latte is easy for a human to mishear or enter into the system wrong, but apps are generally infallible. Curbside pickup targets people who want their item or items right away, but don't want to leave their vehicle to get it or them. It's easy to see the value in that with groceries, a category still dominated by supermarkets and physical retailers. Those are large orders that take significant time to gather. Perhaps Target intends to add groceries or even its whole store to its online pickup program. That's easier said than done given that inventory systems have a hard time tracking items in real time. That means that while a store may show an item in stock in-store customers could empty the shelves before the digital order gets picked. Technical problems are solvable, but it still seems like curbside pickup (really in-parking-lot pickup in this case) may only have limited demand. Target deserves credit for experimenting, but the potential reward here seems small. The chain should work to further refine ordering online and picking up in store as Wal-Mart has done, but curbside may be a step too far. ","

Keith Speights,07202017,Fool,07132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. You know it's coming. Sooner or later, the current long-in-the-tooth bull market will end -- probably in tandem with an economic downturn. What will you do when it happens? For some, the answer is to panic. A better approach, though, is to take advantage of the opportunity to buy solid stocks at lower prices that should perform well over the long run. Three such stocks that would be great picks when the bull market fizzles are Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Wal-Mart StoresÂ (NYSE:WMT). Here's why. Image source: Getty Images. Celgene isn't the kind of stock that's immune to being dragged down in the midst of a broader market pullback. Between August 2008 and May 2009 -- the worst months of the economic crisis of the previous decade, the biotech's share price plunged more than 40%. However, Celgene should keep on making lots of money even if the market drops and the economy falters. Physicians won't stop prescribing the biotech's top drug, Revlimid, to patients with blood cancer. Celgene's other blockbuster drugs, Otezla and Pomalyst, shouldn't skip a beat, either. Image source: Getty Images. And the company certainly wouldn't slow down in rolling out its solid pipeline candidates. Ozanimod, which targets treatment of multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis,, and Crohn's disease, should become a massive success regardless of what the stock market does. So should blood cancer drug luspatercept and several other pipeline drugs. Celgene is in great shape to grow earnings by more than 20% over the next several years, whether those are good or bad years for the economy in general. The stock currently trades at 15 times expected earnings. If the bull market fizzles out, Celgene should be an even more attractive growth stock for the long run. Facebook could be negatively impacted during a market downturn that's linked to tough economic times. Advertising generates nearly all of the social media giant's revenue. Companies could cut back on advertising in a down economy. However, there's a potential positive for Facebook. People could spend more time on social media if they don't have as much disposable income to spend on entertainment. Increased traffic is good for Facebook. Advertisers typically pay when a person clicks on the ad. The more people on the company's social media sites, the more likely they are to click on the ads. Image source: Getty Images. Even if Facebook's share price fell in an overall market pullback, it's still a great long-term stock to own. The company has a natural growth opportunity by putting ads on its Messenger application. Considering that there are 1.2 billion users of Messenger, this could be huge for Facebook. Facebook stock is currently priced at nearly 27 times expected earnings. That might seem expensive. However, the company is expected to grow earnings by 26% annually in the coming years. This kind of growth makes Facebook's valuation more appealing. A drop in the share price would present a great opportunity to profit when the market rebounds. Wal-Mart stock wouldn't be spared from a general market pullback, either. However, if history is a guide, the retail giant's shareholders wouldn't feel as much pain as most investors would. Between August 2008 and May 2009, Wal-Mart stock only fell by 14% -- much less than the broader indexes. The company enjoys some level of insulation from bad economic times because it's known for low prices all the time. Consumers who might would shop elsewhere during strong economies could turn more to Wal-Mart when their finances are stretched. Image source: The Motley Fool. Some might worry about the threat that online competition presents to brick-and-mortar retailers like Wal-Mart. That is a real concern, but I think Wal-Mart is in a better position to fend off competition than most. Also, Wal-Mart isn't yielding the online market without a fight. In the first quarter of 2017, the company's e-commerce sales soared 63% compared to the prior-year period. Buying Wal-Mart at a discount during a market downturn would allow investors to profit from the eventual comeback. Also, it would enable locking in at a higher yield. Wal-Mart's dividend currently yields 2.76%. A decline in the stock could potentially push that yield up to 3% or more -- a quite attractive level for long-term investors. ","
      
    3 Stocks to Buy if the Bull Market Fizzles -- The Motley Fool

  "
Jeremy Bowman,07202017,Fool,07132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Blue Apron'sÂ (NYSE:APRN) turn in the spotlight hasn't been as glamorous as it had hoped. First, the nation's leading meal-kit provider was forced to slash its price offering price from $15 to $17 a share to just $10. Investors seemed nervous about the threat posed byÂ Amazon'sÂ (NASDAQ:AMZN) coming takeover ofÂ Whole Foods MarketÂ (NASDAQ:WFM)Â and other questions lingering about the company's business model. Shares of Blue Apron fell in six of its first eight sessions, dipping as low as $7.10, or 29% below its IPO price, with a market cap hovering around $1.5 billion, much less than its $2 billion valuation in a private funding round back in 2015. Image source: Blue Apron. It was a remarkable rejection for a company that has attracted so much attention from the media -- and the market -- as the meal kit industry has drawn in dozens of start-ups, with major supermarket chains and packaged food companies dabbling in it as well. As the biggest meal-kit provider in the U.S., and the first to go public, Blue Apron was supposed be feted by Wall Street, not spurned. Clearly, investors have turned sour on the recipe specialist, but it's too soon to call Blue Apron a dud. Here are three reasons the stock could bounce back. Blue Apron is the leader in a fast-growing industry, which makes the brand an attractive buyout target for a wide range of companies, including supermarket chains and private equity firms. Much like Amazon bought Whole Foods because it struggled to break into the grocery industry on its own, Amazon could turn around and acquire Blue Apron if the price is right.Â Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.Â (NYSE:WMT)Â also makes sense as a potential suitor. The retail giant has been snatching up e-commerce companies and is already the country's largest grocery seller. Considering Wal-Mart's economies of scale and distribution prowess, Blue Apron could be a perfect fit with its strategy as it seeks to scale up its e-commerce business and target a new customer base. The potential for outside interest should put a floor on the stock, which I'd estimate at around $5, or a market cap of around $1 billion. With revenue set to pass the billion-dollar mark this year, that would make Blue Apron exceptionally cheap for an e-commerce stock. The counterpoint to Blue Apron's being acquired is that the meal kit industry is likely to see consolidation in the coming years. With dozens of businesses operating in the sector, some will go bankrupt while others could be acquired, eliminating competition and allowing customers to concentrate in the hands of the remaining players who could build scale. Blue Apron could potentially be one of the acquirers, especially as struggling rivals would likely sell for cheap. Taking over smaller brands or merging with another large meal kit service like Plated or Hello Fresh could be an option for the company if sales growth flags and profits fail to materialize. It's still early days in the meal kit industry -- Blue Apron is just five years old -- and the upcoming consolidation in the sector will be a definite benefit for larger players such as Blue Apron. Some have argued that meal kits are a fad, but there are at least two important trends that should boost growth in the industry over the coming years. First, delivery is getting more popular. Dubbed the stay-at-home economy, companies that enable customers to get what they want without leaving the home are prospering. There's Amazon for pretty much anything you can think of;Â NetflixÂ for streaming TV shows and movies; and food delivery concepts likeÂ Domino's PizzaÂ andÂ Papa John's, whichÂ have thrived while other restaurants have faltered. Shares ofÂ GrubHubÂ (NYSE:GRUB), the restaurant delivery portal that would seem to offer many of the same benefits and risks as Blue Apron, were notably unchanged by the Amazon-Whole Foods announcement. Delivery is a core benefit of Blue Apron as it saves customers valuable time from having to visit the grocery store to shop for dinner, and that value should increase as demand for delivery grows. Second, healthy eating is on the rise, and cooking at home is generally healthier than eating from a restaurant, where you don't know what ingredients are in the food, and fat and sugar sources are often added to dishes. Blue Apron's meals also enable portion control and help eliminate food waste. Not all of its ingredients are organic, but many of them are. Â The company only uses beef, pork, and poultry without hormones, and it estimates that the standards for its meat are higher than more than 90% of what's sold.Â Â Its seafood is also sourced according to the standards set by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch. Those three factors alone won't make Blue Apron a success, but they should give investors some comfort as the business isn't the disaster the market seems to think it is right now. The company still needs to deliver strong revenue growth and work toward profitability, but the stock is stronger than investors have given it credit for thus far. ","

As we pass the halfway mark of 2017, the news that grocer Whole Foods Markets (NASDAQ:WFM) reached an agreement to be acquired by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been perhaps the biggest merger news of the year. After struggling for some time, Whole Foods shares have since soared to near the $42 acquisition price. WFM data by YCharts However, the prolonged, multi-year slump in Whole Foods stock that preceded the buyout news is also worth considering, even as investors focus on the potential the merger might unlock. It pays to consider the contrarian case for any prospective investment. So while I'm bullish on Amazon -- and now Whole Foods by extension -- let's review the potential risk factors and examine the case against Whole Foods as a part of Amazon. Though the reactions toward the deal were generally positive, they could be overblown. Looking at a number of analyst reports since the news broke on June 16,Â it becomes clear that the deal isn't a magic bullet for Amazon in regard to its longtime interests in the grocery space. The deal does give Amazon a toehold in the $647 billion market for U.S. edible groceries.Â But according to logistics consulting firm MWPVL International Inc., Amazon has only about one-tenth of the grocery-specific warehouse capacity of its chief retail rival,Â Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), and Whole Foods' relatively small footprint of 15 distribution centers does little to change the dynamic. In fact, one analysis suggested Amazon would need to build at least 12 more distribution centers throughout the U.S.Â to meaningfully close the gap between itself and Wal-Mart. Moreover, each warehouse constructed for handling perishables is much more complex -- and expensive -- than Amazon's standard distribution centers are, requiring as many as six refrigerated areas. These specialized grocery distribution centers can also require FDA clearance in some cases. The upshot is that Amazon will need to undertake another round of substantial investment to scale out its long-term vision for Whole Foods. In a similar vein, a research note from Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem noted that Amazon will also need to invest in a fleet of refrigerated delivery trucks to bring grocery delivery to a mass-market scale. Furthermore, Fadem estimates that entering the notoriously low-margin grocery business will do little to help Amazon's profit margin or improve Prime membership growth. So while buying Whole Foods helps Amazon move toward its goal of becoming the ""everything store,"" it doesn't win the battle for online retail supremacy. Image source: Amazon.com. At the same time, the Whole Foods acquisition is classic Amazon. It demonstrates Amazon's focus on winning over the long termÂ even if it raises questions about the near-term impact. For example, we already discussed the near-term investments necessary to scale Amazon's grocery efforts to a national level. That concern ties into a host of additional questions about the impact a new wave of major capital expenditures would have on Amazon's cash flow marginÂ and returns on capital over the next several years. From this perspective, Amazon and its shareholders would seem to have been better served by passing on a struggling grocery retailer like Whole Foods. But those sharing Amazon's long-term perspective would see the unappealing short-term effects as necessary steps toward strengthening Amazon's retail grasp. Like brick-and-mortar retail before it, the mass-market grocery retail business model hasn't undergone a paradigm shift since the rise of the supermarket, but emerging trends such as autonomous delivery drones and self-driving vehicles should help overcome many of the ""last mile"" pain points that have frustrated would-be innovators for years. By owning Whole Foods' brand, customer data, and infrastructure, Amazon inches one step closer to bringing these changes to fruition. ","
      
    Whole Foods Market, Inc.: The Bear Case From a Bull -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,07202017,Fool,07132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Some call it the retail apocalypse. That name reflects the massive turmoil in the sector, where many brick-and-mortar chains have been struggling in the face of ever-growing digital competition. Through the first six months of 2017 Target (NYSE:TGT), GameStop (NYSE:GME), andÂ Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS) have all fallen victim to the trend, and their shares have plummeted due to the changing operating environment. Consumers behavior is changing, which has impacted all three of these retailers in different ways. The underlying theme, though, is that shopping going digital has hurt them all. Target has been testing new store layouts and sizes. Image source:m Target. Shares in the discount store have sunk fairly steadily since the new year began, but they took a further hit when news broke that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was buying Whole Foods. Target stock closed 2016 at $70.80; it closed on June 30 at $52.29, a 26% drop,Â according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. That share price slide can be traced largely to the company's struggles to hold its ground against bigger rivals including Amazon and Wal-Mart. Though it's theÂ second-largest discount chain in the country, investors are likely wary about the chain's ability to keep up in this evolving marketplace. Those are concerns that Target is trying to address. The company has begun revamping many of its stores to make them more customer-friendly and has also begun adding more custom merchandise. This includes fashion-forward clothing lines and household goods that have proven popular in initial tests. The bookstore chain has been reeling pretty much since Amazon became a factor in the book business. As a larger share of book sales have moved to the e-book format -- an area where Barnes & Noble has a limited presence with its failed NOOK line -- the chain has struggled to remain relevant. Even though it has shown signs of stabilizing its business recently, shares remain down for the first half of the year. After closing 2016 at $10.60, they fell to $7.45 on June 30, a 29% drop, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Barnes & Noble has been making significant changes in search of a workable business model. These have included diversifying its merchandise into specialty toys and niches like vinyl records. It has also been testing serving alcohol in some of its cafes and has experimented with adding full-service restaurants in select locations. The book market has partially gone digital, but many readers still prefer physical books. But a desire for physical ownership of media may not translate into the video game space, where digital downloads now allow companies to bypass retailers altogether. That's good new for the publishers and consumers, since in theory, by cutting out the middleman, a game publisher could charge less while making more -- but it's very bad news for Gamestop. That's a slowly developing story, as internet connection speeds and console storage capacities will keep some percentage of game sales in physical discs and cartridges for at least a while. Long term, though, this trend is and will remain a major problem for Gamestop, which saw its shares close at $21.61 on June 30, an 11% drop from the $24.46 where they ended 2016, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Like the other two retailers discussed above, Gamestop is not sitting idly by while its business goes away. Instead, the company has fought to build its own digital download platform and has expanded into the wireless device business, a niche in which people still tend to shop in stores. All three of these chains have been struggling for years, not just a quarter or two, and they are all making big changes. Barnes & Noble and Gamestop may survive -- and recent results suggest they will -- but they will emerge from the crisis as smaller companies. Target's future remains a major wild card. The company has to keep up with two massive competitors in Amazon and Wal-Mart, which will be a serious challenge for a brand that has lost some of its identity and cachet in recent years. The changes the retailer is making to its model and its efforts to improve its digital offering seem promising, but they have yet to be proven out in actual application. ","
      
    Why Target, Gamestop, and Barnes & Noble Shares Have Tumbled in 2017 -- The Motley Fool

Rich Duprey,07202017,Fool,07132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Investors are walking on eggshells ahead of Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ:CALM) earnings report next week. It's expected to give an indication of just how low the egg industry has fallen. With its stock at levels not seen in three years, the fiscal 2017 fourth-quarter financial report will determine whether shares are scrambled further. Data source: Bureau of Labor Statistics. Chart by author. But that's the average. In some regional markets like the Southeast, the industry's Urner Barry price index showed large eggs falling as low as $0.86 per dozen earlier this year. The problem, of course, is the aftereffects of the avian flu outbreak in 2015 that devastated flocks of hen layers. The influenza virus is highly contagious and can cause entire flocks to become infected very quickly. The 2014-2015 outbreak of the H5N2 virus led to the slaughter of over 40 million birds, some 12% of the national laying flock. The loss of so many birds savaged huge swaths of the country's egg inventory and prices soared. BLS data shows the average price of a dozen eggs peaked at almost $3 in September 2015, but what surprised many was how rapidly the industry bounced back. The USDA reported flock sizes were quickly repopulated to near pre-outbreak levels, but unfortunately demand did not return with it and egg prices were pummeled. An outbreak again this past spring had producers worried it would be deja vu all over again, but this time it was quickly contained. Image source: Getty Images. Still, it's a problem for Cal-Maine, the country's largest egg producer, along with other farmers. Cal-Maine admits its operating results are significantly affected by the fluctuations that go on in the wholesale shell egg market, over which it has no control. Even small increases in production or decreases in demand can have a large adverse effect on shell egg prices. The impact was evident when Cal-Maine was forced to suspend its quarterly dividend payment after recording larger-than-expected fiscal first-quarter losses last September. While the situation hasn't improved in the two years following the end of the virus outbreak, CEO Adolphus Baker is hopeful the tide will turn. Bloomberg reports he noted at an analyst conference last month that the egg industry goes through boom and bust cycles periodically, and while ""high prices cure high prices"" because farmers increase their flock sizes, ""low prices also cure low prices"" as farmers reduce them. However, it might not be so easy this time. Egg producers remain under pressure to increase their cage-free flocks, with companies like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) pledging to go cage-free at its 16,000 restaurants within 10 years, and Taco Bell has already completed the task. And after McDonald's made its pledge, around 200 other companies followed suit, including Starbucks, PepsiCo, and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Image source: Getty Images. The move to cage-free eggs allows corporations to virtue signal how good they are, but conditions aren't really all that much better for the chickens, and consumers are still buying based on price -- leaving producers like Cal-Maine Foods caught in the middle. Wal-Mart accounts for 29% of total sales, making it all the more difficult for Cal-Maine. That's why Cal-Maine has been trying to build up its specialty egg business, which is much less volatile than the shell egg market. Where average prices of non-specialty eggs plunged almost 40% year over year last quarter, Cal-Maine's specialty egg prices were down just 5%. It says specialty eggs are now its primary growth strategy focus, and while they accounted for around 24% of its total sales volume last quarter -- the same as last year -- specialty egg revenue was 40% of total shell egg revenue compared to 31% a year ago. Don't expect Cal-Maine Foods to crow about a dramatic U-turn in its prospects in its coming earnings report. Despite the stock being down 20% so far this year, investors might not be clucking for long about its poor performance. Rich has been a Fool since 1998 and writing for the site since 2004.

The retail sector has been dealing with change, but the pace of that change is now picking up with e-commerce growing and pressuring more companies and categories every year, said the note. Even worse than the disruption it is causing is the fear of disruption, which is âcreating excessive dislocation,â it said. âIn this backdrop, WMT has seen the world quite clearly, pre-empting margin erosion and enabling investment as it lowered its U.S. margin in 2015-16, anticipating buy-online-pickup in-store as the most viable option for food e-commerce, and swapping its China online effort for a piece of JD,â said Fassler. Goldmanâs bullish call is also based on its expectation that EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) growth will resume in 2018 and the company will accelerate its share buyback program, boosting EPS growth. âWe have confidence in near-term sales and earnings visibility, but this call will only work if, for the first time in several years, WMT points to the pace of investment abating sufficiently to allow operating margin to hold as sales growth,â said the analysts. âWe believe this outcome is feasible.â Wal-Mart shares have gained about 10% in 2017 so far, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average

Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Going up against the internet giant does not necessarily mean itâs the end for Blue Apron, but it âmakes life hard,â said Max Wolff, market strategist at 55 Institutional. Amazon has a large economy of scale, meaning that the company can likely produce products at a lower cost, and has an advanced distribution network, which could be enhanced by its acquisition of Whole Foods.

On the other hand, Judge Graham, chief marketing officer of Ansira, a marketing agency, said while heâs generally âan optimistic guy,â he does see Amazonâs entrance into the space as a âpotential death sentenceâ for Blue Apron. âAmazon continues to dominate the direct consumer space,â Graham said. âThis is just one more avenue Amazon is going to go in and dominate.â Still, Wolff said he believes Blue Apron could combat the threat by becoming more âniche focusedâ or teaming up with another player, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Graham also sees potential if Blue Apron delivers better recipes or better quality of food, which is something the company touted in its prospectus. Meanwhile, the company needs to communicate better and prove to the public and investors that its business model will not be affected by Amazon. âI think the confidence is broken, so every possible setback gets an exaggerated importance,â Wolff said. Analysts have also been cautious on Blue Apron because of its subscription model, which has yet to prove whether itâs sustainable. It also has a high customer acquisition cost, which is a cost Amazon is unlikely to face as it already has an established base of Prime customers. A meal-kit offering would likely do well with this base of customers, who likely are already focused on convenience and quick delivery, said Jim Fosina, chief executive of Fosina Marketing Group. That base, in addition to Amazonâs ability to market should make Blue Apron and others âvery concerned,â he said. âThey have a installed base that mirrors the population of customers that are in the sweet spot of those interested in these services,â Fosina said. Shares of Blue Apron have fallen 21% month-to-date, while the S&P 500 index

The Toronto-based company, the majority of which Premier Kathleen Wynne sold off to bankroll transportation infrastructure, announced Wednesday it was purchasing Avista, which operates in Washington state, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska. âThis marks a proud moment for Canadian champions as we grow our business into a North American leader,â said Hydro One president and CEO Mayo Schmidt, who noted it would vault the firm into the continentâs top 20 electricity companies. Schmidt said the transaction âdemonstrates the power and value of the transition into an investor-owned utility, by allowing for healthy expansion into new lines of regulated utility business and new jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Pacific Northwest which is experiencing customer and economic growth.â It will have no effect on electricity rates in the province, which are regulated by the independent Ontario Energy Board. Energy Minister Glenn Thibeault, whose government has taken heat for privatizing Hydro One, said Queenâs Park was âpleasedâ by the acquisition, which is subject to approval by U.S. regulators. âIt is expected to deliver clear benefits for the companyâs customers, employees and shareholders, including the people of Ontario, given the governmentâs position as the single largest shareholder in Hydro One,â said Thibeault. âIn particular, we welcome the fact that this proposed acquisition will not impact the rates that Ontario customers pay. Neither will it have any impact on local jobs,â he said. After the deal closes by the middle of next year, the provinceâs stake in the company will drop to around 44 per cent. The Liberals have promised to retain at least 40 per cent of it. âAs the single largest shareholder in Hydro One, the Ontario government would benefit from the companyâs receipt of additional regulated returns expected to begin in 2019,â said Thibeault, stressing those proceeds are âabove and beyondâ the $9 billion government has already made from selling off the majority share in the utility. âOne of the benefits of broadening the ownership of Hydro One was to unlock the potential for precisely this sort of transaction.â Itâs unclear how large those returns would be, but it could be in the tens to hundreds of millions annually. Avista, which is based in Spokane, Washington, operates power plants fuelled by hydro, wind, biomass and coal. It provides electricity to 379,000 customers and natural gas to 342,000 households and businesses. The company said âno workforce reductions are anticipated as a result of this transaction for either Hydro One or Avista.â By next year, the expanded Hydro One will be a utility with more than $32.2 billion in assets, serving two million customers. Avistaâs president and CEO Scott Morris predicted the sale would be good for consumers. âThrough this agreement, we have a unique opportunity to secure a partnership that allows us to continue to define and control, to a significant degree, future operations and opportunities in a consolidating industry landscape for the benefit of our customers,â said Morris. âIn Hydro One, we believe weâve found a partner that allows us to preserve our identity and our proud legacy, while also preparing us for the future.â          Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

See also: Amazon âwill be a top 5 grocer in the U.S.â with Whole Foods acquisition Read also: Amazon Wardrobe is another blow to department stores The Echo Dot was this yearâs big Prime Day seller, according to Amazon, with other Alexa-enabled devices like Fire tablets also reaching record sales. The company as usual did not provide hard numbers. But a survey of Alexa-owning consumers conducted by LivePerson, a cloud-based software platform, on July 6 found that 71% of them have made at least one purchase using an Alexa voice command. And 46% of Alexa owners are repeat users. âAmazon was using Prime Day to educate shoppers how to use voice to buy things online,â said Ryne Misso, director of marketing at Market Track. âThe education around voice commerce in general on Prime Day was probably beneficial to them in terms of getting out in front of others.â Additional data from LivePerson shows that most Alexa device owners are using it to play music (82.9%), or set an alarm (64.7%) or timer (59.1). Nearly half (49.2%) said they were using it to add an item to a shopping cart, although the data does not indicate whether those transactions were completed. See also: These Amazon Prime Day best sellers could drive growth in a new kind of shopping âWith voice, what weâre seeing is them feeling the water out and showing consumers that voice is an easy way to shop,â said Misso. âItâs going to be a strange change of behavior.â Voice commerce may prove easier for shoppers to adopt because it brings together two things that people are already familiar with: digital shopping and communication through the spoken word. The key is making a habit of this change in behavior -- calling out an order rather than going to the store to get it. âItâs simple to execute on the consumer side,â Misso said. âItâs a simple behavior but itâs a matter of making that the norm.â Read:  Amazon is taking away the power of brand names, throwing another industry into turmoil However, Luke Starbuck, vice president of marketing at Linc, a customer care automation company, says these are habits that âform quicklyâ because itâs a natural interface that doesnât require a lot of learning. Two-thirds of Alexa-only Prime Day deals (66%) were for consumer packaged goods (CPG), according to Market Track data, âsuggesting the Echo and Alexa may be key elements to Amazonâs efforts into grocery and other consumables category.â The CPG category is one that is a good fit for the subscription model, said Misso.

,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"SAN ANTONIO, Texas (Reuters) - The truck driver accused of smuggling at least 100 illegal immigrants inside a sweltering tractor-trailer, 10 of whom died, has said he was unaware of the human cargo he was hauling until he took a rest stop in Texas, court papers showed on Monday. James Bradley Jr., 60, told investigators he was caught by surprise when he opened the trailer doors outside a Walmart store in San Antonio, only to be knocked down by a group of âSpanishâ people pouring out of the rig, according to the criminal complaint filed in the case. But the narrative attributed to Bradley, who could face the death penalty if convicted, was at odds with authoritiesâ accounts of a small fleet of SUVs waiting in the Walmart lot to carry away some of the immigrants who clamored out of the truck. Bradley was arrested on Sunday after police said they found the bodies of eight people in the truck, along with 30 to 40 others in and around the vehicle suffering from dehydration and heat stroke. All were illegal immigrants, the bulk of them Mexican nationals, ranging in age from 15 into their 20s and 30s, officials said. Two died later, bringing the death toll to 10, while 29 remained hospitalized on Monday, according to Thomas Homan, acting director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Daytime temperatures in the hours before the truck arrived had topped 100 Fahrenheit (37.8 Celsius). Bradley made a brief appearance in federal court on Monday in San Antonio, where he was charged with one count of transporting illegal immigrants - a felony for which he could face capital punishment if convicted because the crime resulted in deaths. More than 100 people were originally crammed into the stifling big-rig trailer, Homan said. But one of the survivors later told investigators that some managed to flee the scene before police arrived, swarming out of the truck when the rear doors opened to be whisked away by six black sport utility vehicles waiting for them nearby. San Antonio Police Chief William McManus also said video footage showed several vehicles coming to pick up people who were inside the truck, though Bradley, according to court documents unsealed on Monday, denied seeing any such vehicles. Two of the survivors, according to the criminal complaint, recounted having been smuggled in small groups of immigrants across the Rio Grande River from Mexico to Texas, where they were harbored in âstash housesâ around the border town of Laredo before being rounded up into the tractor-trailer for the trip to San Antonio, about 150 miles (240 km) to the north. Describing desperate conditions inside the pitch-black interior of the truck without water or proper ventilation, one survivor recalled people taking turns to gasp for fresh air through a hole in the trailerâs side. Some passed out, while others shouted and pounded on the walls of the truck to get the driverâs attention. Their pleas went unanswered until arriving at the Walmart, according to the account. One survivor said about 70 people were already present when he climbed into the trailer with his group of nearly 30. Another estimated as many as 200 were aboard in total. Bradley told investigators he did not know anyone was inside the truck until he parked near the store to use the bathroom and heard banging and shaking coming from the back, according to the criminal complaint. When the driver opened up the trailer, he noticed âbodies just lying on the floor like meat,â the complaint said. Some 30 or 40 people got out and âscattered,â Bradley told investigators. According to the complaint, Bradley told investigators he was hauling the trailer from Iowa to Brownsville, Texas, to deliver it to its new owner. He said he had stopped in Laredo to get the vehicle washed before heading on to San Antonio. Authorities gave Bradleyâs residence as Clearwater, Florida. But Darnisha Rose, who lives in Louisville, Kentucky, and identified herself as his fiancee, told Reuters Bradley was a 47-year trucking veteran who made his home in his rig. Rose described Bradley as a kind, family man whom she met two years ago when he was hospitalized in Louisville for a toe amputation and she was the housekeeper for his room. She said he recently had his right leg amputated. Public defender Alfredo Villarreal, one of two lawyers representing Bradley, did not respond to a request for comment. Mexicoâs foreign ministry said four of the 10 dead were Mexicans, as were 21 of the 29 people hospitalized. The Guatemalan government confirmed that one of its citizens was among the dead and two others had been found alive. Crossing the border illegally from Mexico has long been a dangerous proposition, according the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has documented at least 7,000 deaths among those making the trek since 1998. In what is considered the worst illegal immigrant smuggling case in U.S. history, 19 people died after traveling in an 18-wheeler truck through Victoria, Texas, in 2003. ","

,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Walmart.com, trailing Amazon.com Inc in the number of goods for sale on its website, is recruiting vendors in China and other countries to boost its online offerings in a pivot away from Wal-Martâs Made-in-America campaign. While there is a financial incentive behind the move, Wal-Mart's decision comes out of necessity: not all the goods its customers want - ranging from jeans to bicycles to beauty products - are manufactured within the United States. That reality pits Wal-Mart against President Donald Trumpâs âMade in Americaâ push. It also risks alienating some of Wal-Martâs existing U.S. vendors since it runs counter to the American-made pledge the retailer made in 2013 in a bid to win customers, and satisfy unions and other critics who said its drive for low cost goods was undermining American jobs. According to two sources with knowledge of the matter, Wal-Mart Stores Inc in February began inviting sellers from China, the United Kingdom and Canada to list on the marketplace section of Walmart.com, where it earns a share of revenue from goods sold and delivered to customers by third-party vendors. Previously, it only allowed U.S. based sellers on the marketplace site, sources said. Calling the unreported move a âmeasured approach,â Wal-Mart Vice-President of Partner Services Michael Trembley confirmed the invite-only program. He said foreign sellers currently make up less than five percent of its seller base. Trembley said Wal-Martâs move is focused on meeting customer demand for different types of products and increasing online assortment. Wal-Martâs marketplace inventory has quintupled this year to 50 million items. That still pales in comparison to Amazonâs nearly 300 million products online, analysts said. Shrinking that gap is key to Wal-Martâs strategy to beat Amazon. Launched in 2009, the marketplace platform contributes more than 10 percent to Wal-Martâs e-commerce revenue, but barely registers in total sales of nearly $486 billion, according to data from e-commerce analytics firm Marketplace Pulse. The data could not be independently verified by Reuters. Amazonâs third-party marketplace, which also uses global vendors from countries like China, contributes to nearly half of Amazonâs retail sales, analysts said. The move brings risks beyond the impact to Wal-Martâs sales. Trump kicked off a âMade in Americaâ week earlier this month where he promised he would take more legal and regulatory steps during the next six months to protect American manufacturers, lashing out against trade deals he said have hurt U.S. companies. Trumpâs comments come as the White House is seeking to renegotiate the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in an effort to shrink the trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. âNo longer will we allow other countries to break the rules, steal our jobs and drain our wealth,â Trump said in a weekly address tweeted by the White House on July 21. âInstead we will follow two simple but very crucial rules: We will buy American and we will hire American.â In a statement on Wednesday, Wal-Mart proposed policy actions to boost U.S. manufacturing which could help capture $300 billion worth of products that are imported. The retailer urged policymakers for simpler regulations on things like Made in USA labeling and modernize trade agreements. Cindi Marsiglio, vice president for U.S. sourcing and manufacturing at Wal-Mart, told Reuters it is on target with its pledge to buy $250 billion worth of American-made products by 2023, and remains committed to boosting U.S. manufacturing. âAGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THEIR âMADE IN AMERICAââ Some of Wal-Martâs existing U.S. vendors - whom Wal-Mart has recruited to supply goods manufactured domestically as part of its highly publicized Made-in-America sourcing plan - are on edge about competition with foreign goods. âIt goes against the spirit of their âMade in Americaâ push,â said one seller of American-made socks to Wal-Mart.com, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of hurting business relations with the retailer. Six out of seven U.S. manufacturers Reuters spoke with who are selling to Walmart.com said they were disappointed with the retailerâs move. Marsiglio said the retailer had not heard any complaints about its move to allow global vendors on its marketplace. âItâs bad timing to start such a program given President Trumpâs push in this direction and the resources they (Wal-Mart) spend on promoting a patriotic image,â said another vendor, who sells pet products. Darius Mir, chief executive of MIA (Made in America) Seating Corp, a Tennessee based seller of office furniture to Wal-Mart.com, said he supports free trade and is open to competition on the platform. But he thinks it would help U.S.-based vendors if Wal-Mart could label âMade in USAâ items listed on its website. âWalmart must distinguish between a âMade In USAâ product from all others by grouping the American made product separately, and highlighting the Made In USA label,â he said. HOLLOWED-OUT MANUFACTURING Wal-Martâs third-party marketplace is part of an overall online initiative that isÂ starting to show growth, with e-commerce sales growing 63 percent during the first quarter. The progress has been led by e-commerce chief Marc Lore, who took over last year after Wal-Mart paid $3.3 billion for Jet.com, an online retail platform he founded. Wal-Martâs Trembley said the retailerâs approach to growing its marketplace, which analysts said has been slow, has been designed to avoid problems like counterfeit products, which is a challenge for rivals Amazon and Alibaba. He said Wal-Mart vets sellers to the third party marketplace and has a high bar for selection. The retailer has also put in place requirements for global vendors that could create U.S. jobs.Â For example, foreign sellers must be able to fulfill orders from a U.S.-based warehouse, they must use a U.S.-based return center and have customer support operating during U.S. business hours, Trembley said. But finding U.S.-based suppliers remains a challenge. Beginning in the 1980s, Wal-Mart led a push to look overseas for inexpensive inventory, and the Made-in-America pushâwith its implied effort to rebuild a hollowed-out manufacturing baseâhas created more publicity than sales, retail consultants and analysts said. Wal-Martâs Marsiglio in an interview in April told Reuters that finding U.S.-based suppliers âremains one of the top challenges across our supplier base.â This week she said one of the ways Wal-Mart is addressing that challenge is by working with existing suppliers and leveraging their manufacturing capacity to produce multiple items. For example, the retailer is working with a playing cards supplier who is now manufacturing plastic cutlery. Wal-Mart had 10,249 sellers on its marketplace at the end of 2017âs first quarter, a substantial jump from 400 in the same period a year ago, according to data from Marketplace Pulse. This compares to millions of sellers on Amazonâs marketplace. But few American consumers are willing to pay higher prices for American-made items. A Reuters Ipsos poll released on Thursday found 70 percent of Americans think it is important to buy U.S.-made products but 37 percent said they wouldnât pay more for U.S.-made goods. âThis all boils down to one thing,â said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder and chief executive of Marketplace Pulse, the e-commerce analytics firm. âWal-Martâs marketplace has not been a success story, but with their renewed focus on e-commerce, they are trying to do everything they can to change that,â he said.

,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"Wal-Mart said barriers to manufacturing growth include a lack of available and qualified workers and of co-ordination and financing to support U.S. manufacturers, complex regulations that create high compliance costs and legal risks, and the need for an overhaul of the U.S. tax system and trade deals. The worldâs largest retailer, which committed to sourcing $250 billion worth of U.S.-made goods in 2013, said it identified those challenges as it worked with suppliers over the last four years. Wal-Martâs comments come at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has made boosting domestic manufacturing a key focus of his economic agenda. Earlier this month the White House held its âMade in Americaâ week showcasing U.S. goods. The companyâs policy proposals included building vocational training programs, reducing costs for private industry to train workers, rebranding U.S. manufacturing to attract workers and drive demand for domestic products, encouraging component production to close supply chain gaps and promoting manufacturing clusters through public-private cooperation. Other proposals included eliminating federal overlap in manufacturing regulations, creating flexible compliance requirements for small businesses, creating a globally competitive tax environment, expanding tax deductions to foster manufacturing investments and overhauling trade agreements. Wal-Mart said it discussed these proposals at a meeting with individuals and organizations representing business, government and non-governmental organizations in Washington D.C. Citing an analysis by the Boston Consulting Group, Wal-Mart said every $100 billion that is onshored has the potential to create more than 500,000 direct manufacturing jobs which could then create an additional 1.5 million jobs.

,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"AUSTIN, Texas/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some of the illegal immigrants who survived a deadly human-smuggling journey into Texas are seeking visas to stay in the United States in exchange for testimony against those responsible for an operation that killed 10 people on a sweltering truck, a lawyer said on Tuesday. There is precedent for such visas and it could help U.S. authorities bring more people to justice, experts said. So far, only one person has been charged, the driver of the truck who said he was unaware of the human cargo aboard until he took a rest stop in San Antonio. He could face the death penalty if convicted. The case could also provide a test for the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which has promised to crack down on illegal immigration and the criminal syndicates responsible for human trafficking. Silvia Mintz, an attorney representing the Guatemalan Consulate in Houston, said she has contacted the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to see if it would consider granting âU visas,â available to victims of crimes such as human trafficking who have pertinent information to provide law enforcement. At least 100 illegal immigrants, mainly from Mexico and Guatemala, were crammed into the back of the truck after crossing the U.S. border. âIf we are able to establish the case, we will go ahead and seek the U visa,â Mintz said in a telephone interview. Shane Folden, special agent in charge for Homeland Security Investigations in San Antonio, said most of the people found alive at the scene are still in local hospitals. He said it was too early to talk about possible visas. âThere are a number of paths toward immigration relief for situations such as this,â he said in a telephone interview, adding, âwe are not at that point yet.â Of the 39 people found at the scene, 10 have died, 22 were in hospitals and seven have been released and were being questioned, he said. Most of those aboard the truck fled before authorities could capture them. U.S. law enforcement has granted temporary visas previously for immigrants who provided testimony in what is considered the worst illegal immigrant-smuggling case in U.S. history, when 19 people died after traveling in an 18-wheeler truck through Victoria, Texas, in 2003. Temporary visas for about 40 people aboard that truck helped U.S. prosecutors charge more than a dozen people with conspiracy in the case, prosecutors said at the time. Alonzo Pena, a former deputy director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said witnesses in the San Antonio case can be released into the community under strict conditions that could include wearing electronic monitoring devices. Authorities would likely repatriate the others, said Pena, who runs a San Antonio consulting business, in a telephone interview. A U-visa is valid for four years and offers a path to apply for permanent residency status. Congress limited the number to 10,000 a year, and the program is heavily oversubscribed. Those on the truck may also try for a T-visa for victims of human trafficking. Agent Folden said U.S. authorities want to topple the criminal groups responsible for human trafficking. âOur primary goal is to disrupt and dismantle these organizations,â he said. ","

 ,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"Thursday, July 27, 2017 - 01:01 Pakistani police have arrested 25 members of a village council of elders who ordered the rape of a 16-year-old girl. She was attacked as revenge for her brother's alleged rape of another girl. Lucy Fielder reports. â² Hide Transcript Raped on the orders of a village council.
              This 16-year-old girl in Pakistan was raped as revenge for her brother's alleged rape of another girl.
              Police have arrested 25 members of an informal village council accused of decreeing the attack.
              She was handed over to the victim's brother to be raped as retaliation. The family handed her over, and the punishment took place last week.
              The case came to light when both families filed criminal charges, accusing each of the two sons of rape.
              Both victims and their mothers are now in a women's protection centre.
              Pakistan has a centuries-old tradition of local councils, or jirgas, handing down quick justice.
              Villagers often see them as preferable to a cumbersome legal system.
              'Revenge rape', and the role of the jirgas, drew world attention when an attack on a woman named Mukhtaran Mai was ordered in similar circumstances.
              She went on to become a high-profile campaigner for women's rights.

(PLUG), the company that makes alternative energy technology for materials handling equipment, is surging in trading, recently up more than 10%, after expanding a deal with megaretailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT). In a press release, the companies announced that under terms of the deal, Plug Power will issue to Wal-Mart warrants to buy 55.3 million shares and in exchange the company can access project financing at a lower cost of capital. With their current commercial agreement, Wal-Mart buys Plug PowerÂ fuel cells for its distribution centers. With the warrants, the company said future distribution transactions with the retailer will be cash flow positive up front. The fuel cell company said it expects to provide its hydrogen fueling station and fuel cell energy technology to up to 30 additional Wal-Mart sites in the U.S. over the next three years. Ten sites are already under contract and slated to be completed by the end of this year. (See also: Plug Power Ships First ProGen Fuel-Cell Engines.) The value of the 2017 commitments is projected to be roughly $80 million. The total value of the Plug Power warrants is around $600 million. Wal-Mart will pay the company for the warrants in $50 million installments with the first 5.8 million shares vested upon execution of the new program agreements at a exercise price of $2.1231 per share. The exercise price for warrants vesting after the first 34.9 million warrant shares will be based on the volume-weighted average closing price at the time they vest, the company said. (See also: Why Is Amazon Interested in Plug Power?) âOur expanding relationship with Walmart validates Plug Powerâs advanced capabilities in fuel cell products and systems, allowing the worldâs largest retailer to maintain its leading position as an industry innovator,â said Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power in a written statement. âWalmartâs long-term supply agreement is a great example of our strategy in action, as it enables us to improve both our revenue visibility and cost structure, all while allowing our customers to experience improved productivity and operational cost savings.â The executive went on to say the company is seeing a growing market opportunity for its power and fueling station technologies within the material handling segment.

Mark Kolakowski,07272017,Investopedia,07202017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Amazon.com's (AMZN) dramatic growth into a corporate retail disruptor -- and its attack on numerous industries -- has launched a new theater of business conflict, a war of the robots,Â according to a story in Wall Street Journal. Increasingly, companies are no longer usingÂ employeesÂ to match wits against their corporate rivals. Instead, they are fieldingÂ robots and machines. Amazon is pushing aggressively into robots to replace human labor with the goal of slashing costs, thusÂ dramatically boosting efficiency, and thus crushing its rivals with its ability to buy goods and sell products at low prices. Amazon needs only about one minute of human labor to ship a typical package,Â according to CNN. The key was Amazon's 2012 acquisition of robotics firmÂ KivaÂ Systems, based in suburban Boston. In 2014, Amazon began usingÂ Kiva'sÂ squat, orange robots in its 20 distribution centers, initially with 15,000, expanding to 30,000 in 2015, and 45,000 in 2016, per reports inÂ The Seattle TimesÂ andÂ the Daily Mail Amazon reports its quarterly resultsÂ on Thursday while Wal-Mart releases its numbers on August 17. This onslaught is forcing a long list of retailers to respond. Brick-and-mortar powerhouse Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), the world's largest retailer, hasÂ stepped up its use of machines in various applications at many of its 4,700 stores. It has alreadyÂ cut human staffing per square foot of store space by 15% over the past decade, the Journal reports. At the same time, home improvement superstore chain Home Depot Inc. (THD) is increasingly replacing human cashiers byÂ expanding self-checkout in its stores, and is experimenting with givingÂ customers scanner guns to speed the process further, the Journal says. Jeweler Tiffany & Co. (TIF), meanwhile, is replacing human silverÂ polishers with machines. But right now, it's clear that Amazon is well ahead of rivals in leveraging robots. At Amazon, the old way of fulfilling orders was to have human ""pickers"" race through a huge warehouse to pull together the disparate items in a customer order. Now the pickers stay in one place and the KivaÂ robots bring racks of merchandise to them. To speed the process further, computer screens guide the pickers to the exact spot in the racks. As a result, pickers can grab many more items per shift than before. Additionally, Amazon can pack about 50% more merchandise in a distribution center, since the use of Kiva robots has eliminated the need for wide aisles that human pickers could negotiate. Both CNN and the Daily Mail describe the process in detail. In Seattle, Amazon has opened aÂ store without a human cashier, and it also has announced its first productÂ delivery by automated drone in the U.K., as reported by The Seattle Times. Just made public lastÂ Wednesday was a patent filed by Amazon in 2015 for a fleet of robots that would could be summoned by people in airports, shopping malls or other public places to charge their phones and take orders forÂ merchandise, CNBC reports. The concept includes giving these robots the ability to find people whose cellÂ phones have less than 10% battery charge left. Users would have to pay for the service by viewing advertisements, answering a survey, browsing for merchandise, or making a purchase. How far, or if, this concept has gone beyond the conceptual stage, CNBC does not say. Nonetheless, Amazon's willingness to spend massively on R&D, including research that goes beyond its current core businesses,Â positions it for continued technical dominance.Â (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Wal-Mart is belatedly trying to catch up by expanding its use ofÂ machines - not robots. It's installed a newÂ Cash360Â machine in most of its 4,700 stores that replaces human clerks in counting and processing cash receipts. Additionally, invoice clerks in the stores are being replaced with centralized systems.Â The Journal mentions several more automation initiatives at Wal-Mart.Â An increasing number of checkout registers are being converted to self-serve. An experiment is being conducted with touch screens to speed the processing of merchandise returns. Staff is beingÂ redeployedÂ toÂ supportÂ in-store pickup of grocery orders placedÂ online by convenience-seeking customers. More intriguingly, Wal-MartÂ has applied for a patent on a system that uses facial recognition to determine customer satisfaction and adjust staffing in response, the Journal says. ItÂ also is experimenting with touch screens to give customers product information, to help them make purchase choices. Â (For more, see also: How Home Depot, Best Buy, Wal-Mart Can Beat Amazon.) How quickly U.S. companies adopt advanced technology may determine which ones are able to lower costs enough, and attract enough sales and profits to reinvest and survive longterm - while boosting their stock prices for investors. Adoption also has major consequences for the economy. About two-thirds of retail jobs in the U.S. are in danger of evaporating by the year 2030 as a result of automation, according to a 2015 report byÂ CitiÂ Research, a division of Citigroup Inc. (C), cited byÂ the Wall Street Journal.  ",Amazon vs. Wal-Mart: Who Is Winning the Robot Wars | Investopedia

Marguerite Ward,07272017,CNBC,07202017,"Jeff Bezos, now the world's richest man with a net worth of over $90 billion, loves books. For one, the company that made him a multi-billionaire started as an online book retailer. He's spent his career changing the way books are published and sold, devouring many small bookstores in the process. But on a more personal level, the Amazon founder and CEO also has an abiding love of reading, and it has played a key role in forming him as a leader. In biography ""The Everything Store,"" author Brad Stone describes how books shaped Bezos' leadership style and way of thinking. In fact, Stone writes that there's a list of books Amazon employees refer to as ""Jeff's Reading List."" It includes autobiographies, business and technology reads and even a novel, and according to Stone, many Amazon executives have made their way through these volumes. Ishiguro's novel is a first-person narrative told by a butler who recalls his time serving in the army during the first World War. The book explores the meaning of duty, the pursuit of greatness and the sacrifices that come with both. Stone writes that it is Bezos' favorite novel. ""Bezos has said he learns more from novels than nonfiction,"" Stone writes. This famous management read explains how companies that succeed build environments where ""employees who embrace the central mission flourish,"" Stone writes. ""A video game designer argues that intelligent systems can be created from the bottom up if one devises a set of primitive building blocks,"" Stone writes. ""The book was influential in the creation of Amazon Web Services, or AWS, the service that popularized the notion of the cloud."" Author and business consultant Collins briefed Amazon executives on many of the principles in this book before its publication, according to Stone. It explains how ""companies must confront the brutal facts of their business, find out what they are uniquely good at and master their flywheel, in which each part of the business reinforces and accelerates the other parts."" In this book, Christensen argues that companies improve by embracing disruptive innovation. Michael Bloomberg, founder and CEO of the eponymous company, once described the book as ""absolutely brilliant."" ""An enormously influential business book whose principles Amazon acted on and that facilitated the creation of the Kindle and [Amazon Web Services],"" Stone writes. ""Some companies are reluctant to embrace disruptive technology because it might alienate customers and undermine their core business, but Christensen argues that ignoring potential disruption is even costlier."" ""In his autobiography, Walmart's founder expounds on the principles of discount retailing and discusses his core values of frugality and a bias for action â a willingness to try a lot of things and make many mistakes,"" Stone writes. ""Bezos included both in Amazon's corporate values."" This book explores how major American, European and Japanese companies applied a series of ""lean thinking"" principles in an attempt to cut costs and boost efficiency to survive the 1991 recession and grow over the rest of the decade. ""[The book is] a collection of memos to employees by the chairman of the now defunct investment bank Bear Stearns,"" Stone writes. ""In his memos, Greenberg is constantly restating the bank's core values, especially modesty and frugality."" ""An influential computer scientist makes the counterintuitive argument that small groups of engineers are more effective than larger ones at handling complex software projects,"" Stone writes. ""An exposition of the science of manufacturing written in the guise of the novel, the book encourages companies to identify the biggest constraints in their operations,"" Stone writes, ""and then structure their organizations to get the most out of those constraints."" ""[This is] a guide to using data to measure everything from customer satisfaction to the effectiveness of marketing,"" Stone writes. ""Amazon employees must support all assertions with data, and if the data has a weakness, they must point it out or their colleagues will do it for them."" ""The scholar argues that people are wired to see patterns in chaos while remaining blind to unpredictable events, with massive consequences. Experimentation and empiricism trumps the easy and obvious narrative,"" Stone writes. For Bezos, the most important thing a book can provide is an escape.

Zameena Mejia,07272017,CNBC,07202017,"It's no secret that jobs at Silicon Valley tech companies like Google, Apple and Facebook are the most sought-after roles. The most in-demand employee at a majority of these tech giants? Software engineer. Although Silicon Valley has long been the ideal destination to land a role in tech,  new research released by jobs and recruiting website Glassdoor shows tech jobs are booming in other cities and sectors. Glassdoor's chief economist Andrew Chamberlain analyzed all unique job listings (based in the United States) with the word ""software"" in the title â such as software developer and software engineer â available on the website on June 1, 2012. He performed the same analysis for listings on June 1, 2017. As all industries incorporate software, automation and data to become more appealing to consumers, there are two reasons why Silicon Valley no longer works to launch your career in tech, according to Glassdoor: Think about your mobile bank app or the different stores you shop on using your phone: Software developers and engineers worked on those apps for companies not traditionally considered part of the tech sector. Chamberlain found that since 2012, retail, banking/finance and manufacturing have experienced the biggest growth in demand for software-related jobs. He tells CNBC Make It that he was most surprised by the jump in software jobs in retail, driven mostly by Amazon and Walmart. ""This is an indicator of a trend toward industries becoming more technologically savvy,"" Chamberlain says. He adds that banking and finance services is another interesting sector that has had difficulty attracting software engineers and developers. The main reason: They don't offer the same perks and benefits as large tech companies. ""You can now re-balance your investment portfolio yourself, you can apply for loans and changes in your credit limit in an automated way through self-service portals,"" Chamberlain says to CNBC Make It. ""Those tools are being built by software engineers and data scientists."" Between the five years analyzed, areas such as Seattle, Washington, D.C. and Detroit saw the biggest growth in software-related job postings. Chamberlain tells Make It there aren't less software-related roles in Silicon Valley. Rather, growth in those jobs has remained flat while other metro areas have experienced a boom in openings. Cost of living in traditional tech hubs is also driving the trend of opening new offices in other metro areas, Chamberlain says. Additionally, he explains that smaller tech hubs like Austin, Texas and Raleigh, North Carolina, are close to universities, which fuel growth of the tech sector. ""Fresh computer science and engineering grads coming out of universities often want to stay close to where they were they were in school and that provides the labor market for employers,"" Chamberlain tells CNBC Make It. Chamberlain highlights that given today's economy and the low unemployment rate in the U.S., job seekers â especially in the software industryâ are in the driver's seat, as they are attractive to prospective employers. ""You might not end up ever having spent time in Silicon Valley as a young person,"" Chamberlain says.

Zameena Mejia,07272017,CNBC,07202017,"The verdict is out: While Silicon Valley is home to many of the most desirable tech companies, it is no longer the tech job mecca. New  data research by jobs and recruiting website Glassdoor shows that in the past five years, the share of software-related roles in San Jose, California, the valley's biggest metro area, has declined. And it's not that there are fewer of these jobs in the United States. In fact, software engineers are the most sought-after employees today. Rather, tech jobs have been moving to other metro areas and sectors, Glassdoor's chief economist Andrew Chamberlain tells CNBC Make It. Chamberlain analyzed all unique job listings (based in the United States) with the word ""software"" in the title â such as software developer and software engineer â available on the website on June 1, 2012.

Here are the 10 best cities for getting a job in tech beyond Silicon Valley based on the share of software job postings for each respective metro area. From 2012 to 2017, Seattle saw a 6.7% increase in software jobs. Seattle, home to tech giant Microsoft, saw the biggest gains in software hiring. But Chamberlain says this growth is mostly driven by retail giants Amazon and Walmart. As e-commerce has boomed, so have the amount of software jobs in the retail sector. From 2012 to 2017, Washington, D.C. saw a 1.3% increase in software jobs. While tech icons including IBM, HP and Oracle are hiring in Washington, D.C., there are an array of education-based companies such as Lexis Nexis, Cengage and Kaplan to pick from as well. From 2012 to 2017, Detroit saw a 0.8% increase in software jobs. The big auto manufacturers still left there, like Ford and General Motors, are relying more and more heavily on software engineers for automation rather than the old style line production worker manufacturing jobs, Chamberlain says. From 2012 to 2017, Denver saw a 0.7% increase in software jobs. Research from Glassdoor shows software workers living in this and other cities with lower cost of living were able to stretch their dollars further. ""The lower cost of living is just one reason Denver has seen a growing tech presence, and as a result more demand for software-related talent,"" Chamberlain says. Google, for example, has doubled its workforce in Colorado ahead of opening a new campus. From 2012 to 2017, Austin saw a 0.7% increase in software jobs. Some non-traditional tech companies seeking software engineers in this city include iHeartMedia, Home Depot and Indeed, which was voted one of Fortune's best places to work in Texas this year. From 2012 to 2017, San Francisco saw a 0.6% increase in software jobs. Although not very far from Silicon Valley itself, San Francisco currently has nearly 20,000 job listings related to software. Among those are retail company Gap, General Electric and Under Armour. From 2012 to 2017, Dallas- Fort Worth saw a 0.4% increase in software jobs. Companies like AT&T, Match.com and Capital One are among the companies with 12,000 software gigs currently available in this area of Texas. As with several other cities on this list, Dallas has been suspected to have a tech boom for a few years now. From 2012 to 2017, New York City saw a 0.4% increase in software jobs. Chamberlain points out that New York City, as well as San Francisco, is a significant hub in the banking and financial services industry. ""As the industry continues to adopt more technology, from online security payments to mobile banking apps, hiring for software roles have significantly grown,"" Chamberlain tells CNBC Make It. From 2012 to 2017, Orlando saw a 0.3% increase in software jobs. Disney Parks and Resorts Deloitte and Universal Studios are just a few examples of places that are non-traditionally tech companies, but demand software talent. From 2012 to 2017, Dallas- Fort Worth saw a 0.3% increase in software jobs. ""Companies today more than ever are locating new offices in lower cost of living areas that are nearby universities where they can recruit young talented software developers, but they can enjoy a cost of living that can be a factor of ten less in some cases for real estate,"" Chamberlain says. Deutsche Bank, Fidelity and Credit Suisse are a few examples of companies seeking software engineers in these two metro areas. Raleigh alone is home to at least 11 universities and colleges. ""Fresh computer science and engineering grads coming out of universities often want to stay close to where they were they were in school and that provides the labor market for employers,"" Chamberlain tells CNBC Make It.

I would probably stop short atÂ calling this a true collaboration between the two companies. We'll getÂ down to the details behind that butÂ first a bit of context. If you're a CostcoÂ shopper, you'll know that the company has its own private label brandÂ called Kirkland Signature. It'sÂ been around for about 20 years, andÂ it now makes up about 20% of allÂ products at Costco stores.Â Kirkland products encompass everything fromÂ packaged goods to apparel, food andÂ beverage, even alcohol. They're known for offering high quality at a pretty good value. Kirkland also makes up 25% of company revenue. Keep in mind that Costco isÂ one of the world's largest retailers. They had $125 billion of salesÂ in the last 12 months, meaning thatÂ Kirkland itself is a $30 billion-plus brand, and some of its items generate annually $1 billion in revenue. ThatÂ should give you an idea of how popular and massiveÂ this private label brand has become. This reflects, overall, a trendÂ across the retail industryÂ with grocery stores andÂ retail pharmacies investing a lotÂ into their private labels as well. Asit,Â you know the tie up here between Kirkland and AmazonÂ probably has more so to do withÂ some of the online efforts and distribution with Costco. CanÂ you give us some high-level thoughts here,Â in terms of this potential for collaboration that Shubhra wants to know about? Mostly, it's third-party sellers which are sellingÂ Kirkland products on the Amazon site so far,Â as far as I can see.Â I certainly haven't read anything about any deeper cooperation. However,Â it's something that AmazonÂ might have wanted to pursue over time,Â but I think the window on that is closingÂ with this purchase of Whole Foods MarketÂ by Amazon.Â Whole Foods Market has its ownÂ private label brand that's called 365. The thing that listeners shouldÂ remember here, and I have a hard time remembering this myself, private label brands likeÂ Kirkland and 365, they'reÂ not manufactured by these retailers. They're simply great deals that the retailers have struck with their suppliers, to put their own label on products,Â hopefully at a better margin. So if you visualize Amazon'sÂ ability to take 365Â private label products by Whole Foods and sellÂ at least the nonperishable foodÂ items which are household goods, sell themÂ straight out of their warehouses withÂ very few human touches -- because, remember how goodÂ Amazon is at robotics, fulfillment, logistics -- they can actuallyÂ improve the margin that Whole Foods is already getting off of its own private label. AndÂ now that Amazon will own Whole Foods, it all hits their bottom line. Very smallÂ incentive left to try to do some deal making with Costco to push a lot of Kirkland products through their site. What are your thoughts on that, Vince? Shen: The big thing thatÂ sticks out to me in terms ofÂ seeing these Kirkland products on the Amazon store is,Â keep in mind that Kirkland Signature,Â the private label is not exclusiveÂ in terms of where you can find those products, atÂ Costco store shelves or on its own website. So I do have some numbers here for the first half of 2016, they're fromÂ data analytics companyÂ 1010data. TheyÂ indicate that Amazon actually, not Costco, wasÂ the biggest online seller of Kirkland Signature products, withÂ 70% share. Again, that was for the first half of 2016. Meanwhile,Â Costco.com came in second with a 23% share. But as you mentioned, Asit, that 70% for Amazon comes from their marketplace sellers. It's not direct Amazon sales. So again, it's not really an official partnership but really a byproductÂ of the fact that we have Kirkland, aÂ very large, popular brand, we have Amazon,Â one of the biggest marketplaces on the internet, and this isÂ basically where they intersect. So the prospects for more collaborationÂ between these two companies appears less likely, especially with the push that Amazon is likely to make with the Whole Foods buyout. The last note thatÂ I mention regarding Kirkland is thatÂ Amazon is not the only competitor carrying the private label. Even aÂ direct rival inÂ Wal-MartÂ (NYSE:WMT)Â ends up sellingÂ Kirkland Signature products through itsÂ Jet.com business. There were some reports last month thatÂ Wal-Mart wants to wind down itsÂ sales of Kirkland products to bolster its ownÂ private label. They have their Sam's Club warehouse club, and its ownÂ private label is called Member's Mark. So my search this morning before coming intoÂ the studio still shows over 200 productsÂ available on the Jet.com marketplaceÂ under the Kirkland Signature brand. But there are someÂ additional numbers here from May fromÂ Slice Intelligence, a market research company. They show that Jet.com has indeed reduced its share ofÂ online Kirkland SignatureÂ sales. Before, it was Amazon,Â Costco, and Jet.comÂ selling the most Kirkland Goods. Now it's Amazon, Costco, andÂ GoogleÂ Express. Any other thoughts from you, Asit, in terms of the dynamics here between howÂ some of these competitors can end up, dueÂ to the popularity of these brands,Â coming together and carrying each other'sÂ product lines? Sharma: It'sÂ good for all companies if they canÂ distribute on each other's platforms. WhenÂ you get into a product,Â your typical Kirkland product, it's basically packaged in a way so that you're buying in bulk,Â often excessive quantities. That'sÂ part of Costco's business model to get you into its store and offer you that product, where you're bringing home a lot of it. That doesn't work as well online, butÂ Kirkland has proven over the years to be aÂ somewhat popular brand. I thinkÂ Costco would do better, though,Â as it moves forward, to emulateÂ Wal-Mart, as Vince brought up. They should seek to buyÂ something like a Jet.com,Â although Jet.com was maybe the last viable online retailer, andÂ Wal-Mart took advantage of that. But Costco should try to copy Wal-Mart's playbook and find some ways where it can acquire more online presence.Â I'm not so sure that just using their own platform,Â they'll really be able to keep up with this aggressive pace that Amazon.com and Wal-Mart areÂ going out with their marketplace purchases,Â Amazon buying Whole Foods,Â Wal-Mart buying Jet.com. Costco needs to up its gameÂ rather than look for a collaboration between these two,Â because that will be hard to come by. ","

Billy Duberstein,07272017,Fool,07202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. To investors, the Kraft-Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) may seem like a can't-miss investment: A portfolio of beloved household brands, huge scale, and top-notch management in 3G Capital and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), which combined own about 50% of the company. However, even Buffett himself said in his 1987 shareholder letter, ""When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact."" Right now, the consumer-packaged goods business is facing several structural headwinds, and even Kraft-Heinz is not immune, posting a 3.1% year-over-year sales decline in the first quarter. Here are two big dangers Kraft-Heinz shareholders need to be aware of. Image source: Getty Images. Large consumer packaged goods companies mostly sell through brick-and-mortar retailers. Often, profit sharing between producer and distributor is determined through delicate negotiations. Thus, if a retailer has sufficient scale, it can afford to be a tough negotiator and drive supplier prices down. This is how Wal-Mart StoresÂ was able to become a very profitable business while also maintaining a reputation for rock-bottom prices. In this light, the ongoing price war in the grocery business combined with Amazon'sÂ recent buyout of Whole FoodsÂ is likely to spur much greater consolidation in a fragmented U.S. grocery industry. On a recent conference call, KrogerÂ CEO Rodney McMullen stated, ""Everything that we can see, we're probably at the front end of the next phase of consolidation. You're starting to see some competitors fall out."" This is not good for Kraft-Heinz. First, an Amazon-Whole Foods tie-up could result in Amazon bringing Whole Foods' prices from ""Whole Paycheck"" levels down closer to those of consumer packaged goods brands. Second, consolidation could very well mean Kraft-Heinz will be weakened in producer-distributor negotiations. For instance, consumer packaged goods companies often get preferred shelf placements and end caps due to their ability to pay slotting fees, pay-to-stay fees, and display fees to grocery stores. If you have, say, the scale of Wal-Mart (25% market share -- by far the largest player), you are likely able to negotiate higher fees (or bigger discounts) for access to your large store base. While Kraft-Heinz is a global company, it still gets almost 80% of its sales from the U.S. and Canada, where consolidation is likely to happen. That could be why the company has been trying so hard to purchase Unilever (NYSE:UN), which is much more globally diversified, getting only 17% of its sales from North America. Another trend threatening Kraft-Heinz's franchise is the rise of private-label brands. Private-label brands are owned by the retailers themselves, such as Costco'sÂ Kirkland, Kroger's Simple Truth, and Whole Foods' 365 Everyday.Â Retailers often give these brands prime placement on their own store shelves, while pricing them far below big-name brands. Since retailers don't need to spend vast sums on marketing and display fees as large consumer packaged goods companies do, these brands are still very profitable despite their bargain prices. Since the Great Recession, cost-conscious customers have been turning increasingly to private labels. Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow estimates private label sales have increased 3.5% annually since 2012, taking market share from the rest of the industry. Moreover, the percentage of consumers who can name a favorite brand has declined, with the age of transparency enabling customers to seek out products based on ingredients and benefits, according to a 2015 Time, Inc./Yougov study. As such, many consumers are simply turning to the cheapest selection, which is usually a private label. Putting these two trends together -- the consolidation of grocery retailers, all with their own private labels -- is a potentially dangerous mix for Kraft Heinz. To combat these headwinds, the company is turning to innovation to keep customers interested, including removing nitrates from Oscar Meyer hot dogs and artificial dyes from Kraft's classic macaroni and cheese. The company has also launched new products, such as Heinz Seriously Good Sauces, Cracker BarrelÂ Mac & Cheese, and Devour frozen dinners, which the company claims are performing very well. Still, with the company posting year-over-year sales declines, it remains to be seen if these new innovations can offset declines in legacy brands and these two large headwinds. While the company is in good hands, Kraft-Heinz investors should still proceed with caution. ","

Finding market-beating stocks can be tough when the stock market is falling because, historically, the majority of stocks go in the same direction as the S&P 500. However, there are some stocks that do better than others, and our Motley Fool investors think that the next time the bear comes calling, investors in Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), andÂ Johnson & JohnsonÂ (NYSE:JNJ) could come out ahead. Todd Campbell (Amgen, Inc): The past doesn't guarantee the future, but sometimes, the past rhymes with it. If that's the case during the next market crash, owning Amgen, Inc. could be smart. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Amgen is one of the world's biggest biotechnology drugmakers. In addition to being one of the few dividend-paying stocks in its industry, it also has the distinction of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 during 2008, when the index fell 38%. AMGN Year-to-Date Price Returns (Daily) data by YCharts. Amgen's outperformance then was due to its reporting successful trial data for its now approved osteoporosis drug, Prolia. It also got a boost when it won Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for a highly anticipatedÂ thrombocytopenia drug, Nplate. Admittedly, it's anyone's guess if Amgen will report similarly good news the next time markets tumble,Â but it's got a lot going on in its pipeline that could provide a steady stream of news over the next couple of years that could boost its share price.Â Currently, it has a migraine drug, an osteoporosis drug, and a multiple myeloma drug approaching the finish line. It's also got a slate of biosimilars in development that could capture billions of dollars in biologics sales someday, if they're approved. Further out, over a dozen early-stage trials are underway to find the next big winner. It also makes sense to own Amgen because it's in industry giant. It doesÂ over $20 billion in sales and it has about $38 billion in cash and investments. Lately, it's been boosting its dividend by 30% per year, and with a 2.6% dividend yield, it's a great stock to include in a dividend portfolio. Dan Caplinger (Wal-Mart): Market crashes are scary because they often take stocks down even if there's no good fundamental reason for doing so. Yet there are a few stocks that investors look to for stability, even under the toughest of conditions. During the most recent market crash in 2008, Wal-Mart was one of the only winners from the financial crisis and Great Recession, and investors couldn't have asked for better performance. The key to Wal-Mart's ability to weather crashes has everything to do with the cause of the plunge in 2008. When the economy is strong, consumers feel good about their economic circumstances, and they feel more comfortable spending money. That's generally good for most retailers, but for Wal-Mart, the big-box giant's emphasis on low prices on discount goods holds less appeal than shopping at higher-end luxury stores. What the 2008 recession and market crash did was to show American shoppers that they needed Wal-Mart and its price focus. In the end, the retail giant fared much better than most of its competitors, largely because many customers moved down from higher-end stores in search of more-affordable options. The stock finished 2008 with a 20% gain, beating the S&P 500's return by more than 55 percentage points. There's no guarantee that the next market crash will come with a recession, so Wal-Mart might not benefit from the same positive impact. The competitive landscape has also shifted, and Wal-Mart's benefit from expanding its grocery business could come with new risks in the near future. Yet with a history of solid performance even in tough markets, Wal-Mart has convinced many investors that it can thrive even in the next market crash. Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Johnson & Johnson): Healthcare titan Johnson & Johnson has lived through more than a few market slumps in its over 120 years of doing business. And yet these ups and downs don't get between income investors and their quarterly checks. In fact, with 55 consecutive annual payout raises, Johnson & Johnson boasts one of the longest-running dividends on the market today. JNJ Dividend data by YCharts. Shareholders can't bank on a perfect record of sales and earnings growth. After all, revenue has declined in two of the last 10 fiscal years. Investors occasionally endure painful profit environments, too. The most recent was a two-year stretch that was marked by severe economic decline around the world, the patent expiration for two blockbuster drugs, and a costly product recall. ""Our company was severely tested,"" Johnson & Johnson's CEO said in its 2011 annual report. Yet the operation excelled through this period thanks, in part, to a well-diversified portfolio that gets 70% of its sales from products that are ranked No. 1 or No. 2 in their markets. Johnson & Johnson's aggressive focus on the future is another competitive strength that's nearly impossible for rivals to match. It plowed $7.5 billion into research-and-development spending in 2011, and the number rose to $9.1 billion last year, equivalent to 13% of sales. The aggressive innovation pace ensures that about one-quarter of the company's revenue comes from products released over just the past five years. In that way, the owner of iconic healthcare brands like Band-Aid demonstrates that constant adaptation is the surest path to market-beating business results over the long term. ","

Friday was a down day for the stock market, but major benchmarks didn't slip too far from where they started the day. A drop in crude oil took prices back below $46 per barrel, igniting debate about whether the global economy is sufficiently strong. An accelerating rise in the value of the euro against the U.S. dollar also raised some concerns among investors looking for stability as central banks seek to remove financial crisis-era stimulus measures. Even though many market participants were downbeat today, some stocks did manage to post gains. Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF), and athenahealth (NASDAQ:ATHN) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well. Shares of Plug Power jumped 15% after the fuel-cell technology specialist announced a new arrangement with partner Wal-Mart StoresÂ (NYSE:WMT). The big-box retailer had already made a deal to obtain hydrogen fuel-cell-powered forklifts from Plug Power, but the announcement gives Plug Power access to project financing at a lower cost of capital, facilitating the partnership. The fuel-cell company expects to provide GenKey hydrogen fueling stations and fuel-cell energy solutions to as many as 30 more Wal-Mart locations in North America over the next three years, with 10 sites already under contract and scheduled for completion by the end of this year. CEO Andy Marsh was pleased with the arrangement, noting that ""our expanding relationship with Wal-Mart validates Plug Power's advanced capabilities in fuel cell products and systems, allowing the world's largest retailer to maintain its leading position as an industry innovator."" Investors hope that the deal will lead to more business from other customers, and they were willing to overlook the dilutive impact of more than 55 million warrants that Plug gave Wal-Mart as part of the arrangement. Image source: Plug Power. Capital One Financial stock rose 8.5% in the wake of the release of the company's second-quarter financial report. The bank said that net interest income climbed 7% from year-ago levels, helping to lift earnings by 15% to $1.94 per share. Capital One was especially pleased that its provisions for credit losses were down by 10% compared to the first quarter of 2017, and it also expressed confidence that it would be able to work with the Federal Reserve to come up with a modified capital plan to address issues that the central bank had raised in its stress test review earlier this year. Investors were willing to overlook a rise in delinquent loan-related write-offs and an increase in loan loss reserves because of better earnings performance than expected, but Capital One will need to stay strong in order to sustain the share price's gains. Finally, shares of Athenahealth climbed 8.5%. The provider of network services and point-of-care mobile applications for hospital and healthcare institutional clients said that revenue climbed 15% during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the year-ago period, and adjusted earnings soared by half. Athenahealth said that its efforts to expand its network are still paying off with better growth metrics, and it reaffirmed its guidance for the full 2017 fiscal year. Coming after a disappointing quarterly report in April, Athenahealth's results this time around reassured investors that long-term growth prospects for the company remain strong. ","

What makes Buffett's claim to fame so interesting is that he isn't using any fancy methods to screen for the stocks he buys. Instead, he simply looks for well-run businesses with clear long-term competitive advantages that he can buy in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio and sock away for years or decades. Some of the best examples include beverage giant Coca-ColaÂ and banking behemoth Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), which have both been steady holdings for nearly three decades and are responsible for generating the hundreds of millions of dollars Berkshire pockets in dividend income each quarter. Image source: The Motley Fool, Flickr. Image source: Getty Images. However, we can't blame Buffett for being a philanthropist, since there are actually two significant benefits to giving. To begin with, the charitable giving deduction tends to favor the wealthiest Americans. Donations made to eligible non-profit charitable organizations recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allow an individual or couple to deduct a percentage of their donation against their taxable income. This percentage correlates with their highest marginal tax rate. Thus, wealthy individuals who find themselves in the uppermost tax bracket of 39.6% are allowed to deduct $0.396 for every $1 they donate to an eligible charity. By comparison, someone with a peak marginal tax rate of 15% (e.g., someone earning $30,000 a year) only receives a $0.15 deduction for every $1 donated. It should be noted that even the wealthy can't deduct their way to $0 taxable income through charitable giving. The IRS limits deductions up to 50% of your adjusted gross income (AGI), with some special cases lowering the limit to just 20% or 30% of AGI.Â Nevertheless, it's a deduction that a number of wealthy Americans wisely take advantage of. The second benefit of donating is that it allows Buffett, and anyone for that matter, to support and further a cause they believe in. For instance, donations to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation help fund access to healthcare and education, both within the U.S. and in developing countries. Image source: Getty Images. Furthermore, it's not just individuals and couples that benefit from helping others. Businesses benefit, too. According to the 2015 Chronicle of Philanthropy's most charitable company list, the 20 most generous companies donated $3.5 billion in cash.Â Topping the list was Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), which many of you may know as the drugmaker with the pricy once-daily hepatitis C pill. Gilead provided nearly $447 million in cash contributions in 2015, much of which given as grants for HIV/AIDS and liver disease research. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) came in second with $301 million in cash contributions, which included $100 million to advance economic mobility for retail workers, and an undisclosed amount to help the anti-hunger charity Feeding America distribute fresh produce. Though Warren Buffett may not be the richest man in the world as a result of his regular charitable contributions, he clearly is among the richest of heart. ","

Investors are walking on eggshells ahead of Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ:CALM) earnings report next week. It's expected to give an indication of just how low the egg industry has fallen. With its stock at levels not seen in three years, the fiscal 2017 fourth-quarter financial report will determine whether shares are scrambled further. Data source: Bureau of Labor Statistics. Chart by author. But that's the average. In some regional markets like the Southeast, the industry's Urner Barry price index showed large eggs falling as low as $0.86 per dozen earlier this year. The problem, of course, is the aftereffects of the avian flu outbreak in 2015 that devastated flocks of hen layers. The influenza virus is highly contagious and can cause entire flocks to become infected very quickly. The 2014-2015 outbreak of the H5N2 virus led to the slaughter of over 40 million birds, some 12% of the national laying flock. The loss of so many birds savaged huge swaths of the country's egg inventory and prices soared. BLS data shows the average price of a dozen eggs peaked at almost $3 in September 2015, but what surprised many was how rapidly the industry bounced back. The USDA reported flock sizes were quickly repopulated to near pre-outbreak levels, but unfortunately demand did not return with it and egg prices were pummeled. An outbreak again this past spring had producers worried it would be deja vu all over again, but this time it was quickly contained. Image source: Getty Images. Still, it's a problem for Cal-Maine, the country's largest egg producer, along with other farmers. Cal-Maine admits its operating results are significantly affected by the fluctuations that go on in the wholesale shell egg market, over which it has no control. Even small increases in production or decreases in demand can have a large adverse effect on shell egg prices. The impact was evident when Cal-Maine was forced to suspend its quarterly dividend payment after recording larger-than-expected fiscal first-quarter losses last September. While the situation hasn't improved in the two years following the end of the virus outbreak, CEO Adolphus Baker is hopeful the tide will turn. Bloomberg reports he noted at an analyst conference last month that the egg industry goes through boom and bust cycles periodically, and while ""high prices cure high prices"" because farmers increase their flock sizes, ""low prices also cure low prices"" as farmers reduce them. However, it might not be so easy this time. Egg producers remain under pressure to increase their cage-free flocks, with companies like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) pledging to go cage-free at its 16,000 restaurants within 10 years, and Taco Bell has already completed the task. And after McDonald's made its pledge, around 200 other companies followed suit, including Starbucks, PepsiCo, and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Image source: Getty Images. The move to cage-free eggs allows corporations to virtue signal how good they are, but conditions aren't really all that much better for the chickens, and consumers are still buying based on price -- leaving producers like Cal-Maine Foods caught in the middle. Wal-Mart accounts for 29% of total sales, making it all the more difficult for Cal-Maine. That's why Cal-Maine has been trying to build up its specialty egg business, which is much less volatile than the shell egg market. Where average prices of non-specialty eggs plunged almost 40% year over year last quarter, Cal-Maine's specialty egg prices were down just 5%. It says specialty eggs are now its primary growth strategy focus, and while they accounted for around 24% of its total sales volume last quarter -- the same as last year -- specialty egg revenue was 40% of total shell egg revenue compared to 31% a year ago. Don't expect Cal-Maine Foods to crow about a dramatic U-turn in its prospects in its coming earnings report. Despite the stock being down 20% so far this year, investors might not be clucking for long about its poor performance. Rich has been a Fool since 1998 and writing for the site since 2004.

    Cal-Maine Foods Scrambled by Low Egg Prices -- The Motley Fool

Maxx Chatsko,07272017,Fool,07202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It hasn't been a completely smooth ride for Silicon Valley unicorn Hampton Creek, which has been embroiled in several controversies concerning its plant-based, vegan mayonnaise brand, Just Mayo. But if you thought that over a full year of silence was a sign that the end was nigh, then you'll need to reconsider. Earlier this month, the company announced that it has been quietly working on its next big product portfolio: animal-free meat. It's real meat, too, not some plant-based go-between that vegans often have to justify. For this announcement the development timeline may be more surprising than the technology itself: CEO Josh Tetrick says Hampton Creek expects to launch its first animal-free meat products in 2018. While food tech start-ups have been raking in funding, Hampton Creek is the largest to throw its hat into the ring for this upstart technology. That may create big opportunities for larger companies that individual investors can gain exposure to -- some of which may be in your portfolio today. Did you say ""animal-free meat""? Image source: Getty Images. What is animal-free meat, exactly? Sometimes it goes by the nails-on-chalkboard monikers of ""test tube meat"" or ""synthetic meat,"" but the entrepreneurs actually developing the technology are (thankfully) steering the discussion toward names such as ""cultured meat"" and ""clean meat."" The latter two are more accurate and consumer-friendly. Why? Well, clean meat is grown not by raising and slaughtering livestock in factory farms but through tissue culture techniques. The process begins with stem cells from the animal whose meat is in demand -- whether cow, turkey, fish, or other -- and ends with an animal-free product that is identical in every way to food from traditional meat and protein production in taste, texture, and nutrition. Delivering on the environmental benefits -- a key factor in consumer decisions in the last decade -- will be crucial to the early success of animal-free products. Image source: Getty Images. Developing the best product in the world doesn't mean much if you can't get it out to consumers. This is a key advantage that Hampton Creek owns over other, much smaller cultured meat start-ups. The company can leverage existing customer relationships with the likes of Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) to quickly gain market share and change the conversation. The unicorn could even play its two largest distribution partners against each other. The stakes certainly seem to be raised now that rival Amazon has swooped into the grocery game by acquiring Whole Foods. Wal-Mart and Amazon are already duking it out for retail and online shopping, but the former's entrance into organic food sales has long been cited as eating away at pricing power for Whole Foods in recent years. Now it's a two-front war. Cultured meat could play heavily into the battle for organic food sales dominance. While products will be created with biotechnologies, that's not to be confused with genetic engineering -- which is unfortunately excluded from the USDA Organic label. Consumers can definitely expect Hampton Creek to exploit the environmental benefits of clean meat during future marketing campaigns, similar to organic food brands today. Don't think it's likely? Whole Foods has seen same-store sales at stores open at least one year fall for seven consecutive quarters. While no one really knows what Amazon has in mind for the grocery chain, it may be willing to take risks to boost sales and margins. Innovative products such as organic clean meat certainly fit the bill. Wal-Mart may be forced to follow, and Hampton Creek may be the first brand to sell the ammunition both sides need. Image source: Getty Images. Hampton Creek has a major fundraising advantage over other clean meat start-ups, having raked in $220 million from venture capitalists to date. But it will need considerably more to develop and launch a new clean meat product. CEO Josh Tetrick doesn't think it'll be a problem. In fact, he sees a huge opportunity for future funding: traditional meat producers. That may be difficult to believe, but Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN), the world's largest meat processor, appears to be gearing up for an animal-free meat future. CEO Tom Hayes, who only came on in June 2016, led the creation of a Tyson Foods-owned VC fund dedicated to investing in start-ups creating substitutes to traditional meat products. In October, the company purchased a 5% stake in plant-based meat manufacturer Beyond Meat. Tetrick says he also expects large traditional meat companies will potentially want to become significant investors. ""We're talking to a number of them right now all across the world,"" he says. ""I'd expect one or two of these partnerships to cross the finish line [soon]."" In other words, investors may need to prepare themselves for a future where Tyson Foods is not only a major funder of animal-free meat but perhaps a leading producer. It's important to note that much of the talk surrounding cultured meat can be filed away as hype rather than reality. There are many manufacturing hurdles that need to be overcome to make clean meat a reality and sell it at price consumers would be willing to pay. It should take many more years before any product in the field hits all of these checkpoints. But you can't fault Hampton Creek for pushing the envelope. And if Tyson Foods continues throwing its weight around, then you may see animal-free meat products at your local grocery store a few years earlier than expected. ","

Travis Hoium,07272017,Fool,07202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Big oil companies are starting to consider what the world will look like after the reign of petroleum is over. For example, Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A) recently announced it will invest $1 billion per year in clean energy -- a large number, but still a relatively small investment compared to its $25 billion in annual capital spending. Nonetheless, it was a public admission that clean energy is the future, not oil. Rival Total (NYSE:TOT) has, arguably, made the biggest investments in renewable energy, buying two-thirds ofÂ solar solutions leader SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR), battery company Saft, and stakes in a number of solar power plant projects. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and BP (NYSE:BP) have also been in and out of the renewable energy business over the past decade, though both have taken steps back recently. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is really the only holdout among the hydrocarbon majors, continuing to focus solely on fossil fuels. What the rest of them are trying to do is create a path to a world beyond oil. But these old-school energy industry giants have a long road ahead to reach powerhouse status in renewable energy. Image source: Getty Images. Disrupting your own business is hard. When a company is running at full steam and generating cash, and has decades of profitable history to look back on, it's nearly impossible to admit that disruption is coming, even if it's staring you in the face. Microsoft could have produced a viable device to compete with the iPhone, but it was making so much money from Windows and Office that it didn't want to reinvent its business, so it missed out on the smartphone revolution. Sears, JC Penney, Walmart, and nearly every other major retailer are losing sales to Amazon.com, despite the fact that even a decade ago, it was easy to forecast that e-commerce was going to skyrocket. One could tell story after story about steady, profitable, incumbents that were unwilling or unable to make strategic shifts to new business models, despite the fact that they were able to see the changes coming to their industries years in advance. The idea of a company making a firm transition from oil to wind or solar energy seems simple enough. Fellow Fool investor Jason Hall recently asked me if I thought Total would buy out the rest of SunPower soon, as part of its path to the energy business of the future. That decision would seem to make sense for Total, on the surface, but I still view it as unlikely, for now. It's difficult to make a wholesale shift to a new business model, and Total is a perfect example of that. Sources have told me that when it bought its majority stake in SunPower, it asked the company for a 10-year plan -- something that's standard in the fossil fuel industry, where businesses chart their investments many years in advance. But SunPower had never crafted such a plan, because if they did, it would be obsolete in a matter of months. The solar industry changes so quickly that companies must constantly adjust on the fly. According to GTM Research, in 2007, the solar industry installed 2.5 GW of generating capacity worldwide. In 2017, China alone installs about that much every two weeks! No one could have predicted that a decade ago, let alone devised a plan then that still made sense in the current environment. It would be almost impossible for SunPower to be as nimble as it needs to be now under Total's corporate umbrella. The better strategy for Total would be to keep its major stake, support the company financially if that's needed, and maybe swoop in to buy the company outright in five or 10 years when the solar industry is mature and the oil business is dying. Just because oil companies don't have the corporate structure, dexterity, or know-how to run renewable energy companies today doesn't mean they'll all go down in flames with the decline of oil. Once the world definitively moves past peak oil consumption and energy companies see darker days ahead, they'll feel compelled to adjust their strategies. That's when their acquisitions of solar manufacturers and developers will likely begin in earnest. But buying into the still-evolving industry that renewable energy is today is too risky, even for big oil's balance sheets. There's a reason incumbent industries in general have a hard time adapting to upstarts that disrupt their businesses, even if they see the disruption coming. It's hard to turn away from a profitable model and leap to a new growth opportunity, even if it's one with a bright future like solar or energy storage. So, while it seems like the big oil companies are starting to take renewable energy seriously,Â a decade from now, they probably won't be the big energy players they are today. They're just not built to thrive in the fast-moving renewable energy industry. ","

Michelle Coffey,07272017,MarketWatch,07202017,"Published: July 23, 2017 5:36 p.m. ET By At least eight people were found dead and many more suffering from life-threatening injuries inside a sweltering semi-truck parked in the lot of a Walmart store in San Antonio, Texas, early Sunday. The death toll has risen to at least nine after one person later died at a hospital, according to a report. The discovery was made after a Walmart security guard was approached by a person in the truck, looking for water, according to San Antonio Police Chief William McManus, who spoke at a media briefing at the scene. The security guard gave the person water and then contacted authorities, who found eight people dead in the back of the trailer and 30 survivors in what officials described as a âhorrificâ human-trafficking incident. Of those injured, 20 at the time were found to be in âextremely critical or very serious conditionâ and eight others were suffering from heatstroke or dehydration, according to San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood. At least two of the 38 people found inside the truck were children, he said. Authorities said the truck didnât have functional air conditioning, despite scorching temperatures in San Antonio this weekend. According to the National Weather Service, temperatures hit 101 degrees just before 5 p.m. and then fell back below 90 degrees a little after 10 p.m. The driver of the vehicle was arrested and could face federal and state charges, officials said. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was also investigating the incident, McManus said.

                                  Â could arguably be said to be a contributor to the demise of U.S. manufacturing, with its rapacious sourcing of consumer goods from China as it became the nationâs dominant retailer. A 2015 estimate from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, said Wal-Martâs trade deficit with China had displaced more than 400,000 U.S. jobs. In 2013, the Arkansas-based retailer committed to sourcing an additional $250 billion of goods âthat support American jobsâ over a decade. Wal-Mart says two-thirds of products sold in its U.S. stores are made, assembled, sourced or grown domestically. The company said it had turned to its own U.S. sourcing effort over the past four years, as well as to The Boston Consulting Group, to draw up a policy roadmap. The ideas are to some degree self-serving â for instance, lowering tax rates and adopting a territorial system of taxation â but go beyond that. For instance, Wal-Mart calls for building vocational training programs linked to local industry, and encouraging the growth of component production to help close supply-chain gaps. It also calls for harmonizing manufacturing regulations across different levels of government. Wal-Mart spent nearly $7 million on lobbying the federal government last year, according to data from The Center for Responsive Politics,ranking it number 56 of companies and industries groups.

 ,07272017,MarketWatch,07202017,"Pistoiaâs train factory benefited from the European Central Bankâs bond buying program, which is drawing to a close. The Hitachi train factory in Pistoia, Italy. A stimulus program by the European Central Bank helped revive the factory, which is the cityâs largest employer.CreditCreditGianni Cipriano for The New York Times Supported by By Jack Ewing and Gaia Pianigiani PISTOIA, Italy â As Europeâs era of easy money slowly draws to a close, the talk in Frankfurt and London is of bond yields, exchange rates and core inflation. In this medieval city at the foot of the Apennines, itâs all about trains. A stimulus program by the European Central Bank helped revive the train factory that is the largest employer in Pistoia, hauling the city out of a deep economic slump and putting people back to work. But the bank is now preparing to take away that stimulus, raising an existential question for Pistoia, a case study in what central bank largess has achieved, and in what might happen when it is no longer there. Precisely when the European Central Bank will allow interest rates to rise remains a matter of speculation. The bank made no changes to its policy at a meeting on Thursday, and Mario Draghi, the central bankâs president, refused to be pinned down on any timetable. But analysts agree that the day is not far away when places like Pistoia will have to stand on their own. Only a few years ago Pistoia, which has a population of 92,000, was mired in economic gloom. The local factory, then owned by the Italian conglomerate Finmeccanica, had produced trains for more than a century, but the downturn was taking its toll. The factory was short of orders and in danger of closing. It laid off hundreds of workers and put others on reduced hours. Dozens of companies that supplied it went out of business. Young people emigrated to Australia in search of better opportunities, while right-wing and populist parties exploited the insecurity to increase their influence in the local government. âThere was a lot of fear,â said Jury Citera, secretary of the main union representing workers at the plant. âNo one thought there was a future at the company.â Then, in early 2015, the European Central Bank announced that it would begin buying bonds, exercising its power to create money from thin air. It started with government bonds, then added debt issued by corporations to its shopping list. All told, the bank has spent 2 trillion newly conjured euros, or $2.3 trillion, buying bonds in a bid to push down market interest rates, making borrowing cheaper and easier. Among the bonds it bought were those issued by Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, the government-owned company that manages the Italian rail network. It, in turn, used the money to order 39 trains for regional services. Suddenly there was work in Pistoia again. âA few years ago we felt like we were on a stationary bicycle, pedaling but going nowhere,â said Antonella Nannetti, another union official. âNow we are moving again.â Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane had been planning to buy new trains anyway, said Stefano Pierini, its finance director. But lower interest rates helped speed up the investment and allowed a bigger order. The same principle, writ large, has helped the eurozone achieve its most solid growth in a decade. The European Central Bank says its bond buying program does not target specific countries, let alone individual communities. But by buying public sector and corporate bonds in grand style, the bank creates more demand and allows governments and companies to issue debt with lower interest rates than would otherwise be the case. The programâs ultimate aim is to lower the cost of credit, stimulate growth and raise annual inflation closer to the official target of nearly 2 percent. If central bank bond buying is helping companies in places like Pistoia to invest and expand, âit is definitely a positive,â BenoÃ®t CoeurÃ©, a member of the European Central Bankâs executive board, said in an interview. The purchases of corporate bonds have covered a broad range of industries across the 19 nations of the eurozone. They include debt issued by the brewers Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken, by the pharmaceutical makers Novartis and Roche, by the fashion eyewear maker Luxottica, and by consumer products companies including NestlÃ©, Unilever and a Belgian unit of Coca-Cola. But an examination by The New York Times of the purchases, which the central bank identifies only by bond serial numbers, reveals one clear theme: infrastructure. That is especially true in Italy. In addition to the railroad company, the central bank has bought debt issued by Autostrade per lâItalia, which builds and manages Italian roads, as well as by utilities and energy companies. One is Hera, a waste and water management company in Bologna, which is using part of the money it raised to build a plant that will convert organic waste into natural gas. Effectively, the European Central Bank is financing an enormous public works program in Italy. The results are easy to see in Pistoia. Though a half-hour trip from Florence, it attracts a trickle of visitors by comparison and cannot depend on tourism for jobs. The cityâs only other major industry is acres of potted pines, palms and other plants lined up in neat rows, ready for export to gardens and nurseries around Europe and Asia. Despite sunny weather, Pistoiaâs pedestrian zone was practically empty on Monday. Edda Iozzini was still in a good mood. âMoney is in circulation again,â the 66-year-old, who owns a newsstand, said between drags of a cigarette. âWeâre very happy in Pistoia.â Whether that feeling remains once the stimulus punch bowl is removed is an open question. After a slump that lasted a decade, growth in the eurozone has surpassed the United Statesâ, and unemployment is falling. For all intents and purposes, the credit crunch is over, analysts say. But there remain trouble spots â notably Italy. The countryâs banks are still working off an enormous backlog of problem loans, and credit remains tight. âQuantitative easing has been very important,â Emma Marcegaglia, chairwoman of the Italian oil and gas giant Eni, said in an interview. âWithout it, Italy would have had a lot of problems.â But Ms. Marcegaglia said she thought the Italian economy was improving and could withstand a gradual decline in central bank stimulus. Pistoiaâs prospects appear good because money flowing into the area since 2015 has been used to improve the regionâs competitiveness. The Japanese industrial conglomerate Hitachi bought the train factory from Finmeccanica just as the European Central Bank released its gusher of cheap credit. Workers in Pistoia say Hitachi brought technological know-how as well as a willingness to modernize the plant. (Hitachi declined to comment for this article.) Better technology has allowed Hitachi Rail Italy to win orders for hundreds of new trains both in Italy and abroad, including rolling stock or components for urban rail systems in Miami and Honolulu. Union leaders in Pistoia say that current orders will keep them busy for six more years at least. The revival of the factory has restored not only the workersâ livelihoods but also their pride. âNow we feel we can show what we can do,â said Marco Fontana, who represents administrative employees at the factory. âItâs an opportunity to show we are real members of the European Union and not some little province.â Follow Jack Ewing @JackEwingNYT and Gaia Pianigiani @gaia_pianigiani on Twitter.

Draghi said the central bank would continue its â¬60 billion a month asset-buying program through December as planned, and that policy makers will discuss the quantitative-easing program this âautumn.â He didnât specify if that meant at its September meeting. His Thursday statements, which sent the euro on its current tear, came after the central-bank boss sparked a so-called mini-taper tantrum on June 27 in Sintra, Portugal when he hinted that the ECB may be inclined to scale back its accommodative policies amid signs the European economy was perking up. Read: Euro rally has room to run if this pattern continues to hold true On Thursday, however, Draghi emphasized that stubbornly low inflation remains the ECB main concern. Traders ultimately sent the euro higher on the view that no matter what Draghi said, the ECB will begin tapering those purchases in 2018, and eventually commence a wind down. âThe euro rally is more to do with the general dollar weakness than the euro strength,â speculated Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange. âThe dollar has been under pressure as the latest political headlines suggest the turmoil within the administration is not abating,â Esiner said. Read: Nobody told the euro that Mario Draghi was dovish The latest burst of strength for the euro may not get Draghi too panicked, said Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capitol Economics. âAt just above $1.16 at the time of writing, the euro remains well below its long-run average against the U.S. dollar of $1.21 and even further below its average in trade-weighted terms,â she said in a note Friday. âAnd since it seems keen to taper its QE program (not least because it is running out of assets to buy), we suspect that it would take a further rise to $1.20 or more before year-end to prompt the Bank to abandon its plans,â said McKeown. The key factor preventing a further euro rise will be U.S. policy tightening, she said, adding that they expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December and then four times in 2018. The Fed will move into focus next week with a two-day meeting starting July 25, though there are scant expectations for an interest-rate change.

See: McCormick buys Reckitt Benckiserâs food unit Read: Amazonâs Whole Foods deal makes online grocery âprimeâ for acceleration The deals are coming at a time of changing eating habits. The focus on health and wellness has led to growing demand for fresh produce and clean labels, especially among younger shoppers like millennials. That trend has led to changes throughout the supply chain, as food companies drop chemicals and additives and other artificial ingredients. For smaller companies, keeping up with the changes is expensive, making deals more attractive. There were 505 food industry M&A deals in 2016, according to data provided by The Food Institute, an organization founded in 1928.

See also:  How Pete & Gerryâs cage-free eggs are a model for other small farmers âThatâs something that these companies canât manufacture in their R&D labs,â he said. âIt is a daunting time because of the competitiveness. But itâs more daunting for conventional food companies than something like ourselves.â While itâs still early days for e-grocery, Laflamme believes food companies have to change their value proposition to meet changing needs. His company is investing in the online future, and his companyâs eggs, produced by family farmers nationwide, are available at Whole Foods. While a dozen of his eggs will cost more than eggs from most other companies, his eggs come with a promise that hens are raised in a humane environment to produce a better product. âEveryoneâs margins are going to be compressed to some degree,â said Laflamme. âThe story that we have warrants the price to consumers. If your product is going to cost more, the value needs to be there.â But as smaller companies continue to appeal to consumers, it makes them more attractive to large companies with deep pockets in search of revenue growth. âThereâs an opportunity for smaller players,â said Darren Seifer, food and beverage industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group, âwhich can make them an eventual target for acquisition by some bigger player out there.â The PowerShares Dynamic Food & Beverage Portfolio ETF

He said Wal-Mart is positioning leaders from the company in new roles so it can deliver and win at a time when retail is constantly changing. A Wal-Mart spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The changes come at a time when the worldâs largest retailer has been conducting price tests across several U.S. states and pushing vendors to undercut rivals. The recent entry of German grocery chain Lidl and expansion by another German rival, Aldi [ALDIEI.UL], has raised the stakes for American grocery chain operators. Some of Wal-Martâs key changes include one for Shawn Baldwin, senior vice-president and general merchandise manager for produce and global food sourcing, who will focus on a new initiative for Hispanic customers. The memo did not elaborate  on the initiative. Martin Mundo, who has worked in Argentina and other countries for Wal-Mart, will replace Baldwin. Wal-Mart will also split leadership in its bakery and deli departments, the memo said. Kerry Robinson will be responsible for the bakery business but will no longer oversee the deli business. Tyler Lehr will be responsible for deli services. Wal-Mart also announced leadership changes in its  merchandising operations in a separate memo sent on Friday and seen by Reuters. Deanah Baker will lead all of apparel, shoes and accessories. Scott McCall will oversee the entertainment, toys and seasonal product categories as a general merchandise manager and Jeff Evans will be general merchandise manager for products under the home category.

,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Walmart.com, trailing Amazon.com Inc in the number of goods for sale on its website, is recruiting vendors in China and other countries to boost its online offerings in a pivot away from Wal-Martâs Made-in-America campaign. While there is a financial incentive behind the move, Wal-Mart's decision comes out of necessity: not all the goods its customers want - ranging from jeans to bicycles to beauty products - are manufactured within the United States. That reality pits Wal-Mart against President Donald Trumpâs âMade in Americaâ push. It also risks alienating some of Wal-Martâs existing U.S. vendors since it runs counter to the American-made pledge the retailer made in 2013 in a bid to win customers, and satisfy unions and other critics who said its drive for low cost goods was undermining American jobs. According to two sources with knowledge of the matter, Wal-Mart Stores Inc in February began inviting sellers from China, the United Kingdom and Canada to list on the marketplace section of Walmart.com, where it earns a share of revenue from goods sold and delivered to customers by third-party vendors. Previously, it only allowed U.S. based sellers on the marketplace site, sources said. Calling the unreported move a âmeasured approach,â Wal-Mart Vice-President of Partner Services Michael Trembley confirmed the invite-only program. He said foreign sellers currently make up less than five percent of its seller base. Trembley said Wal-Martâs move is focused on meeting customer demand for different types of products and increasing online assortment. Wal-Martâs marketplace inventory has quintupled this year to 50 million items. That still pales in comparison to Amazonâs nearly 300 million products online, analysts said. Shrinking that gap is key to Wal-Martâs strategy to beat Amazon. Launched in 2009, the marketplace platform contributes more than 10 percent to Wal-Martâs e-commerce revenue, but barely registers in total sales of nearly $486 billion, according to data from e-commerce analytics firm Marketplace Pulse. The data could not be independently verified by Reuters. Amazonâs third-party marketplace, which also uses global vendors from countries like China, contributes to nearly half of Amazonâs retail sales, analysts said. The move brings risks beyond the impact to Wal-Martâs sales. Trump kicked off a âMade in Americaâ week earlier this month where he promised he would take more legal and regulatory steps during the next six months to protect American manufacturers, lashing out against trade deals he said have hurt U.S. companies. Trumpâs comments come as the White House is seeking to renegotiate the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in an effort to shrink the trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. âNo longer will we allow other countries to break the rules, steal our jobs and drain our wealth,â Trump said in a weekly address tweeted by the White House on July 21. âInstead we will follow two simple but very crucial rules: We will buy American and we will hire American.â In a statement on Wednesday, Wal-Mart proposed policy actions to boost U.S. manufacturing which could help capture $300 billion worth of products that are imported. The retailer urged policymakers for simpler regulations on things like Made in USA labeling and modernize trade agreements. Cindi Marsiglio, vice president for U.S. sourcing and manufacturing at Wal-Mart, told Reuters it is on target with its pledge to buy $250 billion worth of American-made products by 2023, and remains committed to boosting U.S. manufacturing. âAGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THEIR âMADE IN AMERICAââ Some of Wal-Martâs existing U.S. vendors - whom Wal-Mart has recruited to supply goods manufactured domestically as part of its highly publicized Made-in-America sourcing plan - are on edge about competition with foreign goods. âIt goes against the spirit of their âMade in Americaâ push,â said one seller of American-made socks to Wal-Mart.com, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of hurting business relations with the retailer. Six out of seven U.S. manufacturers Reuters spoke with who are selling to Walmart.com said they were disappointed with the retailerâs move. Marsiglio said the retailer had not heard any complaints about its move to allow global vendors on its marketplace. âItâs bad timing to start such a program given President Trumpâs push in this direction and the resources they (Wal-Mart) spend on promoting a patriotic image,â said another vendor, who sells pet products. Darius Mir, chief executive of MIA (Made in America) Seating Corp, a Tennessee based seller of office furniture to Wal-Mart.com, said he supports free trade and is open to competition on the platform. But he thinks it would help U.S.-based vendors if Wal-Mart could label âMade in USAâ items listed on its website. âWalmart must distinguish between a âMade In USAâ product from all others by grouping the American made product separately, and highlighting the Made In USA label,â he said. HOLLOWED-OUT MANUFACTURING Wal-Martâs third-party marketplace is part of an overall online initiative that isÂ starting to show growth, with e-commerce sales growing 63 percent during the first quarter. The progress has been led by e-commerce chief Marc Lore, who took over last year after Wal-Mart paid $3.3 billion for Jet.com, an online retail platform he founded. Wal-Martâs Trembley said the retailerâs approach to growing its marketplace, which analysts said has been slow, has been designed to avoid problems like counterfeit products, which is a challenge for rivals Amazon and Alibaba. He said Wal-Mart vets sellers to the third party marketplace and has a high bar for selection. The retailer has also put in place requirements for global vendors that could create U.S. jobs.Â For example, foreign sellers must be able to fulfill orders from a U.S.-based warehouse, they must use a U.S.-based return center and have customer support operating during U.S. business hours, Trembley said. But finding U.S.-based suppliers remains a challenge. Beginning in the 1980s, Wal-Mart led a push to look overseas for inexpensive inventory, and the Made-in-America pushâwith its implied effort to rebuild a hollowed-out manufacturing baseâhas created more publicity than sales, retail consultants and analysts said. Wal-Martâs Marsiglio in an interview in April told Reuters that finding U.S.-based suppliers âremains one of the top challenges across our supplier base.â This week she said one of the ways Wal-Mart is addressing that challenge is by working with existing suppliers and leveraging their manufacturing capacity to produce multiple items. For example, the retailer is working with a playing cards supplier who is now manufacturing plastic cutlery. Wal-Mart had 10,249 sellers on its marketplace at the end of 2017âs first quarter, a substantial jump from 400 in the same period a year ago, according to data from Marketplace Pulse. This compares to millions of sellers on Amazonâs marketplace. But few American consumers are willing to pay higher prices for American-made items. A Reuters Ipsos poll released on Thursday found 70 percent of Americans think it is important to buy U.S.-made products but 37 percent said they wouldnât pay more for U.S.-made goods. âThis all boils down to one thing,â said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder and chief executive of Marketplace Pulse, the e-commerce analytics firm. âWal-Martâs marketplace has not been a success story, but with their renewed focus on e-commerce, they are trying to do everything they can to change that,â he said.

 ,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican authorities said on Sunday they rescued 147 Central Americans abandoned in the wilderness of Veracruz state after suspected human smugglers forced them out of the cramped tractor trailer they were traveling in on their way to the United States. The migrants, 74 from Honduras,Â 59 from Guatemala, 13 from El Salvador and one from Nicaragua were in the back of the poorly ventilated vehicle as they traveled to the border state of Tamaulipas, where they would eventually be smuggled into the United States, Mexicoâs national immigration institute said. Among those rescued were 48 minors, including 14 traveling without an adult companion. They were abandoned near a highway in the city of Ozuluama, Veracruz. Earlier this month, 10 people died and 29 were hospitalized after more than 100 illegal immigrants were packed into a stifling tractor trailer for a 150-mile (240-km) drive from the U.S.-Mexico border to San Antonio, where survivors spilled out into a Walmart parking lot in the Texas city. âAccording to the testimony of migrants, the alleged traffickers, who used the Veracruz-Tampico route, in order to reach the United States, abandoned the migrants in the wilderness, where they were forced to hide in the bushesâ without food or water, the immigration institute said. Personnel from the immigration institute gave medical attention, food and water to the rescued Central Americans and contacted their respective embassies. Plagued by gang violence and poverty, the trio of Central American nations, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, together send the bulk of migrants entering the United States illegally. Turf wars between gangs have sparked a surge in violence in Mexico in the past 18 months, also raising the incentive for some young Mexicans to risk the crossing. ","

The Tax Authority declined to comment and officials at Coca-Cola were unreachable outside of business hours. Under a tax treaty between the United States and Israel, the taxation rate for royalties for use of a trademark is 10 percent, but that rises to 15 percent for industrial royalties.

 ,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy accelerated in the second quarter as consumers ramped up spending and businesses invested more on equipment, but persistent sluggish wage gains cast a dark shadow over the growth outlook. Gross domestic product increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the April-June period, which included a boost from trade, the Commerce Department said in its advance estimate on Friday. That was more than double the first quarterâs downwardly revised 1.2 percent growth pace. Wage growth, however, decelerated despite an unemployment rate that averaged 4.4 percent in the second quarter. Inflation also retreated, appearing to weaken the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again this year. âAlthough growth is solid, the lack of wage pressure buys the Fed plenty of time, and works with a very âgradualâ tightening cycle,â said Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FX strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York. âThere is more here for the Fed doves than the hawks.â Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose after the data but pared gains as oil prices hit two-month highs. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies and stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly lower following recent hefty gains. Economists expect the Fed to announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in September. The U.S. central bank left rates unchanged on Wednesday and said it expected to start winding down its portfolio ârelatively soon.â The Fed has raised rates twice this year. The rise in second-quarter GDP was in line with economistsâ expectations. Output was previously reported to have increased at a 1.4 percent pace in the first quarter. The economy grew 1.9 percent in the first half of 2017, making it unlikely that GDP would top 2.5 percent for the full year. President Donald Trump has set an ambitious 3.0 percent growth target for 2017. Speaking to law enforcement officers in Brentwood, New York, Trump applauded the GDP data and said it was the result of his administrationâs rollback of some business and environmental regulations. âWeâre doing well, weâre doing really well and we took off all those restrictions,â Trump said. âSome weâre statutorily stuck with for a little while, but eventually that statute comes up and weâre going to be able to cut a lot more.â But analysts are skeptical of the Republican presidentâs vow to push through major tax cuts in the wake of his partyâs failure early on Friday in the Senate to pass a bill that would have repealed parts of former President Barack Obamaâs 2010 healthcare law. So far, the political gridlock in Washington has not hurt either business and consumer confidence. A resurgence in consumer spending accounted for the bulk of the pickup in economic growth in the second quarter. Consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, grew at a 2.8 percent rate. That was an acceleration from the 1.9 percent pace logged in the first quarter. But with wage growth remaining sluggish despite the labor market being near full employment, there are concerns that consumer spending could slow in the third quarter. In a separate report on Friday, the Labor Department said wages and salaries increased 0.5. percent in the April-June period after accelerating 0.8 percent in the first quarter. They rose 2.3 percent on a year-on-year basis. There were, however, strong wage gains in the information, finance and natural resources sectors. âA tightening labor market ought to put upward pressure on wage rates, but employers are likely to resist increases as long as they can, given the state of productivity,â said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Inflation was subdued in the second quarter. The Fedâs preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased at a 0.9 percent rate. That was the slowest rise in more than two years and followed a 1.8 percent rate of increase in the first quarter. The gross domestic purchases price index, another measure of inflation pressures in the economy, increased at a 0.8 percent rate after advancing 2.6 percent in the prior quarter. Businesses helped to carry the economy in the second quarter, with spending on equipment jumping at a rate of 8.2 percent, the fastest in nearly two years. It was the third straight quarterly increase. Spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts grew at a 116.7 percent rate, slowing from the first-quarterâs robust 272.1 percent pace. As a result, investment on nonresidential structures increased at a 4.9 percent pace, moderating from the January-March periodâs brisk 14.8 percent rate. Though businesses continued to carefully manage their inventories in the second quarter, they spent more in some places. Inventory investment was neutral to GDP growth after slicing 1.46 percentage points in the first quarter. Trade added 0.18 percentage point to growth, contributing to output for a second straight quarter. Housing was a drag on growth in the last quarter, with investment on homebuilding contracting at a 6.8 percent rate, the worst performance in nearly seven years. Auto production slumped for a third straight quarter, while government spending rebounded after declining in the prior period. Alongside the second-quarter GDP report, the government published revisions to data going back to 2014, which showed little change in the growth picture. ","

Kraft, which is targeting to cut $1.7 billion in costs by the end of 2017, said on Thursday that its selling, general and administrative expenses fell about 15 percent to $760 million in the second quarter ended July 1. This is the fourth straight quarter of double-digit declines in selling, general and administrative expenses. However, the company, which is backed by billionaire-investor Warren Buffett and private equity firm 3G, said revenue fell 1.7 percent to $6.68 billion, the third straight quarter of drop. Analysts on average had expected $6.73 billion. U.S. sales dipped 1.2 percent in the quarter. The region accounts for more than two-thirds of the companyâs total revenue. But analysts did not read much into the decline. âThe revenue line was not as bad as some observers may have feared, especially in light of recent U.S. food trends,â J.P.

If you miss a payment deadline, make that payment within 30 days. A missed payment isn't reported to any credit bureau unless it is made 30 days after the deadline. However, you'll still be responsible for applicable late payment fees (up to $35 with either Walmart card). Keep a low balance on your credit card by paying off the entire balance every month. The amount owed is the second-largest component (30%) of your FICO credit score. By keeping a low credit utilization ratio, you're contributing positively to your credit score. Most credit issuers like to see a credit utilization ratio below 35%. Don't close your credit card account. Your credit score improves as the length of your credit history grows. Even if you stop using your Walmart MasterCard or Walmart credit card, keep them open, especially if they're your first or only credit cards. By enrolling in electronic statements with your Walmart credit card, you can also enroll to receive a monthly FICO credit score to keep track of your progress. Watching your score go up will keep you motivated to keep on building your credit. ",Can a Walmart credit card help you build credit? (WMT) | Investopedia
Annie Pei,08032017,CNBC,07272017,"Despite a flood of analyst upgrades on Wall Street, Snap shares fell 5 percent this week. And two upcoming events could send the stock to fresh lows. The social media company has already tanked 44 percent since its March 2 IPO, and with the stock's lockup period expiring over the weekend and Q2 earnings to follow on August 10, the options market is implying some big moves for the stock. Traders expect Snap to move 10 percent in either direction by next Friday's close following the lockup expiration. This means that Snap does have the potential to bounce back above $15 from Friday's levels. But an even bigger implied move of 16 percent in either direction is expected from Snap's earnings. When Snap reported its first earnings on May 10, the stock tanked 25 percent in the after-hours session. A 16 percent implied move could mean that Snap falls below $12. However, Dan Nathan of RiskReversal.com said Thursday's move in Snap was ""pretty interesting"" and that a ""short squeeze"" might have been in play. This is because Snap shares seemed to have bottomed on Thursday but then reversed, leading Nathan to believe that short sellers may have closed out their positions in Snap.

Marguerite Ward,08032017,CNBC,07272017,"Jeff Bezos, now the world's richest man with a net worth of over $90 billion, loves books. For one, the company that made him a multi-billionaire started as an online book retailer. He's spent his career changing the way books are published and sold, devouring many small bookstores in the process. But on a more personal level, the Amazon founder and CEO also has an abiding love of reading, and it has played a key role in forming him as a leader. In biography ""The Everything Store,"" author Brad Stone describes how books shaped Bezos' leadership style and way of thinking. In fact, Stone writes that there's a list of books Amazon employees refer to as ""Jeff's Reading List."" It includes autobiographies, business and technology reads and even a novel, and according to Stone, many Amazon executives have made their way through these volumes. Ishiguro's novel is a first-person narrative told by a butler who recalls his time serving in the army during the first World War. The book explores the meaning of duty, the pursuit of greatness and the sacrifices that come with both. Stone writes that it is Bezos' favorite novel. ""Bezos has said he learns more from novels than nonfiction,"" Stone writes. This famous management read explains how companies that succeed build environments where ""employees who embrace the central mission flourish,"" Stone writes. ""A video game designer argues that intelligent systems can be created from the bottom up if one devises a set of primitive building blocks,"" Stone writes. ""The book was influential in the creation of Amazon Web Services, or AWS, the service that popularized the notion of the cloud."" Author and business consultant Collins briefed Amazon executives on many of the principles in this book before its publication, according to Stone. It explains how ""companies must confront the brutal facts of their business, find out what they are uniquely good at and master their flywheel, in which each part of the business reinforces and accelerates the other parts."" In this book, Christensen argues that companies improve by embracing disruptive innovation. Michael Bloomberg, founder and CEO of the eponymous company, once described the book as ""absolutely brilliant."" ""An enormously influential business book whose principles Amazon acted on and that facilitated the creation of the Kindle and [Amazon Web Services],"" Stone writes. ""Some companies are reluctant to embrace disruptive technology because it might alienate customers and undermine their core business, but Christensen argues that ignoring potential disruption is even costlier."" ""In his autobiography, Walmart's founder expounds on the principles of discount retailing and discusses his core values of frugality and a bias for action â a willingness to try a lot of things and make many mistakes,"" Stone writes. ""Bezos included both in Amazon's corporate values."" This book explores how major American, European and Japanese companies applied a series of ""lean thinking"" principles in an attempt to cut costs and boost efficiency to survive the 1991 recession and grow over the rest of the decade. ""[The book is] a collection of memos to employees by the chairman of the now defunct investment bank Bear Stearns,"" Stone writes. ""In his memos, Greenberg is constantly restating the bank's core values, especially modesty and frugality."" ""An influential computer scientist makes the counterintuitive argument that small groups of engineers are more effective than larger ones at handling complex software projects,"" Stone writes. ""An exposition of the science of manufacturing written in the guise of the novel, the book encourages companies to identify the biggest constraints in their operations,"" Stone writes, ""and then structure their organizations to get the most out of those constraints."" ""[This is] a guide to using data to measure everything from customer satisfaction to the effectiveness of marketing,"" Stone writes. ""Amazon employees must support all assertions with data, and if the data has a weakness, they must point it out or their colleagues will do it for them."" ""The scholar argues that people are wired to see patterns in chaos while remaining blind to unpredictable events, with massive consequences. Experimentation and empiricism trumps the easy and obvious narrative,"" Stone writes. For Bezos, the most important thing a book can provide is an escape. ""The key thing about a book is that you lose yourself in the author's world,"" Bezos tells The Washington Post.

""Tesla has been the second most active single stock option over the past 20 days â second only to Amazon,"" Mike Khouw of Optimize Advisors said Friday on CNBC's ""Options Action."" Khouw noted that the options market is implying about a 7.5 percent move in either direction, which is significantly higher than the average 5.5 percent move over the past eight quarters. If Tesla moves according to the implied post-earnings expectation of 7.5 percent, that would be about a $4 billion shift in market cap, and could represent the largest earnings-related valuation swing in the company's history. ""We have all of these enormous unknowns like upcoming earnings and what the outcome of the Model 3 is,"" Khouw added. So to play for a move lower, Khouw bought the August 335/310 1x2 put spread for a total of $2.50. This is a bearish bet where one buys a put and then sells two lower strike puts to offset the cost. The goal is for the stock to fall to $310 by August expiration.

Rebecca Ungarino,08032017,CNBC,07272017,"The U.S. dollar continued its slide on Thursday against a basket of foreign currencies, trading near 15-month lows after U.S. services sector data missed economists' expectations early in the session. Currency markets are of particular concern right now to Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, who said in an interview Thursday that he is watching the dollar/euro relationship quite closely. The euro is the top-weighted currency in the dollar index, and the activity in both currencies has widespread impact on equity and commodity markets. ""We have seen a big move in both the dollar and the euro. We are coming to a point here where the euro has become very over-owned and very over-loved, and the dollar has become very under-owned and very over-hated,"" Maley said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" The currency, which has declined over 9 percent year to date, has weakened relative to foreign currencies as the likelihood of future interest-rate hikes from the Federal Reserve has fallen, along with the chances of pro-growth policies passing in Washington. Maley pointed to the Daily Sentiment Index, which measures futures traders' sentiment, flashing very bearish sentiment toward the dollar. Maley also says a reversal in the dollar would cause stock market volatility (measures of which are near record lows) to pick up substantially. ""We have too many people on one side of the boat,"" he said. ""That is the exact opposite of what we had at the beginning of the year, just before the dollar fell out of bed. I think the risks are that we see a multi-week and even a multi-month rally in the dollar. If that takes place, that is going to cause a pickup of volatility in certain markets."" The weaker U.S. dollar has proven beneficial for emerging markets-related equities, such as the EEM exchange-traded fund, which has gained 25 percent year to date. If the dollar sees a reversal and bounces, Maley said, ""it could have an impact not only on emerging markets but on our markets, as well.""

Zameena Mejia,08032017,CNBC,07272017,"The verdict is out: While Silicon Valley is home to many of the most desirable tech companies, it is no longer the tech job mecca. New  data research by jobs and recruiting website Glassdoor shows that in the past five years, the share of software-related roles in San Jose, California, the valley's biggest metro area, has declined. And it's not that there are fewer of these jobs in the United States. In fact, software engineers are the most sought-after employees today. Rather, tech jobs have been moving to other metro areas and sectors, Glassdoor's chief economist Andrew Chamberlain tells CNBC Make It. Chamberlain analyzed all unique job listings (based in the United States) with the word ""software"" in the title â such as software developer and software engineer â available on the website on June 1, 2012. He performed the same analysis for listings on June 1, 2017. Chamberlain highlights that given today's economy and the low unemployment rate in the U.S., job seekers â especially in the software industryâ are in the driver's seat, as they are attractive to prospective employers. Here are the 10 best cities for getting a job in tech beyond Silicon Valley based on the share of software job postings for each respective metro area. From 2012 to 2017, Seattle saw a 6.7% increase in software jobs. Seattle, home to tech giant Microsoft, saw the biggest gains in software hiring. But Chamberlain says this growth is mostly driven by retail giants Amazon and Walmart. As e-commerce has boomed, so have the amount of software jobs in the retail sector. From 2012 to 2017, Washington, D.C. saw a 1.3% increase in software jobs. While tech icons including IBM, HP and Oracle are hiring in Washington, D.C., there are an array of education-based companies such as Lexis Nexis, Cengage and Kaplan to pick from as well. From 2012 to 2017, Detroit saw a 0.8% increase in software jobs. The big auto manufacturers still left there, like Ford and General Motors, are relying more and more heavily on software engineers for automation rather than the old style line production worker manufacturing jobs, Chamberlain says. From 2012 to 2017, Denver saw a 0.7% increase in software jobs. Research from Glassdoor shows software workers living in this and other cities with lower cost of living were able to stretch their dollars further. ""The lower cost of living is just one reason Denver has seen a growing tech presence, and as a result more demand for software-related talent,"" Chamberlain says. Google, for example, has doubled its workforce in Colorado ahead of opening a new campus. From 2012 to 2017, Austin saw a 0.7% increase in software jobs. Some non-traditional tech companies seeking software engineers in this city include iHeartMedia, Home Depot and Indeed, which was voted one of Fortune's best places to work in Texas this year. From 2012 to 2017, San Francisco saw a 0.6% increase in software jobs. Although not very far from Silicon Valley itself, San Francisco currently has nearly 20,000 job listings related to software. Among those are retail company Gap, General Electric and Under Armour. From 2012 to 2017, Dallas- Fort Worth saw a 0.4% increase in software jobs. Companies like AT&T, Match.com and Capital One are among the companies with 12,000 software gigs currently available in this area of Texas. As with several other cities on this list, Dallas has been suspected to have a tech boom for a few years now. From 2012 to 2017, New York City saw a 0.4% increase in software jobs. Chamberlain points out that New York City, as well as San Francisco, is a significant hub in the banking and financial services industry. ""As the industry continues to adopt more technology, from online security payments to mobile banking apps, hiring for software roles have significantly grown,"" Chamberlain tells CNBC Make It. From 2012 to 2017, Orlando saw a 0.3% increase in software jobs. Disney Parks and Resorts Deloitte and Universal Studios are just a few examples of places that are non-traditionally tech companies, but demand software talent. From 2012 to 2017, Dallas- Fort Worth saw a 0.3% increase in software jobs. ""Companies today more than ever are locating new offices in lower cost of living areas that are nearby universities where they can recruit young talented software developers, but they can enjoy a cost of living that can be a factor of ten less in some cases for real estate,"" Chamberlain says. Deutsche Bank, Fidelity and Credit Suisse are a few examples of companies seeking software engineers in these two metro areas. Raleigh alone is home to at least 11 universities and colleges. ""Fresh computer science and engineering grads coming out of universities often want to stay close to where they were they were in school and that provides the labor market for employers,"" Chamberlain tells CNBC Make It.

Over a span of decades, Wal-MartÂ Stores (NYSE:WMT) disrupted and then dominated a huge swath of the retail industry. In the process, the discount behemoth made early investors a fortune along the way. Yet even the best businesses have risks, and it's important to study the threats that could derail your investments. That way, you won't be blindsided by them, and you can identify the key trends you should be watching. On that note, here are the major bear arguments against Wal-Mart. Here's what the bears would say about Wal-Mart Stores. Image source: Getty Images. Wal-Mart, like many brick-and-mortar retailers, is in a vicious fight for survival. The retail giant's store traffic, sales, and margins are all under pressure from the relentless growth of e-commerce juggernaut Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon's ascent has been breathtaking, with the e-commerce titan's revenue up by a factor of 10 over the past decade, and far exceeding Wal-Mart's slightly more than 30% growth during that time. AMZN Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Amazon's torrid growth is a major threat to Wal-Mart. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his team have an unwavering focus on delivering more value to the customer -- and on widening Amazon's competitive moat. To that end, Bezos is notorious for reinvesting Amazon's rising cash flows back into new growth-creating initiatives, which also tend to be value-destroying for its competitors. As an example, Amazon is investing heavily in strengthening its global distribution network, thereby lessening one of Wal-Mart's last remaining advantages: immediacy. With shortening delivery times, the ability to quickly pick up some items at one of Wal-Mart's stores is now less meaningful for customers, compared to simply waiting a day or two -- or even just a few hours in some cases -- for a convenient online delivery from Amazon. Wal-Mart is fighting back by ramping up its own e-commerce operations. It paid $3.3 billion to acquire Jet.com in 2016 and installed its founder and CEO Marc Lore as head of its e-commerce division. Since that time, Lore has gone on a buying spree, snapping up online retailers such as Bonobos in order to broaden Wal-Mart's online brand portfolio and infuse its executive team with experienced e-commerce talent. Lore also spearheaded Wal-Mart's move to offer free shipping on orders over $35, which forced Amazon to lower its free-shipping threshold. And under Lore's tenure, Wal-Mart is aggressively courting online merchants in an attempt to weaken Amazon's network of third-party merchants while strengthening its own. So far, Wal-Mart's efforts appear to be working: Its e-commerce sales surged 63% in the first quarter. Yet the bears would point out that as Wal-Mart has moved to close the gap between itself and Amazon in the e-commerce arena, Amazon has not stood still. In fact, Bezos and company recently launched a major attack on Wal-Mart's most important business: groceries. In June, Amazon agreed to acquire leading organic grocer Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion. Amazon has long dabbled in grocery experiments, but the Whole Foods deal is an outright assault on the $600 billionÂ U.S. grocery industry. It's also a direct attack on Wal-Mart -- the current market leader. Wal-Mart's shares sank on the news, but have since recovered to new 52-week highs. Initial fears that a combined Amazon and Whole Foods would quickly gobble up market share likely subsided when investors realized that Wal-Mart and Whole Foods compete at different ends of the pricing spectrum. Still, the bears would remind us that Amazon has risen to prominence largely due to its low prices, so it's very possible that it will ramp up the ""price investments"" that Whole Foods has already begun to make in recent years. That could make the combined company a larger threat to Wal-Mart's grocery business than many bulls currently believe it could become. Either way, this is a battle that investors should watch closely, as it's likely to be a major determinant of Wal-Mart's stock-price performance in the years ahead. ","

Palbir Nijjar,08032017,Fool,07272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Paying a yield of 2.6%, investors seeking dividend stocks may find Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI)Â an attractive option. The clothing company owns multiple brands including its namesake Hanes, Playtex, and Jockey. The company has increased its payout every year since 2013 and its most recent payout increased more than 36% over the prior year. Image source: Getty Images A consistently growing dividend is a strong signal of business strength but investors should be wary if yields begin to creep up. At first glance, Hanes's dividend yield of 2.6% does not appear to be a concern. It's not much higher than the S&P 500 yield of 1.9%. However, the yield has increased 43% over the past year and although this is generally positive, the reasoning behind the increase can be a red flag. Measured as dividend per share divided by price per share, dividend yields can go up with a combination of two factors -- an increasing payout and/or a declining share price. With consistent annual dividend bumps, Hanesbrands has been increasing its payout. However, its stock price has also taken a hit over the last year, causing its yield to increase. HBI data by YCharts Although Hanes stock has recovered from its 52-week low reached in February, it's still down 13.5% for the year, trailing the S&P 500 by a whopping 27%. When a stock is down double-digits during a bull market, there should be cause for concern. Weak business results can cause a halt in future dividend increases or even worse, an eventual dividend cut. Therefore, Hanesbrands investors seeking yield should take a deeper look at the numbers to see if the company's dividend is sustainable. Why the stock price drop? It's no secret the retail industry is struggling. Brokerage firm Credit Suisse reported 2,056 stores closed in 2016 and indicated more than 8,600 brick-and-mortar stores will close in 2017. To put the latter number in perspective, more stores will close in 2017 than the worst year on record when over 6,000 stores were closed during the great recession in 2008. Hanesbrands is not immune to the retail struggles. Hanes's largest customer, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), accounted for 20% of its net sales in 2016. Last year, the retail giant announced it will close 269 stores. As a result of Wal-Mart and the industry struggles, with the exception of international, 2016 year-over-year sales dropped in each of Hanes's operating segments. Innerwear sales, its largest contributor to revenue, fell 2.7%. Operating segment 2016 2015 Change (%) Innerwear $2,609,754 $2,680,981 Activewear $1,570,972 $1,576,724 International $1,531,913 $1,132,637 Total net sales $6,028,199 $5,731,549 5.2% Data source: Company filings The weak results spilled over into profits as Hanes has failed to beat Wall Street earnings estimates in 4 of the past 6 quarters. There is also concern about Hanes's recent acquisitions and its accumulation of debt to help for them. Last year, the company spent $964 million on acquisitions while adding nearly $1.3 billion in long-term debt on its balance sheet. Its debt to equity ratio today sits at 432%. Dividend analysis A combination of a declining business along with increasing debt can be burdensome on a company's financials. If it begins to struggle making interest payments, a dividend cut will be likely. Let's see if Hanes is in jeopardy. Hanes's trailing-twelve-month (TTM) dividend payout ratio, the total dividend paid to shareholders relative to its net income, came in at a healthy 35%. The company's payout ratio actually came in less than two other popular apparel makers, Gap Inc. and V.F. CorpÂ payout 53% and 64% of their earnings as dividends respectively. The dividend payout ratio is a fine metric to look at but one flaw is that it compares dividends paid, a cash transaction, to earnings, an accounting metric. A more accurate measure to validate the safety of a dividend would be to compare the dividends paid to a company's free cash flow, which is the amount of operating cash available after investing in its business. A quick look at this measure shows that Hanesbrands may have some wiggle room to increase its dividend further. Metric (TTM) FY 2016 Amount Operating cash flow $605,607 Capital expenditures ($83,399) Free cash flow $522,208 Dividends paid $167,375 Dividend-to-FCF-ratio 32% All numbers in thousands. Data source: Annual filings. Hanesbrands still has some dirty laundry Despite a relatively low dividend payout ratio, Hanesbrands investors still have reasons to be concerned. Â Between 2014 and 2016, the company spent over $1.5 billion on acquisitions. Investors shouldn't expect the buying spree to be complete either. Hanesbrands has communicated to investors that acquisitions remainÂ a key component of its long-term growth strategy. Another concern is Hanes's underfunded pension plan. As of the end of its most recent quarter ending in April, Hanesbrands had $375 million in pension liabilities in addition to its $3.7 billion in debt. At some point, Hanesbrands will have to make this liability up. Although Hanesbrands dividend appears to be sustainable over the near-term, investors should keep a close eye on the company to make sure it can meet all its obligations over a longer period. Between maintaining annual dividend increases, meeting long-term obligations to its employees and bondholders, and continuing to make acquisitions, Hanesbrands must be on top of its game. Given its recent business struggles, I'm not sold that the dividend can be sustained unless it either turns things around or slows down the buying spree. ","

During the third quarter last year, the meal-kit delivery service said it was forced to up its marketing spend to attract new customers in response to competition. And in the fourth quarter, it saw many of those customers abandon its service, possibly trying the competitors' services. The scary thing is the competition Blue Apron is talking about are just small start-ups. None have the same scale as Blue Apron. But if a big competitor with established infrastructure and customer bases like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) decides to enter the market, it could easily wipe out Blue Apron's operating profits. Image source: Blue Apron. Following its acquisition agreement with Whole Food Market (NASDAQ:WFM), Amazon subsequently filed a trademark for a meal kit product and started offering said kits to AmazonFresh customers. While AmazonFresh customers represent a small portion of Amazon's customers and are restricted to just a handful of cities, the pilot should provide Amazon with useful data for launching a nationwide service. The addition of Whole Foods stores, which can double as distribution centers for Amazon's grocery business, should enable a nationwide rollout of Amazon's grocery business. Importantly, Amazon has a built-in customer base. It has around 85 million Prime subscribers in the United States, according to the latest estimate from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. That gives Amazon a big marketing funnel to sell meal kits into. It's used a similar tactic for its subscription music streaming service, and it's grabbed about 16 million global subscribers. Amazon has the resources to undercut Blue Apron's pricing thanks to its existing infrastructure and Prime subscription service. It can also spend more on marketing and use its marketing dollars more efficiently. Finally, it could offer a more flexible product than Blue Apron's subscriptions, allowing same-day, one-off orders thanks to potential distribution from Whole Foods. Wal-Mart has over 4,200 Supercenter and Neighborhood Market stores stocked full of groceries, and it's easily the largest grocery chain in the U.S. Blue Apron sees the traditional grocery market as just part of its addressable market along with restaurant spending. Considering groceries make up more than half of Wal-Mart's revenue, it has a vested interest in either preventing services like Blue Apron from taking a share of its business or co-opting the service for itself. Like Amazon, Wal-Mart has superior infrastructure compared to Blue Apron. And with the entire country littered with thousands of stores, it could develop a strong supply chain to deliver meal kits to homes or provide a convenient place for consumers to pick up kits on their way home from work. Wal-Mart already operates online grocery ordering and parking-lot pickup in nearly 670 locations as of the end of the first quarter. On the other hand, Wal-Mart's brand is often associated with low quality. That's a big selling point for Blue Apron -- high-quality ingredients. As such, if Wal-Mart has any intentions on entering the market, it may need to develop a new brand to compete with Blue Apron. Wal-Mart entering the market is just speculation at this point. Unlike Amazon, it's not currently testing any established plans in the market. As Blue Apron grows larger, more and more competitors are popping up and stealing away customers. Its customer acquisition costs have skyrocketed over the last couple years. To be sure, Blue Apron continues to increase its customer base at a strong pace, but it's coming at a much higher cost than its early days. If a big company like Amazon or Wal-Mart takes a serious crack at the meal-kit delivery market, it could absolutely crush Blue Apron. Both have existing businesses that support quickly scaling a meal-kit business, especially considering Amazon's impending acquisition of Whole Foods. While neither has gotten serious about the business yet, it's a very real possibility that it's the next big battle between the two retail giants. That could leave Blue Apron on the sidelines and cost its investors a lot of money. ","

Joseph E. Stiglitz,08032017,MarketWatch,07272017,"Published: July 28, 2017 4:17 p.m. ET Back-room deals on corporate tax reform wonât increase growth By NEW YORK (Project Syndicate) â Although Americaâs right-wing plutocrats may disagree about how to rank the countryâs major problems â for example, inequality, slow growth, low productivity, opioid addiction, poor schools, and deteriorating infrastructure â the solution is always the same: lower taxes and deregulation, to âincentivizeâ investors and âfree upâ the economy. President Donald Trump is counting on this package to make America great again. It wonât, because it never has. When President Ronald Reagan tried it in the 1980s, he claimed that tax revenues would rise. Instead, growth slowed, tax revenues fell, and workers suffered. The big winners in relative terms were corporations and the rich, who benefited from dramatically reduced tax rates. Trump has yet to advance a specific tax proposal. But, unlike his administrationâs approach to health-care legislation, lack of transparency will not help him. While many of the 32 million people projected to lose health insurance under the current proposal donât yet know whatâs coming, that is not true of the companies that will get the short end of the stick from Trumpâs tax reform. Hereâs Trumpâs dilemma. His tax reform must be revenue neutral. Thatâs a political imperative: with corporations sitting on trillions of dollars in cash while ordinary Americans are suffering, lowering the average amount of corporate taxation would be unconscionable â and more so if taxes were lowered for the financial sector, which brought on the 2008 crisis and never paid for the economic damage. Moreover, Senate procedures dictate that to enact tax reform with a simple majority, rather than the three-fifths supermajority required to defeat an almost-certain filibuster by opposition Democrats, the reform must be budget-neutral for 10 years. This requirement means that average corporate-tax revenue must remain the same, which implies that there will be winners and losers: some will pay less than they do now, and others will pay more. One might get away with this in the case of personal income tax, because even if the losers notice, they are not sufficiently organized. By contrast, even small businesses in the United States lobby Congress. Most economists would agree that Americaâs current tax structure is inefficient and unfair. Some firms pay a far higher rate than others. Perhaps innovative firms that create jobs should be rewarded, in part, by a tax break. But the only rhyme or reason to who gets tax breaks appears to be the effectiveness of supplicantsâ lobbyists. One of the most significant problems concerns taxation of U.S. corporationsâ foreign-earned income. Democrats believe that, because U.S. corporations, wherever they operate, benefit from Americaâs rule of law and power to ensure that they are not mistreated (often guaranteed by treaty), they ought to pay for these and other advantages. But a sense of fairness and reciprocity, much less national loyalty, is not deeply ingrained in many U.S. companies, which respond by threatening to move their headquarters abroad. Republicans, partly out of sensitivity to this threat, advocate a territorial tax system, like that used in most countries: taxes should be imposed on economic activity only in the country where it occurs. The concern is that, after imposing a one-off levy on the untaxed profits that U.S. firms hold abroad, introducing a territorial system would generate a tax loss. To offset this, Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, has proposed adding a tax on net imports (imports minus exports). Because net imports lead to job destruction, they should be discouraged. At the same time, so long as U.S. net imports are as high as they are now, the tax would raise enormous revenues. But thereâs the rub: the money must come from someoneâs pocket. Import prices will go up. Consumers of cheap clothing from China will be worse off. To Trumpâs team, this is collateral damage, the inevitable price that must be paid to give Americaâs plutocrats more money. But retailers such as Wal-Mart

                                  Â , not just its customers, are part of the collateral damage, too. Wal-Mart knows this â and wonât let it happen. Other corporate tax reforms might make sense; but they, too, imply winners and losers. And so long as the losers are numerous and organized enough, they are likely to have the power to stop the reform. A politically astute president who understood deeply the economics and politics of corporate tax reform could conceivably muscle Congress toward a reform package that made sense. Trump is not that leader. If corporate tax reform happens at all, it will be a hodge-podge brokered behind closed doors. More likely is a token across-the-board tax cut: the losers will be future generations, out-lobbied by todayâs avaricious moguls, the greediest of whom include those who owe their fortunes to scummy activities, like gambling. The sordidness of all of this will be sugarcoated with the hoary claim that lower tax rates will spur growth. There is simply no theoretical or empirical basis for this, especially in countries like the U.S., where most investment (at the margin) is financed by debt and interest is tax deductible. The marginal return and marginal cost are reduced proportionately, leaving investment largely unchanged. In fact, a closer look, taking into account accelerated depreciation and the effects on risk sharing, shows that lowering the tax rate likely reduces investment. Small countries are the sole exception, because they can pursue beggar-thy-neighbor policies aimed at poaching corporations from their neighbors. But global growth is largely unchanged â the distributive effects actually impede it slightly â as one gains at the expense of the other. (And this assumes that the other does not respond and fuel a race to the bottom.) In a country with so many problems â especially inequality â tax cuts for rich corporations will not solve any of them. This is a lesson for all countries contemplating corporate tax breaks â even those without the misfortune of being led by a callow, craven plutocrat.

Read also: Apple bets that youâll adopt these three tech habits The growth for iPad was a big surprise for a product that has largely been ignored by investors and analysts, who did not bother to ask specific question about the tablet on Tuesdayâs conference call despite its surprising performance. Most analystsâ earnings previews did not even include a breakdown or any comments on the iPad, amid the usual obsession on Wall Street on the iPhone and the timing of the next model. If Apple can keep up sales momentum with the iPad, it could also boost the average sales prices with more sales of the higher priced iPad Pro, which only had one month of sales in the quarter. For a product long seen as an underachieving little brother to the iPhone, sales growth and potential to actually bolster Appleâs finances is quite an accomplishment. Apple stock rose to record levels after the earnings results were released, and surged 6.3% at Wednesdayâs open.

                                  Â  could impact Kraft, given fears that Kraft may be asked to âhelpâ by cutting its prices. Kraft Chief Operating Officer George Zoghbi responded by saying, âthe price competition among retailers is not like something new,â according to a transcript of the call provided by FactSet. âOf course, weâd have to be mindful of the impact on us, particularly the one that we watch for the most is the equity, the impact on the equity of our brands, because we have certain expectation where we position our brands.â But perhaps what is more important for investors isnât how much the company made on the products it sold, but how many products it actually sold. RBC Capital analyst David Palmer trimmed his second-quarter earnings estimate this week, but he said that was primarily to reflect revenue declines in the U.S. and tough year-over-year sales comparisons in Europe. Kraft is expected to report earnings per share that rise from year-ago levels for the fourth straight quarter. Although the company missed the FactSet EPS consensus in the first quarter, it had beaten expectations in nine of the previous 10 quarters. But revenue is a different story, as FactSet consensus is calling for a fourth straight quarter of declines. The company missed revenue expectations last quarter, and has for 12 of the past 16 quarters. In the first quarter, sales declined in nine of Kraftâs 11 product categories, including its largest categories â condiments and sauces, and cheese and dairy. The only categories seeing growth were frozen and chilled meats, and âother.â Kraft Chief Executive Bernardo Hees said back then that product innovations and geographic expansion had positioned the company âto drive organic sales growth for the balance of 2017 and beyond.â Investors will find out after Thursdayâs closing bell whether the company can deliver. Here are some other things to watch for: Earnings: Kraft Heinz is expected to report adjusted EPS, which excludes nonrecurring items, of 95 cents a share, according to the average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by FactSet. That compares with EPS of 85 cents in the same period a year ago. On March 31, the FactSet EPS consensus was $1.02. Revenue: The FactSet revenue consensus is $6.73 billion, which is down from $6.79 billion in the same quarter last year. On March 31, analysts were expecting revenue to rise to $6.87 billion. Stock price: There is no guarantee that Kraftâs stock will rise if results beat expectations. Although Kraft missed first-quarter profit and revenue, the stock rose 0.6% on the day after the report was released. After fourth-quarter 2016 results, in which earnings and revenue topped expectations, the stock fell 4.2%. Over the past three years, the stock has fallen on the day after results eight times, by an average of 3.0%, while the stock has climbed 3.0% on average on the days that it has gained. The average rating of analysts surveyed by FactSet is the equivalent of overweight, while the average price target of $95.84 is 9.6% above current levels. The stock inched up 0.1% year to date through morning trade Thursday, while the SPDR Consumer Staples Select Sector exchange-traded fund

,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"Charles Redfield, executive vice-president for food at Wal-Mart U.S., unveiled the changes in the memo dated Friday and seen by Reuters. He said Wal-Mart is positioning leaders from the company in new roles so it can deliver and win at a time when retail is constantly changing. A Wal-Mart spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The changes come at a time when the worldâs largest retailer has been conducting price tests across several U.S. states and pushing vendors to undercut rivals. The recent entry of German grocery chain Lidl and expansion by another German rival, Aldi [ALDIEI.UL], has raised the stakes for American grocery chain operators. Some of Wal-Martâs key changes include one for Shawn Baldwin, senior vice-president and general merchandise manager for produce and global food sourcing, who will focus on a new initiative for Hispanic customers. The memo did not elaborate  on the initiative. Martin Mundo, who has worked in Argentina and other countries for Wal-Mart, will replace Baldwin. Wal-Mart will also split leadership in its bakery and deli departments, the memo said. Kerry Robinson will be responsible for the bakery business but will no longer oversee the deli business. Tyler Lehr will be responsible for deli services. Wal-Mart also announced leadership changes in its  merchandising operations in a separate memo sent on Friday and seen by Reuters. Deanah Baker will lead all of apparel, shoes and accessories. Scott McCall will oversee the entertainment, toys and seasonal product categories as a general merchandise manager and Jeff Evans will be general merchandise manager for products under the home category. The company also named Greg Hall as senior vice-president of merchandise operation for food among several other moves in the merchandising team.

,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Walmart.com, trailing Amazon.com Inc in the number of goods for sale on its website, is recruiting vendors in China and other countries to boost its online offerings in a pivot away from Wal-Martâs Made-in-America campaign. While there is a financial incentive behind the move, Wal-Mart's decision comes out of necessity: not all the goods its customers want - ranging from jeans to bicycles to beauty products - are manufactured within the United States. That reality pits Wal-Mart against President Donald Trumpâs âMade in Americaâ push. It also risks alienating some of Wal-Martâs existing U.S. vendors since it runs counter to the American-made pledge the retailer made in 2013 in a bid to win customers, and satisfy unions and other critics who said its drive for low cost goods was undermining American jobs. According to two sources with knowledge of the matter, Wal-Mart Stores Inc in February began inviting sellers from China, the United Kingdom and Canada to list on the marketplace section of Walmart.com, where it earns a share of revenue from goods sold and delivered to customers by third-party vendors. Previously, it only allowed U.S. based sellers on the marketplace site, sources said. Calling the unreported move a âmeasured approach,â Wal-Mart Vice-President of Partner Services Michael Trembley confirmed the invite-only program. He said foreign sellers currently make up less than five percent of its seller base. Trembley said Wal-Martâs move is focused on meeting customer demand for different types of products and increasing online assortment. Wal-Martâs marketplace inventory has quintupled this year to 50 million items. That still pales in comparison to Amazonâs nearly 300 million products online, analysts said. Shrinking that gap is key to Wal-Martâs strategy to beat Amazon. Launched in 2009, the marketplace platform contributes more than 10 percent to Wal-Martâs e-commerce revenue, but barely registers in total sales of nearly $486 billion, according to data from e-commerce analytics firm Marketplace Pulse. The data could not be independently verified by Reuters. Amazonâs third-party marketplace, which also uses global vendors from countries like China, contributes to nearly half of Amazonâs retail sales, analysts said. The move brings risks beyond the impact to Wal-Martâs sales. Trump kicked off a âMade in Americaâ week earlier this month where he promised he would take more legal and regulatory steps during the next six months to protect American manufacturers, lashing out against trade deals he said have hurt U.S. companies. Trumpâs comments come as the White House is seeking to renegotiate the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in an effort to shrink the trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. âNo longer will we allow other countries to break the rules, steal our jobs and drain our wealth,â Trump said in a weekly address tweeted by the White House on July 21. âInstead we will follow two simple but very crucial rules: We will buy American and we will hire American.â In a statement on Wednesday, Wal-Mart proposed policy actions to boost U.S. manufacturing which could help capture $300 billion worth of products that are imported. The retailer urged policymakers for simpler regulations on things like Made in USA labeling and modernize trade agreements. Cindi Marsiglio, vice president for U.S. sourcing and manufacturing at Wal-Mart, told Reuters it is on target with its pledge to buy $250 billion worth of American-made products by 2023, and remains committed to boosting U.S. manufacturing. âAGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THEIR âMADE IN AMERICAââ Some of Wal-Martâs existing U.S. vendors - whom Wal-Mart has recruited to supply goods manufactured domestically as part of its highly publicized Made-in-America sourcing plan - are on edge about competition with foreign goods. âIt goes against the spirit of their âMade in Americaâ push,â said one seller of American-made socks to Wal-Mart.com, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of hurting business relations with the retailer. Six out of seven U.S. manufacturers Reuters spoke with who are selling to Walmart.com said they were disappointed with the retailerâs move. Marsiglio said the retailer had not heard any complaints about its move to allow global vendors on its marketplace. âItâs bad timing to start such a program given President Trumpâs push in this direction and the resources they (Wal-Mart) spend on promoting a patriotic image,â said another vendor, who sells pet products. Darius Mir, chief executive of MIA (Made in America) Seating Corp, a Tennessee based seller of office furniture to Wal-Mart.com, said he supports free trade and is open to competition on the platform. But he thinks it would help U.S.-based vendors if Wal-Mart could label âMade in USAâ items listed on its website. âWalmart must distinguish between a âMade In USAâ product from all others by grouping the American made product separately, and highlighting the Made In USA label,â he said. HOLLOWED-OUT MANUFACTURING Wal-Martâs third-party marketplace is part of an overall online initiative that isÂ starting to show growth, with e-commerce sales growing 63 percent during the first quarter. The progress has been led by e-commerce chief Marc Lore, who took over last year after Wal-Mart paid $3.3 billion for Jet.com, an online retail platform he founded. Wal-Martâs Trembley said the retailerâs approach to growing its marketplace, which analysts said has been slow, has been designed to avoid problems like counterfeit products, which is a challenge for rivals Amazon and Alibaba. He said Wal-Mart vets sellers to the third party marketplace and has a high bar for selection. The retailer has also put in place requirements for global vendors that could create U.S. jobs.Â For example, foreign sellers must be able to fulfill orders from a U.S.-based warehouse, they must use a U.S.-based return center and have customer support operating during U.S. business hours, Trembley said. But finding U.S.-based suppliers remains a challenge. Beginning in the 1980s, Wal-Mart led a push to look overseas for inexpensive inventory, and the Made-in-America pushâwith its implied effort to rebuild a hollowed-out manufacturing baseâhas created more publicity than sales, retail consultants and analysts said. Wal-Martâs Marsiglio in an interview in April told Reuters that finding U.S.-based suppliers âremains one of the top challenges across our supplier base.â This week she said one of the ways Wal-Mart is addressing that challenge is by working with existing suppliers and leveraging their manufacturing capacity to produce multiple items. For example, the retailer is working with a playing cards supplier who is now manufacturing plastic cutlery. Wal-Mart had 10,249 sellers on its marketplace at the end of 2017âs first quarter, a substantial jump from 400 in the same period a year ago, according to data from Marketplace Pulse. This compares to millions of sellers on Amazonâs marketplace. But few American consumers are willing to pay higher prices for American-made items. A Reuters Ipsos poll released on Thursday found 70 percent of Americans think it is important to buy U.S.-made products but 37 percent said they wouldnât pay more for U.S.-made goods. âThis all boils down to one thing,â said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder and chief executive of Marketplace Pulse, the e-commerce analytics firm. âWal-Martâs marketplace has not been a success story, but with their renewed focus on e-commerce, they are trying to do everything they can to change that,â he said.

 ,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican authorities said on Sunday they rescued 147 Central Americans abandoned in the wilderness of Veracruz state after suspected human smugglers forced them out of the cramped tractor trailer they were traveling in on their way to the United States. The migrants, 74 from Honduras,Â 59 from Guatemala, 13 from El Salvador and one from Nicaragua were in the back of the poorly ventilated vehicle as they traveled to the border state of Tamaulipas, where they would eventually be smuggled into the United States, Mexicoâs national immigration institute said. Among those rescued were 48 minors, including 14 traveling without an adult companion. They were abandoned near a highway in the city of Ozuluama, Veracruz. Earlier this month, 10 people died and 29 were hospitalized after more than 100 illegal immigrants were packed into a stifling tractor trailer for a 150-mile (240-km) drive from the U.S.-Mexico border to San Antonio, where survivors spilled out into a Walmart parking lot in the Texas city. âAccording to the testimony of migrants, the alleged traffickers, who used the Veracruz-Tampico route, in order to reach the United States, abandoned the migrants in the wilderness, where they were forced to hide in the bushesâ without food or water, the immigration institute said. Personnel from the immigration institute gave medical attention, food and water to the rescued Central Americans and contacted their respective embassies. Plagued by gang violence and poverty, the trio of Central American nations, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, together send the bulk of migrants entering the United States illegally. Turf wars between gangs have sparked a surge in violence in Mexico in the past 18 months, also raising the incentive for some young Mexicans to risk the crossing. ","

Three leading Israeli newspapers said the tax bill is based on royalties of about 1 billion shekels transferred in recent years to Coca-Cola from Central Bottling Co, the Israel franchiser of Coca-Cola. The Tax Authority declined to comment and officials at Coca-Cola were unreachable outside of business hours. Under a tax treaty between the United States and Israel, the taxation rate for royalties for use of a trademark is 10 percent, but that rises to 15 percent for industrial royalties. Haaretz newspaper said normally the tax would have been deducted at the source, but the tax authority could not do this because Coca-Cola does not have a local corporate presence.

 ,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy accelerated in the second quarter as consumers ramped up spending and businesses invested more on equipment, but persistent sluggish wage gains cast a dark shadow over the growth outlook. Gross domestic product increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the April-June period, which included a boost from trade, the Commerce Department said in its advance estimate on Friday. That was more than double the first quarterâs downwardly revised 1.2 percent growth pace. Wage growth, however, decelerated despite an unemployment rate that averaged 4.4 percent in the second quarter. Inflation also retreated, appearing to weaken the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again this year. âAlthough growth is solid, the lack of wage pressure buys the Fed plenty of time, and works with a very âgradualâ tightening cycle,â said Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FX strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York. âThere is more here for the Fed doves than the hawks.â Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose after the data but pared gains as oil prices hit two-month highs. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies and stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly lower following recent hefty gains. Economists expect the Fed to announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in September. The U.S. central bank left rates unchanged on Wednesday and said it expected to start winding down its portfolio ârelatively soon.â The Fed has raised rates twice this year. The rise in second-quarter GDP was in line with economistsâ expectations. Output was previously reported to have increased at a 1.4 percent pace in the first quarter. The economy grew 1.9 percent in the first half of 2017, making it unlikely that GDP would top 2.5 percent for the full year. President Donald Trump has set an ambitious 3.0 percent growth target for 2017. Speaking to law enforcement officers in Brentwood, New York, Trump applauded the GDP data and said it was the result of his administrationâs rollback of some business and environmental regulations. âWeâre doing well, weâre doing really well and we took off all those restrictions,â Trump said. âSome weâre statutorily stuck with for a little while, but eventually that statute comes up and weâre going to be able to cut a lot more.â But analysts are skeptical of the Republican presidentâs vow to push through major tax cuts in the wake of his partyâs failure early on Friday in the Senate to pass a bill that would have repealed parts of former President Barack Obamaâs 2010 healthcare law. So far, the political gridlock in Washington has not hurt either business and consumer confidence. A resurgence in consumer spending accounted for the bulk of the pickup in economic growth in the second quarter. Consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, grew at a 2.8 percent rate. That was an acceleration from the 1.9 percent pace logged in the first quarter. But with wage growth remaining sluggish despite the labor market being near full employment, there are concerns that consumer spending could slow in the third quarter. In a separate report on Friday, the Labor Department said wages and salaries increased 0.5. percent in the April-June period after accelerating 0.8 percent in the first quarter. They rose 2.3 percent on a year-on-year basis. There were, however, strong wage gains in the information, finance and natural resources sectors. âA tightening labor market ought to put upward pressure on wage rates, but employers are likely to resist increases as long as they can, given the state of productivity,â said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Inflation was subdued in the second quarter. The Fedâs preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased at a 0.9 percent rate. That was the slowest rise in more than two years and followed a 1.8 percent rate of increase in the first quarter. The gross domestic purchases price index, another measure of inflation pressures in the economy, increased at a 0.8 percent rate after advancing 2.6 percent in the prior quarter. Businesses helped to carry the economy in the second quarter, with spending on equipment jumping at a rate of 8.2 percent, the fastest in nearly two years. It was the third straight quarterly increase. Spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts grew at a 116.7 percent rate, slowing from the first-quarterâs robust 272.1 percent pace. As a result, investment on nonresidential structures increased at a 4.9 percent pace, moderating from the January-March periodâs brisk 14.8 percent rate. Though businesses continued to carefully manage their inventories in the second quarter, they spent more in some places. Inventory investment was neutral to GDP growth after slicing 1.46 percentage points in the first quarter. Trade added 0.18 percentage point to growth, contributing to output for a second straight quarter. Housing was a drag on growth in the last quarter, with investment on homebuilding contracting at a 6.8 percent rate, the worst performance in nearly seven years. Auto production slumped for a third straight quarter, while government spending rebounded after declining in the prior period. Alongside the second-quarter GDP report, the government published revisions to data going back to 2014, which showed little change in the growth picture. ","

 ,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"Shares of North Americaâs third-largest food and beverages company were marginally up at $87.50 in after-market trading. Kraft, which is targeting to cut $1.7 billion in costs by the end of 2017, said on Thursday that its selling, general and administrative expenses fell about 15 percent to $760 million in the second quarter ended July 1. This is the fourth straight quarter of double-digit declines in selling, general and administrative expenses. However, the company, which is backed by billionaire-investor Warren Buffett and private equity firm 3G, said revenue fell 1.7 percent to $6.68 billion, the third straight quarter of drop. Analysts on average had expected $6.73 billion. U.S. sales dipped 1.2 percent in the quarter. The region accounts for more than two-thirds of the companyâs total revenue. But analysts did not read much into the decline. âThe revenue line was not as bad as some observers may have feared, especially in light of recent U.S. food trends,â J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman wrote, adding that Kraftâs 0.9 percent drop in organic sales is better than numbers posted by peers. Kraft Heinz has responded by launching products such as no salt-, no sugar-added Heinz Beanz and a new line of premium pasta sauces under the Classico Riserva brand with no artificial ingredients or added sugar. The company has also relaunched Kool-Aid Jammers with fewer calories and no preservatives. Kraftâs net income surged 50.5 percent to $1.16 billion, or 94 cents per share, in the latest quarter. Excluding certain items, the company earned 98 cents per share, 3 cents ahead of analystsâ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also benefited from refinancing its Series A preferred stock a year earlier. Kraft also raised its quarterly dividend to 63 cents per share from 60 cents. ","

Annie Pei,08032017,CNBC,07272017,"Despite a flood of analyst upgrades on Wall Street, Snap shares fell 5 percent this week. And two upcoming events could send the stock to fresh lows. The social media company has already tanked 44 percent since its March 2 IPO, and with the stock's lockup period expiring over the weekend and Q2 earnings to follow on August 10, the options market is implying some big moves for the stock. Traders expect Snap to move 10 percent in either direction by next Friday's close following the lockup expiration. This means that Snap does have the potential to bounce back above $15 from Friday's levels. But an even bigger implied move of 16 percent in either direction is expected from Snap's earnings. When Snap reported its first earnings on May 10, the stock tanked 25 percent in the after-hours session. A 16 percent implied move could mean that Snap falls below $12. However, Dan Nathan of RiskReversal.com said Thursday's move in Snap was ""pretty interesting"" and that a ""short squeeze"" might have been in play. This is because Snap shares seemed to have bottomed on Thursday but then reversed, leading Nathan to believe that short sellers may have closed out their positions in Snap. ""People are expecting a lot of downside volatility, and sentiment is horrible,"" said Nathan Thursday on CNBC's ""Fast Money.""

Marguerite Ward,08032017,CNBC,07272017,"Jeff Bezos, now the world's richest man with a net worth of over $90 billion, loves books. For one, the company that made him a multi-billionaire started as an online book retailer. He's spent his career changing the way books are published and sold, devouring many small bookstores in the process. But on a more personal level, the Amazon founder and CEO also has an abiding love of reading, and it has played a key role in forming him as a leader. In biography ""The Everything Store,"" author Brad Stone describes how books shaped Bezos' leadership style and way of thinking. In fact, Stone writes that there's a list of books Amazon employees refer to as ""Jeff's Reading List."" It includes autobiographies, business and technology reads and even a novel, and according to Stone, many Amazon executives have made their way through these volumes. Ishiguro's novel is a first-person narrative told by a butler who recalls his time serving in the army during the first World War. The book explores the meaning of duty, the pursuit of greatness and the sacrifices that come with both. Stone writes that it is Bezos' favorite novel. ""Bezos has said he learns more from novels than nonfiction,"" Stone writes. This famous management read explains how companies that succeed build environments where ""employees who embrace the central mission flourish,"" Stone writes. ""A video game designer argues that intelligent systems can be created from the bottom up if one devises a set of primitive building blocks,"" Stone writes. ""The book was influential in the creation of Amazon Web Services, or AWS, the service that popularized the notion of the cloud."" Author and business consultant Collins briefed Amazon executives on many of the principles in this book before its publication, according to Stone. It explains how ""companies must confront the brutal facts of their business, find out what they are uniquely good at and master their flywheel, in which each part of the business reinforces and accelerates the other parts."" In this book, Christensen argues that companies improve by embracing disruptive innovation. Michael Bloomberg, founder and CEO of the eponymous company, once described the book as ""absolutely brilliant."" ""An enormously influential business book whose principles Amazon acted on and that facilitated the creation of the Kindle and [Amazon Web Services],"" Stone writes. ""Some companies are reluctant to embrace disruptive technology because it might alienate customers and undermine their core business, but Christensen argues that ignoring potential disruption is even costlier."" ""In his autobiography, Walmart's founder expounds on the principles of discount retailing and discusses his core values of frugality and a bias for action â a willingness to try a lot of things and make many mistakes,"" Stone writes. ""Bezos included both in Amazon's corporate values."" This book explores how major American, European and Japanese companies applied a series of ""lean thinking"" principles in an attempt to cut costs and boost efficiency to survive the 1991 recession and grow over the rest of the decade. ""[The book is] a collection of memos to employees by the chairman of the now defunct investment bank Bear Stearns,"" Stone writes. ""In his memos, Greenberg is constantly restating the bank's core values, especially modesty and frugality."" ""An influential computer scientist makes the counterintuitive argument that small groups of engineers are more effective than larger ones at handling complex software projects,"" Stone writes. ""An exposition of the science of manufacturing written in the guise of the novel, the book encourages companies to identify the biggest constraints in their operations,"" Stone writes, ""and then structure their organizations to get the most out of those constraints."" ""[This is] a guide to using data to measure everything from customer satisfaction to the effectiveness of marketing,"" Stone writes. ""Amazon employees must support all assertions with data, and if the data has a weakness, they must point it out or their colleagues will do it for them."" ""The scholar argues that people are wired to see patterns in chaos while remaining blind to unpredictable events, with massive consequences. Experimentation and empiricism trumps the easy and obvious narrative,"" Stone writes. For Bezos, the most important thing a book can provide is an escape. ""The key thing about a book is that you lose yourself in the author's world,"" Bezos tells The Washington Post.

""Tesla has been the second most active single stock option over the past 20 days â second only to Amazon,"" Mike Khouw of Optimize Advisors said Friday on CNBC's ""Options Action."" Khouw noted that the options market is implying about a 7.5 percent move in either direction, which is significantly higher than the average 5.5 percent move over the past eight quarters. If Tesla moves according to the implied post-earnings expectation of 7.5 percent, that would be about a $4 billion shift in market cap, and could represent the largest earnings-related valuation swing in the company's history. ""We have all of these enormous unknowns like upcoming earnings and what the outcome of the Model 3 is,"" Khouw added. So to play for a move lower, Khouw bought the August 335/310 1x2 put spread for a total of $2.50. This is a bearish bet where one buys a put and then sells two lower strike puts to offset the cost. The goal is for the stock to fall to $310 by August expiration. ""This is a stock, if we have a five-to-six-year chart of it ... almost every year, almost like clockwork, there's been a 30, 35 percent peak-to-trough decline in this thing,"" Dan Nathan of RiskReversal.com added.

Rebecca Ungarino,08032017,CNBC,07272017,"The U.S. dollar continued its slide on Thursday against a basket of foreign currencies, trading near 15-month lows after U.S. services sector data missed economists' expectations early in the session. Currency markets are of particular concern right now to Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, who said in an interview Thursday that he is watching the dollar/euro relationship quite closely. The euro is the top-weighted currency in the dollar index, and the activity in both currencies has widespread impact on equity and commodity markets. ""We have seen a big move in both the dollar and the euro. We are coming to a point here where the euro has become very over-owned and very over-loved, and the dollar has become very under-owned and very over-hated,"" Maley said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" The currency, which has declined over 9 percent year to date, has weakened relative to foreign currencies as the likelihood of future interest-rate hikes from the Federal Reserve has fallen, along with the chances of pro-growth policies passing in Washington. Maley pointed to the Daily Sentiment Index, which measures futures traders' sentiment, flashing very bearish sentiment toward the dollar. Maley also says a reversal in the dollar would cause stock market volatility (measures of which are near record lows) to pick up substantially. ""We have too many people on one side of the boat,"" he said. ""That is the exact opposite of what we had at the beginning of the year, just before the dollar fell out of bed. I think the risks are that we see a multi-week and even a multi-month rally in the dollar. If that takes place, that is going to cause a pickup of volatility in certain markets."" The weaker U.S. dollar has proven beneficial for emerging markets-related equities, such as the EEM exchange-traded fund, which has gained 25 percent year to date. If the dollar sees a reversal and bounces, Maley said, ""it could have an impact not only on emerging markets but on our markets, as well.""

Zameena Mejia,08032017,CNBC,07272017,"The verdict is out: While Silicon Valley is home to many of the most desirable tech companies, it is no longer the tech job mecca. New  data research by jobs and recruiting website Glassdoor shows that in the past five years, the share of software-related roles in San Jose, California, the valley's biggest metro area, has declined. And it's not that there are fewer of these jobs in the United States. In fact, software engineers are the most sought-after employees today. Rather, tech jobs have been moving to other metro areas and sectors, Glassdoor's chief economist Andrew Chamberlain tells CNBC Make It. Chamberlain analyzed all unique job listings (based in the United States) with the word ""software"" in the title â such as software developer and software engineer â available on the website on June 1, 2012. He performed the same analysis for listings on June 1, 2017. Chamberlain highlights that given today's economy and the low unemployment rate in the U.S., job seekers â especially in the software industryâ are in the driver's seat, as they are attractive to prospective employers. Here are the 10 best cities for getting a job in tech beyond Silicon Valley based on the share of software job postings for each respective metro area. From 2012 to 2017, Seattle saw a 6.7% increase in software jobs. Seattle, home to tech giant Microsoft, saw the biggest gains in software hiring. But Chamberlain says this growth is mostly driven by retail giants Amazon and Walmart. As e-commerce has boomed, so have the amount of software jobs in the retail sector. From 2012 to 2017, Washington, D.C. saw a 1.3% increase in software jobs. While tech icons including IBM, HP and Oracle are hiring in Washington, D.C., there are an array of education-based companies such as Lexis Nexis, Cengage and Kaplan to pick from as well. From 2012 to 2017, Detroit saw a 0.8% increase in software jobs. The big auto manufacturers still left there, like Ford and General Motors, are relying more and more heavily on software engineers for automation rather than the old style line production worker manufacturing jobs, Chamberlain says. From 2012 to 2017, Denver saw a 0.7% increase in software jobs. Research from Glassdoor shows software workers living in this and other cities with lower cost of living were able to stretch their dollars further. ""The lower cost of living is just one reason Denver has seen a growing tech presence, and as a result more demand for software-related talent,"" Chamberlain says. Google, for example, has doubled its workforce in Colorado ahead of opening a new campus. From 2012 to 2017, Austin saw a 0.7% increase in software jobs. Some non-traditional tech companies seeking software engineers in this city include iHeartMedia, Home Depot and Indeed, which was voted one of Fortune's best places to work in Texas this year. From 2012 to 2017, San Francisco saw a 0.6% increase in software jobs. Although not very far from Silicon Valley itself, San Francisco currently has nearly 20,000 job listings related to software. Among those are retail company Gap, General Electric and Under Armour. From 2012 to 2017, Dallas- Fort Worth saw a 0.4% increase in software jobs. Companies like AT&T, Match.com and Capital One are among the companies with 12,000 software gigs currently available in this area of Texas. As with several other cities on this list, Dallas has been suspected to have a tech boom for a few years now. From 2012 to 2017, New York City saw a 0.4% increase in software jobs. Chamberlain points out that New York City, as well as San Francisco, is a significant hub in the banking and financial services industry. ""As the industry continues to adopt more technology, from online security payments to mobile banking apps, hiring for software roles have significantly grown,"" Chamberlain tells CNBC Make It. From 2012 to 2017, Orlando saw a 0.3% increase in software jobs. Disney Parks and Resorts Deloitte and Universal Studios are just a few examples of places that are non-traditionally tech companies, but demand software talent. From 2012 to 2017, Dallas- Fort Worth saw a 0.3% increase in software jobs. ""Companies today more than ever are locating new offices in lower cost of living areas that are nearby universities where they can recruit young talented software developers, but they can enjoy a cost of living that can be a factor of ten less in some cases for real estate,"" Chamberlain says. Deutsche Bank, Fidelity and Credit Suisse are a few examples of companies seeking software engineers in these two metro areas. Raleigh alone is home to at least 11 universities and colleges. ""Fresh computer science and engineering grads coming out of universities often want to stay close to where they were they were in school and that provides the labor market for employers,"" Chamberlain tells CNBC Make It.

Over a span of decades, Wal-MartÂ Stores (NYSE:WMT) disrupted and then dominated a huge swath of the retail industry. In the process, the discount behemoth made early investors a fortune along the way. Yet even the best businesses have risks, and it's important to study the threats that could derail your investments. That way, you won't be blindsided by them, and you can identify the key trends you should be watching. On that note, here are the major bear arguments against Wal-Mart. Here's what the bears would say about Wal-Mart Stores. Image source: Getty Images. Wal-Mart, like many brick-and-mortar retailers, is in a vicious fight for survival. The retail giant's store traffic, sales, and margins are all under pressure from the relentless growth of e-commerce juggernaut Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon's ascent has been breathtaking, with the e-commerce titan's revenue up by a factor of 10 over the past decade, and far exceeding Wal-Mart's slightly more than 30% growth during that time. AMZN Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Amazon's torrid growth is a major threat to Wal-Mart. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his team have an unwavering focus on delivering more value to the customer -- and on widening Amazon's competitive moat. To that end, Bezos is notorious for reinvesting Amazon's rising cash flows back into new growth-creating initiatives, which also tend to be value-destroying for its competitors. As an example, Amazon is investing heavily in strengthening its global distribution network, thereby lessening one of Wal-Mart's last remaining advantages: immediacy. With shortening delivery times, the ability to quickly pick up some items at one of Wal-Mart's stores is now less meaningful for customers, compared to simply waiting a day or two -- or even just a few hours in some cases -- for a convenient online delivery from Amazon. Wal-Mart is fighting back by ramping up its own e-commerce operations. It paid $3.3 billion to acquire Jet.com in 2016 and installed its founder and CEO Marc Lore as head of its e-commerce division. Since that time, Lore has gone on a buying spree, snapping up online retailers such as Bonobos in order to broaden Wal-Mart's online brand portfolio and infuse its executive team with experienced e-commerce talent. Lore also spearheaded Wal-Mart's move to offer free shipping on orders over $35, which forced Amazon to lower its free-shipping threshold. And under Lore's tenure, Wal-Mart is aggressively courting online merchants in an attempt to weaken Amazon's network of third-party merchants while strengthening its own. So far, Wal-Mart's efforts appear to be working: Its e-commerce sales surged 63% in the first quarter. Yet the bears would point out that as Wal-Mart has moved to close the gap between itself and Amazon in the e-commerce arena, Amazon has not stood still. In fact, Bezos and company recently launched a major attack on Wal-Mart's most important business: groceries. In June, Amazon agreed to acquire leading organic grocer Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion. Amazon has long dabbled in grocery experiments, but the Whole Foods deal is an outright assault on the $600 billionÂ U.S. grocery industry. It's also a direct attack on Wal-Mart -- the current market leader. Wal-Mart's shares sank on the news, but have since recovered to new 52-week highs. Initial fears that a combined Amazon and Whole Foods would quickly gobble up market share likely subsided when investors realized that Wal-Mart and Whole Foods compete at different ends of the pricing spectrum. Still, the bears would remind us that Amazon has risen to prominence largely due to its low prices, so it's very possible that it will ramp up the ""price investments"" that Whole Foods has already begun to make in recent years. That could make the combined company a larger threat to Wal-Mart's grocery business than many bulls currently believe it could become. Either way, this is a battle that investors should watch closely, as it's likely to be a major determinant of Wal-Mart's stock-price performance in the years ahead. ","
      
    Wal-Mart Stores Inc: The Bear Case From a Bull -- The Motley Fool

Palbir Nijjar,08032017,Fool,07272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Paying a yield of 2.6%, investors seeking dividend stocks may find Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI)Â an attractive option. The clothing company owns multiple brands including its namesake Hanes, Playtex, and Jockey. The company has increased its payout every year since 2013 and its most recent payout increased more than 36% over the prior year. Image source: Getty Images A consistently growing dividend is a strong signal of business strength but investors should be wary if yields begin to creep up. At first glance, Hanes's dividend yield of 2.6% does not appear to be a concern. It's not much higher than the S&P 500 yield of 1.9%. However, the yield has increased 43% over the past year and although this is generally positive, the reasoning behind the increase can be a red flag. Measured as dividend per share divided by price per share, dividend yields can go up with a combination of two factors -- an increasing payout and/or a declining share price. With consistent annual dividend bumps, Hanesbrands has been increasing its payout. However, its stock price has also taken a hit over the last year, causing its yield to increase. HBI data by YCharts Although Hanes stock has recovered from its 52-week low reached in February, it's still down 13.5% for the year, trailing the S&P 500 by a whopping 27%. When a stock is down double-digits during a bull market, there should be cause for concern. Weak business results can cause a halt in future dividend increases or even worse, an eventual dividend cut. Therefore, Hanesbrands investors seeking yield should take a deeper look at the numbers to see if the company's dividend is sustainable. Why the stock price drop? It's no secret the retail industry is struggling. Brokerage firm Credit Suisse reported 2,056 stores closed in 2016 and indicated more than 8,600 brick-and-mortar stores will close in 2017. To put the latter number in perspective, more stores will close in 2017 than the worst year on record when over 6,000 stores were closed during the great recession in 2008. Hanesbrands is not immune to the retail struggles. Hanes's largest customer, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), accounted for 20% of its net sales in 2016. Last year, the retail giant announced it will close 269 stores. As a result of Wal-Mart and the industry struggles, with the exception of international, 2016 year-over-year sales dropped in each of Hanes's operating segments. Innerwear sales, its largest contributor to revenue, fell 2.7%. Operating segment 2016 2015 Change (%) Innerwear $2,609,754 $2,680,981 Activewear $1,570,972 $1,576,724 International $1,531,913 $1,132,637 Total net sales $6,028,199 $5,731,549 5.2% Data source: Company filings The weak results spilled over into profits as Hanes has failed to beat Wall Street earnings estimates in 4 of the past 6 quarters. There is also concern about Hanes's recent acquisitions and its accumulation of debt to help for them. Last year, the company spent $964 million on acquisitions while adding nearly $1.3 billion in long-term debt on its balance sheet. Its debt to equity ratio today sits at 432%. Dividend analysis A combination of a declining business along with increasing debt can be burdensome on a company's financials. If it begins to struggle making interest payments, a dividend cut will be likely. Let's see if Hanes is in jeopardy. Hanes's trailing-twelve-month (TTM) dividend payout ratio, the total dividend paid to shareholders relative to its net income, came in at a healthy 35%. The company's payout ratio actually came in less than two other popular apparel makers, Gap Inc. and V.F. CorpÂ payout 53% and 64% of their earnings as dividends respectively. The dividend payout ratio is a fine metric to look at but one flaw is that it compares dividends paid, a cash transaction, to earnings, an accounting metric. A more accurate measure to validate the safety of a dividend would be to compare the dividends paid to a company's free cash flow, which is the amount of operating cash available after investing in its business. A quick look at this measure shows that Hanesbrands may have some wiggle room to increase its dividend further. Metric (TTM) FY 2016 Amount Operating cash flow $605,607 Capital expenditures ($83,399) Free cash flow $522,208 Dividends paid $167,375 Dividend-to-FCF-ratio 32% All numbers in thousands. Data source: Annual filings. Hanesbrands still has some dirty laundry Despite a relatively low dividend payout ratio, Hanesbrands investors still have reasons to be concerned. Â Between 2014 and 2016, the company spent over $1.5 billion on acquisitions. Investors shouldn't expect the buying spree to be complete either. Hanesbrands has communicated to investors that acquisitions remainÂ a key component of its long-term growth strategy. Another concern is Hanes's underfunded pension plan. As of the end of its most recent quarter ending in April, Hanesbrands had $375 million in pension liabilities in addition to its $3.7 billion in debt. At some point, Hanesbrands will have to make this liability up. Although Hanesbrands dividend appears to be sustainable over the near-term, investors should keep a close eye on the company to make sure it can meet all its obligations over a longer period. Between maintaining annual dividend increases, meeting long-term obligations to its employees and bondholders, and continuing to make acquisitions, Hanesbrands must be on top of its game. Given its recent business struggles, I'm not sold that the dividend can be sustained unless it either turns things around or slows down the buying spree. ","

Adam Levy,08032017,Fool,07272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN) is extremely susceptible to competitive pressure. During the third quarter last year, the meal-kit delivery service said it was forced to up its marketing spend to attract new customers in response to competition. And in the fourth quarter, it saw many of those customers abandon its service, possibly trying the competitors' services. The scary thing is the competition Blue Apron is talking about are just small start-ups. None have the same scale as Blue Apron. But if a big competitor with established infrastructure and customer bases like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) decides to enter the market, it could easily wipe out Blue Apron's operating profits. Image source: Blue Apron. Following its acquisition agreement with Whole Food Market (NASDAQ:WFM), Amazon subsequently filed a trademark for a meal kit product and started offering said kits to AmazonFresh customers. While AmazonFresh customers represent a small portion of Amazon's customers and are restricted to just a handful of cities, the pilot should provide Amazon with useful data for launching a nationwide service. The addition of Whole Foods stores, which can double as distribution centers for Amazon's grocery business, should enable a nationwide rollout of Amazon's grocery business. Importantly, Amazon has a built-in customer base. It has around 85 million Prime subscribers in the United States, according to the latest estimate from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. That gives Amazon a big marketing funnel to sell meal kits into. It's used a similar tactic for its subscription music streaming service, and it's grabbed about 16 million global subscribers. Amazon has the resources to undercut Blue Apron's pricing thanks to its existing infrastructure and Prime subscription service. It can also spend more on marketing and use its marketing dollars more efficiently. Finally, it could offer a more flexible product than Blue Apron's subscriptions, allowing same-day, one-off orders thanks to potential distribution from Whole Foods. Wal-Mart has over 4,200 Supercenter and Neighborhood Market stores stocked full of groceries, and it's easily the largest grocery chain in the U.S. Blue Apron sees the traditional grocery market as just part of its addressable market along with restaurant spending. Considering groceries make up more than half of Wal-Mart's revenue, it has a vested interest in either preventing services like Blue Apron from taking a share of its business or co-opting the service for itself. Like Amazon, Wal-Mart has superior infrastructure compared to Blue Apron. And with the entire country littered with thousands of stores, it could develop a strong supply chain to deliver meal kits to homes or provide a convenient place for consumers to pick up kits on their way home from work. Wal-Mart already operates online grocery ordering and parking-lot pickup in nearly 670 locations as of the end of the first quarter. On the other hand, Wal-Mart's brand is often associated with low quality. That's a big selling point for Blue Apron -- high-quality ingredients. As such, if Wal-Mart has any intentions on entering the market, it may need to develop a new brand to compete with Blue Apron. Wal-Mart entering the market is just speculation at this point. Unlike Amazon, it's not currently testing any established plans in the market. As Blue Apron grows larger, more and more competitors are popping up and stealing away customers. Its customer acquisition costs have skyrocketed over the last couple years. To be sure, Blue Apron continues to increase its customer base at a strong pace, but it's coming at a much higher cost than its early days. If a big company like Amazon or Wal-Mart takes a serious crack at the meal-kit delivery market, it could absolutely crush Blue Apron. Both have existing businesses that support quickly scaling a meal-kit business, especially considering Amazon's impending acquisition of Whole Foods. While neither has gotten serious about the business yet, it's a very real possibility that it's the next big battle between the two retail giants. That could leave Blue Apron on the sidelines and cost its investors a lot of money. ","

Joseph E. Stiglitz,08032017,MarketWatch,07272017,"Published: July 28, 2017 4:17 p.m. ET Back-room deals on corporate tax reform wonât increase growth By NEW YORK (Project Syndicate) â Although Americaâs right-wing plutocrats may disagree about how to rank the countryâs major problems â for example, inequality, slow growth, low productivity, opioid addiction, poor schools, and deteriorating infrastructure â the solution is always the same: lower taxes and deregulation, to âincentivizeâ investors and âfree upâ the economy. President Donald Trump is counting on this package to make America great again. It wonât, because it never has. When President Ronald Reagan tried it in the 1980s, he claimed that tax revenues would rise. Instead, growth slowed, tax revenues fell, and workers suffered. The big winners in relative terms were corporations and the rich, who benefited from dramatically reduced tax rates. Trump has yet to advance a specific tax proposal. But, unlike his administrationâs approach to health-care legislation, lack of transparency will not help him. While many of the 32 million people projected to lose health insurance under the current proposal donât yet know whatâs coming, that is not true of the companies that will get the short end of the stick from Trumpâs tax reform. Hereâs Trumpâs dilemma. His tax reform must be revenue neutral. Thatâs a political imperative: with corporations sitting on trillions of dollars in cash while ordinary Americans are suffering, lowering the average amount of corporate taxation would be unconscionable â and more so if taxes were lowered for the financial sector, which brought on the 2008 crisis and never paid for the economic damage. Moreover, Senate procedures dictate that to enact tax reform with a simple majority, rather than the three-fifths supermajority required to defeat an almost-certain filibuster by opposition Democrats, the reform must be budget-neutral for 10 years. This requirement means that average corporate-tax revenue must remain the same, which implies that there will be winners and losers: some will pay less than they do now, and others will pay more. One might get away with this in the case of personal income tax, because even if the losers notice, they are not sufficiently organized. By contrast, even small businesses in the United States lobby Congress. Most economists would agree that Americaâs current tax structure is inefficient and unfair. Some firms pay a far higher rate than others. Perhaps innovative firms that create jobs should be rewarded, in part, by a tax break. But the only rhyme or reason to who gets tax breaks appears to be the effectiveness of supplicantsâ lobbyists. One of the most significant problems concerns taxation of U.S. corporationsâ foreign-earned income. Democrats believe that, because U.S. corporations, wherever they operate, benefit from Americaâs rule of law and power to ensure that they are not mistreated (often guaranteed by treaty), they ought to pay for these and other advantages. But a sense of fairness and reciprocity, much less national loyalty, is not deeply ingrained in many U.S. companies, which respond by threatening to move their headquarters abroad. Republicans, partly out of sensitivity to this threat, advocate a territorial tax system, like that used in most countries: taxes should be imposed on economic activity only in the country where it occurs. The concern is that, after imposing a one-off levy on the untaxed profits that U.S. firms hold abroad, introducing a territorial system would generate a tax loss. To offset this, Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, has proposed adding a tax on net imports (imports minus exports). Because net imports lead to job destruction, they should be discouraged. At the same time, so long as U.S. net imports are as high as they are now, the tax would raise enormous revenues. But thereâs the rub: the money must come from someoneâs pocket. Import prices will go up. Consumers of cheap clothing from China will be worse off. To Trumpâs team, this is collateral damage, the inevitable price that must be paid to give Americaâs plutocrats more money. But retailers such as Wal-Mart

                                  Â , not just its customers, are part of the collateral damage, too. Wal-Mart knows this â and wonât let it happen. Other corporate tax reforms might make sense; but they, too, imply winners and losers. And so long as the losers are numerous and organized enough, they are likely to have the power to stop the reform. A politically astute president who understood deeply the economics and politics of corporate tax reform could conceivably muscle Congress toward a reform package that made sense. Trump is not that leader. If corporate tax reform happens at all, it will be a hodge-podge brokered behind closed doors. More likely is a token across-the-board tax cut: the losers will be future generations, out-lobbied by todayâs avaricious moguls, the greediest of whom include those who owe their fortunes to scummy activities, like gambling. The sordidness of all of this will be sugarcoated with the hoary claim that lower tax rates will spur growth. There is simply no theoretical or empirical basis for this, especially in countries like the U.S., where most investment (at the margin) is financed by debt and interest is tax deductible. The marginal return and marginal cost are reduced proportionately, leaving investment largely unchanged. In fact, a closer look, taking into account accelerated depreciation and the effects on risk sharing, shows that lowering the tax rate likely reduces investment. Small countries are the sole exception, because they can pursue beggar-thy-neighbor policies aimed at poaching corporations from their neighbors. But global growth is largely unchanged â the distributive effects actually impede it slightly â as one gains at the expense of the other. (And this assumes that the other does not respond and fuel a race to the bottom.) In a country with so many problems â especially inequality â tax cuts for rich corporations will not solve any of them. This is a lesson for all countries contemplating corporate tax breaks â even those without the misfortune of being led by a callow, craven plutocrat.

                                  Â reported better-than-expected third-quarter results Tuesday, with 41 million iPhone sales and revenue growth of 3% helping to calm fears about the companyâs fiscal year. While iPhone sales were a relief, iPad sales were a big surprise, apparently thanks to success in the education and enterprise markets. Unit sales for the iPadâwhich have been mostly declining since the end of the 2013 fiscal yearâhandily beat expectations, as Apple said it sold 11.4 million iPads, more than two million more than expected by analysts. iPad revenue also grew, but not by as much, suggesting that a lower-cost iPad released in March helped boost unit sales while dragging the average selling price for iPads from $490 a year ago to about $435. First positive YoY iPad unit growth in four years, second YoY revenue growth in that period. ASPs down quite a bit YoY: $329 iPad pic.twitter.com/ouPQLvwSkQ In Tuesdayâs conference call, executives chalked the gains up to the launch of the lower-cost iPad and the new iPad Pro, which hit shelves in June. The two tablets address different but potentially lucrative markets, with schools looking for cheap computing devices and businesses looking for machines that employees can find more uses for than a standard tablet. Donât miss: Apple makes move that could improve its gadgets, but it wonât be easy Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook pointed to a 32% jump in iPad sales to educators, with sales of one million iPads to schools. That could be an important win for Apple, which appeared to be losing the education market to Chromebooks, low-cost laptops running Alphabet Inc.âs

Read also: Apple bets that youâll adopt these three tech habits The growth for iPad was a big surprise for a product that has largely been ignored by investors and analysts, who did not bother to ask specific question about the tablet on Tuesdayâs conference call despite its surprising performance. Most analystsâ earnings previews did not even include a breakdown or any comments on the iPad, amid the usual obsession on Wall Street on the iPhone and the timing of the next model. If Apple can keep up sales momentum with the iPad, it could also boost the average sales prices with more sales of the higher priced iPad Pro, which only had one month of sales in the quarter. For a product long seen as an underachieving little brother to the iPhone, sales growth and potential to actually bolster Appleâs finances is quite an accomplishment. Apple stock rose to record levels after the earnings results were released, and surged 6.3% at Wednesdayâs open. The stock is now up 51.7% in the past year, easily topping the S&P 500 indexâs

                                  Â  could impact Kraft, given fears that Kraft may be asked to âhelpâ by cutting its prices. Kraft Chief Operating Officer George Zoghbi responded by saying, âthe price competition among retailers is not like something new,â according to a transcript of the call provided by FactSet. âOf course, weâd have to be mindful of the impact on us, particularly the one that we watch for the most is the equity, the impact on the equity of our brands, because we have certain expectation where we position our brands.â But perhaps what is more important for investors isnât how much the company made on the products it sold, but how many products it actually sold. RBC Capital analyst David Palmer trimmed his second-quarter earnings estimate this week, but he said that was primarily to reflect revenue declines in the U.S. and tough year-over-year sales comparisons in Europe. Kraft is expected to report earnings per share that rise from year-ago levels for the fourth straight quarter. Although the company missed the FactSet EPS consensus in the first quarter, it had beaten expectations in nine of the previous 10 quarters. But revenue is a different story, as FactSet consensus is calling for a fourth straight quarter of declines. The company missed revenue expectations last quarter, and has for 12 of the past 16 quarters. In the first quarter, sales declined in nine of Kraftâs 11 product categories, including its largest categories â condiments and sauces, and cheese and dairy. The only categories seeing growth were frozen and chilled meats, and âother.â Kraft Chief Executive Bernardo Hees said back then that product innovations and geographic expansion had positioned the company âto drive organic sales growth for the balance of 2017 and beyond.â Investors will find out after Thursdayâs closing bell whether the company can deliver. Here are some other things to watch for: Earnings: Kraft Heinz is expected to report adjusted EPS, which excludes nonrecurring items, of 95 cents a share, according to the average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by FactSet. That compares with EPS of 85 cents in the same period a year ago. On March 31, the FactSet EPS consensus was $1.02. Revenue: The FactSet revenue consensus is $6.73 billion, which is down from $6.79 billion in the same quarter last year. On March 31, analysts were expecting revenue to rise to $6.87 billion. Stock price: There is no guarantee that Kraftâs stock will rise if results beat expectations. Although Kraft missed first-quarter profit and revenue, the stock rose 0.6% on the day after the report was released. After fourth-quarter 2016 results, in which earnings and revenue topped expectations, the stock fell 4.2%. Over the past three years, the stock has fallen on the day after results eight times, by an average of 3.0%, while the stock has climbed 3.0% on average on the days that it has gained. The average rating of analysts surveyed by FactSet is the equivalent of overweight, while the average price target of $95.84 is 9.6% above current levels. The stock inched up 0.1% year to date through morning trade Thursday, while the SPDR Consumer Staples Select Sector exchange-traded fund

,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc warned on Thursday that this quarterâs earnings could miss Wall Streetâs estimates as the worldâs biggest retailer struggles with falling margins due to price-cutting and heavy spending on its e-commerce operations. The companyâs shares fell more than 2 percent, with investors shrugging off a higher full-year profit outlook and sales that defied sluggish consumer demand that has hurt many rivals. Wal-Mart has reported three straight years of comparable sales growth as more people shop at its stores and on its websites. With a steady rise in the number of people who buy online, e-commerce sales growth has been outstripping brick-and-mortar. Like other retailers, Wal-Mart has been aggressively investing in its e-commerce business in the past year. It has begun offering programs like free-two-day shipping and discounts for picking up online purchases at stores, and it acquired several startups, including Jet.com for $3.3 billion last year. The companyâs online sales growth outpaced the industry at 60 percent in the second quarter ended on July 31 but decelerated from the 63 percent increase of the previous quarter. Wal-Mart said most of the growth had come from its own online business and not the acquisitions it has made in the past year. Wal-Mart has also been cutting grocery prices to remain competitive against discounters like Germanyâs Aldi Inc, which is rapidly expanding in the United States, and Lidl, another German rival that has recently started opening stores in the country. Given Wal-Martâs moves, margins may contract for the rest of the year, UBS said in a note to clients. But despite the earnings warning and pressure on margins, most analysts remained bullish on Wal-Mart because of its sales performance. âThe second-quarter numbers show that Wal-Mart remains firmly on the front foot and is more than holding its own in a challenging and competitive retail market,â said GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders. Second-quarter sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.8 percent, excluding fuel price fluctuations and including e-commerce. That exceeded market expectations for a 1.7 percent increase, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. The company cited its grocery and food business, which reported its best performance in five years, and said its online operation added 70 basis points to comparable sales. U.S. store visits were up 1.3 percent from 1.2 percent a year earlier. Total revenue increased 2.1 percent to $123.4 billion from a year earlier. It would have been up 2.9 percent without the effects of currency fluctuations, which the company said had diminished from previous quarters. Net income attributable to Wal-Mart fell 23 percent to $2.9 billion due to a loss from repurchasing debt after a bond tender offer. Excluding special items, earnings per share of $1.08 exceeded the analystsâ average estimate of $1.07, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Gross margins were down 11 basis points at 25 percent, including a five-basis-point decline in the United States, compared with analystsâ expectations of 25.22 percent. Operating margins fell to 4.9 percent from 5.1 percent, and U.S. operating expenses rose 3.9 percent. The company said it expected third-quarter earnings of 90 cents to 98 cents a share, excluding special items. Analysts on average had forecast 98 cents. Wal-Mart raised the low end of its earnings outlook for the full year to $4.30 per share from $4.20, excluding items, while keeping the high end at $4.40. ","

,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A truck driver accused of smuggling immigrants inside a packed and sweltering tractor-trailer through Texas, 10 of whom died, was formally indicted by a federal grand jury on Wednesday on charges that can carry the death penalty, prosecutors said. James Bradley Jr., 60, was given a five-count indictment that included charges of transportation of undocumented aliens resulting in death and conspiracy to transport aliens resulting in death. If convicted on these charges, he could face up to life in prison or death, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Western District of Texas said. A lawyer for Bradley was not immediately available for comment. The incident was one of the deadliest cases of immigrant smuggling in recent U.S. history and brought renewed attention to the dangers of human trafficking. Law enforcement was called to investigate a suspicious tractor trailer in a Walmart parking lot in San Antonio on July 23 and found about 39 people in the trailer, eight of whom were dead. Others were in perilous health, and two died later, court documents showed. Many of the immigrants in the trailer ran when Bradley opened the doors. Nearly 200 people may have been inside the truck, according to the documents. Bradley told law enforcement officials that he did not know about he was carrying human cargo. âBradley said he went to open the doors and was surprised when he was run over by âSpanishâ people and knocked to the ground,â the criminal complaint said. Seven men from Mexico and an 18-year-old man from Guatemala were among the dead. The other two fatalities included a juvenile whose name has not been made public and an adult who has not yet been identified, prosecutors said. Of the survivors, 22 were in federal custody and charged as material witnesses, two remained in hospital and five were  released from hospital and turned over to U.S. immigration authorities, prosecutors said. Some survivors have sought to offer testimony in exchange for consideration of visas that would allow them to stay in the United States, their attorneys said. In 2003, 19 people died after traveling in an 18-wheeler truck through Victoria, Texas. ","

,08172017,Reuters,08102017,"MONTREAL, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Canadians are making smaller payments more frequently on auto term loans as new financing offers lure buyers away from the typical monthly billing cycle, a trend public advocacy groups say could push consumers to purchase more expensive vehicles that they simply cannot afford. âBecause long-term car loans tend to involve lower monthly or bi-weekly payments, extended terms can encourage consumers to buy more car than they may be able to afford,â said Kathryn Dunn, a spokeswoman for the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada This new financing trend has made it easier for consumers to pile on debt, further extending already over-leveraged households. According to Statistics Canada, households have amassed huge debt, with the ratio of debt to disposable income at a near record of 166.9 percent during the first quarter of 2017. The increase comes at a time when the Bank of Canada is likely to raise interest rates again this year, after the first interest rate hike in seven years in July. More than half of Canadians who borrow to buy new vehicles look to make payments every two weeks, with the arrival of their paychecks, said Robert Karwel, a senior manager for J.D. Power in Canada. Some borrowers are opting to pay even more frequently with four percent making payments each week during the first half of 2017, up from 3.4 percent in 2015, the J.D. Power data show. âThese terms donât allow you to pay off the car any faster, so itâs questionable why it is being taken-up by customers,â Karwel said. âWe feel it has to do with the amount of stress the family budget is under.â Consumer appetite for weekly payments has been fueled by advertisements which tout smaller amounts that are paid in more frequent installments, said George Iny, director of the Automobile Protection Association, a Canadian consumer advocacy group. Iny said he believes the proportion of borrowers opting for weekly payments would be even higher than the data suggests, but some financial institutions accustomed to monthly and bi-weekly installments, have not yet produced the paperwork needed for such frequent payments. âPsychologically, the amount sounds lower. It allows you to buy without feeling guilty,â he said. Still, delinquency rates on Canadaâs C$120 billion ($94.7 billion) in auto loans remained low at 1.7 percent during the first quarter of 2017, relatively flat from the same period a year ago, according to June data from credit information company TransUnion.

Mark Kolakowski,08172017,Investopedia,08102017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Online retail colossus Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is regarded as the undisputed leader of the industry as it prepares to plunge into brick-and-mortar selling with its bid for upscale grocery chain Whole Foods Market inc. (WFM). But aÂ Chinese e-commerce giant, JD.com Inc. (JD), already is far ahead of Amazon in the game of merging virtual stores with real ones. It has a strategic alliance with the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer,Â Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), CNBC reports. JD.com's share performance is worth noting for Amazon-obsessed investors. JD.com's ADRÂ shares trading on theÂ NasdaqÂ are up by 88%, while Amazon has gained 31% for theÂ year-to-date through Wednesday's close.Â (For more, see also: These Techs Have Left FAANG Stocks in the Dust.) A key to that outperformance is JD.com's ability to partner with Wal-Mart to exploit a Chinese online consumer market that's far bigger than the U.S. Wal-Mart entered China in 1996, and operates 433 store locations there, employing approximately 100,000 associates,Â according to the company's website. The alliance with JD.com began in June 2016, and resulted in Wal-Mart gaining a 5% stake in the Chinese company, per Wal-Mart's press initial press release. The concept was that that Wal-Mart would be able to tap JD.com's significant base of online customers and vast same-day delivery network, while JD.com's customers would gain access to a wide range of new and imported items from Wal-Mart and Sam's Club, according to Wal-Mart.Â Wal-Mart later increased its stake to about 12%. That strategy has worked. JD.com is offering its customers over 1,700 of Wal-Mart's most popular items from its retail stores across China, CNBC reports. Winston Chen, the president of JD International, told CNBC that the deal has the prospect of allowing his company to sell ""a tremendous number of quality products not previously widely available in China."" Meanwhile,Â Wal-Mart isÂ stocking its stores with merchandise from JD.com, which allows that company to expand its fulfillment capabilities, with delivery times now ""about 30 minutes,""Â as Chen also told CNBC. China already is an important market for Wal-Mart, which generates about 33% of its non-U.S. sales revenue there, according TechCrunch, citingÂ analysis by the Wall Street Journal. The original deal wth JD.com in 2016 involved a number of steps. It included Wal-Mart's sale of its own ChineseÂ e-commerce marketplace to JD.com, with Wal-Mart retainingÂ the direct sales business and becoming a seller within the site, rather than its operator. The former Wal-Mart site, calledÂ Yihaodian,Â focuses on grocery items for an affluent female customer base, with its strongest presence in eastern and southern China. Wal-Mart took a minority stake in 2011, then bought it outright in 2015, according to Tech Crunch. However, with under Â 2% of the Chinese e-commerce market, YihaodianÂ was at competitive disadvantage to JD.com and AlibabaÂ Group Holding Ltd. (BABA) which combine for over 80%, per data from iResearch cited by TechCrunch. A key difference between Alibaba and JD.com is that the latter owns its logistics system and specializes in fast delivery and fresh goods, per TechCrunch. The success that JD.com and Wal-Mart are having in meshing virtual and physical stores in China shows just how far Amazon has to go in the U.S. Amazon may be the giantÂ of e-commerce, but the Whole Foods merger may test how nimbly it can exploit the new and old worlds of retailing.

Lauren Thomas,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"Wal-Mart on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings and sales that topped Street expectations, as the big-box retailer made further gains in its online business. Fresh digital initiatives and a growing assortment of products on Walmart.com aided the retailer in boosting online transactions by 60 percent, the company said. Last quarter, e-commerce sales climbed 63 percent, compared with 29 percent growth in the prior quarter. Although many retailers are struggling to draw shoppers in, Wal-Mart posted same-store sales growth at its U.S. locations for the 12th-consecutive quarter, fueled by traffic growth of 1.3 percent, the company said. Despite the news, shares of Wal-Mart were down more than 2.5 percent during premarket trading. Here's what Wal-Mart reported compared to what Wall Street was expecting, based on a Thomson Reuters survey of analysts: ""This isn't a blow-away report ... it's a solid report,"" Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" Wal-Mart's stock has been a ""big outperformer"" of late, Grom added, which can lead to a temporary sell-off, ""even if the print is perfect."" ""I think this number needed to be a little bit better today to drive the stock higher,"" he said. One weakness for Wal-Mart the second quarter was that profit margins fell slightly due to more aggressive promotions. The retailer has been investing heavily to keep its prices competitive, defending market share from Amazon, among other rivals. It also bulking up its online operations. The expensive moves are yielding results. ""Our customers are responding to the improvements in stores and online, and our results reflect this,"" CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. ""Traffic increases at store level and the eCommerce growth rate are key highlights."" The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said it earned 96 cents per share during the period. Excluding one-time charges, the company earned $1.08 a share. Wal-Mart's total sales climbed 2.1 percent from a year ago, to $123.36 billion. This consisted of 3.3 percent sales growth at Wal-Mart U.S. stores, a 1 percent decline in revenues for Wal-Mart's international business and 2.3 percent growth across Sam's Club. Wal-Mart's U.S. comparable sales â a metric closely watched by the Street for retailers â increased 1.8 percent, including fuel. Excluding gasoline sales, comps in the U.S. were up 1.7 percent, which consisted of growth of 1.2 percent at Sam's Club, and an increase of 1.8 percent at Wal-Mart stores. ""It was another solid quarter ... we are pleased with the first half of the year,"" CFO Brett Biggs told CNBC. ""I think one of the things I'm most excited about is that we continued to bring together what we are doing in the stores with what we are doing online."" Looking ahead, Wal-Mart raised the low end of its earnings outlook for the full year, now forecasting profit ranging from $4.30 to $4.40 per share, adjusted. Previously, Wal-Mart had said it expected to earn $4.20 to $4.40 a share. A survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters was calling for earnings per share of $4.37. Same-store sales, excluding fuel, are expected to climb 1.5 to 2 percent at Wal-Mart U.S. locations in the third quarter of 2017. In a competitive retail environment, the big-box retailer has been defending its turf against internet giant Amazon, especially in the digital world. Wal-Mart is also reportedly expanding its online advertising business. Some of Wal-Mart's latest efforts to get purchases more quickly and efficiently to customers include testing an employee delivery program. The retailer is also piloting a push in its same-day service in certain markets, while retail rival Target just landed a partnership to do so. Last September, Wal-Mart purchased e-retailer Jet.com, bringing the website's founder, Marc Lore, to its team. Its e-commerce growth has been accelerating ever since, showing little sign of slowing. These days, Wal-Mart and Amazon.com are neck and neck on pricing. ""As Walmart is a key player across most back-to-school/back-to-college product categories, and we are in the heart of those seasons, we would expect further promotional activity in Q3, with smaller retailers to feel increased levels of stress as Walmart and Amazon continue their battle over market share,"" said Charlie O'Shea, Moody's lead retail analyst. In its fiscal first quarter, Wal-Mart said its grocery business continued to improve across U.S. stores. CFO Biggs told CNBC on Thursday the retailer is pleased with what it's been doing in the food business, and ""online grocery continues to grow rapidly."" During the second quarter, food categories saw their strongest quarterly comparable sales performance in five years, Wal-Mart said. ""One of the particular areas of success for Walmart is grocery,"" GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders wrote in a note to clients. ""Our data show continued gains in customer share, even in areas where discounters like Aldi have expanded. ... [Wal-Mart] is one of the few firms that have the firepower to cope with the push towards compressed prices and margins."" The retailer completed remodels of 283 stores globally in the second quarter, and expanded its online grocery service to include more than 900 locations in the U.S. alone. Retail rival Target on Wednesday reported better-than-expected digital sales growth, as it saw more shoppers returning to its stores and online for ""quick trips"" â ringing up smaller purchases, but more frequently. As of Wednesday's market close, shares of Wal-Mart have climbed about 11 percent over the past 12 months. This far outpaces the S&P 500 Retail ETF's (XRT) declines of about 15 percent over the period. ",Wal-Mart q2 earnings 2017
Lauren Thomas,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"Online outrage is being directed at Wal-Mart for a gun display at one of its stores, after a photo went viral on Wednesday of a sign that hung above it. The photo shows a back-to-school banner that reads ""Own the school year like a hero"" situated above a glass case full of guns. TWEET ""What's seen in this photograph would never be acceptable in our stores,"" a Wal-Mart spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. ""We regret this situation and are looking into how it could have happened."" Initial reports said the store was in Evansville, Indiana, but that has not been confirmed by Wal-Mart as of Thursday afternoon. The company had started its investigation midday Wednesday, after the photo began circulating. The customer who initially tweeted the photo and who also spoke with The Washington Post has since taken her Twitter account private. The woman, Leeanna May, insisted in an interview with the Post that the photo was taken in Evansville. ""We have already lost so many innocent lives to guns,"" May told the Post. ""People don't seem to honestly care."" But Wal-Mart's latest tweets to unhappy customers tell a different story. It appears there is still some confusion regarding which store displayed the sign. TWEET TWEET After initially tweeting about removing the sign in Evansville, Wal-Mart is now looking into whether the photo was doctored or if the display of guns was part of a prank by customers. This isn't the first time Wal-Mart has come under a viral attack for its products. In July, Wal-Mart used a racist term to describe a wig cap sold on its website by a third party. The color of the hat was listed as ""nââ brown."" The retailer also drew fire in 2016, prior to Sept. 11, when a store used Coca-Cola products to build two towers signifying the World Trade Center. A banner reading ""We will never forget"" hung above it. ","Wal-Mart back-to-school sign hung above guns, sparking outrage"
Eugene Kim,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"Wal-Mart has been quietly building up its online advertising business, opening up a new revenue channel for the retail giant. According to KeyBanc's Ed Yruma, Wal-Mart's website has started to show banner ads by third-party sellers more frequently, with links to product pages or vendor websites. Historically, Wal-Mart's online ads have highlighted its own products or discounts, Yruma said. On top of that, Wal-Mart has recently started linking its in-store and online shopping data, giving more in-depth data that advertisers could play with, he said. Wal-Mart already offers plenty of online ad options, including display media, native ads and programmatic buying programs. ""We believe Walmart recently began intensifying focus on its advertising business,"" Yruma wrote in a note published this week. Wal-Mart's push into the online advertising space is another sign of growth for the company's e-commerce business. It also signifies a new potential battleground against its rival Amazon, which has been drawing a lot of attention for its own advertising business. Wal-Mart's e-commerce business has grown robustly in recent quarters, more than 60 percent year over year. Although online sales are estimated to account for only a tiny fraction of its total revenue, Wal-Mart has made it clear that it plans to build its online business, and the company has a number of e-commerce startups in recent months as well. Given Wal-Mart's online sales and traffic is much smaller than Amazon's, it's unlikely Wal-Mart's advertising business is generating significant revenue yet. Amazon advertising is one of the company's fastest-growing businesses, estimated to be growing more than 50 percent annually, and analysts expect it to generate more than $3 billion in revenue this year. But Yruma says Wal-Mart's ability to merge its massive in-store data with its growing online shopping data could make it a more attractive advertising option going forward. Not many companies have the mix of data Wal-Mart can offer. ""There's a lot happening within physical stores, so being able to merge those two data sets will be incredibly important going forward,"" Yruma said.

Lauren Thomas,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"Add Wal-Mart's CEO to the list of executives speaking out against President Donald Trump's response, or lack thereof, to protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. On Tuesday, Chief Executive Doug McMillon issued a statement saying the president ""missed a critical opportunity to help bring our country together."" The same memo was sent to company employees Monday evening. McMillon's comments come amid growing backlash against President Trump, and how he reacted to violent protests that resulted in one fatality. On Monday, CEOs from Merck, Under Armour and Intel said they were stepping down from their roles within Trump's manufacturing council. Although McMillon doesn't serve on the manufacturing council, he holds a different role within the administration's strategic policy group. McMillon told employees in his memo: ""[W]e should stay engaged to try to influence decisions in a positive way and help bring people together. ... I will continue to strongly advocate on behalf of our associates and customers."" In response to the uproar, President Trump has since followed suit on Tuesday by calling the executives who left his council ""grandstanders."" Shortly after Trump made this comment, Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said he would drop out. Paul, head of the group that aims to promote American manufacturing, said, ""it's the right thing for me to do."" Read the full memo from Wal-Mart's CEO, Doug McMillon: Respect for the individual is one of our core beliefs at Walmart. And the role we play in communities around the country to build a more diverse and inclusive society is more critical than ever as the tragic events in Charlottesville over the weekend painfully reminded us. Our prayers are with the victims and their families. As we watched the events and the response from President Trump over the weekend, we too felt that he missed a critical opportunity to help bring our country together by unequivocally rejecting the appalling actions of white supremacists. His remarks today were a step in the right direction and we need that clarity and consistency in the future. Our country is facing some very difficult issues that require our elected officials, business leaders and community-based organizations to work together. Representing a company with the largest and one of the most diverse groups of associates in the U.S., and an even more diverse customer base of tens of millions of customers, we believe we should stay engaged to try to influence decisions in a positive way and help bring people together. I will continue to strongly advocate on behalf of our associates and customers, and urge our elected officials to do their part to promote a more just, tolerant and diverse society. Thank you for representing Walmart and our values today â and every day. Ironically, Wal-Mart was known for supporting Trump during his run for presidency. Wal-Mart gave $150,000 to Trump's inaugural committee, and also sponsored a ball, according to a company spokesman, per the Wall Street Journal. McMillon said Monday evening that Trump's follow-up comments had been a ""step in the right direction,"" and that the president needs to show that same ""clarity and consistency"" in the future. Trump at last condemned white supremacists, two days after what many viewed as a tepid response to deadly violence from the president.

Michelle Fox,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"Now that CEOs have abandoned President Donald Trump, the most concerning thing is what will happen with Trump's agenda, former Wal-Mart U.S. CEO Bill Simon told CNBC on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, Trump's Strategy & Policy Forum decided to disband and condemn the president's controversial response to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Soon after the news broke, Trump said he decided to dissolve the group, as well as his manufacturing council. ""Where do we go from here? We still need tax reform. We still need health-care reform. We still need to run this country and now they don't have a seat at the table and now the president doesn't have the best assets ... to move forward,"" Simon said in an interview with ""Closing Bell."" ""I wouldn't go to dinner with him but I would probably figure out a way to work with him,"" Simon added, noting that he is in no way defending what Trump said. Business leaders and Republicans have been distancing themselves from Trump since his response to the rally. One person was killed and 19 others were injured when a suspected white nationalist rammed a car into counterprotesters. In a news conference on Tuesday, Trump reiterated his initial response that ""both sides"" were to blame for the violence. He also defended the protest and contended that some of the individuals carrying torches did not have bad intentions. ""The fact that the president makes insensitive remarks and does it on a frequent basis without thinking is not new news. He's done that all through the campaign. They knew that when they joined the council,"" Simon said. What Trump said can't be condoned, forgiven or understood, Simon said, but he doesn't think the country can stand 3Â½ years of inactivity on major policy issues. And now, the president doesn't have the counsel of some of the best in the business. ""If good people don't engage, we're left with people who aren't as good as the ones who were originally selected."" Steve Odland, former CEO of Office Depot, also is concerned about that lack of engagement. He told ""Closing Bell"" the dissolution of the advisory groups was ""disappointing"" because they were working on things like trade, taxes and health care. ""You've got all of these very important issues where the business leaders are driving it,"" he said. ""So to have the business leaders withdraw at a point in time when we need them the most is very discouraging, especially when you've got an administration with a lot of empty seats and without a lot of input that they need."" Odland thinks corporate leaders should avoid taking political positions, and instead focus strictly on policy positions. ""They should do that regardless of whether we have a Democratic president or whether we have a Republican president, he said. ""They should stay engaged.""

Elizabeth Gurdus,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"Retail competition is at the forefront of Wall Street yet again as retailers release their earnings reports, and Jim Cramer is seeing a divide form around the industry's most powerful disruptor. ""When the book is closed on retail this quarter, we're going to have two different narratives: there are the companies that Amazon can crush and the companies that Amazon should admire or perhaps even fear,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. As of Thursday, one company stood out to Cramer as the competitor Amazon should worry most about: Wal-Mart. The discount retailer's second-quarter earnings report not only beat the Street's estimates on earnings per share and revenue, but also saw a 60 percent boost in online sales. Wal-Mart's same-store sales, a key measure of success for retailers, ticked up as well thanks to traffic growth, a much sought-after trend at many struggling brick-and-mortar businesses. Cramer attributed Wal-Mart's online growth to its 4,100-store network, which makes it easy for the family-owned company's 100 million weekly shoppers to pick up their goods in-store. ""You could also look at Wal-Mart's store base as 4,100 distribution centers with easy delivery for food, blunting the footprint of Amazon, which will only have a 10th of the stores that Wal-Mart has when that Whole Foods deal closes,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart's CEO, told Cramer exclusively on Thursday that ""we're taking 140 million transactions a week [and] combining it with our exploding online business to serve customers in a seamless way, in-store and online. We will own the intersection of physical and digital shopping."" Plus, Jet.com, the e-commerce platform Wal-Mart acquired in 2016, has been thoroughly integrated into Wal-Mart's ""family"" thanks to the work of its founder, Marc Lore, Cramer said. ""Speaking of family, that's Wal-Mart's ace in the hole,"" Cramer added. Amazon may turn to the capital markets for the money it needs in place of profits, he said, but Wal-Mart has its legacy owners, the Walton family, to provide a similar cushion that goes hand in hand with Wal-Mart's bargaining power with product suppliers. ""And there too, lies the real Achilles Heel of Amazon: the clout Walmart still has over its suppliers,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Amazon is likely the biggest customer of almost every single U.S.-based consumer products company. Most of those companies' websites are hosted by Amazon Web Services, the e-commerce giant's cloud computing arm. But those same companies risk losing Wal-Mart's business by partnering with Amazon for the cloud, and they want their products featured on the big-box retailer's shelves as much as they want them on Amazon.com, Cramer said. ""If I'm the chief technology officer of any supplier, I'm going to green-light shifting away from Amazon Web Services to the ultra-competitive Microsoft Azure or Google Web Services,"" Cramer said. ""That way, my CEO can go to Wal-Mart's headquarters and say, 'Hey, we know the score. We're not trading with the enemy anymore.'"" So the two giants are neck-in-neck; Amazon's Alexa steers customers towards Amazon's products, while Wal-Mart's free two-day delivery challenges Amazon Prime's membership fee, and their product prices are comparably attractive. ""Let just call it as it is: a legitimate, two-horse race with others bringing up the rear, but at least they're now at the track,"" Cramer said. Questions for Cramer?

Jeremy Bowman,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.Â (NYSE:WMT) has been a household name for more than a generation, ever since the company toppledÂ Sears in the late 1980s to become the nation's largest retailer, and it hasn't looked back since. Today, it's the world's largest retailer by a wide margin, with nearly $500 billion in revenue. While Americans are very familiar with Wal-Mart at this point, there are more than a few surprising facts about the company that many might find surprising. Image source: Wal-Mart. Based in rural Arkansas, Wal-Mart has historically catered to a conservative customer base and embodied conservative values. Its stores have also downplayed alcohol sales, and the company even removed alcohol from Jet.com's offices when it acquired the e-commerce start-up. It's also long been a bogeyman of labor activists for underpaying workers and using anti-union tactics. However, Wal-Mart's environmental policies are much more progressive. The company had 142 megawatts of photovoltaic capacity as of 2015, and is striving for 100% renewable energy. At that point, it was the leading corporate consumer of solar power, but it has since fallen to No. 2 behind Target.Â Wal-Mart explains that the strategy ""lowers our energy costs and is clearly good for the environment, but another benefit is that it keeps prices low for our customers."" Groceries make up more than half of Wal-Mart's sales so perhaps it makes sense that the company's biggest seller is the banana, the most popular fruit in the U.S. Bananas are generally known as the cheapest food at the grocery store, which suits Wal-Mart's shoppers who come to its stores for low-priced staples. The retailer sells over 1 billion pounds of the fruit every year, and its success at selling bananas and other groceries has offered something of a moat against e-commerce sellers. Bananas, which can't be squashed or go below 59 degrees, have proven challenging for grocery home deliveries. One report even described howÂ Amazon Fresh was throwing away thousands of extras because they only sold them in bunches of five. Last year, Wal-Mart's U.S. stores and Sam's Club together brought in $365.4 billion in revenue, nearly 10% of all non-automotive retail in spending in the U.S. That figure, which does not include spending at restaurants and bars, totaled $3.72 trillion. That Wal-Mart controls nearly 10% of retail spending is evidence of its economies of scale and shows how big of an effect it has on the rest of the economy, including stakeholders like suppliers, employees, and customers. Not surprisingly, when Wal-Mart raised its wages to $10 an hour last year, a number of its peers followed suit. Just as it is the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart is also the world's largest private employer, with 2.2 million employees around the world. Wal-Mart trails only the Department of Defense and the People's Liberation Army of China as the world's biggest employers of any kind. Wal-Mart's huge employee base gives it sizable sway over the labor market and has also made it a target of activists and policymakers over the year. It's also the biggest employer in 19 states, including much of the South. As more evidence of the company's ubiquity, more than two-thirds of Americans live within five miles of a Walmart. Ninety percent live within 15 minutes of one. That ubiquity explains why Wal-Mart has shifted strategies in recent years and scaled back significantly on new store openings. Instead, it is stepping up e-commerce efforts, which include its new grocery pick-up stations, and spending to clean up stores and eliminate stockouts to make its stores more attractive. With a ceiling approaching on its real estate growth, Wal-Mart now must fight for market share with competitors. ","

Anders Bylund,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Early Wednesday morning, Donald Trump posted another controversial tweet. This time, he's picking a fight with e-commerce veteran Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN): Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt-many jobs being lost!  Just four hours later, this statement had been retweeted nearly 9,000 times, while also garnering more than 31,000 ""likes"" and 17,000 replies from other Twitter users. Trump clearly hit a nerve, here. That's not always the same as hitting his mark, though. Let's run some numbers to fact-check Trump's inflammatory tweet. Image source: Whitehouse.gov. Let's start with the central argument of Trump's tweet. Is the American retail employee really a dying breed? According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that's not really the case: Data source: Bureau of Labor Statistics. Chart by author. That's the total number of retail trade employees in the U.S. over the last decade, using seasonally adjusted data. The economic crash in 2008 brought the retail industry to its knees for a while, and employment in the sector dropped by 6% before hitting rock bottom in 2010. From there, retailers bounced back to increase their payrolls by nearly 8%. That growth has stalled over the last year, but we're hardly looking at a dead industry here. Some retailers have fared better than others in the last 10 years. For example, Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) increased its employee count by 9.5%, landing at 2 million full-time and part-time workers. Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) doubled its payroll, to 78,600 employees. Sears Holdings (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ), on the other hand, saw its Sears and K-Mart payrolls plunge 58% lower, stopping at 140,000. Oh, and Amazon's employee tally rose nearly 20-fold -- from 13,900 to 341,400 workers. That's before adding 87,000 Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) workers, assuming that the pending $13.7 billion buyoutÂ goes through. The rising employee counts at Wal-Mart and Ross prove that a well-managed retailer can grow its business, even while Amazon is stealing market share from the bricks-and-mortar shopping sector as a whole. And the retail sector is keeping plenty of workers' feet on the store floor overall, as shown by the government's own data. Sears is the poster child for failing retailers these days, but that's due more to gross mismanagement than to Amazon stepping in to attack that company in particular. If Amazon is guilty of anything, it would be of making consumers expect lower retail prices in general. The retail chains that have held up well under this pressure tend to specialize in low-cost goods, leaving many upscale specialists withering as their profit margins dwindle. It is almost impossible to find a large old-school retailer whose operating margins haven't faded over the last five years. Trump entered the White House based on a message of business-friendly policies and an understanding of what makes American businesses tick. However, this tweet only shows him to be out of touch with the retail industry's actual state of health and with the forces that are driving retailers into a new era. If you can compete with Amazon and its online peers based on price and convenience, you'll do fine. Ross is doing it without much of an e-commerce strategy, after all. Killing Amazon's e-commerce business by hook, by crook, or by draconian policies would do nothing to revitalize the American mall -- other low-cost shopping solutions would quickly step in to keep the pressure on. Fresh thinking might, but I'd be a highly paid retail consultant if I knew exactly how. Stay tuned, Donald. The retail industry will keep evolving whether you like it or not.

    Trump Can't Blame Amazon.com for the Death of American Retailers -- The Motley Fool

Christy Bieber,08172017,Fool,08102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you're looking forward to getting Medicare because you think this health insurance for seniors will provide comprehensive coverage, you may end up disappointed. Studies have shown seniors with high-prescription drug needs could incur as much as $350,000 in out-of-pocket spending on healthcare during retirement, even with both Medicare and a supplementary Medigap policy. Image Source: Getty Images. You need to be as prepared as you can for high healthcare costs as a senior, and that starts with understanding the kinds of healthcare services that Medicare won't pick up the tab for. Here are seven you should be aware of. Even though about half of all older adults experience some degree of back pain, Medicare won't cover chiropractic care or acupuncture to help manage or eliminate discomfort. While Medicare will cover spinal manipulation when necessary to correct a misalignment in the spine (called a subluxation), routine chiropractic care to stay healthy -- which is called maintenance careÂ -- is not paid for. Acupuncture and many other alternative and holistic treatments are also not covered at all. To try to get your chiropractic costs covered, make sure your doctor knows of any discomfort or symptoms of pain you've been experiencing, as care for an acute condition can be paid for through Medicare. Ask your alternative care practitioner up front how much a procedure will cost and how much insurance may cover -- and before you undergo an alternative treatment in the first place, make sure there are clinical studies attesting to its efficacy. If you become unable to perform the routine activities of daily living, like showering or eating meals on your own, you may require a personal care aide to come to your home and assist you. Medicare will pay for certain types of home care, including occupational therapy, intermittent skilled nursing care, physical therapy and speech therapy services -- as long as your doctor certifies that you need the care as part of a planned course of treatment, and as long as leaving your home is difficult for you. If you need more than intermittent care, or if you need unskilled care -- e.g., help with hygiene, as opposed to physical therapy or injections -- Medicare will not pay for you to receive this type of care in your home. You can purchase long-term care insurance to cover the costs of home health aides, but the premiums can be high, the amount of coverage may be too low, and you may have a long waiting period before the insurer begins to pay for the costs of care. Medicaid will pay for long-term care services for eligible seniors who need more than just intermittent help and who need unskilled services, but in order to qualify for Medicaid, your income and assets must fall below your state's eligibility threshold. Some seniors work with Medicaid planning attorneys to structure the ownership of their wealth in such a way that their assets do not count as resources that would disqualify them from Medicaid coverage. This may be the best way to preserve your wealth and still get long-term care at home if you need it. Another option is to self-insure -- i.e, to pay for long-term care out of your own savings. This is a viable option if you're confident you can pay for a few hundred thousand dollars' worth of long-term care. If you aren't, you may want to explore one of the alternatives above. Like long-term care, nursing home care for eligible seniors can be covered by Medicaid, while Medicare pays only for a brief stay in a skilled nursing facility. You should take the same approach to paying for nursing home care as you would to paying for long-term care. Look into a comprehensive long-term care policy if you can afford it, or make plans to qualify for Medicaid coverage when you need it. The Veterans' Administration may also provide some help covering costs of long-term care and nursing home care for eligible veterans and their family members. Aid & Attendance benefits, for example, are an increase in pension funds for veterans who require care in a nursing home setting or who have functional limitations that leave them unable to do everyday tasks. Medicare does not cover dental services except in limited circumstances, like when you must go to a hospital for a complicated procedure or emergency surgery. You can purchase a Medicare Advantage or Medigap plan to get supplementary coverage for dental care, and this supplementary plan may also cover other costs as well. You can also talk with your doctor about cash discounts or seek care from a dental school if one is located near you. Medicare does not cover routine eye exams, eyeglasses, or contact lenses. Cataract surgery and certain other procedures for the eyes, including emergency procedures, can be covered by Medicare. However, if you just need a routine exam or an updated pair of glasses, you'll have to pay out of pocket. Many Medicare Advantage plans also include vision coverage. Otherwise, online sources likeÂ Zenni OpticalÂ offer glasses as inexpensive as $6.95 plus $4.95 shipping, and discount eye exams are available at big box stores, including most Walmart and Sam's Club stores. Diagnostic hearing tests are covered only if your healthcare provider orders a hearing and balance exam to determine whether you need medical care. Hearing exams and hearing aids are not paid for by Medicare. Purchasing a hearing aid or buying a hearing aid online could save you thousands of dollars, as could shopping at wholesale stores like Costco. Some Medicare Advantage or Medigap plans will also provide at least partial coverage for hearing exams and hearing aides. Although Medicare Part B will pay for a podiatrist to treat foot injuries and diseases such as heel spurs or bunions, you're on your own for routine care like nail clippings, removal of corns or calluses, and preventive maintenance. To save on care costs, consider telemedicine services, or shop around for low-priced care by calling podiatrists in your area. Make sure your doctor knows all that symptoms you're experiencing so your doctor can determine whether you have foot problems that are covered. By working with your caregiver -- not just for foot care but for all the types of care that are not covered -- you can find ways to keep your costs down even for services you have to pay for yourself. Working with a caregiver to lower healthcare costs should help your retirement savings last longer. ","

Â jumped nearly 30%. Market participants said they were also following reports that Gary Cohn was resigning as economic adviser to President Donald Trump, but the White House has countered those rumors. U.S. equity benchmarks had been facing selling pressure at the start of trade, as European markets ended lower after a three-day winning streak. âIn Europe, we had weakness out of the gate and then we had worries about the Cohn news,â said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading, in an interview. âWith the light volume, Barcelona is not something that the market is going to handle well.â The equity market was also digesting minutes from the Federal Reserveâs July meeting, as well as the dissolution of a pair of Trumpâs business-advisory panels, which underscores the presidentâs challenges in promoting his Wall Street-friendly policies. The president has faced a furor after he repeatedly blamed âboth sidesâ for violence last weekend at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Overall, Fed minutes were read as dovish, lowering expectations of another rate increase this year. âThereâs no direct market impact in what Trump has done recently, but if things continue to be so polarized that his agenda is completely dead on arrival, that would have a negative impact,â Alpineâs Spellman said.

Peter Morici,08172017,MarketWatch,08102017,"Published: Aug 11, 2017 9:02 a.m. ET Yellen doesnât understand that low inflation will persist because of changes in economy By Central bankers are captive to conventional economics â faced by low inflation and low unemployment they are flummoxed about pulling back on monetary stimulus. Their dilemma lies in an incorrect reading of statistics and taking modern macroeconomic theory too seriously. Unemployment in the European Union is at its lowest level since 2009, yet inflation across the pond drags along at about 1.3%. U.S. unemployment is at a similar trough, while headline and core inflation remain well below the Fedâs 2% target. According to the textbooks, unemployment and inflation are supposed to move in opposite directions, not in tandem as they have. As summarized by the Phillips curve, falling unemployment should coincide with tightening labor markets and rising wages and prices, and the inverse should be true as unemployment rises. For one thing, headline unemployment rates are proving an increasingly poor measure of what is going on in many labor markets. In the United States and Europe, large numbers of adults are on the dole and opting out of work altogether, and on both continents many university graduates are underutilized in low-paying jobs â serving coffee at Starbucks, chaperoning tours of historic venues, and the like. For another, macroeconomic models deal poorly with the fact that entitlement programs have created large pools of contingent workers â folks who may only again participate in the labor force if wages rise very sharply. More generally, those models paper over other demand- and supply-side structural changes that are holding down prices and subverting the historically expected inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. Central bankers point to low oil prices

Janet Yellen is fond of pointing to falling cell-phone subscription rates â thanks to more intense competition among the four principal carriers. However, even after pulling cell-phone services out of the core deflator for personal consumption â the Fedâs preferred measure of inflation â price increases have been slowing through 2017 and were only 1.6% in June. The cell-phone alibi looks even weaker after considering recent weakness in inflation for apartments, air fares, autos, and apparel. All are items that should exhibit more robust price increases this late in the business cycle but in varying measure, their prices have been dampened by swelling capacity and innovation that push down costs and retail prices. Perhaps the most compelling phenomena have been the intersection of overbuilding in the retail sector â everything from grocery to department stores â and the revolution in supply-chain management and increased competition associated with the Amazon effect. Internet aggregators are driving down supply-chain management costs and prices for many household items and business necessities. With their share of retail at only 8.5% but growing, that downward pressure on inflation is not likely to abate soon.

These kinds of structural changes â all occurring with increasing perforce â simply shift the parameters of the Phillips curve in ways conventional macroeconomic models and the bubble think at central banks cannot accommodate. In many ways, the latter mirrors the obsession central bankers have with trying to inflict inflation on households. Having observed that inflation in the past has accompanied economic growth (and lower unemployment), in a fit of ill-logic they have concluded that at least 2% inflation is necessary to accomplish steady growth. The steady growth in the United States and recent uptick in Europe indicate that simply isnât so, and central bankers should normalize monetary policy now. ",Why central bankers are so confused by low prices - MarketWatch
Peter Morici,08172017,MarketWatch,08102017,"If you want to understand Bridgewater Associates, the cultish hedge fund founded in 1975 by Ray Dalio, which today manages $162 billion, this anecdote, via Bloomberg Markets Magazine, is a good place to start: One video of a meeting included in a 2012 Harvard Business School case study shows Dalio and [co-C.I.O. Greg] Jensen admonishing a younger colleague in an investment meeting for being defensive. Jensen points out the younger manâs habit of using the words âas we have saidâ and then adding a point to his argument that logically doesnât fit, rather than saying âas we missed.â One former employee, who left after less than two years and would speak only on the condition of anonymity, recounted a Maoist-like struggle session where a young male Â­employee was berated by a group of peers and superiors for not being good enough. Instead of helping him improve or getting rid of him, they needed to âget in syncâ about the employeeâs perceived inadequacies, he says. The encounter ended, he adds, with the man firing himself. Sure, it sounds like a human-resources nightmare, especially if youâre not familiar with the company. Who the hell would ever want to work there? most peopleâs reaction will probably be. But for Dalio, who created Bridgewaterâs unique corporate culture, the reaction is likely first pride and then fear: pride at having cultivated something so beautiful, and fear that such a moment, illustrative of how he thinks a workplace should, nay, must operate, may not be repeated after he relinquishes his co-chairman title. Sure, the hedge fund has got Principles, the company handbook Dalio wrote to encourage staff to make âradical truthâ part of everything they doâincluding such maxims as âask yourself whether you have earned the right to have an opinion,â âdonât âpick your battles,â fight them all,â and âfiring people is not a big deal.â And yes, new employees are required to go through a three-week Principles boot camp and are later, through their entire time at the firm, assigned a âweekly quota of homework that includes watching case studies and answering how they would solve a problem based on the rules.â And sure, those same employees/acolytes must ârateâ each other on 75 different attributes 15 times a week to generate âbaseball cardsâ that show âhow much their views can be trusted.â And, of course, current employees, a.k.a. the âculture carriers,â will stress to the next generation that itâs not just appropriate by imperative to conduct a series of interrogations to get to the bottom of something as small as whether a person typed or dictated an e-mail. But what if all thatâs not enough? What if people start thinking it is a big deal to fire someone? What if, one day, someone decides itâs not necessary to gang up on an employee like a pack of hyenas attacking a wildebeest? The entire institution would fall apart! Luckily, though, Dalioâs got a plan for Bridgewaterâs Principles to outlive even himself. Per Bloomberg Markets: Dalio is leaving nothing to chance. In Bridgewaterâs glass-and-stone buildings, a 20-person team has been toiling for the past year on what until now has been a secret project: the company charter. If Dalio is the founding father and the Principles are the constitution, the charter will turn the latter into law. Setting them in stone guarantees that everything from who sets compensation to how the Principles can be changed is governed by a legal system. All this work, the algos and the charter and getting the right management in place, is to help close what Bridgewater insiders call the Ray gap, or the difference between how Dalio has done things and how likely it is the staff he leaves behind can do the same. For Bridgewater, finishing the lawmaking projectâthe companyâs charterâis one of the last steps before Dalio can pass on his boon and just manage Â­money in the woods. This rule of law, rather than rule by whoever is in charge, is âcloser to the U.S. legal systemâ than any guidelines or policies a typical company might have, Dalio says. The effort led by senior managers and board members involves building out and expanding in extraordinary detail a governance structure based on the Principles, he says. The charter will outline how peopleâs votes are weighted and what benchmarks are used to measure investments, among other details. It will even clarify which disputes get escalated to the management committee. The group in charge is also creating a system for how the Principles can be amended, added, or deleted and what happens to employees who donât follow them. Dalio, who says âwhat weâve done is magical,â expects this phase of the charterâs development to take another year to complete. Of course, not everyone thinks the Bridgewater Way of Life is necessarily something to worry about preserving after Ray is gone, or even something that should exist right now. By the firmâs own estimate, 21 percent of employees leave in the first year, with an additional 10 percent leaving in the second. (After that, the company says âattrition falls to the low single digits.â) A former executive once called Bridgewater a âcultâ and recalled a colleague who couldnât sleep at night and would throw up before meetings with Dalio. And while some investors have bought into the notion that Bridgwaterâs âmantra of radical truth and radical transparency is the reason for its success,â others say itâs âhard to tell if itâs gone too far.â (Incidentally, Bloomberg notes that since 2012, the firmâs Pure Alpha II fund âhas posted an annualized return of 2.5 percent . . . a far cry from its historic average of 12 percent,â and is down 2.8 percent for the year through July.) A current employee who came to appreciate the âconstant feedbackâ she once found overwhelming now advises new hires ânot to question whether theyâre enjoying or hating their experience but to keep an open mind.â After all, anyone who would criticize Bridgewater is simply not a believer.

The C.E.O. of ADP isnât a huge Bill Ackman fan Last week, hedge-fund manager Bill Ackmanâs Pershing Square disclosed an 8 percent stake in Automatic Data Processing, nominated three directors to the board, and said it wanted the companyâs C.E.O., Carlos Rodriguez, to be shown the door. Unsurprisingly, this didnât go over very well at A.D.P., which issued a statement noting that âduring Rodriguezâs six-year tenure, ADP has yielded a total shareholder return (T.S.R.) of 202 percent, well in excess of the S&P 500 T.S.R. of 128 percent and many times over Pershingâs T.S.R. of 29 percent.â As corporate press releases go, it was pretty tetchy! But apparently it was just an opening act for Rodriguezâs own response to Ackman, delivered today on CNBC. In an interview with Squawk on the Street, Rodriguez said Ackmanâs request for an extension of the director nomination deadline âkind of reminds me of a spoiled brat in school asking the teacher for an extension for their homework.â Then he likened Ackman to a used-car salesman. âI honestly canât make heads or tails of whatâs going on,â Rodriguez said. âWhat it feels like is Iâm negotiating with someone about buying a used car. And this is not a used car. This is a company that has 58,000 employees, $50 billion market cap, and a lot of shareholders that we have of responsibility toward.â Though the words might have stung, Ackman is no stranger to people going on TV to trash him. In 2013, his longtime nemesis Carl Icahn called into CNBC to say the Pershing Square manager once called him sounding âlike the crybaby in the school yard,â and that he reminded Icahn of âthe little Jewish boys they used to beat upâ at his rough-and-tumble school in Queens. (Icahn also said, âI rue the day I ever met the guy,â and that he âwouldnât invest with [Bill if he] was the last man on Earth.â) Wells Fargo hopes sacrificial board offering will appease God of Bank Fraud As you may have heard, because weâve discussed it at length, the last year has not gone so well for Wells Fargo vis-Ã -vis its name landing in headlines about banks that have screwed over customers. Last September, we learned that as many as 2.1 million accounts may have been opened in customersâ names without said customersâ consent, a number the company recently said in a filing may be bigger than it previously estimated. Last month, it admitted that hundreds of thousands of customers were charged for auto insurance they didnât need, resulting in delinquencies and the wrongful repossession of thousands of peopleâs cars. To top things off, on Friday, Wells agreed to pay $108 million to settle claims, which it denies, that it charged military veterans hidden fees. And while Wells has previously ignored suggestions by the likes of Senator Elizabeth Warren that its entire board be canned, the bankâfacing an unceasing tide of scandals that has created the impression, rightly or wrongly, that screwing over customers is kind of its thingâhas apparently come around to the idea that it better sacrifice one of its own. The board of Wells Fargo& Co., grappling with fresh problems even as it tries to move past the bankâs sales-practices scandal, is planning a shake-up that is likely to include Stephen Sanger stepping down as nonexecutive chairman, according to people familiar with the matter. Directors are aiming to make final decisions on any changes by Labor Day, some of the people said . . . Discussions about board changes have been under way for a few months, spurred by dismal results at the bankâs shareholder meeting. They also come against the backdrop of calls in Washington for even more dramatic action at the bank. Who wants to buy Goldman Sachsâs yacht? It got it from a client, but apparently Lloyd isnât much of a boat guy. Per The Wall Street Journal: The story behind the 217-foot luxury yacht called âNatitaâ begins with a 2014 loan to a prized Goldman client, billionaire Texas oilman William Kallop. It ends with Goldman suing its own client and the U.S. Marshals last month swooping down on a West Palm Beach marina to impound the yachtâwhich boasts a movie theater, Jacuzzi and helipad. Goldmanâs nautical trophy is a strange but inevitable outcome of Wall Streetâs latest gold rush: lending to wealthy clients, the loans backed by everything from Warhols to wine. These loans, which are growing quickly at firms such as Goldman, Morgan Stanley and UBS Group AG, are an exotic spin on the most basic thing banks do: lending money to people. They have the added benefit of building loyalty among prized, ultrawealthy clientele. Like any loans, though, they can go bad and leave banks holding assets that arenât easy to value or sell. Goldman will likely auction âNatita,â which already has been on the market for almost two years with no takers. Wealthy Seattleites are having none of this income tax crap Last month, Seattleâs city council passed a measure that would tax the income of individuals making $250,000 a year, or couples filing jointly making $500,000 a year, at 2.25 percent, a move that is expected to affect 2 percent of Seattleâs taxpayers. And, apparently, thatâs an aggression that cannot stand, so theyâre suing. The Wall Street Journal reports that a conservative think tank called the Freedom Foundation filed a lawsuit on Wednesday, on behalf of 19 Seattle citizens, alleging that the measure âviolates the state constitution as well as restrictions on cities to impose such taxes.â It was followed by a similar suit from a group called the Opportunity for All Coalition, which was founded by venture capitalist Matt McIlwain. In a statement, McIlwain said, âOverturning this city income tax will help to create the most opportunities for the most citizens of our city and state. To me, that feels like a cause worth investing time in.â Elsewhere! Risks of Fiscal Mishap Rise as Debt and Budget Deadlines Loom (W.S.J) U.S. Ran Nearly $43 Billion Budget Deficit in July (W.S.J.)

Sue Chang,08172017,MarketWatch,08102017,"Published: Aug 10, 2017 4:51 p.m. ET Failure to raise debt ceiling could also lead to technical default by U.S. By At least one prominent Wall Street investor seems to think a war with North Korea is a real possibility. Ray Dalio, chairman and chief investment officer at Bridgewater Associates, on Thursday urged investors to hedge their risks with gold amid rising geopolitical tensions. Dalio, in a LinkedIn post, observed that the dangers lurking under the surface appear to be more political than economic, making them difficult to gauge. âProspective risks are now rising and do not appear appropriately priced,â said the chairman of the largest hedge fund in the world. In his view, the two main risks are a military conflict between the U.S. and North Korea, and the possibility of a U.S. default on the failure to raise the debt ceiling. The U.S. and North Korea have engaged in a war of words this week after the Asian country threatened to teach the U.S. a lesson with its nuclear weapons. President Donald Trump responded by warning North Korea that he would respond with âfire and fury like the world has never seen.â The barrage of threats was enough drag down global stock markets, with the S&P 500

Dalio wrote: âMost immediately, during the calm of the August vacation season, we are seeing 1) two confrontational, nationalistic, and militaristic leaders playing chicken with each other, while the world is watching to see which one will be caught bluffing, or if there will be a hellacious war, and 2) the odds of Congress failing to raise the debt ceiling (leading to a technical default, a temporary government shutdown, and increased loss of faith in the effectiveness of our political system) rising.â Both situations are difficult to predict and as such, investors must stay liquid, diversify and not be overly vested in any particular outcome, he said. âIf the above things go badly, it would seem that gold (more than other safe-haven assets like the dollar, yen and treasuries) would benefit, so if you donât have 5%-10% of your assets in gold as a hedge, weâd suggest that you relook at this,â said Dalio. Dalio has been a fairly devout gold bug and has consistently recommended gold over the past few years. And his grim view on world affairs also shouldnât come as a big surprise. Soon after Trumpâs election, the hedge-fund manager predicted that the president is likely to be âcomparativelyâ more aggressive in his foreign policy.

,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"Google, which makes the Android software used to run most of the worldâs smartphones, will offer hundreds of thousands of Walmart items on its voice-controlled Google Assistant platform from late September, Walmartâs head of e-commerce, Marc Lore, wrote in a blog post on Wednesday. Lore, who joined the worldâs largest retailer after it bought his e-commerce company Jet.com, said Wal-Mart would offer a wider selection than any retailer on the platform. Amazon, whose voice-controlled aide Alexa allows users to shop from the retailer, has the lionâs share of the U.S. voice-controlled device industry, with its Echo devices accounting for 72.2 percent of the market in 2016, far ahead of the Google Home gadgetâs 22 percent, according to research firm eMarketer. Amazon has also dominated Wal-Mart and other brick-and-mortar retailers in online sales. Wal-Mart has begun pushing back aggressively, however, offering discounts to customers who buy online and pick up in-store, and free two-day shipping for purchases of $35 or more. The latter move even forced Amazon, which rarely imitates the competition, to lower its threshold for free shipping. Lore said in the blog post Wal-Mart was also integrating its quick reordering tool into Googleâs same-day delivery service. âOne of the primary-use cases for voice shopping will be the ability to build a basket of previously purchased everyday essentials,â he said in an interview. He added that Wal-Mart has bigger plans for voice shopping next year that will involve capitalizing on its 4,700 U.S. stores to âcreate customer experiences that donât currently exist within voice shopping anywhere else.â Customers might be able to use voice shopping to pick up a discounted order in-store or buy fresh groceries across the country, he said. But while both Amazon and Googleâs voice-controlled speakers are gaining in popularity, people still mainly use them for such basic tasks as placing phone calls or playing music. To boost voice purchases, Amazon has started offering Alexa-only shopping deals. âWeâre still in early days, but shopping isnât yet one of the big uses of the devices,â Victoria Petrock, principal analyst at research firm eMarketer, said on Tuesday. âObstacles to people using the devices to shop are cost and privacy. A little more than six in 10 people are concerned that these virtual assistants are spying on them.â ","

,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc warned on Thursday that this quarterâs earnings could miss Wall Streetâs estimates as the worldâs biggest retailer struggles with falling margins due to price-cutting and heavy spending on its e-commerce operations. The companyâs shares fell more than 2 percent, with investors shrugging off a higher full-year profit outlook and sales that defied sluggish consumer demand that has hurt many rivals. Wal-Mart has reported three straight years of comparable sales growth as more people shop at its stores and on its websites. With a steady rise in the number of people who buy online, e-commerce sales growth has been outstripping brick-and-mortar. Like other retailers, Wal-Mart has been aggressively investing in its e-commerce business in the past year. It has begun offering programs like free-two-day shipping and discounts for picking up online purchases at stores, and it acquired several startups, including Jet.com for $3.3 billion last year. The companyâs online sales growth outpaced the industry at 60 percent in the second quarter ended on July 31 but decelerated from the 63 percent increase of the previous quarter. Wal-Mart said most of the growth had come from its own online business and not the acquisitions it has made in the past year. Wal-Mart has also been cutting grocery prices to remain competitive against discounters like Germanyâs Aldi Inc, which is rapidly expanding in the United States, and Lidl, another German rival that has recently started opening stores in the country. Given Wal-Martâs moves, margins may contract for the rest of the year, UBS said in a note to clients. But despite the earnings warning and pressure on margins, most analysts remained bullish on Wal-Mart because of its sales performance. âThe second-quarter numbers show that Wal-Mart remains firmly on the front foot and is more than holding its own in a challenging and competitive retail market,â said GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders. Second-quarter sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.8 percent, excluding fuel price fluctuations and including e-commerce. That exceeded market expectations for a 1.7 percent increase, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. The company cited its grocery and food business, which reported its best performance in five years, and said its online operation added 70 basis points to comparable sales. U.S. store visits were up 1.3 percent from 1.2 percent a year earlier. Total revenue increased 2.1 percent to $123.4 billion from a year earlier. It would have been up 2.9 percent without the effects of currency fluctuations, which the company said had diminished from previous quarters. Net income attributable to Wal-Mart fell 23 percent to $2.9 billion due to a loss from repurchasing debt after a bond tender offer. Excluding special items, earnings per share of $1.08 exceeded the analystsâ average estimate of $1.07, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Gross margins were down 11 basis points at 25 percent, including a five-basis-point decline in the United States, compared with analystsâ expectations of 25.22 percent. Operating margins fell to 4.9 percent from 5.1 percent, and U.S. operating expenses rose 3.9 percent. The company said it expected third-quarter earnings of 90 cents to 98 cents a share, excluding special items. Analysts on average had forecast 98 cents. Wal-Mart raised the low end of its earnings outlook for the full year to $4.30 per share from $4.20, excluding items, while keeping the high end at $4.40. ","

The migrants were found at Playa Munecos in Veracruz, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. There were 55 men, 19 women, 23 boys and 18 girls. The two people driving the truck were arrested, the official said. In July, eight migrants were found dead inside a suspicious tractor trailer in a Walmart parking lot in San Antonio in Texas. At least 100 illegal immigrants were packed in the sweltering tractor-trailer and two more died later. The driver was indicted this month. The number of Central American migrants arrested at the southern U.S. border has fallen sharply since President Donald Trump took office in January. Migrants have increasingly sought to travel through Mexico in large groups in trucks, in order to avoid Mexican immigration authorities who stepped up efforts to stem the migrant flow after a rise in child migrants in 2014.

With the success of Alexa, lots of technology heavy hitters are getting into the smart speaker market. (See also: Why Amazon Is Losing to JD.com and Wal-Mart.) âOne of the primary use cases for voice shopping will be the ability to build a basket of previously purchased everyday essentials. Thatâs why we decided to deeply integrate our Easy Reorder feature into Google Express,â said Marc Lore, president and CEO of Walmart U.S. e-commerce, in the blog post. âThis will enable us to deliver highly personalized shopping recommendations based on customersâ previous purchases, including those made in Walmart stores and on Walmart.com.â Â The company isnât stopping there. The executive said that in 2018 it will create customer experiences within voice shopping that donât currently exist. Some of those include picking up an order in store for a discount or using voice to purchase fresh groceries around the country. Wal-Mart said it chose to team up with Google instead of creating its own tool because of the search giantâs prowess on the voice front. âTheyâve made significant investments in natural language processing and artificial intelligenceâ to deliver a powerful voice shopping experience,â wrote Lore. âWe know this means being compared side-by-side with other retailers, and we think thatâs the way it should be. An open and transparent shopping universe is good for customers.â (See also: Six Retail Stocks That Still Rule: Morgan Stanley.) Wal-Mart's move to interject voice shopping comes at a time when the retailer is trying to make inroads on Amazon, which has long held the top spot in e-commerce. According to The Wall Street Journal, in July, the Seattle-based Amazon said it accounted for close to 45 cents of every dollar that was spent online. Thatâs up from 43 cents in the beginning of 2017. Wal-Mart gets close to 2 cents per dollar, noted the Journal. Walmart is hoping the partnership will lure more shoppers its way. For Google, it is seen as a way to sell more of its voice-activated devices. Reports surfaced earlier this week that the company is gearing up to roll out a smaller version of its Google Home speaker ahead of Apple Inc.âs (AAPL) launch of its Siri-powered HomePod. â ","Walmart, Google Team on Voice Shopping | Investopedia"
David Floyd,08242017,Investopedia,08172017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs It sounds like the Northwest Passage, the Fountain of YouthÂ or El Dorado: the kind of tantalizing myth that spurs minor Spanish nobility to tramp through unfamiliar continents for years on end, but simply doesn't exist. Be that as it may, the Amazon-Proof Retailer might just be a real thing. Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY) has not just avoided the ugly ravages suffered by the likes of Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD) and Macy's Inc. (M). Its shares have actually returned more over the past two years (121%) than Amazon.com Inc.'s (AMZN) have (94%). Unlike other big box retailers, Best Buy has managed to keep its revenues and profits intact in the face of the online juggernaut. Same-store sales growth has been bumpy, but an unexpected surge in the first quarter of 2017 â 1.6% growth compared to a forecastÂ 1.5% decline â sent the stock up by over 20% on May 25. What explains Best Buy's resilience? It has not been able to employ the same defense as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), which simply bought Amazon's competitor Jet.com. Best Buy is less than a twelfth the size of Walmart, measured by market capitalization. However, asÂ CFRA's Efraim Levy wrote in a recent note, the firm uses its physical presence to its advantage: it ""encourages consumers to browse and test electronics, including TVs and stereos in-store."" Any real-world retailer could potentially appeal on similar grounds, but buying a stereo or a flat-screen TV is different from buying a set of drill bits or a dress shirt. You could go to Sears for the drill bits, but they're standardized anyway, so why not order them online? You could go to Macy's for the dress shirt, but you know the size and brand you want, so again, why not go online? In both cases the stakes are low because the costs are. That's not the case for expensive electronics: you want to scrutinize them in person. The risk, from Best Buy's perspective, is that you do that, decide on the exact product you want, then order it on Amazon. To combat that trend, Levy points out, Best Buy matches Amazon's prices. He writes that Geek Squad, the company's technical support service, also acts as a draw, although Amazon has begun offering in-home consultations with Alexa experts. This ""encroachment,"" as Levy puts it, is a reminder that perhaps no retailer is totally Amazon-proof. Grocery stores had appeared immune to disruption since the collapse of dotcom darling Webvan in 2001. Then Amazon bought Whole Foods, knocking 9% off Kroger Co.'s (KR) stock on June 16. If it can be sold, Amazon is likely to try to dominate the market for it. Best Buy may be holding its own for now, but there are no guarantees in Primeworld.

Lauren Thomas,08242017,CNBC,08172017,"Wal-Mart on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings and sales that topped Street expectations, as the big-box retailer made further gains in its online business. Fresh digital initiatives and a growing assortment of products on Walmart.com aided the retailer in boosting online transactions by 60 percent, the company said. Last quarter, e-commerce sales climbed 63 percent, compared with 29 percent growth in the prior quarter. Although many retailers are struggling to draw shoppers in, Wal-Mart posted same-store sales growth at its U.S. locations for the 12th-consecutive quarter, fueled by traffic growth of 1.3 percent, the company said. Despite the news, shares of Wal-Mart were down more than 2.5 percent during premarket trading. Here's what Wal-Mart reported compared to what Wall Street was expecting, based on a Thomson Reuters survey of analysts: ""This isn't a blow-away report ... it's a solid report,"" Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" Wal-Mart's stock has been a ""big outperformer"" of late, Grom added, which can lead to a temporary sell-off, ""even if the print is perfect."" ""I think this number needed to be a little bit better today to drive the stock higher,"" he said. One weakness for Wal-Mart the second quarter was that profit margins fell slightly due to more aggressive promotions. The retailer has been investing heavily to keep its prices competitive, defending market share from Amazon, among other rivals. It also bulking up its online operations. The expensive moves are yielding results. ""Our customers are responding to the improvements in stores and online, and our results reflect this,"" CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. ""Traffic increases at store level and the eCommerce growth rate are key highlights."" The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said it earned 96 cents per share during the period. Excluding one-time charges, the company earned $1.08 a share. Wal-Mart's total sales climbed 2.1 percent from a year ago, to $123.36 billion. This consisted of 3.3 percent sales growth at Wal-Mart U.S. stores, a 1 percent decline in revenues for Wal-Mart's international business and 2.3 percent growth across Sam's Club. Wal-Mart's U.S. comparable sales â a metric closely watched by the Street for retailers â increased 1.8 percent, including fuel. Excluding gasoline sales, comps in the U.S. were up 1.7 percent, which consisted of growth of 1.2 percent at Sam's Club, and an increase of 1.8 percent at Wal-Mart stores. ""It was another solid quarter ... we are pleased with the first half of the year,"" CFO Brett Biggs told CNBC. ""I think one of the things I'm most excited about is that we continued to bring together what we are doing in the stores with what we are doing online."" Looking ahead, Wal-Mart raised the low end of its earnings outlook for the full year, now forecasting profit ranging from $4.30 to $4.40 per share, adjusted. Previously, Wal-Mart had said it expected to earn $4.20 to $4.40 a share. A survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters was calling for earnings per share of $4.37. Same-store sales, excluding fuel, are expected to climb 1.5 to 2 percent at Wal-Mart U.S. locations in the third quarter of 2017. In a competitive retail environment, the big-box retailer has been defending its turf against internet giant Amazon, especially in the digital world. Wal-Mart is also reportedly expanding its online advertising business. Some of Wal-Mart's latest efforts to get purchases more quickly and efficiently to customers include testing an employee delivery program. The retailer is also piloting a push in its same-day service in certain markets, while retail rival Target just landed a partnership to do so. Last September, Wal-Mart purchased e-retailer Jet.com, bringing the website's founder, Marc Lore, to its team. Its e-commerce growth has been accelerating ever since, showing little sign of slowing. These days, Wal-Mart and Amazon.com are neck and neck on pricing. ""As Walmart is a key player across most back-to-school/back-to-college product categories, and we are in the heart of those seasons, we would expect further promotional activity in Q3, with smaller retailers to feel increased levels of stress as Walmart and Amazon continue their battle over market share,"" said Charlie O'Shea, Moody's lead retail analyst. In its fiscal first quarter, Wal-Mart said its grocery business continued to improve across U.S. stores. CFO Biggs told CNBC on Thursday the retailer is pleased with what it's been doing in the food business, and ""online grocery continues to grow rapidly."" During the second quarter, food categories saw their strongest quarterly comparable sales performance in five years, Wal-Mart said. ""One of the particular areas of success for Walmart is grocery,"" GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders wrote in a note to clients. ""Our data show continued gains in customer share, even in areas where discounters like Aldi have expanded. ... [Wal-Mart] is one of the few firms that have the firepower to cope with the push towards compressed prices and margins."" The retailer completed remodels of 283 stores globally in the second quarter, and expanded its online grocery service to include more than 900 locations in the U.S. alone. Retail rival Target on Wednesday reported better-than-expected digital sales growth, as it saw more shoppers returning to its stores and online for ""quick trips"" â ringing up smaller purchases, but more frequently. As of Wednesday's market close, shares of Wal-Mart have climbed about 11 percent over the past 12 months. This far outpaces the S&P 500 Retail ETF's (XRT) declines of about 15 percent over the period. ",Wal-Mart q2 earnings 2017
Lauren Thomas,08242017,CNBC,08172017,"Wal-Mart is quietly growing its online grocery pilot, rolling out the service in two more urban markets this week. If you live in Dallas or Orlando, Florida, you will now be able to order your groceries on Walmart.com and have them delivered to your house via Uber, the big-box retailer announced Monday. Until now, the pilot service with Uber had been available in Phoenix and Tampa, Florida. Wal-Mart has also been running its own grocery delivery service in Denver and San Jose, California. ""We've been testing delivery in a number of ways for a while now in key markets across the country,"" Mike Turner, Wal-Mart's vice president of e-commerce operations, said in a statement. ""In some areas, we're trying general merchandise deliveries led by associates. In others, we're testing grocery delivery using Walmart trucks and drivers."" Just last year, Wal-Mart began testing grocery delivery through services such as Uber. The company also has been testing delivery by its employees, who drop purchases off at customers' homes after a day at work. In its latest earnings report, Wal-Mart management highlighted online grocery as a bright and booming business. CFO Brett Biggs told CNBC last week that the retailer is pleased with what it's been doing in food, and ""online grocery continues to grow rapidly."" During the second quarter, food categories saw their strongest quarterly comparable sales performance in five years, Wal-Mart said. And digital sales were up 60 percent for the period, fueled in part by the retailer's acquisition of Jet.com last September. More and more retailers and grocers alike are looking to grab a share of the online food market before it's too late. Amazon's AmazonFresh program has been a pioneer, prompting other grocers to consider beefing up their e-commerce business or risk losing sales from consumers who are increasingly in search of quick and convenient options. Instacart has been another big player. The same-day grocery delivery start-up has been growing its list of partnerships with retailers including Whole Foods, Costco, CVS and recently Aldi. Target is also gradually making moves to speed its delivery to shoppers' homes, but the big-box retailer's food business isn't as developed as that of some of its peers. Later this week, shareholders of Whole Foods are set to vote on Amazon's takeover bid. While investors are expected to approve the offer, there are many unknowns regarding how this deal, once completed, might impact the supermarket industry. ""The message for all retailers, especially grocers, is simple: Engage with your customers in the manner they want and expect, whether in the digital realm or through traditional channels, or be prepared to lose market share to those that do,"" said Sam Cinquegrani, CEO of ObjectWave.

Thomas Franck,08242017,CNBC,08172017,"Google's partnership with Wal-Mart won't affect Amazon's ascent because similar deals between the search engine and other large retailers have had ""little to no impact"" on the growth of Amazon's shopping services, according to Cowen research. The partnership between Wal-Mart and Google, announced Wednesday, will give shoppers the ability to order hundreds of thousands of products from Wal-Mart by voice through Google Express, its online shopping service. The deal is another strategic step by Wal-Mart to advance its e-commerce operations to compete with Amazon's powerful voice-enabled network Alexa. Google Express came about in 2013 and has deals with Costco and Target, which offer similar goods as Wal-Mart, Cowen analyst John Blackledge said, but those partnerships have ""had little to no impact on Amazon's retail business or the growth of Amazon Prime households."" ""While we are encouraged to see Google continue to enhance its eCommerce/Shopping offering, we believe the attention the announcement received was overblown,"" Blackledge wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. As of Wednesday, Google also began offering free delivery on Google Express orders so long as the order is above each retailer's minimum threshold. Amazon said Thursday that its acquisition of Whole Foods will close Monday, promising ""more to come,"" as the internet giant begins to integrate its Prime membership offerings into the Whole Foods network. Prime members will eventually receive ""special savings and in-store benefits."" Shares of Amazon pared earlier losses Thursday afternoon and sat down 0.33 percent at 3:09 p.m. ET. Shares of Wal-Mart fell after the announcement of the Amazon-Whole Foods deal closure, now down 1.92 percent. While attention has largely been focused on Wal-Mart's new opportunities from the deal, Cowen research also noted that Google could see a meaningful uptick in its Express service. ""Of the United States households purchasing groceries online each month (about 12 percent of U.S. households on average), only about 4 percent bought groceries via Google Express in July '17,"" added Blackledge. That stands in stark comparison to the 46 percent of online grocery shoppers who said they bought goods on Amazon Prime, according to the Cowen report. Still, the analyst said he isn't persuaded that the Google-Wal-Mart agreement means much for Amazon. ""Amazon's end to end voice-enabled shopping solution is a significant advantage versus the Wal-Mart/Google pairing in our view. Overall, we do not see the partnership impacting Amazon's US retail biz and/or Prime Sub penetration."" ",Google-Wal-Mart deal won't stop Amazon's 'retail ascent:' Cowen
Ryan Browne,08242017,CNBC,08172017,"IBM has been joined by a group of global food giants including the likes of Nestle, Unilever and Walmart in an effort to reduce food contamination by using blockchain. The corporation announced Tuesday that it would enable global food businesses to use its blockchain network to trace the source of contaminated produce. One in ten people succumb to illness every year due to contaminated food, according to the World Health Organization. Earlier this month a summit was called by the European Union's food safety commissioner, after a contamination scare over eggs infected with the pesticide fipronil. IBM said that the problem of consumer health suffering at the hands of toxic food could be solved using its distributed ledger technology, which maintains a digital record of transactions rather than a physical one. It would enable food suppliers to source information about the origin, condition and movement of food, and to trace contaminated produce in mere seconds. ""The whole opportunity that we share is to provide transparency across the ecosystem today,"" Brigid McDermott, IBM's vice president for blockchain business development, told CNBC over the phone. IBM's blockchain specialist said that building a blockchain network meant providing both a ""brilliant solution"" and a ""growing ecosystem"". ""That's what we're trying to do,"" she said. ""We're trying to use that to get that transparency across the whole system so that we can find the problem, so that we can make it easier for people to run safer systems, run safer food supply chains."" Walmart has previously worked with IBM to digitally track the movement of food. At a meeting of shareholders in June, Frank Yiannas, vice president for food safety at Walmart, demonstrated the process of tracking information using blockchain in less than 3 seconds. ""Blockchain technology enables a new era of end-to-end transparency in the global food system â equivalent to shining a light on food ecosystem participants that will further promote responsible actions and behaviors,"" Yiannas said in a press statement on Tuesday. ""It also allows all participants to share information rapidly and with confidence across a strong trusted network. This is critical to ensuring that the global food system remains safe for all."" Blockchain - or distributed ledger technology - is a decentralized log of data maintained on a network of computers, rather than a physical ledger. The original blockchain was created by bitcoin-founder Satoshi Nakamoto to serve as the public ledger for all bitcoin transactions. Experts believe the technology could provide a secure, transparent network of information, and revolutionize industries ranging from healthcare to agriculture. ""We see other industries like energy, healthcare and marketing, looking at transformation that really could be happening,"" IBM's McDermott said. ""And I think it's partially because the transformation you see happening with blockchain can come from different areas."" Another blockchain expert from Hyperledger, the open source blockchain platform which IBM built its solution on, said that blockchain was likely to continue broadening out from financial services to other big sectors. ""Because it can impact every sector out there, it's no surprise that the sectors that are most interested are those that are extremely transactionally and actually fairly distributed,"" Brian Behlendorf, Hyperledger's executive director, told CNBC in a phone call earlier this month. ""The financial markets, even if you divide that into core banking, into capital formation, private equity â all of these different domains have ledgers at the heart of what they do. And building a distributed ledger is a way to reconcile these ledgers."" Behlendorf added: ""But also health care, also supply chains; those are recurring themes. Any big sector, any big component in the U.S. GDP (gross domestic product), it's likely that they're talking about blockchain pilots.""

Lauren Thomas,08242017,CNBC,08172017,"After Amazon announced its plan to acquire Whole Foods, the market started buzzing about the internet giant's next potential acquisition. Then there's big-box retailer Wal-Mart, which has also been on a buying spree of late. The two companies are competing for the same shoppers, as one attempts to step into the other's core area of focus â Wal-Mart growing its e-commerce platform, and Amazon expanding a portfolio of real estate. All things considered, location intelligence company Foursquare, which is able to track where users are ""checking in,"" has made a prediction of the retailers it believes Wal-Mart and Amazon might go after next. ""We can make informed recommendations about which brands Amazon and Walmart should target next using our proprietary data-driven insights,"" Foursquare CEO Jeff Glueck said in a blog post Wednesday. Foursquare analyzed foot traffic trails from more than 2.5 million Americans, anonymously, between January 2016 and June 2017. The acquisition that makes the most sense, for both companies, is department store chain Nordstrom, Glueck said. This prediction comes as the Nordstrom family has been searching for its own buyer, hoping to take the company private. A representative from Nordstrom didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on this story. Nordstrom shoppers are about two times more likely to shop at Whole Foods than the average consumer, according to Foursquare, so that's where a deal with Amazon begins to make sense. ""An Amazon-owned Nordstrom chain would deepen Amazon's relationships with its expanding core base,"" Glueck said. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart might want a company like Nordstrom in its portfolio to capture more millennial shoppers; Nordstrom shoppers are, on average, 55 percent less likely to shop at Wal-Mart than other American consumers, Foursquare found. Following a similar trend of Wal-Mart acquiring more millennial-friendly apparel brands ModCloth and Bonobos, ""A Nordstrom purchase would help Walmart further develop the expertise to combat Amazon,"" Glueck said. Another retailer that would make sense for both Amazon and Wal-Mart to consider acquiring is Warby Parker, Foursquare says. In this deal, Amazon would learn from Warby's ""showroom experiments"" in the brick-and-mortar world, while Wal-Mart could ""lure Warby ladies into its big-box stores."" In picking one unique partnership for both Amazon and Wal-Mart, Foursquare has suggested the internet giant acquire Lowe's and the big-box retailer look to Ulta Beauty. ""Amazon loves to win, so imagine what would happen if they cut prices and sacrificed margin to compete for marketshare, further growing their share of DIY homeowners,"" Glueck wrote about Lowe's working with the e-commerce conglomerate. Meantime, in Ulta Wal-Mart would find a loyal customer base. ""Our data also shows that there are a wide swath of Ulta shoppers who are just as likely as the average consumer to visit Walmart, whereas another cosmetics brand â Sephora, for example would be less of a willing convert to an Ulta/Walmart store,"" Glueck said. ""Walmart likely covets Ulta's customer base."" It's true, beauty marks a bright spot in retail today as apparel companies and other specialty names are struggling to keep pace with change. And home improvement companies Home Depot and Lowe's have already seen their stocks take somewhat of a hit on fears that they aren't ""Amazon-proof."" Notably, in the spring of 2016, Foursquare CEO Glueck told CNBC he was predicting Chipotle's comparable sales would fall by 29 percent in its first quarter, based on user data tracked via the company's app. Two weeks later, Chipotle reported sales dropped 29.7 percent. Amazon, Wal-Mart, Warby Parker, Lowe's and Ulta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ","Foursquare uses data to predict next acquisitions by Amazon, Wal-Mart,"
Elizabeth Gurdus,08242017,CNBC,08172017,"With Amazon's stock down over 125 basis points from its high, CNBC's Jim Cramer couldn't help but wonder if the e-commerce giant was the most vulnerable of the top tech stocks. The ""Mad Money"" host pointed to Wednesday's news that Wal-Mart would partner with Google to link Wal-Mart shoppers' accounts with a Google-made, voice-enabled device. While Cramer nodded to the power and machine-learning capabilities of Amazon's voice-enabled technology, Alexa, he saw the announcement as a clear attempt to stem Amazon's domination. ""Wal-Mart's not going to be outdone with its Google partnership. They have too much money riding on this fight and the company keeps assuring me that we ain't seen nothing yet out of theses partnerships. I like this battle royal. Plus, Google may know even more about you than Amazon does,"" Cramer said. ""Combine Google and Walmart, and for the first time â maybe the first time in a long time, maybe the first time ever â it feels like Amazon could have a real rival, someone to fear and loathe on the Alexa trail."" As U.S. retailers race to adjust to an increasingly online shopping environment, PVH President and CEO Manny Chirico told CNBC that the e-commerce pain isn't affecting much overseas. ""The department store channel there continues to be fairly strong, and our own stores and our own direct e-commerce business is very strong,"" Chirico told Cramer on Wednesday. ""I have to be honest, we're clearly taking market share in Europe, and same thing in China."" Sitting down with Cramer after the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger parent reported earnings, Chirico touted the brands' mid-to-high single-digit same-store sales growth, a key measure of success for retailers. Particularly in Europe, Chirico said Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein were both growing at double-digit rates, with Calvin seeing a 25 percent boost in the company's latest quarter. Wall Street traders are all to familiar with oil's recent trajectory â trading in a tight range and struggling to break out above $50 a barrel. But if oil's 2014 crash was an obstacle for Pioneer Natural Resources chief Timothy Dove, it was hardly enough to eradicate the U.S. oil industry altogether, he told CNBC on Wednesday. ""It's a bit like waking the sleeping giant,"" Pioneer's president and CEO told Cramer. ""In other words, challenging U.S. industry to improve in the face of adversity, in this case price adversity, is something that we all stood up to and accepted."" During the crash, oil prices tumbled from over $100 to the $40s in about a year. But rather than letting the fall shutter the oil industry altogether, Dove said it actually spurred innovation. You've won the Powerball. You're on top of the world. You can taste the $700 million already. But wait! Cramer has seven rules that will ensure your winnings don't get squandered. ""First and foremost, you take the money all at once,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Don't let them string it out like that. You want the time value of all that cash working for you. That's vital."" Cramer's second vital step is to pay your taxes right away. Finally, Cramer checked in on Align Technology, the orthodontic device provider best known for making Invisalign, a clear, removable alternative to traditional braces. In light of dental equipment player Straumann's recently announced takeover of ClearCorrect, one of Align's competitors, Cramer wondered how the merger might affect Align's business. ""I've been thinking about this and I've gotta tell you, I'm not all that concerned,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Most braces are sold by orthodontists, not the general dental practitioners that Straumann focuses on. Consider it more of a separate set of goods sold to a different set of dentists than a true replacement offered to Align's existing clients at a lower price point than Align can offer."" After all, Straumann has zero exposure to the North American orthodontist market. Align takes in 60 percent of its sales from it. And to the extent that other dental providers start giving people ClearCorrect products, Cramer saw it as an extension of the market where Align is the leader. Shirley Stacy, the vice president of corporate and investor communications at Align, responded to Cramer's analysis in an email to CNBC: ""We expect competition in the clear aligner space to accelerate as companies recognize that outdated metal braces are a thing of the past and move to take advantage of the huge market opportunity for clear aligners. With new entrants, market awareness grows, the clear aligner category grows faster, and the market expands significantly,"" Stacy wrote. ""Align's clear-aligner-focused company strategy and Invisalign['s] brand strength, combined with decades of technology advancements and tremendous know-how in moving teeth with plastic, gives us the confidence to continue to successfully compete."" And the ""Mad Money"" host seemed to be on board with Stacy's remarks. ""Align's products have proven to be more popular. Invisalign is simply better,"" Cramer said. ""Look, I know competition is anathema to profits, but I really don't believe this Straumann-ClearCorrect deal represents a meaningful threat to Align Technology. That said, we prefer to buy high-quality stocks into weakness. Maybe we should just hope that Align pulls back again, giving us the opportunity to get into this quintessential look-you-selfie-best, 'InstaImperative' stock.""

Elizabeth Gurdus,08242017,CNBC,08172017,"Retail competition is at the forefront of Wall Street yet again as retailers release their earnings reports, and Jim Cramer is seeing a divide form around the industry's most powerful disruptor. ""When the book is closed on retail this quarter, we're going to have two different narratives: there are the companies that Amazon can crush and the companies that Amazon should admire or perhaps even fear,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. As of Thursday, one company stood out to Cramer as the competitor Amazon should worry most about: Wal-Mart. The discount retailer's second-quarter earnings report not only beat the Street's estimates on earnings per share and revenue, but also saw a 60 percent boost in online sales. Wal-Mart's same-store sales, a key measure of success for retailers, ticked up as well thanks to traffic growth, a much sought-after trend at many struggling brick-and-mortar businesses. Cramer attributed Wal-Mart's online growth to its 4,100-store network, which makes it easy for the family-owned company's 100 million weekly shoppers to pick up their goods in-store. ""You could also look at Wal-Mart's store base as 4,100 distribution centers with easy delivery for food, blunting the footprint of Amazon, which will only have a 10th of the stores that Wal-Mart has when that Whole Foods deal closes,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart's CEO, told Cramer exclusively on Thursday that ""we're taking 140 million transactions a week [and] combining it with our exploding online business to serve customers in a seamless way, in-store and online. We will own the intersection of physical and digital shopping."" Plus, Jet.com, the e-commerce platform Wal-Mart acquired in 2016, has been thoroughly integrated into Wal-Mart's ""family"" thanks to the work of its founder, Marc Lore, Cramer said. ""Speaking of family, that's Wal-Mart's ace in the hole,"" Cramer added. Amazon may turn to the capital markets for the money it needs in place of profits, he said, but Wal-Mart has its legacy owners, the Walton family, to provide a similar cushion that goes hand in hand with Wal-Mart's bargaining power with product suppliers. ""And there too, lies the real Achilles Heel of Amazon: the clout Walmart still has over its suppliers,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Amazon is likely the biggest customer of almost every single U.S.-based consumer products company. Most of those companies' websites are hosted by Amazon Web Services, the e-commerce giant's cloud computing arm. But those same companies risk losing Wal-Mart's business by partnering with Amazon for the cloud, and they want their products featured on the big-box retailer's shelves as much as they want them on Amazon.com, Cramer said. ""If I'm the chief technology officer of any supplier, I'm going to green-light shifting away from Amazon Web Services to the ultra-competitive Microsoft Azure or Google Web Services,"" Cramer said. ""That way, my CEO can go to Wal-Mart's headquarters and say, 'Hey, we know the score. We're not trading with the enemy anymore.'"" So the two giants are neck-in-neck; Amazon's Alexa steers customers towards Amazon's products, while Wal-Mart's free two-day delivery challenges Amazon Prime's membership fee, and their product prices are comparably attractive. ""Let just call it as it is: a legitimate, two-horse race with others bringing up the rear, but at least they're now at the track,"" Cramer said. Questions for Cramer?

Rebecca Ungarino,08242017,CNBC,08172017,"Home improvement retailer Lowe's is set to release its quarterly earnings Wednesday before the market opens, and some will be watching specifically for any evidence of Amazon's impact on the chain. The company's earnings are of particular importance to Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, as he views it as a gauge of housing market demand, as well as the broader retail sector. Lowe's management may reveal that Amazon's e-commerce convenience has negatively impacted its business, Schlossberg said, as it was perceived to have done to competitor Home Depot earlier this month. ""Amazon doesn't have to copy a lot of Lowe's inventory to be able to steal away some of the low-lying fruit, by simply allowing people to order many of these items online versus in-store. So Wall Street is going to be watching very carefully to see what kind of forward guidance Lowe's management gives, and whether they are going to admit or acknowledge any type of bleeding effect from Amazon that Home Depot â¦ also sort of alluded to in their call earlier"" this year, Schlossberg said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" Indeed, last week shares of Home Depot fell 3 percent, even as its quarterly earnings beat analysts' estimates, amid fears that company would suffer further from competition from Amazon. ""Amazon does not have to really compete on [a] full catalog basis with Lowe's. They can sell lamps, and furnishings, and all of the fixtures at a much lower cost, with much easier delivery method, and that could really impact Lowe's bottom line very harshly,"" Schlossberg pointed out.  Analysts seem to be arguing, he said, that if there is a dip in the stock after its earnings report Wednesday, that it would present an attractive buying opportunity because ""Lowe's has generally been a good dividend payer, and is more or less a good quality business."" But Schlossberg is more cautious, because if retail stocks are in the midst of a more ""secular decline,"" it's more than just the immediate part of Lowe's business, and ""we could be seeing a much longer-term downward bleed in Lowe's, and I would be much more cautious in picking my spots as to where I want to come in on the price."" On a grander scale, Schlossberg said the larger question surrounding the business is not so much to do with its own business but rather whether can Lowe's ""fend off"" outside forces like the potential for rising interest rates giving way to slowing demand in the housing market, in addition to Amazon's threat. In a bullish note to clients published last week, BTIG analysts Alan Rifkin and Marvin Fong wrote that they expect earnings per share to beat expectations, reiterating their buy rating and bullish $95 per share price target (implying more than 25 percent upside for the now-$75.82 stock). They wrote that concerns around the company's ability to compete with Amazon wading into the appliance market, as was announced earlier this summer, are ""overblown."" ""While Amazon is never to be taken lightly, we believe Lowe's has a significantly more robust product lineup in terms of breadth of top brands and selection within brands,"" they wrote.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,08242017,Fool,08172017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is the biggest retailer on the planet. A ruthless competitive strategy focused on offering the lowest possible prices has yielded a business that generates nearly $500 billion of annual revenue.Â Its long-term stock returns have been phenomenal, too, as its founding share owners are some of the richest people in the world. Let's take a look at the main sources of revenue and profits for one of capitalism's greatest success stories. Image source: Getty Images. Wal-Mart's business is split into three segments: U.S. retailing, international retailing, and the warehouse division that operates under the Sam's Club brand. The U.S. unit is by far the largest. It's comprised of 4,600 Wal-Mart stores that spread out 700 million square feet of selling space across the country. The segment generated $308 billion of revenue in the most recent fiscal year to account for 64% of the entire business. For context, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is the nation's second-largest retailer, with approximately $84 billion of annual sales. Next up is the international segment that's worth one-quarter of Wal-Mart's annual sales haul, or $116 billion. This segment has been shrinking as a percentage of total sales for several years, but that's only because of unfavorable foreign currency moves. When adjusted for that shift, the division would have ticked higher by 3% to $127 billion last year as opposed to the 6% decline that the company actually reported. Finally, Wal-Mart's membership club business accounts for $60 billion of annual sales, or about 12% of the revenue base. The segment is dwarfed by industry leader Costco, whose 512 U.S. locations generate over $80 billion of annual revenue. Wal-Mart is making less money today than in years past. In fact, operating income has decreased for two consecutive years and earnings last year were $13.6 billion, down from $16.2 billion in 2015. Return on investment, a key measure of operating efficiency, also slipped to 15.2% in fiscal 2017 from 15.5% the prior year. WMT Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts. Increased spending is the main driver behind that slump. Wal-Mart is directing more cash toward its employees through training, education, and increased wages in the core U.S. market. It has also been shelling out billions of dollars in building up its online infrastructure in response to the long-run shift toward digital shopping. The moves appear to be paying off for the business. E-commerce sales spiked 60% in the most recent quarter as the company's online inventory ballooned to almost 70 million items, many of which can be delivered to a customer's home in two business days or less. Wal-Mart's physical locations are also enjoying a healthy rebound. Increased customer traffic has helped comparable-store sales improve for 12 consecutive quarters. Wal-Mart's growth pace is still modest, and that's partly a consequence of its massive size. Costco is expanding at a 5% rate these days, after all, compared to the retailing king's 2% uptick. The online sales threat should continue pressuring profits in the coming years, and so shareholders can't count on anything like the booming earnings growth that characterized this business in the past. WMT Cash from Operations (Annual) data by YCharts. Yet Wal-Mart remains an attractive investment thanks to its dominant market position, stellar cash flow, and solid dividend yield. These metrics point to decent returns for shareholders of this industry leader despite the likelihood that its market share will shift toward online-focused rivals over time. ","
      
    How Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Makes Most of Its Money -- The Motley Fool

Danny Vena,08242017,Fool,08172017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There has been a prevailing concern among retailers in general, and Wal-Mart StoresÂ (NYSE:WMT) in particular, that competition from e-commerce juggernaut Amazon.comÂ (NASDAQ:AMZN) would be the death of the American retailer. Wal-Mart has been on the defensive as more and more consumers opt for the ease and convenience of online shopping. When Wal-Mart reported its financial results, investors were looking for signs that the world's largest retailer could meet the challenges presented by the shift in consumer behavior. As it turns outs, the company showed that its strategy is bearing fruit. Wal-Mart's online sales take center stage. Image source: Wal-mart. In the just completed quarter, Wal-Mart produced revenue of $123.4 billion, an increase of 2.1% over the prior year quarter, and comparable sales that increased 1.8% year over year, prompted by a 1.3% increase in foot traffic. Those increases came at a cost, however, as competition in groceries led to discounting, causing operating income to fall 3.2% as a result. Wal-Mart has increasingly focused its efforts on building out its online sales, while leveraging physical stores to its advantage. One example is the company's offer of free shipping on orders that exceed $35 and discounts for items not offered in stores that can be ordered online and scheduled for in-store pickup. There are signs that these efforts are paying off, as the headline of Wal-Mart's financial report was the massive increase in e-commerce sales, which grew by 60% year over year, with gross merchandise volume increasing 67% over the prior-year quarter. Wal-Mart has been beefing up its e-commerce capabilities, starting with the acquisition of online retailer Jet.com for $3.3 billion last year and the appointment of founder Marc Lore as its head of e-commerce. That move was followed by a flurry of smaller purchases earlier this year that included outdoor retailer Moosejaw, women's clothier Modcloth, and men's clothing company Bonobos. These acquisitions have been part of a major effort by Wal-Mart to transform its online strategy and become a meaningful competitor in the world of e-commerce. The motivation behind several recent purchases may offer the most insight into Wal-Mart's ultimate strategy. High-end men's apparel purveyor Bonobos is renowned for its seamless integration of online and physical retail stores, focus on customer service, and its minimalist retail footprint. Smaller locations in major cities allow customers to try on garments that are later drop shipped. Wal-Mart gained access not only to more affluent shoppers but the expertise in creating a hybrid business model that combines physical and digital retail. Walmart's Pickup program allows customers to order products online and have them ready for pickup in stores. Image source: Wal-Mart. When executive Marc Lore sold Jet.com to Wal-Mart, his brainchild was expanding quickly but had yet to produce a profit. His mandate to quickly ramp up the company's e-commerce strategy has given birth to a new emphasis on meeting the customers where they are. He instituted Pickup, which allows customers to order from over a million of the company's most popular items on the website for in-store pickup.Â Many of those items are available on the same day, and Lore notes that 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, offering speed and convenience. The story of e-commerce is still in its early chapters, as online sales accounted for only 8.2% of total U.S. retail sales for the quarter ended June 2017.Â While Amazon has been the primary beneficiary of the shift to online sales, Wal-Mart's recent results show that there's room for more than one winner in the space. The company is developing a blueprint for how to compete in an Amazon-centric world: a multi-channel presence that combines the ease of online shopping with the advantages gained by a large physical store presence. Add an extreme focus on customer service, an eye toward convenience, and a variety of pickup and delivery options, and Wal-Mart may have the template needed to actually thrive in the digital economy.

Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) reported fiscal 2018 second-quarter results on Aug. 17. The retail colossus continues to enjoy strong growth in its e-commerce operations and improving performance in its stores, prompting management to raise its earnings guidance for the year ahead. Metric Q2 2018 Q2 2017 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $123.355 billion $120.854 billion 2.1% Operating Income $5.969 billion $6.165 billion (3.2%) Adjusted EPS $1.08 $1.07 0.9% Data source: Wal-Mart Stores Q2 2018 earnings press release. (Opens PDF) Total revenue grew 2.1% to $123.4 billion, and 2.9% on a constant currency basis. U.S. comparable-store sales -- excluding the impact of fuel prices -- rose 1.8%, fueled by a 1.3% increase in traffic. Additionally, nine of Wal-Mart's 11 international markets enjoyed positive comp sales, helping Walmart International's net sales rise 1% (2.5% in constant currency), to $28.3 billion. Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce business continued its torrid growth, with sales surging 60%, following a 63% jump in the first quarter. Gross merchandise volume soared 67%, as Wal-Mart expanded its online assortment of goods to more than 67 million products. Notably, e-commerce growth was primarily driven by higher organic sales through Walmart.com, which were further boosted by recent e-commerce acquisitions such as Bonobos. Wal-Mart has become a powerful force in online retail. Image source: Getty Images. ""Our customers are responding to the improvements in stores and online, and our results reflect this,"" said CEO Doug McMillon in a press release. ""We are moving faster and becoming more creative as we strive to make every day easier for busy families."" However, Wal-Mart's technology investments and its move to lower prices at many of its stores in order to drive sales weighed on profits. Gross margin fell 11 basis points, and operating income declined 3.2% (1.6% in constant currency), to $6 billion. Fortunately, Wal-Mart continues to gush cash, to the tune of more than $11 billion in operating cash flow and nearly $7 billion in free cash so far in fiscal year 2018. In turn, the retail behemoth was able to return $3.8 billion to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks in the second quarter. Wal-Mart expects third-quarter comp sales growth (ex. fuel) of 1.5% to 2% for its U.S. locations and 1% to 1.5% for its Sam's Club stores. Earnings per share are projected to be between $0.90 and $0.98. The company also boosted its fiscal 2018 full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $4.30 to $4.40, up from a previous forecast of $4.20 to $4.40. ""We're uniquely positioned to deliver the seamless, fast, innovative and exciting shopping experience our customers desire,"" McMillon said during Wal-Mart's earnings call. ""We have a clear strategy that we're executing against and good momentum across the business."" ","

Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) just teamed up with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The Google Express service already featured 46 retail partners, but none with the market heft of Sam Walton's shopping empire. Now that Wal-Mart is aboard, does that make Google Express a serious challenger to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and its voice-shopping tools powered by Alexa and Amazon Echo? Let's find out. Voice-controlled shopping could make this tablet-tapping experience look quaint. Image source: Getty Images. Google Express has been around for six months now. The service lets you place online shopping orders through a web site, a mobile app, or the voice-controlled Google Assistant tool. It's the last option that's a potential game-changer here, and it includes support for the Google Home voice-controlled home automation helper. The service has featured a plethora of household-name retail partners from the start. The original announcement name-dropped Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), and Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM). Early additions included Target (NYSE:TGT) and Kohl's (NYSE:KSS). Any way you slice it, that was always a pretty impressive range of well-known store brands. I wouldn't be surprised to see Whole Foods dropping off Google's partner list since it was bought by Amazon, but the organic food store veteran is still aboard the good ship Google Express. Wal-Mart takes Google Express to a whole new level. The annual sales of the other retailers I've listed here add up to just 70% of Wal-Mart's revenue tally. Also, Google Express doesn't blanket the American map equally. If you're shopping from New York City, you'll have access to 36 stores today (not including Wal-Mart, which joins the fray in September). In Beverly Hills, California the list shrinks to 34 names. In the relative backwaters of Tampa, Florida, I have to settle for 29 store partners. Wal-Mart should pop up on most of these lists next month, given the retailer's massive footprint of physical stores. And if you only get one shopping option, Wal-Mart offers a juicy combo of low prices and a wide product selection. If Wal-Mart was shopping around for an e-commerce partner, Google claimed a big prize here. Of course, the retailer's management takes a dim view of rising rival Amazon, and was never likely to throw in its lot with the leading e-commerce platform anyhow. But the online shopping market is larger than just Amazon and Google, so at least this deal keeps Wal-Mart's partnership away from other hopefuls. These are still the early days of online shopping in general and of voice-driven shopping tools in particular. We are watching a few major players in these markets staking out their strategies right now. It's a little early to pick long-term winners here, even if the largest retailer on the planet is teaming up with a leading online business early on. As a shareholder of both Alphabet and Amazon, I hope to see both companies escalating this fight much further. Voice-powered technology is one of the biggest sea changes going on right now, and pairing that revolution with the cold, hard dollars of shopping experiences can only be a good thing -- for the winners.

    Will Wal-Mart Make a Shopping Giant Out of Google Express? -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,08242017,Fool,08172017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A number of analysts, journalists, pundits, and investors have spent a lot of time trying to guess which companies Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) may buy next. In fact, you could probably find an article or a report linking one brand or the other to nearly every struggling retailer and upstart pure-digital brand. This type of speculation has only gotten stronger since Amazon agreed to buy grocer Whole Foods for $13.7 billion and Wal-Mart agreed to spend $310 million to buy upscale men's clothing retailer Bonobos. Beyond pure speculation, the people at Foursquare, which calls itself a ""location intelligence"" company, believe they can use data-driven insights to predict which companies both retailers will target next. ""Our analysis is driven by the unique perspective we have based on our location intelligence and our understanding of how people move through more than 105 million locations around the globe,"" the company said in a post on Medium by CEO Jeff Glueck. Could Wal-Mart or Amazon be eyeing Nordstrom? Image source: Nordstrom. Foursquare went into its research using what can be gleaned about each company's potential purchases based on its past ones. It found, for example, that Amazon ""prefers brands that foster an even deeper relationship with its current shopping base,"" while Wal-Mart is looking for companies that help it play catch-up in e-commerce. Both companies, Glueck wrote, ""are interested in attacking verticals that have proved resistant to e-commerce penetration."" In addition, both appear to value companies that use a limited amount of retail locations to push immediate in-person or later online purchases. Based on those assumptions and its interpretation of data, Foursquare came up with a list of three companies the retailers could be interested in. The company does acknowledge that ""location intelligence is only one factor in evaluating such a transaction,"" but pointed out that its past history of prediction success shows ""it's a good one."" Foursquare found that both companies would be smart to consider buying fashion retailer Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN) and growing eyeglasses company Warby Parker. The analysis shows that Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack customers are 55% less likely to go to Wal-Mart than the average American. ""What Nordstrom does have is a bona-fide track record as well as a healthy concentration of Millennials and females, a nice addition for Walmart to balance out the purchase of Bonobos, which has a wider male reach,"" according to the report. Foursquare believes that while Wal-Mart could buy Nordstrom to reach new customers, Amazon might buy it to expand its offerings to core customers. ""Nordstrom shoppers are almost 2X more likely to shop at Whole Foods than the average consumer,"" wrote Glueck. ""So an Amazon-owned Nordstrom chain would deepen Amazon's relationships with its expanding core base."" When it comes to Warby Parker, many of the reasons are the same. A shocking 80% of Warby Parker customers also shop at Whole Foods, according to Foursquare data. ""Amazon's acquisition would improve Warby Parker's distribution and reduce their shipping costs -- fueling growth and padding pockets, too,"" Glueck wrote. Were Wal-Mart to buy the eyeglass brand, it would be doing so to bring in women and millennial customers to its stores. Foursquare's data show that 55% of Warby Parker shoppers are millennial. ""It's a similar hand to what Walmart played for Bonobos, but on a bigger scale,"" Foursquare reported. Warby Parker customers are also 80% less likely to visit a Wal-Mart compared to the average American. So a purchase would, much like the Bonobos deal, give the retailer a way to bring in fresh customers. Foursquare's research also showed that Amazon might buy Lowe's while Wal-Mart could make a play for Ulta Beauty. Just because a deal falls in line with what a company has done in the past does not mean it will make it. Foursquare's research is interesting because it uses data to identify logical purchases for both retailers. You can see why Amazon or Wal-Mart would want Nordstrom or Warby Parker, but factors like price and management would play into any deal as well. This type of research may be useful to both companies in helping them evaluate potential purchases. Knowing where else your customers do (and don't) shop allows both brands to look at whether a deal would bring in new users or deepen their relationship with existing ones. ","
      
    Which Companies Might Amazon and Wal-Mart Buy Next? -- The Motley Fool

Tiny stocks don't get a lot of love on Wall Street -- and by tiny I mean companies that have a share price of under $5. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock that trades at ""less than $5 per share"" is referred to as a penny stock.Â Penny stocks are usually highly speculative investments that we long-term investors leave to the traders. Futhermore, many are often listed on over-the-counter exchanges as opposed to reputable exchanges like the NYSE. However, not every stock that has a share price under $5 deserves to be thrown out with the bathwater. Some of the stock markets' hidden gems can be found with share prices in the low single-digits. After all, great businesses have to start from somewhere. Image source: Getty Images. If you're looking for the next Mighty Mouse of sorts, take a closer look at these three top stocks under $5. If you were to just look at the headline figures for Yamana Gold (NYSE:AUY), a gold producer with properties in North and South America, in the first and second quarter of this year, you'd probably turn around and walk away. In fact, Yamana's missed Wall Street's profit per share consensus for five consecutive quarters. But if you were to turn your back on Yamana now, you'd be overlooking what could be one of the most prolific growth stories throughout the remainder of the decade. Yamana currently has six producing mines, but it's about to get some new additions. Its Cerro Moro mine remains on budget and on schedule with production slated to begin in early 2018.Â Over its first three years of production, Cerro Moro should yield an annual average of 150,000 ounces of gold and 7.2 million ounces of silver. Similarly, the recommissioning of C1 Santa Luz, which is also expected in 2018, should add an average of 114,000 ounces of gold annually over the approximate 10-year mine life. On a smaller note, the Suruca development within the Chapada mine could be producing by 2019, with a yield of 45,000 ounces of gold to 60,000 ounces of gold annually for up to five years.Â All of this new production is expected to boost revenue by about 33% and cash flow per share by roughly 50%! Image source: Getty Images. Gold investors also shouldn't overlook a number of macroeconomic catalysts that could positively impact Yamana's margin. For instance, even though higher interest rates are generally bad news for spot gold, we're seeing plenty in the way of domestic and international political uncertainty, and the U.S. dollar has been pushing to greater than one-year lows. The dollar and gold usually move in opposite directions. If the price of gold goes up, Yamana's margin would be expected to follow. Despite its sub-$3 price tag per share, Yamana carries around a very respectable $2.6 billion market cap. This is a small stock in share price only -- it's a top stock in the making within the gold industry. If you prefer to live a little more dangerously and enjoy a good risk-versus-reward stock, then clinical-stage biotech Geron (NASDAQ:GERN), with its share price of just $2, could be the shot in the arm you're craving. The risk with Geron is plainly apparent: It has one drug in development (imetelstat) and has done essentially nothing with its other drug development ventures throughout the years. Like Yamana's recent quarterly results, Geron's history is probably enough to make fundamental-focused investors turn up their nose and walk away. But there's a really intriguing story behind imetelstat that could add significant value to Geron's $325 million market cap. Something amazing happened roughly four years ago: Geron went from potentially staring down bankruptcy to reporting exceptionally promising early-stage results in an investigator-sponsored study that showed imetelstat led to partial and complete responses in patients with myelofibrosis (a rare type of bone marrow cancer).Â This was notable in that no previous drug had ever demonstrated a clinical response in treating myelofibrosis. There's currently a Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy on the market named Jakafi that treats the symptoms associated with the disease, but it does nothing to slow or halt disease progression. Image source: Getty Images. This promise is what lured in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in late 2014. Johnson & Johnson snagged a licensing partnership with Geron for $35 million in upfront cash and $900 million in possible development, regulatory, and sales milestones for myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic syndrome.Â While there have been concerns from Wall Street in recent months about the trials being narrowed a bit to specific patients pools, we're still talking about a drug that has game-changing potential for myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic syndrome patients. If imetelstat proves its worth in later-stage studies, it's not out of the question that J&J considers scooping up Geron in a buyout. For now, more risk-oriented long-term investors need to wait for more clinical data. A final top stock under $5 that could offer alluring upside over the long run, assuming management gets its act together, is hydrogen fuel cell developer Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG). There are two main reasons why investors have generally shied away from Plug Power and its alternative energy solutions. First, the company just keeps losing money. In fact, it reported a considerably wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter and has missed Wall Street's consensus in 11 of the past 12 quarters. Secondly, the company has regularly issued common stock in order to fund its operations, which is a fairly common practice for money-losing companies. Between 2012 and the end of Q2 2017, Plug Power's outstanding share count has ballooned from 34 million to 206 million.Â Unfortunately, long-term shareholders take it on the chin when that happens since their existing shares are diluted as a result.

Between Q1 2015 and Q2 2017, it's more than doubled the number of cumulative GenDrive deployments (e.g., GenDrive forklift fuel cells) to 16,100, and its vertically integrated GenKey sites, which handle everything from the fuel cell systems to infrastructure and support, have nearly quadrupled to 48 in the same period.Â This expansion can be attributed primarily to its growing relationship with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT)Â and to a smaller, but still very important degree, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Wal-Mart recently signed a deal with Plug Power for 30 new GenKey sites over the next three years, while Amazon and Plug forged a deal in April of this year for multi-site GenKey deployments.Â But, the caveat with these deals is that Wal-Mart and Amazon both received Plug Power warrants, which could further balloon its outstanding share count, as my colleague Travis Hoium pointed out. If management can tighten the reins on dilution and focus on building its relationships with Amazon and Wal-Mart, it could become profitable on a recurring basis as soon as 2019. In fact, Wall Streets' consensus calls for $0.19 in full-year EPS by 2020. If Plug can indeed hit that figure, its $2 share price would be a remarkable bargain. ","

You might thinkÂ The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) would be a boring stock in a boring business. After all, lawn and garden care usually doesn't generate a lot of buzz among investors. However, 2016Â was one of the best times ever to own Scotts Miracle-GroÂ stock. Shares soared nearly 50%. Granted, 2017 has been a yawner for the most part for Scotts stock. Although its share price dropped by more than 10% earlier this summer, Scotts stock is now up slightly year to date. Still, though, the company has attracted a lot more attention recently for one reason: the rapid rise of the U.S. marijuana industry. Scotts Miracle-Gro has become one of the most intriguing ""marijuana stocks"" on the market. Here are three things you need to know about the company. Image source: Getty Images. No, Scotts Miracle-Gro doesn't grow or sell marijuana in any shape, form, or fashion. However, it's frequently referred to as a marijuana stock. Why? Because Scotts has become the go-to supplier of key products needed by marijuana growers. The company marketsÂ fertilizers, hydroponics, and lighting systems that are essential for growing healthy marijuana crops. Scotts Miracle-Gro has been aggressively going after the cannabis market. The company's subsidiary, The Hawthorne Gardening Company, has made several key acquisitions over the last couple of years to build up its hydroponics business. In 2016, Hawthorne boughtÂ American Agritech, L.L.C., an Arizona-based leading producer of plant nutrients, plant supplements, and growing systems used for hydroponic gardening, and Gavita, a Netherlands-basedÂ marketer of indoor lighting used in the greenhouse and hydroponic markets. More recently, the company acquired lighting systems supplier Agrolux. It's been said that back in the gold rush days in California, Alaska, and elsewhere, the people who made the most money weren't the gold miners themselves; instead, it was the ones selling shovels and supplies to those gold miners. That's a good way of looking at Scotts Miracle-Gro today, except now there's a ""green rush"" instead of a gold rush. Scotts Miracle-Gro is enjoying nice growth from Hawthorne's premiere status in the marijuana industry. However, that's not where the company makes most of its money. Scotts is organized into three business segments: U.S. consumer, Europe consumer, and other. The first two segments include the company's consumer lawn and garden products in their respective geographies. Scotts' other segment includes its Hawthorne subsidiary, which sells indoor, urban, and hydroponic gardening products, and consumer lawn and garden products sold outside of the U.S. and Europe. The U.S. consumer segment is by far Scotts' biggest moneymaker, generating 73% of total sales in the second quarter of 2017. The segment with Hawthorne comes in second, accounting for nearly 18% of total revenue. Scotts' Europe consumer segment kicks in the remaining 9% of sales. When it comes to profits, though, the company's U.S. consumer segment is even more important. The segment generates nearly 87% of Scotts Miracle-Gro's total profit. Scotts Miracle-Gro faces several key challenges in the days ahead. The company's products compete with private-label brands offered by big retailers like Wal-Mart. Scotts' sales are highly dependent on weather conditions. The company has also been lagging its peers in cash-flow productivity. Successfully integrating the acquisitions made by Hawthorne is another challenge. The Hawthorne segment currently operates with a lower margin than the rest of Scotts' business. Perhaps the biggest risk for Hawthorne is the possibility that growth in the U.S. marijuana industry could be stifled as a result of federal crackdowns in states that have legalized medical and/or recreational marijuana. However, Scotts Miracle-Gro also has several big opportunities before it. The company has expanded into selling live plants and rodenticides, both of which have higher growth trajectories than its core business. Warmer weather trends could potentially increase growing seasons, which would likely boost sales of Scotts' lawn and garden products. Then there's the great prospects in supplying products for the cannabis market. Scotts thinks it will be able to tie all of the businesses that its bought together under the Hawthorne umbrella to create a much more profitable organization. The potential legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada and possibilities for expanded legalization of marijuana in more U.S. states present significant pathways for sustained growth for Hawthorne. Scotts Miracle-Gro might not meet the purists' definition of marijuana stock. However, there's no doubt that the company has hitched its wagon to the marijuana industry. As the market for marijuana goes, so goes Scotts Miracle-Gro. ","

Consumers will be able to order Wal-Mart goods from the retailerâs stores by speaking to Googleâs virtual assistant, which sits in phones, Googleâs voice-controlled speakers and soon other devices.

Â jumped nearly 30%. Market participants said they were also following reports that Gary Cohn was resigning as economic adviser to President Donald Trump, but the White House has countered those rumors. U.S. equity benchmarks had been facing selling pressure at the start of trade, as European markets ended lower after a three-day winning streak. âIn Europe, we had weakness out of the gate and then we had worries about the Cohn news,â said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading, in an interview. âWith the light volume, Barcelona is not something that the market is going to handle well.â The equity market was also digesting minutes from the Federal Reserveâs July meeting, as well as the dissolution of a pair of Trumpâs business-advisory panels, which underscores the presidentâs challenges in promoting his Wall Street-friendly policies.

                                   is undoubtedly a major influence on the economy, altering how millions of Americans consume. Yet the company is still too small to broadly influence price pressures in a huge U.S. economy buffeted by other domestic and global forces that affect inflation, according to research by Capital Economics. After a run-up earlier in the year, inflation has receded again despite an ultratight labor market and the lowest unemployment rate in 16 years. The Fedâs preferred PCE inflation index slipped to a 1.4% annual rate in June from a five-year high of 2.2% in February. The combination of low unemployment and low inflation has confounded the Fed. Some economists and even a few Fed insiders wonder if the online behemoth is partly responsible for U.S. inflation remaining below the central bankâs 2% inflation target.

                                  Â in June, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans pointed to âdisruptiveâ technologies sweeping across old, previously stable, industries, such as grocers. These forces are reshaping how business is done, increasing competition and putting more downward pressure on prices. âWe know technology is disruptiveâ and that âcould be an undercurrent for holding back inflation,â Evans suggested. Clearly Amazon is an undercurrent for limiting price increases in the retail business, but the industry has been under pressure for a long time, argues U.S. economist Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics.

Even now Wal-Mart is the 800-pound gorilla: The older Arkansas-based chain generates five times as much in U.S. retail sales each year as Amazon. The early 2000s also saw the official entry of China into the global economy, another huge factor in restraining prices that persists to this day. The U.S. buys more than $460 billion in Chinese-made goods each year, many of them so cheaply priced that American firms canât compete. Also Read: U.S. economy is still missing this one critical piece to happier days Setting goods aside, the internet and global economy have played a much smaller role in curbing inflation in critical household services such as health care, insurance, education, real estate and utilities. E-Commerce only accounts for about 4% of service-oriented revenue, Capital Economics estimates. Simply put, âthe shift to online retailing doesnât explain the recent drop back in core inflation,â Ashworth contends. Like Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, Ashworth partly blames the recent shortfall in inflation on the introduction of cheaper unlimited wireless phone plans and a flood of formerly leased autos into the used car market. Another major factor: A sudden and inexplicable drop-off in the cost of medical care, one of the services least affected by the internet. âThis is crucial because medical care now accounts for almost 20% of the Fedâs preferred PCE deflator measure of inflation,â Ashworth said. Amazon has been credited or blamed for a lot of things lately, even by President Trump. Heâs repeatedly accused the Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, of unfair coverage. Others now worry Amazon will trigger a revolution in the grocery business that eliminates many traditional jobs often filled by less educated Americans. Also Read: Sen. Collins says itâs âtoo difficult to sayâ if Trump will be 2020 Republican nominee Yet blaming Amazon for the failure of inflation to rise to the Fedâs 2% target appears to be, well, fake news.

                                  Â now trades above $4,300. These must be among the most heroic forecasts yet for the booming cybercurrency, which has been on fire all year. By these calculations, in five yearsâ time all the btcoins in the world will be valued at around $350 billion, or about what Johnson & Johson is worth today. How does FundStrat produce these numbers? Simple. It sees the number of people using bitcoin rising and the value of the network therefore rising exponentially. This is based on something called Metcalfâs Law, which is says that the value of a network is linked to the square of the number of its users. The argument is not completely stupid. Metcalfâs Law accurately encapsulates the incredible power of networks. The famous example in modern history is possibly the adoption of the QWERTY keyboard. Once everyone used it, it became locked in. You couldnât change it because then everyone would have had to change, and the costs would be enormous. FundStrat says its model of the bitcoin price, based on the number of uses and the size of accounts, explains 94% of the price movement over the past few years. Nonetheless the argument is based on some debatable assumptions: That ultimately there is a strong fundamental case for bitcoin or its equivalents, and therefore one should be a long-term bull. Iâve already expressed my skepticism. You can take it or leave it. But Fundstratâs projection may be a clever piece of marketing. If bitcoin keeps booming, theyâll look smart. If it collapses everyone will forget about it anyway. Henry Blodget made a name for himself during the dot-com bubble by outdoing everyone else in his forecasts. He looked brilliant - for a while. On a more serious note, Fundstratâs prediction is further grist to my belief that we are now in a full-bore cybercurrency mania or bubble, where euphoria rules the day and there may be easy money to be made. Nothing wrong with that. ","This bitcoin $25,000 call is more proof of the cybercurrency bubble - MarketWatch"

                                   closed down 7.08 points, or 0.1%, at 6,271.33. During a CNBC interview a little after 1 p.m. Eastern, Ryan said Republicans are âeye to eyeâ with President Donald Trump regarding policy. The statement comes after the president late Tuesday threatened to close down the federal government if he wasnât able to secure the estimated $1.6 billion in funding from Congress to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico. With stocks experiencing their lightest trading volumes of the year, the market is very easy to influence, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist, at Prudential Financial, in an interview. âRyan wasnât just positive but he provided more details than we have had so far,â Krosby said. âIn a pragmatic manner, he laid out what congress is able to do, and that was helpful. Thatâs something the market has been looking for.â Stocks had their lightest volume day of the year on Wednesday, with about 5 billion shares traded, well below the year-to-date average of 6.54 billion. At the close, 2.76 billion shares had traded on the New York Stock Exchange and 1.52 billion had changed hands on the Nasdaq, both well below the already light average daily volumes for August. The latest economic data also painted a mixed picture of economic conditions. Jobless claims rose by 2,000 in the latest week, a smaller increase than expected. Separately, a read on new-home sales came in at 571,000, below the 608,000 that had been expected, while mortgage rates fell to their lowest level of the year. The meeting of central bankers is likely to be the primary driver of trading, even though such key speakers as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen wonât appear until Friday. âYou canât underestimate the importance of Jackson Hole, and this year is especially interesting,â said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners. âYellenâs commentary will be closely watched, because investors want to know both if the Fed will be raising rates, and also the timing and the magnitude of the Fed unwinding its portfolio.â For the week, the Dow is on pace to gain 0.5%, the S&P 500 is set to add 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite is on track to rise 0.9%, a move that would end a four-week string of declines for the technology-heavy index. Words from Wyoming: The program for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bankâs symposium, titled âFostering a Dynamic Global Economy,â is set for release at 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The meeting runs through Saturday. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.
