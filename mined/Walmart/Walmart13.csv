Retail giant Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has long enjoyed a significant competitive advantage thanks to its massive scale. Wal-Mart is able to get the best prices from its suppliers and pass those savings onto its customers, making it next to impossible for traditional retailers to compete on price. But the continued rise of e-commerce has changed the equation, putting Wal-Mart in a position where it's playing catch-up with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Wal-Mart has gotten far more serious about e-commerce in recent years, acquiring Jet.com in 2016 for $3.3 billion, rolling out an online grocery pick-up and delivery service, and just recently launching free two-day shipping in an effort to undercut Amazon Prime. But it remains well behind the e-commerce leader. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart's U.S. store business is still performing well, producing a long streak of positive comparable-sales growth thanks in part to initiatives like higher wages and better training for employees. But that business will no doubt begin to feel pressure as online sales grow as a percentage of total retail sales. Profits have taken a dive as Wal-Mart invests in e-commerce and in-store initiatives, and an earnings recovery will require these investments to pay off in the long run. With the retail business changing rapidly, is Wal-Mart stock a safe bet? And what about the dividend? With slumping profits, is the quarterly payout at risk? Wal-Mart has not historically been a great dividend stock, in part because the stock price was soaring right along with the dividend prior to 2000. The yield was consistently below 1% until the mid-2000s, when the stock price began to stagnate. The yield has steadily risen since then, currently sitting right around 3%. WMT Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts. Wal-Mart is a Dividend Aristocrat, meaning that it has raised its dividend annually for at least 25 years. In Wal-Mart's case, the dividend has been increased annually since the very first payment in 1974. This long track record doesn't guarantee that the dividend will continue to increase going forward, but it shows that the company has been disciplined over the years in regards to capital allocation. Wal-Mart's current quarterly dividend is $0.50 per share, with a total annual payout of $2 per share. Based on its adjusted earnings guidance for fiscal 2017, results for which the company will report on Feb. 21, the payout ratio is currently around 47%. This gives Wal-Mart some breathing room, even though earnings will be down compared to previous years. Wal-Mart's dividend growth will likely be slow as the company diverts its resources to building out its e-commerce business. But I suspect that it will remain a dividend aristocrat for the foreseeable future. The risk of future profit declines is certainly higher today than it was before the company needed to care very much about e-commerce. Not only is there the threat of declining in-store sales as consumers shift online, but Wal-Mart is competing in e-commerce against a company that has been operating with razor-thin margins, and sometimes no margins at all, since its founding. Amazon generates lower margins than Wal-Mart, but Amazon also spends prodigiously on everything from content for its streaming service to a $1.5 billion air hub to help shuttle around merchandise. Wal-Mart will almost certainly be more focused and disciplined with its e-commerce investments, which should help keep the bottom line intact. The worst-case scenario for Wal-Mart would be a failure to grow e-commerce sales rapidly despite its major investments coupled with declining in-store sales. That scenario would almost certainly lead to earnings stagnation or decline, eventually putting the dividend at risk. The best-case scenario, strong e-commerce sales growth and solid store performance, would eventually lead to earnings growth. Wal-Mart stock trades for around 16 times the company's guidance for full-year adjusted earnings. That's not bargain territory, but it does represent a discount to the overall market. Any company going through a major transition is inherently risky, but it looks like the steps Wal-Mart is taking are the right ones. Wal-Mart stock comes with risks, but not nearly as many as most other retailers. ","

Adam Levy,02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's no secret that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a dominant force in online retail. But it's still astounding just how dominant it's been in recent years. New data from Slice Intelligence shows that Amazon took 53% of all of the sales growth of online retailers in the U.S. last year. Amazon's North American sales increased 25.2% in 2016. Meanwhile, the U.S. Census Bureau has been tracking e-commerce sales growth at around 15.5% through the first three quarters of the year. Put another way, despite its size, Amazon continues to take share of the growing e-commerce market, and competitors such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are struggling to keep up. Image source: Getty Images. While the U.S. Census Bureau hasn't released its estimates for the fourth quarter of 2016 yet, extrapolating out the steady growth rate of the first three quarters results in $53 billion in online sales for 2016. In addition, the majority of retail growth in the United States comes from e-commerce. In 2015, 62% of total growth came from online sales. Slice's numbers may be a bit off, considering Amazon saw an increase of ""just"" $16 billion in sales across all of North America. Still, the company is undoubtedly taking market share as its sales growth outpaces the overall industry. With e-commerce accounting for such a significant share of retail growth in the United States, Amazon's biggest competitors, like Wal-Mart, are really feeling the hurt. While Amazon's North American sales increased 25.2% last year, Wal-Mart's overall U.S. sales increased just 3.3% through the first three quarters of the year. Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales fared a bit better, increasing 7%, 11.8%, and 20.6% in the first, second, and third quarters, respectively. The third quarter was boosted by the acquisition of Jet.com. Overall, Wal-Mart's organic e-commerce sales still appear to lag the industry. Even if you're skeptical of Slice's claim that Amazon took 53% of online sales growth last year, it's clear that Amazon accounts for a huge share of the retail growth in the United States. Not just e-commerce growth, but overall retail sales. Slice had a few thoughts to share on why Amazon has been able to stay ahead of the competition: Undoubtedly, however, the biggest factor fueling Amazon's continued dominance of retail in the United States is its Prime program. Prime makes customers extremely loyal. It's what fuels 55% of online shoppers to check Amazon.com first (and maybe last). And it causes shoppers to spend more on Amazon than their non-Prime counterparts. Last year, Amazon added ""tens of millions"" of new Prime members, according to its fourth-quarter earnings release. Unlike the previous two years, when Amazon experienced around 50% annual growth in membership, the company didn't provide a growth rate. That may be because Prime membership is nearing saturation in markets such as the United States. Estimates show more than half of U.S. households are already Prime members. Still, with a growing majority of households subscribed to Prime (even if that growth is slowing) and going to Amazon as their first online shopping destination, it looks as if Amazon will continue to take share of the U.S. retail market for the foreseeable future.

Rich Duprey,02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently said some 4 million locations, or about 35% of all retail stores in the U.S., accept its Apple Pay mobile payment option. Although there are some notable exceptions among the largest retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Target, who don't offer it, others like Gap do, or soon will feature the payment solution. Because it's available on mobile phones, tablets, and even the Apple Watch, its ubiquity and relative ease of use make it the go-to choice for consumers on the go as well as those dissatisfied with the hassle and delays of embedded chip cards. According to data analytics firm TXN Solutions, which surveyed the transactions from over 3 million payment cards, Apple Pay usage has soared by 50% over the past year. Image source: Apple. Indeed, during Apple's first-quarter earnings conference call with analysts last month, CEO Tim Cook said transaction volume had risen sixfold from the prior year as Apple Pay expanded into four new countries, including Japan, Russia, New Zealand, and Spain. While that would seem to clash somewhat with TXN's more muted (though still significant) rise, it comes down to a difference in what's being measured. While Apple isn't particularly forthcoming on details of the Apple Pay ecosystem, it is talking about the actual number of transactions made, while the data analytics firm is referencing the percentage of transactions from its panel of consumers who provide their credit and debit card data and whose banks distinguish Apple Pay transactions. While that naturally limits the universe of transactions captured, over time it still tracks the acceptance of the mobile payment option and its growth, and what it found was that most people were using it in mobile apps and on websites. That surprising conclusion was reached after finding that of all the places Apple Pay users were using the payment option, getting a cheap hotel room at the last minute topped the list. Ordering takeout was apparently the second favorite way to use the service. Image source: HotelTonight. The TXN data, which examined payments made between December 2015 and December 2016, found mobile travel app HotelTonight, a last-minute reservation service, had 3.4% of all its credit cards transactions made with Apple Pay, followed by food delivery services Caviar, Postmates, and DoorDash, which all had around 2.5% usage rates or slightly higher. What is more notable about the survey results is that despite the broad proliferation of places accepting Apple Pay as an option, it really hasn't caught on among brick-and-mortar retailers, where most places saw it represent less than 1% of all credit card transactions. And ultimately, regardless of where it is used, it isn't creating much of a stir in the payments industry, as it represents just a small percentage of total credit card transactions. At the bottom of the list is Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which came in last on a list of the 13 top places processing Apple Pay transactions, accounting for about 0.5% of the coffee shop's total credit card transactions. Considering Starbucks has its own highly regarded mobile ordering and payment option, which is often looked at as the gold standard for convenience and ease of use, it raises eyebrows that people are using Apple Pay there at all. On its first-quarter earnings conference call with analysts two weeks ago, Starbucks President Kevin Johnson said, ""Mobile Order & Pay had a banner quarter, representing more than 7% of total transactions, double the figure from Q1 last year, and we now have nearly 1,200 stores with 20% or more Mobile Order & Pay transactions at peak, compared to only 13 stores one year ago."" When you have customer loyalty like that, who needs Apple Pay? Image source: Starbucks. Food retailers still represent the lion's share of places seeing Apple Pay usage, and Lowes Foods, Sprouts Farmers Markets, Panera Bread, and Schnucks round out the bottom five places for users of the mobile wallet, with around 0.6% of their credit card transactions accounted for using the payment method. So, if Starbucks and trendy grocery stores were bringing up the rear, who was it that was leading the brick-and-mortar pack? Would you believe Duane Reade, the New York metropolitan area drugstore chain owned by Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA)? According to the TXN data, the pharmacy operator was the top spot where people used Apple Pay, with 1.8% of the credit card transactions identifying the mobile payment option being chosen. That put it slightly ahead of No. 2 retailer Whole Foods Market (Nasdaq: WFM), which had about 1.7% of its credit card transactions using Apple Pay. Because both retailers have been with the service since Apple launched Apple Pay in 2014, it might not be so surprising they were well ahead of the others, including Canteen Vending at No. 3 with slightly less than 1% of its transactions, and fourth place Peet's Coffee with just under 0.8%. Whether that means Apple Pay will ever supplant EMV cards as a preferred payment option remains to be seen, but it seems hard to believe it will replace Starbucks' mobile order and pay app anytime soon. And though Apple Pay users seem to be a rare breed indeed, maybe all you need to see them in action is to simply stop by your local pharmacy.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Target (NYSE:TGT) shares dropped about 11% last month, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Data by YCharts. The slump contributed to a double-digit gap between the retailer and the broader market so far this year. Yet many of its peers, including Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), are underperforming the S&P 500 as well. Target's January swoon came after the company announced surprisingly weak results for the key holiday shopping period. Comparable-store sales fell 3%, thanks to a nearly 2% drop in customer traffic. That slump was just partially offset by big gains in the online sales channel. The good news is that Target gained market share in e-commerce -- the bad news is it had to trade profitability. ""The costs associated with the accelerated mix shift between our stores and digital channels and a highly promotional competitive environment had a negative impact on our fourth quarter margins and earnings per share,"" CEO Brian Cornell said in a press release. Image source: Target. Wal-Mart hasn't announced its holiday figures yet, but the retailing titan has also warned investors to brace for lower profit growth ahead as it plows investments into competing online while protecting its traditional retailing locations. It enjoyed its seventh straight quarter of customer traffic growth last quarter, and investors will find out in late February if that streak extended into the holiday season. Fourth-quarter sales growth is expected to be slightly negative when Target announces its detailed earnings report on Feb. 28, down from the flat result Cornell and his team had originally projected. Lower profit margins, meanwhile, will ensure that earnings rise to just $5.05 per share for the full 2016 fiscal year. While that would mark a record high for the retailer, it's below the $5.20 per share that executives first forecast, so Wall Street needed to pull down their expectations. Over the longer term, Target's results will depend on management striking the right balance between pressing its core retailing advantages and making smart investments aimed at meeting customers' changing shopping preferences.

Reuben Gregg Brewer,02162017,Fool,02092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (NYSE:HP) has an impressive dividend record, particularly when you take into consideration that it operates in the highly cyclical oil and gas services industry. The problem for investors, though, is that a dividend decision a few years ago obscures the income story here. This is one stock where the trend isn't what it seems, and a little more analysis is needed to understand Helmerich & Payne's true dividend potential. Helmerich & Payne has increased its dividend each and every year for 44 consecutive years. That's nothing short of impressive, putting it up there with companies like Consolidated Edison, Kimberly-Clark Corp, and Wal-Mart. That's rarified air for sure, and it shows a deep commitment to returning value to shareholders. Add in the current yield of roughly 4%, and income investors are sure to be interested. Image source: Helmerich & Payne, Inc. But you can't just stop there. You have to look deeper. For example, Helmerich & Payne's dividend streak looks even more impressive when you consider that it operates in the highly cyclical oil and gas drilling services business. To give you an idea of just how volatile that business is, at the end of fiscal 2016, only 25% of the company's drill rigs were being used by customers. At the end of fiscal 2014, just as oil prices were getting set to tumble, that number was nearly 90%. You have to ask yourself how a company with such variability in demand can keep upping the dividend year-in and year-out? The answer is that it doesn't. Helmerich & Payne has historically increased dividends in the middle of a calendar year, which means it can hold the dividend steady for up to 10 quarters and still maintain its annual streak based on nothing more than timing. In fact, it did just that for eight quarters, when oil prices were tumbling in mid-2014. It only started upping the disbursement again in August of 2016. That doesn't mean you shouldn't own Helmerich & Payne stock; it just means you have to take the dividend history with a grain of salt. Some other reasons it was able to protect the dividend are a conservative culture that favors a low debt load (long-term debt is just 10% of the capital structure) and impressive cash flow. Cash flow, the lifeblood of a company, is worth a deeper look. HP Capital Expenditures (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Helmerich & Payne builds expensive drill rigs. It then depreciates those costs over the useful lives of the rigs, a non-cash charge that hits earnings. When demand for rigs is high, the expense of building new rigs offsets the depreciation add back on the cash flow statement. In a downturn, though, the company stops building rigs, and the depreciation add back flows right into the company's bank account -- leaving it with plenty of cash to keep paying the dividend. So, Helmerich & Payne's dividend streak isn't as clean as it looks, but it is built on a solid foundation. The stock really is worth a closer look for income-focused investors. That said, there's one other metric that needs to be considered, here. Over the past three years, Helmerich & Payne's annualized dividend growth rate is 28%. Over the past five years it's 60%. And over the past decade, the dividend grew at an annualized rate of 32%. If that doesn't knock your dividend socks off, nothing will! HP Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YCharts. But somehow, those numbers don't make much sense, particularly when you consider that the dividend was static for eight quarters in a row between 2014 and 2016. Here's what's going on: In calendar year 2012, the company more than doubled the quarterly dividend from $0.07 a share to $0.15. And then in 2013, it increased it again, this time going from $0.15 a share per quarter to a $0.50. Those were huge increases that are unlikely to be repeated. Prior to that span, the dividend was usually increased just a few pennies a year. And since 2014, the dividend has basically been increased just a few pennies a year. So, the trailing dividend data has to be taken with a grain of salt, too. In fact, the increase over the trailing year was less than 1%. And that low single-digit number is far closer to what you should expect over time than 30% or more. None of this is meant to suggest that Helmerich & Payne is a bad company. When it comes to oil and gas drilling services, it's a top-notch name. And despite the oddities, the 44-year dividend streak is truly impressive for a company in such a cyclical industry. However, as a dividend investor, you need to dig a little deeper, here, to figure out what you are buying. On that score, the future likely holds a continuation of the annual streak based on small dividend increases that may or may not happen on an annual basis. That sounds worse than it really is, but it's the truth you need to understand if you are digging into Helmerich & Payne. ","

                                  is going to make a major move into the bricks-and-mortar supermarket space, convenience and time savings are where it has to differentiate itself. But there are questions about whether its apparently favored format, which includes many robots and few human workers, will satisfy grocery shoppers. “It seems really hard to imagine a day where the retail experience becomes a bunch of robots,” said James Lamberti, chief marketing officer of Quri, a retail intelligence and analytics company. “Robotics and tech will be behind the scenes, with more people servicing out front.” Lamberti thinks there are different reasons, or “occasions,” when people go to a grocery retailer, he said, whether it’s the quick in-and-out of grabbing lunch, or the meandering trip where shoppers wander the aisles. Changing those shopping behaviors will be difficult, but Morgan Stanley, in a note published Tuesday, noted that Amazon has done it before. Read also: Supermarkets’ best weapon against e-tailers: produce See also: Amazon takes on tech’s white whale: grocery shopping “In our view, behavior modification is Amazon’s core business model — bringing consumers to the site, converting them to Prime and (through leading selection, clean interface, powerful suggestion engine, and low-friction shopping/checkout) driving them to spend more across categories,” wrote the Morgan Stanley analysts. Those analysts estimate that the grocery business is a $770 billion segment of annual U.S. consumer expenditures. The next frontier for advancement in the grocery-store space is saving time in the shopping process, experts say. “A lot of the focus on saving time is in the kitchen,” said Darren Seifer, NPD Group’s food and beverage analyst, referring to factors like cook time. “Now there’s a shift going on because more consumers are using fresh food, which requires a little more prep. The notion of saving the consumer time while getting their groceries is how they have to think. There’s no one specific way to do it.” Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

                                  has talked up its curbside grocery pickup service as an option for busy families looking for a way to save time on what otherwise might be an hours-long supermarket trip. According to the New York Post, Amazon is looking into a 10,000-plus-square-foot automated grocery store. Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has taken to Twitter to rebut that report. .@nypost, whoever your anonymous sources are on this story https://t.co/VFyzGQcOAZ – they’ve mixed up their meds! And on the NYPost article, if anybody knows how to get 20% margins in groceries, call me! :) Even if Amazon isn’t planning stores like this right now, the existence of the Amazon Fresh offering and the Amazon Go convenience store show that the company has an interest in getting deeper into groceries. “While Amazon’s business has momentum — making up [about 5%] of its total addressable U.S. consumer expenditure market, driving [approximately] 50% of U.S. expenditure growth — grocery remains one of the greener fields, with only [about] 2% estimated online industry penetration,” Morgan Stanley wrote. “At some point over the next few years, Amazon may need grocery to maintain its same-store sales and strong overall gross merchandise value growth.” In the longer term, a study from the Food Marketing Institute and Nielsen found that online grocery spending could capture 20% of all grocery shopping by 2025, totaling about $100 billion in sales annually. “Traditional bricks-and-mortar stores have to think now about how they can get creative with tech-savvy consumers,” said Seifer. As Rupesh Pareskh, senior analyst for food, grocery and consumer products at Oppenheimer & Co., said he sees it, the equation for being a threat to Wal-Mart, Kroger Co.

                                  and any of the other players in the industry is good experience plus lower prices. “Grocery has razor-thin margins,” he said. “If they can do something to take the cost out of the grocery store, that could be viewed as a negative for other stores.” See also: Amazon is not the only online retailer developing a store for the future Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the per-store build cost for an Amazon bricks-and-mortar location is in the range of $6 million to $10 million. For now, online grocery would be the next step in digitizing grocery shopping, and consumers have not been quick to adopt it. The latest survey data from Morgan Stanley shows that the top reason people don’t shop online is they like to select fresh produce for themselves. Where Quri’s Lamberti sees e-commerce already cutting into the grocery business are for items that are commoditized and have long shelf lives, like cleaning products and paper goods. “It’s hard not to see Amazon cutting into that in a major way, but there are lots of occasions that aren’t about robots,” he said. Even if change is slow, it’s happening, and grocers have to be ready. The NPD Group says 52 million U.S. consumers are currently grocery shopping online, with 20 million planning to increase their online grocery-shopping activity in the next six months. Younger generations, like millennials, are among those favoring the online option. Amazon shares closed Wednesday up nearly 1% and are up 68% for the past year.

,02232017,Reuters,02162017,"Investors shrugged off an 8 percent drop in gross profit margins stemming from Wal-Mart’s continued efforts to cut prices to make them more competitive, along with discounts offered after the holiday season. “A number of things helped Wal-Mart over the holiday quarter,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Global Data. “Foremost among these was the strategic decision to invest in price and to heavily promote this fact to consumers.” Wal-Mart said it expected earnings per share of 90 cents to $1 for the current quarter and $4.20 to $4.40 for this fiscal year. Analysts' estimates were within both ranges. A delay in refund checks from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has curbed customer spending somewhat, Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said on a conference call with reporters. However, he still expects U.S comparable sales - those at stores open at least a year and through e-commerce - to rise 1 percent to 1.5 percent this quarter. The company said U.S. comparable sales rose 1.8 percent, excluding fuel price fluctuations, during the fourth quarter ended on Jan. 31. Analysts on average were expecting a 1.3 percent increase, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Biggs said comparable sales were up at all retail formats due to a steady improvement in stores, strong growth from e-commerce and a growing contribution from the online grocery business. “We’ve now seen nine consecutive quarters of traffic growth in our stores,” Biggs said. “Clearly, we’re gaining traction.” U.S. store visits rose 1.4 percent, compared with a year-earlier increase of 0.7 percent. Despite lower food prices, Biggs said comparable sales rose in Wal-Mart’s grocery business, which accounts for nearly 53 percent of overall revenue. Net income attributable to Wal-Mart fell to $3.76 billion in the fourth quarter from $4.57 billion a year earlier, reflecting the impact from discontinued real estate projects and severance. Excluding items, earnings per share of $1.30 exceeded the analysts’ average estimate of $1.29, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 1 percent to $130.9 billion, with the depreciation of the Mexican peso to the U.S. dollar curbing growth. Excluding currency fluctuations, sales came to $133.6 billion. E-COMMERCE ACCELERATES Online sales increased 29 percent, compared with a third-quarter rise of 20.6 percent. That business added 0.8 percentage points to the fourth-quarter comparable sales gain. Lore said Wal-Mart had a “nice uptick” in online sales after it recently made two-day shipping free in the United States. The retailer will keep looking for acquisitions “wherever it makes sense,” he added. Wal-Mart recently acquired online outdoor clothing and gear retailer Moosejaw for $51 million in cash, its third purchase in about six months.

Asda, based in Leeds, northern England, said sales at stores open over a year fell 2.9 percent, excluding fuel, in the three months to Dec. 31, its fiscal fourth quarter. While that represented a 10th straight quarter of falling sales, the outcome was in line with analysts’ expectations and was a significant improvement on declines of 5.8 percent and 7.5 percent in the previous two quarters respectively. Monthly industry data has also indicated that Asda’s trading continued to improve through January. Clark was brought in after Wal-Mart announced that Asda would shift the balance of its trading strategy from protecting profit to protecting market share. Wal-Mart’s Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs welcomed Asda’s encouraging data but cautioned: “We have a lot of work to do in this market.” Asda is Britain’s third largest grocery retailer but has lost over 1 percentage point of UK market share since 2014, according to researcher Kantar Worldpanel. Its share currently stands at 15.6 percent, versus more than 28 percent for Tesco. Shares in Tesco were down 1.2 percent at 1432 GMT, while Morrisons was down 1.3 percent, with Sainsbury’s down 0.9 percent. Asda has previously said it will cut prices equating to 1.5 billion pounds of savings to the customer over five years from November 2013, washing through at about 300 million pounds a year. Separately on Tuesday, Wal-Mart reported higher-than-expected U.S. comparable sales for the fourth quarter, driven by higher customer traffic to stores and accelerating online activity. ","

,02232017,Reuters,02162017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday spoke positively about a border adjustment tax being pushed by Republicans in Congress as a way to boost exports, but he did not specifically endorse the proposal. Trump, who has lashed out at U.S. companies for moving operations and jobs to countries such as Mexico, had previously sent mixed signals on the proposal at the heart of a sweeping Republican plan to overhaul the tax code. “It could lead to a lot more jobs in the United States,” Trump told Reuters in an interview, using his most approving language to date on the proposal. Trump sent conflicting signals about his position on the border adjustment tax in separate media interviews in January, saying in one interview that it was “too complicated” and in another that it was still on the table. The proposal has divided American businesses. Critics say the planned 20 percent tax on imports could be passed along in higher prices to consumers, including manufacturers that rely on imported goods to make their products. Some critics have warned of a potential global trade war which would sharply curtail U.S. and world economic growth. Advocates say U.S. exporters will gain as their revenues will be excluded from federal taxes. They say the tax on imports will encourage domestic production and cause the already strong dollar to rise, offsetting upward pressure on import prices. Trump has also called for a 35-percent border tax on U.S. companies that move jobs abroad and import products back into the U.S. market. It has been unclear in the past if those references referred to the border adjustment proposal. “I certainly support a form of tax on the border,” he told Reuters on Thursday. “What is going to happen is companies are going to come back here, they’re going to build their factories and they’re going to create a lot of jobs and there’s no tax.” White House spokesman Sean Spicer also came to the defense of border adjustment on Thursday, disputing the claim that it could lead to higher consumer prices. “That benefits our economy, it helps American workers, it grows the manufacturing base,” Spicer told reporters at a White House briefing. The Mexican peso MXN= weakened slightly against the U.S. dollar immediately after Trump's comments and was last trading at 19.68 per dollar. Earlier on Thursday, the Mexican currency hit its strongest level since Trump's Nov. 8 election victory. Earlier on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC the Trump administration aimed to formulate a tax plan with support from the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Senate and pass it before August. Lawmakers and corporate lobbyists say the border adjustment tax could die in Congress, potentially jeopardizing the prospects for tax reform, mainly because of opposition from a handful of Senate Republicans. But experts say Trump’s endorsement could change the political climate. “If Trump supports it, that makes it considerably more likely,” Harvard Business School professor Mihir Desai told Reuters. Trump’s comments were followed by dueling statements from lobbying groups. A statement from the pro-border adjustment American Made Coalition said the White House was “sending its strongest signals yet that it’s leaning toward supporting the House blueprint with border adjustability.” The Americans for Affordable Products coalition that opposes the border adjustment tax issued a statement saying Trump’s remarks were “consistent with what he’s already said” and that it was “impossible” to know if they were specific to any individual legislative policy. Trump spoke to Reuters after meeting with more than 20 chief executives of major U.S. companies to discuss ways to return manufacturing jobs to the United States, one of the linchpins of his 2016 presidential campaign. A border adjustment has emerged as the most controversial segment of the House Republican tax reform blueprint. Under the House plan, it would raise more than $1 trillion in revenues to help pay for a corporate tax cut. ","

(WMT) is claiming more of online retail market share, and if Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN​) latest price-dropping move is any indication, the e-commerce giant feels threatened. Walmart’s fourth quarter results show a 29% rise in e-commerce sales thanks to its $3-billion purchase of Jet.com in September. U.S. comparable sales increased 1.8 percent, driven by increased traffic. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $130.9 billion. (See also, Retail Empires Strike Back with Omnichannel Strategies) In head-to-head competition, Amazon and Walmart each have distinct advantages. While Walmart is gaining ground in e-commerce, Amazon still dominates this arena with $136 billion in online sales in 2016. Walmart, however, boasts higher revenue all around with its massive network of retail locations. Walmart’s overall revenue for fiscal 2017 was $485.9 billion, nearly four times Amazon’s. To pit itself as a solid e-commerce contender against Amazon, Walmart recently launched a free two-day shipping offer on orders over $35. For its part, Amazon quietly struck back by lowering its minimum purchase requirement for free shipping to $35 from $49 for customers who are not Prime members. The price change occurred during President’s Day weekend with no announcement, and matches Walmart’s own minimum for free shipping. (See also, Amazon Filing Reveals Prime Numbers for First Time) ""This is one of the first times we’ve seen a real reactionary response by Amazon,” Sarah Engel, senior vice president of DynamicAction, a retail analytics firm, told MarketWatch. ""Amazon did this without fanfare, and when they have a change that impacts the customer positively, they are very vocal about it."" On Feb. 2, Amazon reported fourth quarter sales increased 22 percent to $43.7 billion from the same quarter a year prior. Amazon said it will create more than 100,000 new full-time jobs over the next 18 months. AMZN is up 60 percent over the past year, and up 14.1 percent year-to-date.

Craig Adeyanju,02232017,Investopedia,02162017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs There was a time when Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charles Munger said not investing early enough in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) was one of the mistakes of the conglomerate’s first 50 years with Warren Buffett in charge. Well, it seems Mr. Buffett doesn’t believe in the retail giant any more. (See also, Wal-Mart to Consolidate Buying Operations.) Berkshire Hathaway’s recent Form 13F filing revealed the firm cut its stake in WMT to 1,393,513 shares. That’s roughly 89.3% lower than the 12,971,574 shares the firm reported in its previous Form 13F filing. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter Buffett has cut his WMT holdings, and the fifth time in the last six quarters. Berkshire had over 60 million shares of WMT in 2014. In a 2015 annual meeting with shareholders, Bloomberg quoted Buffett as saying, “It is a big, big force and it has already disrupted plenty of people and it will disrupt more.” He was referring to how the Amazon-led e-commerce industry is disrupting the traditional retail business. He went on to admit that many competitors (of Amazon, surely) “including us in a few areas, have not figured the way to either participate in it, or to counter it.” Buffett also once said that it’s very difficult to turn around a retailer that has been struggling for a long time. He was talking about Sears and K-mart. In reality, both companies witnessed anything but a turnaround afterwards. Going by that logic, Buffett believes that e-commerce is the future of retail and that since WMT has allowed Amazon to take such huge lead for a long time, WMT will forever be playing catch-up in the e-commerce space. Reuters recently reported that WMT is consolidating buying e-commerce-type operations, a move that will make all the items in every Wal-Mart store become available for sale online. This move places priority on e-commerce, considering that one of Wal-Mart’s suppliers told Reuters that, “It is hard to make their online buyers a priority. I would get to them when I had a chance.” That’s because store orders have been significantly more important. This move stands to improve WMT’s e-commerce position. Moreover, WMT is making in-store shopping more interesting and seamless with its Scan and Go technology, which allows shoppers to scan items with their phones as they shop. They then make payments with their phones as they walk out. A store with the technology is opening in Tomball, Texas today. This initiative goes further to tear down the wall between in-store and online shopping. Maybe Buffett sees this, but simply thinks his funds can perform better elsewhere.

(WMT) matched EPS estimates, while revenues came up short in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Tuesday morning, triggering a buy-the-news reaction that’s unlikely to repeal broad weakness that’s guided price action since last summer.  Inline guidance may be responsible for the uptick, easing investor anxiety about headwinds that are likely to grow in coming months. The Arkansas retail giant has lost considerable ground since hitting an all-time high above $90 in January 2015, caught in the historic exodus out of brick and mortar retail sales into e-commerce. They’ve responded with a strong web presence that’s booked encouraging growth in recent quarters, underpinned by the Jet.com acquisition. But so far at least, those efforts have failed to take significant market share from juggernaut Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). Also, they now face a major obstacle due to the Trump’s administration pursuit of cross-border taxes that will significantly drive up costs and lower margins. Cheap foreign goods have underpinned company profits for decades while forcing numerous competitors to drop out, generating a near-domination of their unique blue collar demographics. As a result, codifying those tariffs could drive the stock price much lower. WMT Long-Term Chart (1993–2017) Wal-Mart rallied above the 1987 peak at $5.36 (post two stock splits) in 1990 and set off on a powerful uptrend that continued into the 1993 high at $17.00. A three-year correction got bought just below $10, triggering a renewed advance that continued into the December 1999 top at $70.25, which marked the highest high for the next 12-years. It turned sharply lower through the Dot-com bear market, grinding out a broad basing pattern with support in the low-40s. It underperformed badly through the mid-decade bull market, stuck in a trading range between the 1999 high and 2000 low. Multiple tests at range support denied short sellers between 2005 and 2007, setting the stage for a 2008 countertrend rally that failed to reach range resistance. Multi-year barriers finally gave way in 2012, yielding a choppy uptrend that failed to generate momentum until a late 2014 surge lifted into the January 2015 all-time high at $90.97. Aggressive sellers then took control in a major decline that triggered a failed breakout when it cut through the 1999 high in August 2015. The descent continued into the November 2015 low at $56.30, giving way to an oversold bounce that stalled during the summer of 2016 at the 50% selloff retracement, right after price nosed above resistance in the lower-70s. A slow motion pullback since that time held in the mid-60s, ahead of this week’s renewed buying interest. WMT Short-Term Chart (2014-2017) The decline through 2015 incurred heavy technical damage, intensified in August when the bottom dropped out in a series of vertical selling waves. The recovery wave into 2017 has eased the bearish outlook, but it’s hard to recommend buying the stock after the summer reversal at resistance first put into place more than 17-years ago (blue line). That will change if the current buying effort lifts above the August 2016 high at $75.19. On Balance Volume topped out in 2012, more than 2-and-a-half years ahead of the 2015 price peak, and tested that level between 2013 and early 2015. It then entered a ferocious liquidation wave that continued into October 2015, bottoming out a month ahead of price. A renewed accumulation wave reversed near the indicator midpoint in the fourth quarter of 2016 and drifted lower into 2017, pointing to chronic apathy while major benchmarks post all-time highs. Wal-Mart is trading above $71 on Tuesday morning after easing shareholder nerves with a mildly positive report that failed to post quarterly revenue growth. While the results could generate additional buying interest in coming weeks, the stock faces a buzz saw of resistance in the mid-70s, telling sidelined players to keep their powder dry while waiting for more strong buy or sell signals. <Disclosure: the author held no positions in the stocks mentioned above at the time of publication.> ","Pass On Wal-Mart After Earnings (WMT, AMZN) | Investopedia"
Krystina Gustafson,02232017,CNBC,02162017,"Wal-Mart's U.S. business accelerated during its fiscal fourth quarter, helping the world's largest retailer top Wall Street's earnings expectations and record its largest domestic same-store sales increase since July 2012. Still, even as the company reported its 10th straight quarter of comparable sales growth, revenue fell short of expectations as foreign exchange rates and food deflation weighed on its top line. Wal-Mart's shares shook off that miss and moved 2 percent higher in premarket trading. Here's how Wal-Mart did: ""We've been waiting a long time for Wal-Mart to show these kinds of numbers. We like what we're seeing here. They're doing all the right things,"" Jan Kniffen, CEO of J.Kniffen Worldwide Enterprises, told CNBC. Wal-Mart has been investing heavily in both its stores and e-commerce operations, which have weighed on its profitability. Last year, Wal-Mart earned $1.49 per share. But those investments have paid off for its U.S. business, which recorded its ninth straight increase in quarterly traffic. The retailer's total sales also edged 1 percent higher from $129.67 billion a year ago. Apparel, health and wellness, and grocery were some of the top-performing categories at the company's U.S. stores, despite a slow start to the quarter for cold-weather merchandise. Electronics, media and gaming were soft. Wal-Mart's online sales also accelerated, boosted by its acquisition of Jet.com and the continued rollout of its online grocery service. U.S. digital sales rose 29 percent during the quarter. The company will no longer report an overarching global figure for its e-commerce growth in order to focus on the U.S. market. Its domestic online performance has been outpacing its results overseas. ""We continue to invest in e-commerce to accelerate growth,"" CEO Doug McMillon said in prepared remarks. ""We're gaining traction and moving faster."" In a bid to better compete against Amazon, Wal-Mart has snapped up three online retailers over the past five months for a combined $3.12 billion. The largest of those acquisitions was its $3 billion purchase of Jet.com, which brought Jet Chief Marc Lore on board and led to a reshuffling of Wal-Mart's digital business. Last month, Wal-Mart scrapped a subscription program it was testing, which offered free two-day shipping for $49 a year. Now, it will offer free shipping on more than 2 million items for no fee when shoppers spend at least $35. That's down from its previous $50 threshold. Wal-Mart CFO Brett Biggs said the company's digital sales have improved since it implemented this change. ""They're competing with a really, really tough business in Amazon. So we kept waiting to see, could it really happen. It looks to me like it's happening,"" Kniffen said. ""And of course, they've got strong cash flow. They can buy back stock. I mean, they're this really big, healthy company."" The company's gross margin decreased slightly, as part of its efforts to ensure it has the lowest prices. Markdowns after the holidays also weighed on Wal-Mart's gross margin. Comparable sales at 10 of Wal-Mart's 11 international markets increased, though exchange rates pressured its top line. Net sales in its international division grew 3 percent excluding currency fluctuations but declined 5.1 percent when including their impact. The U.K. continued to be Wal-Mart's weakest market, as it struggles to combat low-price competitors like Aldi. Comparable sales at Sam's Club rose 2.4 percent excluding fuel. For fiscal 2018, Wal-Mart expects to earn between $4.20 a share and $4.40 a share, compared with an estimate of $4.33. That includes profit of 90 cents per share to $1 per share in the first quarter. Sales have started the year slower than expected, due in part to a delay in tax refunds, Biggs said. Wal-Mart said at its October investor day that it would significantly slow its pace of store openings in the fiscal year that just began. Instead, it will focus its capital expenditures on e-commerce, the company said at the time. Wal-Mart has meanwhile been investing in its employees by raising their minimum pay and providing better training. ",Wal-Mart earnings: $1.30 EPS vs vs $1.29 estimate
Rachel Cao,02232017,CNBC,02162017,"In the retail world, many are trying to stand out against Amazon, but former J.C. Penney CEO and former head of retail for Apple Ron Johnson says only one retailer is truly making an effort. ""The only retailer that's truly taking Amazon seriously is Walmart,"" Johnson told CNBC's ""Fast Money"" on Thursday. ""Walmart generates five times the net income that Amazon does. Walmart has the resources to take them on."" However, Johnson pointed out that Walmart will still need to figure out how to compete better to counteract Amazon's skyrocketing growth. ""They're making a lot of moves and it's starting to pay off, but even Walmart will have trouble because if Walmart doubles its $10 billion in sales, it will add $10 billion while Amazon adds $80 billion. People have to take Amazon much more seriously,"" Johnson said. For retail in general, Johnson suggested that companies should band together in order to make a real impact in taking on the e-commerce giant. ""If you look at it, collectively, they can have impact. When the industry goes together and Simon [Malls] puts together a better center, people come,"" Johnson said. ""The super regional mall is doing well against Amazon. It's very hard for an individual store within its four walls to create an experience that can matter enough."" Johnson also suggested a few questions retailers should be asking themselves if they take on the mission to beat Amazon. ""What do you do in store to beat Amazon? What do we do with our merchandise to make sure it's differentiated and preferred? How do we price goods?"" Johnson said. ""I would put Amazon on the wall. I would paint it on the billboards and I would say, we are going to find a way to beat Amazon because that is what's going to change the game here."" On top of the Amazon issue, Johnson also commented about the detrimental effect on retail if the border-adjustment tax was to be implemented. ""We're in a very difficult time. Many retailers are on the brink as they begin to close stores, as the malls they're in start to close and change, so it's a very difficult environment. And you add something like a major need to put a price increase on products and it could have a very serious impact on many,"" Johnson said. ""Almost every retailer is forecasting comp sales flat or down next year. If you have a border tax and they're forced to raise prices, that's going to further decrease their sales and keep people out of stores."" ",Former J.C.

Krystina Gustafson,02232017,CNBC,02162017,"A planned delay in the delivery of two tax refunds could be taking a bite out of Wal-Mart's revenue. After reporting another quarter of top-line growth during the holiday period, the world's largest retailer said sales have gotten off to a slow start in its new fiscal year. Later delivery of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Additional Child Tax Credit could be to blame. Congress passed a measure to delay these refunds, which benefit low- to middle-income households with children, back in 2015. The holdup was designed to give the IRS more time to track down fraudulent claims. Jefferies estimates this delay has resulted in roughly $45 billion less income than the same time last year. Refunds are expected to begin trickling in next week, meaning Wal-Mart should have a better sense of the impact from their delays in coming weeks, CFO Brett Biggs said. ""We continue to run our plan,"" the company said. Wal-Mart expects comparable sales for the 13-week period ending April 28 to increase between 1 percent and 1.5 percent. That would mark the 11th consecutive quarter of growth for that key metric. The retailer's same-store sales rose 1.8 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, marking their biggest gain in more than four years.

Michael Khouw,02232017,CNBC,02162017,"Wednesday on CNBC's ""Fast Money"" we discussed some unusual options action in Home Depot, which hit a new high of $142.66 on Wednesday. Specifically, we saw an opening buyer pay 42 cents for 1,332 March 150 calls. Ultimately, about 2,000 of these traded. While we highlighted that the trader is betting on 6 percent upside in Home Depot over the coming month, we did not have time to examine whether that's reasonable. Is it? Home Depot is the world's largest home-improvement retailer, selling building materials and home improvement and lawn and garden products. The company also offers home improvement services. With nearly 400,000 employees and more than 2,200 stores in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, the typical store averages 105,000 square feet of indoor retail space with 35,000 products. The growing e-commerce business offers more than one million products for online purchases, and many purchasers arrange for in-store pickup. Customers include ""do-it-yourselfers,"" professional contractors, as well as customers who buy both products and services via their installation business. Although professional customers represent approximately 3 percent of the total customer base, they represent about 40 percent of gross revenues, and as such the company focuses heavily on this important group of customers. Historically big box retailers have focused on two key areas for growth: increasing same-store sales (which in turn can also improve margins) and increasing the number of locations. While this was certainly Home Depot's strategy in the early years, more recently they have focused on online sales. Consequently, the company has seen sales growth and broader margins in recent years, even as many other retailers contracted as consumers migrated increasingly to online purchases. For example, while the 2,274 store locations as of January 31, 2016 was exactly the same as it was 6 years earlier in January of 2010, revenues grew about 34 percent over that period. Earnings grew from $1.67 per share in the 12 months ended January 2010 to $6.20 per share last year. Granted, 2010 was in the throes of the housing crisis; but even compared to the pre-credit crisis peak earnings of $2.72 per share in 2006, the growth on roughly the same number of locations is impressive and enviable. Lowe's, Home Depot's largest competitor, also experienced impressive growth over the same period, however, to do so, their store count grew nearly 9 percent over the same time frame. Additionally, they logged sales of $293 per-retail-square-foot in the most recent fiscal year, which is substantially lower than the $374 per-square-foot that Home Depot achieved during the same period. Online sales represented 5.6 percent of total revenues in the most recently reported quarter, up 17 percent from the prior quarter. Impressive considering many of the company's products require a forklift, which might also explain why 40 percent of those online purchases were picked up in the store, one of the few online instances that justifies a bricks-and-mortar presence. A history of consistently delivering impressive growth and regular dividend increases helps explain Wall Street's bullish sentiment. Of the 36 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, there are 22 ""buy"" ratings on the stock, 11 ""holds"" and no ""sells"" (the remaining analysts surveyed did not issue buy/sell recommendations). One of the top ranked analysts, Christopher Horvers of J.P. Morgan, reaffirmed his bullish ""overweight"" rating on Wednesday with a $149 price target — but there's the rub. Mr. Horvers's target is less than 5 percent above the current stock price. Even with the stock trading at all-time highs, bulls could point to fundamentals; seven consecutive years of double-digit earnings growth and high single-digit revenue growth even as other big box retailers such as Walmart and Target have had none. For a retailer, the margins are enviable and growing. For comparison, in 2010, Target had net income margins of roughly 4 percent, the same as they do today. Home Depot, which had similar net margins of 4.3 percent in 2010, has seen those margins nearly double to 8.3 percent. Although it's a fair criticism to suggest Home Depot does not compete directly with Target, in many areas they do compete directly with another big and storied retailer, Sears. Both sell tools, home appliances, lawn and garden equipment and, to a small extent, auto supplies. Since 2010, Sears sales have fallen by half. Net margins of just 0.6 percent in 2010 and 0.2 percent in 2011 have been negative every year since. Sears' sales-per-square-foot of $128.56 (and declining fast) are roughly one-third those of Home Depot. These companies sell the same appliances, so product differentiation didn't apply here. Craftsman-branded tools at Sears (recently sold to Stanley Black & Decker) have historically enjoyed more cache than the Husky-branded tools at Home Depot. So, the outperformance of one versus the other is largely one of better management and operations, at least in the segments where these businesses compete. At less than 20 times forward earnings, with 15 to 20 percent earnings per share (EPS) growth, propelled by a strong housing market, good management, improving margins and increasing market share versus poorly managed competitors such as Sears, the bulls have a reasonable case. The company is growing earnings faster than the S&P 500 yet trades at a discount to it. Technically it looks good, too, with the stock on Wednesday hitting an all-time closing high. A reversal would be a warning sign, but we haven't seen one yet. To anyone who is buying the stock today, it might seem to be an all-clear. On the macroeconomic front, home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation and an aging housing stock are also tailwinds for their business. The cracks in the bull case are that the equity bull market is long in the tooth. Interest rates are rising, and as they do, that could crimp both home price appreciation and turnover. While it's true that Home Depot's multiples look reasonable in the context of S&P 500 multiples all are well above average. At historical multiples for Home Depot, which existed while the company enjoyed similar growth, Home Depot would be 15 to 30 percent cheaper than it is today. Even if 10-year Treasury rates remain steady — thus minimizing the impact on mortgage rates tied to them at historically low levels — inflation fears could raise the short-end of the curve. An inverted yield curve has historically slowed economic growth, and the rhetoric of pro-growth President Donald Trump is unproven. Options are currently pricing in a one-day earnings related move of 2.4 percent when the company report results next Tuesday. That is smaller than the historical average move of almost 2.9 percent. Put simply, options are cheap. Recent activity could be an effort to make a cheap bet that the rally could continue, with earnings as the catalyst to propel it to new heights. My counterpoint would be that the one month move following earnings is usually small, roughly 4.5 percent. Consequently, if I was inclined to use options to press bullish bets—a strategy I vastly favor over buying the stock here—I would use options closer to at-the-money, and might even consider call spreads. While we usually talk about using ""regular"" expirations on Options Action (those that occur on the third Friday of every month), one of the advantages of weekly options is that there are often more strikes available. In Home Depot's case, weekly options have ""dollar strikes"" whereas the regular options have strikes $5 apart. For example one could spend about $2 to buy the March 31 expiration 143/150 call spread (prices are about $2.60 and 60 cents respectively). Options will have a slight ""vol suck"" after earnings are announced as options decay once the event has passed; the short 150 calls would help mitigate that. Additionally, since a 6-percent move over the ensuing month following earnings is unusual, the 150s have only a 20-percent probability of being in play.

Dustin McKissen,02232017,CNBC,02162017,"In 1994, when I was 13, my dad got our family's first cell phone. It was one of those brick-sized Motorolas, and it was incredibly expensive, even by today's standards. Making a call on that phone also cost a fortune—I learned that the hard way when I made a long-distance call to a girl and was sentenced by my dad to three months of hard labor as punishment. Now, more than twenty years later, I use an iPhone (which is still cheap compared to my dad's Motorola) to video chat with Pierre, my friend and client from Belgium. It's no coincidence that the information economy exploded at the same time the world opened to free trade. Complex supply chains made technology and communication cheaper, and created a world where workers and companies that exist in the knowledge and information economy—like me—can tap into a global market for their goods and services. Of course, another effect of cheap technology, complex supply chains, and globalization has been a reduction in America's manufacturing workforce. Donald Trump made the pain of America's manufacturing workforce a centerpiece of his campaign. In fact, Trump explicitly told us he is going to bring back an America-first manufacturing-based economy. That's not going to happen. Things have changed. The economy Trump promises we will return to—one financed by tariffs and guarded by walls—was not an information-based economy. Walls and tariffs can change where we manufacture our cars and appliances, but you can't build walls and enact tariffs to keep knowledge and information out. If Trump succeeds in bringing American manufacturing back to the pre-globalization world, he will create a different type of economic inequality—an inequality based on some workers existing in a modern, globalized economy, while others exist in an economy trying to recreate the 1950s. In other words, the Goldman Sachs team advising Trump will still have access to global markets, while the blue-collar workers who fervently believe Trump can recreate a different era will suffer. I've worked with manufacturers in the plastics and rubber industries, and I can tell you the relentless drive toward automation in manufacturing is real. That's happening because robots are cheaper in the long run, and because America's manufacturers have a tough time filling jobs. And in an economy nearing full employment, manufacturers that can't fill jobs have no choice but to automate. Manufacturers might re-shore or choose to keep some operations in America, but a large number of jobs for Trump's blue-collar base won't be a part of that equation. What that blue-collar base will get from Trump's protectionist approach is higher prices on consumer goods and food. And an open world has more than just economic benefits. Even if my client in Belgium and I weren't doing business together, my life has been enriched just by knowing him. Pierre was born in Africa, was adopted by a French family, and has lived all over Europe. I was born in Washington state, and the most cosmopolitan place I've ever lived is Phoenix. (You read that correctly—I'm a lifelong resident of red state America.) I would have never known someone like Pierre in an economy based on walls and tariffs—but of course, the main benefit of globalization, cheap technology, and the information age isn't having friends in other parts of the world. My family didn't own a cell phone in 1994 because we were rich. My dad's employer gave him a phone because we literally lived in a trailer in the woods and couldn't have a landline. He had just gotten a promotion, and would now be on-call and traveling—which is hard to do without a phone. The trailer was far from the worst place my family ever lived. Just a few years earlier we lived in a tent, and survived on cheese, peanut butter, milk, and food stamps from the government. During the first years of my adult life I was on a path toward the same poverty my parents experienced. Then, as a young father with a full-time job, I used a laptop I bought at Walmart and an online degree program to become the first college graduate in my family. Donald Trump is selling a simple message that is almost impossible to resist if you're caught on the wrong side of progress. As a society, we need to have a better answer for those displaced by trade than just, ""tough luck, that's the way the world works."" We need real solutions—like expanding Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) to cover more workers, public investment in industries that can re-absorb skilled blue collar employees (like clean energy), and politicians willing to engage in an honest dialogue about the future of work in an interconnected world, rather than simple nostalgia-driven slogans. Because the reality is that our globalized world isn't going back in the box. And, according to a just-released Gallup poll that indicated 72 percent of the public supports free trade, most of us recognize the benefits of a more open world. Embracing that fact is the only way to create a future where everyone has a chance to live a better life than the one their father experienced.

Lauren Silva Laughlin,02232017,CNBC,02162017,"The power behind the Burger King throne wants an extra side of nuggets. Fresh from withdrawing Kraft Heinz's $143 billion bid for Unilever over the weekend, investment firm 3G Capital's restaurant roll-up pounced on fried-chicken chain Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. Restaurant Brands International is offering $1.8 billion for the maker of the Bonafide Chicken meal, a 27 percent premium to the undisturbed price. The deal gives the Brazilian founders of 3G a savory snack while they settle on another big deal for Kraft Heinz. The fast-food business has become more challenging over the last several years as newer entrants like Shake Shack and Five Guys and online ordering outlets threaten the market share of traditional drive-throughs.

 ,02232017,CNBC,02162017,"WHEN: Today, Thursday, February 23rd WHERE: CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Following is the unofficial transcript of a FIRST ON CNBC interview with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and CNBC's Becky Quick on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" (M-F, 6AM-9AM ET) today, Thursday, February 23rd live from the Treasury Department in Washington, D.C. Following is a link to the full interview on CNBC.com: http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000595630. All references must be sourced to CNBC. BECKY QUICK: I WANT TO THANK THE TREASURY SECRETARY FOR TAKING THIS TIME TO SIT DOWN WITH US. STEVEN MNUCHIN IS THE NEW TREASURY SECRETARY THE 77THTREASURY SECRETARY. THIS IS YOUR FIRST SIT-DOWN TELEVISION INTERVIEW SINCE TAKING OVER IN THAT SPOT MR SECRETARY. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US AND INVITING US INTO THE BUILDING. STEVEN MNUCHIN: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. QUICK: AS JOE MENTIONED, THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU. THERE'S BEEN HUGE DEBATE ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES. ONE THING I'D LIKE TO CLEAR UP FIRST AND FOREMOST IS HOW YOU PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME. I'VE HEARD IT PRONOUNCED 15 DIFFERENT WAYS BY PEOPLE WHO SWEAR THEY KNOW YOUR FAMILY. MNUCHIN? MNUCHIN: I'LL GO WITH MNUCHIN. PERFECT. QUICK: JUST FOR THE RECORD SO WE CLEAR IT UP AND GET IT RIGHT ON OUR AIR. MNUCHIN: AND STEVEN. NOT STEVE. QUICK: STEVEN MNUCHIN SO EVERYONE KNOW IT SINCE WE HAVE BUTCHERED IT A FEW TIMES THROUGH HERE. SIR, I THINK THE THING THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO THE MARKETS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH TAX REFORM. YESTERDAY PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID WE COULD EXPECT TO SEE A PLAN MAYBE THE BEGINNING TO MIDDLE OF MARCH. HE SAID IT'S VERY WELL FINALIZED AT THIS POINT. I JUST WONDER, DOES IT RESEMBLE THE HOUSE PLAN? WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE PLAN AT THIS POINT? MNUCHIN: LET ME FIRST SAY THAT OUR ECONOMIC AGENDA, THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IS GROWTH AND THE FIRST, MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WILL IMPACT GROWTH IS A TAX PLAN. SO WE ARE COMMITTED TO PASS TAX REFORM. IT WILL BE VERY SIGNIFICANT. IT'S GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON MIDDLE INCOME TAX CUTS, SIMPLIFICATION, AND MAKING THE BUSINESS TAX COMPETITIVE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH HAS BEEN A BIG PROBLEM AND A LOT OF REASONS WHY COMPANIES ARE LEAVING AND CASH IS SITTING OFFSHORE. SO THAT'S REALLY OUR FOCUS. WE WANT TO GET THIS DONE BY THE AUGUST RECESS. WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, AND WE'RE WORKING ON A COMBINED PLAN. QUICK: LET'S BREAK DOWN SOME OF THE SPECIFICS YOU JUST MENTIONED. GROWTH BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU THINK WE CAN GET BACK TO 3% GDP, MAYBE BETTER THAN THAT. HOW DO WE DO THAT? MNUCHIN: I THINK IT'S VERY ACHIEVABLE. IF YOU LOOK AT LONG-TERM GROWTH, WE HAVE UNDERPERFORMED WHERE WE NEED TO BE. WE BELIEVE WE CAN BE COMPETITIVE AND GET BACK TO SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AT 3% OR MORE. THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WILL IMPACT IT. I THINK THE FIRST ISSUE, AS I MENTIONED, IS GOING TO BE TAX REFORM. I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE IS GOING TO BE REGULATORY RELIEF. WE NEED TO CUT BACK REGULATIONS THAT HAVE PREVENTED SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES FROM BEING THE ENGINE OF GROWTH IN THIS COUNTRY. WE'RE ALSO FOCUSED, AS YOU KNOW, ON DODD-FRANK AND LOOKING AT DODD-FRANK AND MAKING SURE BANKS CAN LEND. THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF LIQUIDITY OUT THERE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BANKS PUT IT TO WORK. QUICK: IF WE STICK TO YOUR TIME FRAME AND WE SEE SOMETHING PASSED BEFORE THE AUGUST RECESS, DO YOU THINK -- WE'VE ALREADY SEEN REGULATORY REFORM START. DO YOU THINK WE'D SEE 3% PLUS GDP BY NEXT YEAR? MNUCHIN: I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO GET THERE. SO I THINK IT WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, MORE TOWARDS THE END -- SEEING THE GROWTH TOWARDS THE END OF NEXT YEAR. I THINK BY THE TIME WE PASS TAX REFORM, YOU SEE THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY, YOU SEE THE IMPACT OF REGULATION, IT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO TAKE INTO NEXT YEAR TO SEE AN ENGINE OF GROWTH. QUICK: OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THIS, THE FED AND THE CDO, AND THEIR GROWTH PROJECTIONS ARE CLOSER TO 1.8%. WHAT ARE THEY MISSING? THEY DON'T SEE ANY OF THIS? MNUCHIN: I DON'T THINK THEY'RE MISSING ANYTHING. I THINK THEY'RE MAKING THOSE PROJECTIONS BASED ON THE STATUS QUO. THAT'S WHERE THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN. IT'S BEEN ACTUALLY LOWER THAN THAT UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AND I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC CHANGES. WE HAVE AN UNBELIEVABLE ECONOMIC TEAM. MYSELF, GARY COHN. I SPEAK TO GARY MANY TIMES A DAY. WE WERE WITH MICK MULVANEY YESTERDAY ON THE BUDGET AT OMB. WE HAVE WILBUR ROSS IN COMMERCE. WE HAVE A GREAT ECONOMIC TEAM, AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT FORTH POLICIES THAT ARE GOING TO REALLY CREATE GROWTH IN THIS COUNTRY. QUICK: LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW YOU GET A PLAN THROUGH CONGRESS BECAUSE THE HOUSE HAS ITS PLAN THAT PAUL RYAN HAS SHEPHERDED THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE UNDERSTAND VERY WELL. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS -- I CAN NAME AT LEAST SIX WHO HAVE SAID THE IDEA OF A BORDER ADJUSTMENT TAX IS SOMETHING THAT IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL, THAT THEY WILL NOT SUPPORT. THAT MAKES UP A HUGE PORTION, A TRILLION DOLLARS IN INCOME. FIRST OF ALL, DO YOU AGREE WITH THE BORDER ADJUSTMENT TAX AS SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED IN TAX REFORM? MNUCHIN: WELL, LET ME JUST SAY, I THINK THERE'S A CONSENSUS ON THE MAJORITY OF WHERE WE ARE ON TAX REFORM. WE'RE LOOKING CLOSELY AT THE ISSUES ON THE BORDER ADJUSTED TAX. I SPOKEN EXTENSIVELY WITH PAUL RYAN AND WITH CHAIRMAN BRADY ON THIS. WE'RE LOOKING AT IT. WE THINK THERE'S SOME INTERESTING ASPECTS OF IT. WE THINK THERE'S SOME CONCERNS ABOUT IT. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS, YOU KNOW, WE ARE ALL COMMITTED TO DO IS MAKE SURE THERE IS A COMBINED PLAN THAT'S A PLAN THAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING TOGETHER ON ONE PLAN THAT GETS PASSED. I THINK EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PAGE AND DOING THAT. QUICK: BUSINESS COMMUNITY OBVIOUSLY IS LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT A LOT OF THESE ISSUES. YOU HAVE MAJOR EXPORTERS LIKE A BOEING OR A GENERAL ELECTRIC WHO ARE ADAMANT WE SEE SOME SORT OF BORDER ADJUSTMENT. IF NOT THAT SORT OF TAX, BUT SOME OTHER WAY OF MAKING THE ADJUSTMENT. AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS ARE AT A HUGE DISADVANTAGE. WE'RE THE ONLY ONE OF 35 OECD COUNTRIES THAT DON'T DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IF YOU HEAR FROM THE BIG RETAILERS, SOMEBODY LIKE A WALMART OR TARGET, THEY SAY IT WOULD WIPE OUT THEIR PROFITS POTENTIALLY AND WOULD END UP BENG A TAX ON CONSUMERS. WHICH ONE OF THOSE CAMPS DO YOU HAVE YOUR OWN CONCERNS COMING IN MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH? MNUCHIN: ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE REACHING OUT TO BUSINESS. NOT JUST BIG BUSINESS, BUT SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES, AND WE'RE LISTENING TO WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THIS MORNING THE PRESIDENT IS HOSTING A GROUP. WE HAVE ABOUT 30 EXECUTIVES FROM VARIOUS MANUFACTURERS. I'LL BE GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND PARTICIPATING IN THAT. THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY HOSTED THE RETAIL GROUPS. SO WE'RE LISTENING. WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS. WE UNDERSTAND WHERE PEOPLE ARE, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PLAN THAT ADDRESSES THESE CONCERNS. QUICK: IS IT FAIR TO SAY IT'S STILL A LITTLE TOO EARLY TO TELL ON THESE DETAILS THAT HAS TO BE WORKED OUT? MNUCHIN: I WOULD SAY IT'S A LITTLE TOO EARLY TO ANNOUNCE. WE'RE WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES VERY CAREFULLY. WE'RE RUNNING A LOT OF NUMBERS. WE'RE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT A LOT OF ISSUES. AS I SAID, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WE'RE COMMITTED TO GET THIS PASSED BY AUGUST. QUICK: DOES THIS PLAN NEED TO BE REVENUE NEUTRAL? MNUCHIN: WELL, I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT REVENUE NEUTRAL, THERE'S GOING TO BE THE SCORING THAT THE JOINT COMMITTEE USES, THEN THERE'S OUR OWN INTERNAL VIEWS AT TREASURY AND THE ADMINISTRATION. MY GUESS IS THAT OUR GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS WILL BE HIGHER THAN WHAT THEY USE TO SCORE THE PLAN. AGAIN, THESE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT. WE'RE RUNNING A LOT OF NUMBERS. I THINK YOU'VE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT WE BELIEVE IN DYNAMIC, NOT STATIC, SCORING. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND I'LL TELL YOU, MY FIRST WEEK IN TREASURY, I HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE RESOURCES IN THIS BUILDING. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY AN INCREDIBLE HISTORY HERE, BUT THERE ARE JUST UNBELIEVABLE RESOURCES. THE STAFF IS SO TALENTED. THEY'RE SO FOCUSED ON DOING THINGS. WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE TAX GROUP AND MODELING AREA. THEY'RE WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK ON RUNNING SCENARIOS FOR US. QUICK: IT'S A FAIR POINT. IF YOU'RE USING DYNAMIC SCORING, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY IF GROWTH IS COMING IN FASTER THAN EXPECTED, THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE ALL THE DIFFERENT NUMBERS. IT ALWAYS GETS BACK TO THE QUESTION OF WHO GETS TO BE THE ARBITER OF THAT, WHO'S CALLING THE SHOTS, WHO'S MAKING THOSE DECISION. JUST TO BE CLEAR, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU'LL HAVE YOUR OWN INTERNAL SCORING OF ALL OF THIS. IT WON'T NECESSARILY BE SOMETHING THAT MATCHES UP WITH CBO OR ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS. MNUCHIN: WELL, AGAIN, THERE MAY BE DIFFERENCES IN GROWTH PROJECTIONS. I THINK YOU'VE SEEN THAT IN THE PAST. I THINK AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE GROWTH PROJECTIONS BASED UPON OUR PLAN THAT WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO CREATE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF GROWTH AND THAT'S GOING TO CREATE JOBS, CREATE TAX REVENUES. THAT'S GOING TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY. SO WE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE DOING A LOT OF WORK. AS I SAID, THIS IS MY NUMBER ONE AGENDA ITEM. THE PRESIDENT IS VERY FOCUSED ON THIS. THE LEADERSHIP IS VERY FOCUSED ON THIS, AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS DONE. QUICK: YOU MENTIONED YOU'RE MAKING SURE THIS IS GOING TO BRING TAX BREAKS TO MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS. WHEN YOU SAT DOWN WITH US ON ""SQUAWK BOX"" BACK IN NOVEMBER, YOU SAID EVEN IF WEALTHIER PEOPLE GET A TAX BREAK, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT THEY NECESSARILY ARE PAYING LESS IN TAXES BECAUSE THE DEDUCTIONS, THE LOOPHOLES WOULD BE CLOSED AS A RESULT. DO YOU STAND BY THAT NOW THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND IN YOUR POSITION AS TREASURY SECRETARY? MNUCHIN: THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COMMENTS ON THAT. I ACTUALLY THINK THERE'S A RULE. I THINK DURING MY CONFIRMATION, IT GOT NAMED THE MNUCHIN RULE. I WAS VERY KEEN ON THAT. THERE'S A VOLCKER RULE AND A MNUCHIN RULE AND A BUFFETT RULE. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE GOOD COMPANY. AS I'VE SAID BEFORE, WE'RE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON A MIDDLE INCOME TAX CUT AND SIMPLIFICATION FOR BUSINESS. WHAT WE ARE FOCUSED IS THAT ON THE HIGH END, IF THERE ARE TAX CUTS, THAT THEY ARE OFFSET WITH REDUCTION OF DEDUCTIONS AND OTHER THINGS. SO IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO CAREFULLY LOOK AT. WHEN WE COME OUT WITH THE PLAN, WE'LL COME OBVIOUSLY OUT WITH THE DISTRIBUTION AND HOW IT IMPACTS PEOPLE AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON. QUICK: IS THAT -- THE MNUCHIN RULE IS NOT SET IN STONE AT THIS POINT, IT'S DEBATABLE? MNUCHIN: WELL, AGAIN, WE HAVEN'T FINALIZED THE PLAN, BUT OUR OBJECTIVE AND WHAT I SAID BEFORE STILL STANDS. YOU KNOW, KIND OF THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS WHEN WE RUN THE NUMBERS. THE OBJECTIVE IS THIS IS A MIDDLE INCOME TAX CUT AND THIS IS TAX SIMPLIFICATION AND THIS IS MAKING BUSINESSES MORE COMPETITIVE. QUICK: THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE TIMING WOULD BE ON THIS. DO YOU EXPECT THAT THE TAX REFORMS WOULD BE RETROACTIVE TO TAKE PLACE IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, OR DO YOU EXPECT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LOOK FOR NEXT YEAR AT THE EARLIEST? MNUCHIN: AGAIN, I CAN'T COMMENT ON THE SPECIFICS OF WHEN WE ROLL THIS OUT. OBVIOUSLY THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE'LL BE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. REGARDLESS OF WHEN THEY GO IN PLACE, THIS WON'T REALLY IMPACT THE ECONOMY UNTIL NEXT YEAR WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SEE CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR. AND IT WILL TAKE A COUPLE YEARS TO GET GROWTH. BUT WE'RE COMMITTED IN THIS ADMINISTRATION, AND YOU CAN SEE THIS IN THE MARKETS. YOU CAN SEE THE STOCK MARKET IS UP, THE DOLLAR IS UP. THERE'S A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND IN THE DESIRE TO INVEST IN THE U.S. THIS IS A VERY COMPETITIVE PLACE TO DO BUSINESS. WE GOT GREAT COMPANIES. YOU SEE THAT REFLECTED IN THE MARKETS. QUICK: OBVIOUSLY THE STOCK MARKET HAS RALLIED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK OFFICE. ACTUALLY, SINCE THE ELECTION, AND AGAIN SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE. DO YOU VIEW THAT AS A REPORT CARD? MNUCHIN: ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY. THIS IS A MARKET TO MARKET BUSINESS AND YOU SEE WHAT THE MARKET THINKS. QUICK: IF THE MARKET WERE TO PULLBACK IS THAT JUST DISAPPOINTMENT AND THINGS NOT GETTING DONE AS THE MARKET HAD ANTICIPATED -- YOU'VE WATCHED THE MARKETS FOR A LONG TIME. DO YOU EXPECT A PULLBACK AT SOME POINT WHEN YOU SEE THINGS MOVE SO FAR, SO QUICKLY? MNUCHIN: I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FOCUSED IN THE MARKETS ON NOT DAY TRADING AND WHERE THEY ARE DAY TO DAY. WHETHER THE MARKET GOES UP OR DOWN ON ANY GIVEN DAY, YOU KNOW, I'VE GIVEN UP FIGURING OUT WHY THAT IS. QUICK: SMART MAN. MNUCHIN: BUT DO I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR -- WE'RE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE'S VERY ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE U.S. I THINK THAT'S REFLECTIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOALS AND WHAT THE MARKET THINKS OF IT. QUICK: YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU EXPECT INTEREST RATES TO REMAIN RELATIVELY LOW FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME, BUT WHEN WE GET TO THIS GROWTH YOU'RE EXPECTING OF 3% OR BETTER, HOW QUICKLY DO YOU THINK INTEREST RATES WILL HAVE TO ADJUST TO CATCH UP WITH THAT TO REFLECT A STRONG ECONOMY? MNUCHIN: WELL, LET ME SAY THIS IS REALLY MORE THE FED'S ROLE AND NOT MY ROLE. I DO LOOK FORWARD ON STARTING MY WEEKLY MEETINGS WITH JANET YELLEN AT THE FED. I LOOK FORWARD TO SPENDING TIME WITH HER. I WOULD COMMENT AGAIN, WE'RE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE'RE AT HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES. I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THIS ON A HISTORICAL BASIS, WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE LOW INTEREST RATES FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WITHIN THAT THERE'S NOT THE CONTEXT THAT INTEREST RATES CAN GO UP AND YOU'VE SEEN THE FED SIGNAL THAT. AGAIN, I'M NOT GOING TO SPECULATE ON WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. MY COMMENTS ARE REALLY ABOUT WHERE WE ARE NOT RELATIVE TO JUST TODAY BUT WHERE WE ARE RELATIVE TO WHERE INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. QUICK: THERE WERE SOME MARKET SPECULATION YESTERDAY THAT YOU MIGHT TODAY ANNOUNCE PLANS FOR A LONGER TERM TREASURY BOND, A 50-YEAR AND 100-YEAR BOND BECAUSE OF JUST THAT, INTEREST RATES BEING LOW RIGHT NOW. HAVE YOU GIVEN THAT SERIOUS THOUGHT, AND IS THAT SOMETHING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE? MNUCHIN: I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE. WE'RE IN THE GOING TO MAKE A FORMAL -- WE'RE NOT READY TO MAKE ANY FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT ON WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A 50-YEAR OR 100-YEAR. I HAVE SAID THIS BEFORE. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD SERIOUSLY LOOK AT. I'VE ALREADY BEGUN TO TALK TO THE STAFF ABOUT LOOKING AT THAT. AGAIN, WE'LL REACH OUT TO THE MARKET, INVESTORS, DIFFERENT PEOPLE, BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE OF WHETHER WE SHOULD EXPLORE, WHETHER WE CAN RAISE 50 OR 100-YEAR MONEY AT A VERY SLIGHT PREMIUM. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE FOR TREASURY TO LOOK AT. QUICK: IT DOES. YESTERDAY YOU CONTACTED CHRISTINE LAGARDE AT THE IMF AND HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH HER ABOUT MAKING SURE THE IMF IS POLICING THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE POLICIES OF ITS MEMBERS. IS THAT A WAY OF TRYING TO MONITOR CHINA AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE TREATING THINGS FAIRLY WITHOUT OFFICIALLY CALLING THEM CURRENCY MANIPULATORS? MNUCHIN: LET ME FIRST SAY I HAD A TERRIFIC CONVERSATION WITH HER. I THINK I'VE SPOKEN TO PROBABLY ABOUT 12 FOREIGN LEADERS AT THIS POINT. FINANCE MINISTERS AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNMENTS. I THINK I HAVE THE REST OF MY CALLS SCHEDULED FOR NEXT WEEK. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING TO THE G20 AND BADEN-BADEN IN MARCH. SO I THINK ONE OF THE IMPORTANT JOBS IN THIS ROLE IS TO MAKE SURE I REACH OUT TO MY COUNTERPARTS AND THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON CREATING OBJECTIVES THAT WILL CREATE ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR US AND SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS. CURRENCIES ARE ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOK AT, AND THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF MY COUNTERPARTS ABOUT. QUICK: IS IT FAIR TO SAY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE NAMING CHINA A CURRENCY MANIPULATOR ANY TIME SOON? MNUCHIN: AGAIN, WHAT'S FAIR TO SAY IS, FIRST OF ALL, I'VE HAD A TERRIFIC CONVERSATION WITH MY COUNTERPARTS THERE. I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING THEM. WE HAVE A PROCESS WITHIN TREASURY WHERE WE GO THROUGH AND LOOK AT CURRENCY MANIPULATION ACROSS THE BOARD. WE'LL GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS. WE'LL DO THAT AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST. WE'RE NOT MAKING ANY JUDGMENTS UNTIL WE CONTINUE THAT PROCESS. QUICK: DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THE EXIM BANK, THE EXPORT/IMPORT BANK? IT'S SOMETHING THAT BIG EXPORTERS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE HOPED TO SEE SOME SUPPORT FOR. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON IT. MNUCHIN: I'VE TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT ABOUT IT. IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW, IT'S OBVIOUSLY STALLED AT THE MOMENT. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS HISTORICALLY ABOUT THE XM BANK AND IS IT JUST SUBSIDIZING CERTAIN LARGE CORPORATIONS. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'RE INTERESTED IN DOING. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT, AND TO THE EXTENT WE THINK T EXPORT/I EXPORT/IMPORT BANK CAN BE COMPETITIVE IN HELPING SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES EXPORT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN MAKE LOANS UP TO $10 MILLION. THEY'RE DOING THAT, DOING PLENTY OF THEM. I ALREADY HAVE A TEAM LOOKING AT WHAT THE IMPACT IS ON THE ECONOMY IF WE EXPANDED THAT. QUICK: FANNIE AND FREDDIE. IT'S BEEN A HUGE ISSUE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SWIRLING AROUND. IT'S HARD TO SAY EXACTLY WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION STANDS ON IT, BUT YOU HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO HOUSING FINANCE REFORM. CAN YOU TELL US HOW YOU COME DOWN ON THAT AND WHAT SORT OF TIME FRAME WE SHOULD EXPECT. MNUCHIN: SURE. SO I MEAN, I'D SAY SOMETHING I'VE ALREADY STARTED WORKING ON. I MET WITH MEL WATT THIS WEEK WE HAD A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION. I MET WITH JEB HENSARLING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT VARIOUS DIFFERENT ISSUES. AS I I'VE SAID BEFORE, I'M COMMITTED THAT UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION WE'RE GOING TO HAVE HOUSING REFORM SO THAT WE DON'T JUST LEAVE THESE ENTITIES THE WAY THEY ARE. THEY'VE BEEN SITTING THERE FOR TOO LONG OF A PERIOD OF TIME. WE NEED A SOLUTION. WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS. I THINK THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT SHARE THE VIEW THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH THEM. THERE ARE DIFFERENT VIEWS. AS I SAID, YOU KNOW, I'VE ALREADY REACHED OUT TO PEOPLE. WE HAVE A TEAM INTERNALLY THAT WE'VE ALREADY ASSIGNED. SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO STUDY CAREFULLY. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING RIGHT AWAY FROM US, WHEREAS TAX REFORM IS A NEAR-TERM ISSUE, BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY ON THE AGENDA. WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO DO HERE.

Timothy Green,02232017,Fool,02162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Retail giant Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) reported solid fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, with the U.S. business producing another quarter of comparable-sales growth. But the star of the show was e-commerce as U.S. online sales soared 29% year over year, an acceleration driven by the company's investments in this business as well as the acquisition of Jet.com. E-commerce is still small relative to brick-and-mortar operations, but that won't remain true for long. According to the Department of Commerce, total e-commerce sales in the U.S. rose 15.1% in 2016, far faster than the 2.9% growth in total retail sales. It wasn't too long ago that Wal-Mart's e-commerce business was underperforming the broad market, losing market share despite being well behind leader Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, which ended in January of last year, Wal-Mart's global e-commerce sales increased by just 8% on a constant currency basis. Fiscal 2017, however, was a transformative year. After a slow start, sales growth began to pick up dramatically. Global e-commerce sales were up 7% in the first quarter, 11.8% in the second, and 20.6% in the third. Wal-Mart switched to reporting U.S. e-commerce growth in its fourth-quarter report, but it's clear that the company is making progress. Image source: Wal-Mart. The company made two major moves last year that helped drive this growth. The first was the continued rollout of online grocery, a service that Wal-Mart aggressively expanded in 2016 after successful, regional testing. The service allows customers to place an order online, including not only grocery items but general merchandise as well, and pick it up curbside at a Wal-Mart store, free of charge. A delivery option is also available for a small fee. This online grocery service is now available in various cities across 31 states. The company is even testing out a concept convenience store that allows customers to pick up orders without the hassle of traveling to a supercenter. With the grocery business likely to see rapid change in the coming years, driven in part by Amazon, Wal-Mart is aiming to stay one step ahead of the competition. The second major move was buying start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Jet launched in 2015 with some notable innovations, including its ""smart cart"", which delivers savings to customers based on how much they buy. Prices start out low, often price-matching competitors like Amazon, and then additional savings are layered on top. Wal-Mart paid a significant premium for Jet.com, but the acquisition accomplished two things. First, it brought Jet.com CEO Marc Lore onboard as the head of Wal-Mart's entire e-commerce business. After years of e-commerce playing second fiddle to Wal-Mart's brick-and-mortar operations, an aggressive leader was necessary. Second, Jet.com gives Wal-Mart a brand that has a better chance of clicking with those who have no interest in shopping at Wal-Mart itself. It's unclear whether the company plans to keep the Jet.com brand alive in the long run, but I think it would be a wise move. All of these investments in e-commerce, as well as those made in stores, have knocked down Wal-Mart's bottom line. Adjusted earnings per share was $4.32 in fiscal 2017, down from $4.59 in fiscal 2016. Wal-Mart guided for adjusted earnings between $4.20 and $4.40 per share this year, roughly flat at the midpoint. There's no question that effectively competing with Amazon will be expensive. Margins in the online business will likely be lower than those in the store business, so earnings growth going forward will be sluggish at best. But the alternative -- not competing at all -- isn't an option in a world where retail is shifting online. Wal-Mart's recent move to offer free two-day shipping on all orders over $35 is another aggressive step that will both hurt profitability and provide a boost to e-commerce growth. The company scrapped its Amazon Prime-like subscription program in favor of this simpler strategy, and CEO Doug McMillon noted in the conference call that the company was already seeing an uptick in its e-commerce business as a result. Wal-Mart is no longer sitting idly by as Amazon scoops up an ever-growing share of retail sales. The company made some big moves last year that turbocharged its online efforts, and this year is off to a strong start as well. The bottom line will likely remain pressured as Wal-Mart aggressively pursues this opportunity, but the company is doing what needs to be done to remain relevant. ","
      
    Wal-Mart's E-Commerce Business Is Booming -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,02232017,Fool,02162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) made a bold move last month when it dropped its annual membership that cost customers $49 a year for unlimited, free two-day shipping, instead offering that perk to anyone ordering $35 in eligible items. The retailer's previous program, ShippingPass, was a blatant attempt to undercut the price of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime, the online retailer's incredibly successful membership program. Prime began as a service that offered free, two-day shipping on millions of items in exchange for an annual fee. Now a $99-a-year (or $10.99 a month) Prime membership comes with all sorts of perks beyond two-day shipping, including Sunday delivery in many markets, the company's streaming video and music services, early access to some deals, and unlimited photo storage. Powered by the free shipping offer, Prime grew to 65 million members in the United States entering Q4, 2016, according to an analysis by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP). Those members make up a little over half of Amazon's audience in the U.S., and they are incredibly important to the retailer because, according to CIRP, they spend an average of about $1,200 per year, compared to about $600 per year for non-member customers. Wal-Mart dropping its membership program is both an admission that it can't catch up to Prime and a bold attempt to win over customers. In theory, the physical retailer's offer should be very attractive to anyone who is not a Prime member, and the lack of a membership fee could get some people to consider dropping Amazon's service. Wal-Mart's new program offers free shipping on all eligible offers over $35. Image source: Wal-Mart. Even though Wal-Mart has one-upped Amazon by going fee-free, the two shipping programs are not identical. Prime may cost $99 a year while Wal-Mart doesn't charge, but it's not quite that simple an equation. There are arguments in favor of both companies even with the physical retailer's new pricing advantage. The major difference -- and for some people it may be enough to make Prime worth it -- is that Amazon Prime covers ""over 50 million eligible items,"" according to its web page. Wal-Mart's free two-day shipping offer only covers ""more than two million items,"" the company said in a press release. The Wal-Mart program, which also lets consumers have their order shipped to stores, focuses ""on the items customers shop the most, including household essentials such as baby necessities, pet products, food, like cereal and peanut butter, cleaning supplies and beauty favorites, as well as top electronics and toys,"" the company said. Amazon Prime offers all of those staples as well as pretty much anything else you can think of because the free two-day shipping deal applies not just to items the company sells directly to consumers but also orders it ships directly from its warehouses sold by various vendors. In addition, Amazon offers free, though slower (5-8 day business days) shipping on any order of books over $25 and any overall order of $35 in eligible items. That's very slow delivery, but it might appeal to consumers who want to buy something they can't find in stores. Amazon uses a mix of robots and people in its warehouses. Image source: Amazon. For consumers who don't buy online very often. Wal-Mart has a very compelling offer. The retailer's free shipping offer takes away the risk of paying $99 for Prime and then finding you don't use it very often. In addition, while it offers only a couple of million items, the company clearly knows what consumers buy and has built its program around those items. Still, while Wal-Mart may win business from non-Prime members and from people who let their membership lapse due to lack of use, it's hard to see the average Amazon devotee who spends $1,200 a year opting to make a change. That's because Amazon's program covers so much more that using Prime becomes a reflex for many members. The difference between over 2 million items and over 50 million is massive, and likely enough for Amazon to protect its turf, especially when you consider the other benefits Prime offers. For less-devoted online shoppers however Wal-Mart has a better deal. On a very basic level free is simply better than $99 a year, even if Amazon has more items. This is an early battle in what is likely going to be a prolonged war. Wal-Mart's offer should win it some customers and it may slow down Prime's growth. There are likely to be more shipping moves made by both companies, but Wal-Mart has shown that it's serious about becoming an online player. If it grows the eligible items in its free shipping program it could eventually erode the value of Prime, at least for people who join mostly for free shipping. ","
      
    Amazon vs. Wal-Mart: Which Has the Better Shipping Deal? -- The Motley Fool

Todd Campbell,02232017,Fool,02162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett loves buying great stocks at fair prices, but he doesn't hold onto every stock he buys forever. Sometimes, he'll sell stocks after he's made a healthy profit. Other times, he'll sell because something has changed to make the company less attractive to him. Knowing what stocks Buffett's selling can be important because his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) (NYSE:BRK-A), is so big that when he sells, it can cause share prices to drop. That's a risk investors might not want to take! Luckily, Berkshire Hathaway files a 13F report with the SEC every quarter that shows exactly what he's been selling, and that can keep you from being unhappily surprised. For example, Buffett sold shares in Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), Deere & Co. (NYSE:DE) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in Q4. Should you sell those stocks too? Warren Buffett has been a longtime owner of Wal-Mart Stores, but he's been selling shares in the retail giant since last spring, and in Q4, Berkshire Hathaway reduced its position in Wal-Mart by 89% to 1.4 million shares. Image source: Wal-Mart Stores. One reason Buffett may be selling Wal-Mart is because the company has been under fire from online retailers, and maintaining market share against those retailers has been hard. Wal-Mart is nowhere near as troubled as some other traditional retailers, but retail sales figures, and Wal-Mart's own financials suggest Wal-Mart's best days may be behind it. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce industry revenue jumped 15.7% year over year in Q3, 2016, and it now represents 8.4% of total retail sales. Wal-Mart's most recent quarterly earnings report from November shows investors just how tough its been to compete against online retailers like Amazon.com. In Wal-Mart's fiscal third quarter, its sales grew by an anemic 0.7% to $118.2 billion, and through the first nine months of fiscal 2017, its sales also grew by just 0.7% to $355 billion. For perspective, consider that Amazon.com's net sales surged 27% to $136.0 billion in 2016. Based on that comparison alone, it's understandable why Buffett no longer wants Wal-Mart to be one of his biggest holdings. Warren Buffett was betting that Deere & Co. could recapture some of luster last year, and it seems the farm machinery maker lived up to his expectations. Deere & Co.'s shares came into 2016 trading in the $70's. But, after a big run up, they finished the year trading at over $100. With Deere's shares rallying to all-time highs, it appears Buffett decided not to push his luck. In the third quarter, he sold 874,185 shares, and in the fourth quarter, he sold his remaining 21.1 million shares. It's anyone's guess if Warren Buffett will buy shares in Deere & Co. again, but if he does, it's probably not going to be for a while, unless of course, Deere's shares sell-off, or farm income climbs. In 2016, farm income was the lowest since the recession, and that caused Deere's net revenue to fall 8% to $26.6 billion. Deere & Co.'s ability to turn a profit despite slowing equipment demand is impressive, but the outlook for 2017 doesn't provide a lot of conviction to buy Deere's shares at lofty levels. The USDA net farm income forecast for this year puts it at the lowest levels since 2002, and Deere is projecting that equipment sales will dip by another 1% in 2017. Thus, Deere & Co. may be worth buying only if share prices retreat  Until then, patience is probably best. Verizon may be the country's biggest wireless carrier, but that fact alone wasn't enough to keep Warren Buffett a shareholder. Berkshire Hathaway sold almost all of its stake in Verizon last quarter. We may never know exactly why Buffett soured on Verizon, but since Buffett has owned Verizon shares since the middle of 2014, it's possible, depending on the exact timing of his buys and sells, that he was able to book a double-digit percentage profit on his investment in Verizon, and if so, then that gain might have been enough to convince him to sell into growing industry uncertainty. Last year, Verizon decided to buy Yahoo! to merge it with its AOL business, but after a high-profile data breach, pressure has mounted for that deal to be renegotiated to reflect damage to Yahoo!'s brand. Rumors are that Yahoo! may agree to a $250 million haircut to appease Verizon, but even at that lower price, it's not a given that this deal will be a big win. Adding to Verizon's uncertainty is the fact that it might need to do more deals just to keep pace with AT&T. AT&T bought DirecTV in 2015, and this week, Time Warner shareholders approved AT&T's $85 billion acquisition offer. As competitors push deeper into video, Verizon could have to make its own big splash, and that could be costly. Depending on how costly, that could be enough to send investors to the sidelines.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,02232017,Fool,02162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Stocks extended their rally last week as both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) gained over a full percentage point. The two indexes are up nearly 5% so far for the year. ^DJI data by YCharts. Earnings season is likely to continue to produce big stock swings for the companies involved. And the next five trading days have no shortage of big names posting their results, including Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA),and Gap (NYSE:GPS). The world's biggest retailer announces earnings results before the market opens on Tuesday. Expectations are low, with consensus estimates pegging sales growth of just 1% as earnings fall 13%, to $1.29 per share. Customer traffic figures will be key to watch this week. Wal-Mart has managed seven straight quarters of improvements there, but last quarter, the figure slipped to nearly flat. Since then, rival Target revealed a surprising 1.7% traffic decline over the holiday season, which suggests growth was hard to come by as competition heated up last quarter. Image source: Wal-Mart. Any growth slowdown might be complicated by rising costs, especially in the U.S. business. On the positive side, Wal-Mart is likely to keep showering shareholders with dividends and stock buyback spending that's being funded by surging free cash flow. Tesla shares are up over 50% in the last three months heading into Wednesday's earnings release despite the fact that investors know the electric-car manufacturer won't hit management's delivery forecast. CEO Elon Musk and his team signed over roughly 22,000 vehicles to customers, representing 27% growth year over year compared to the 25,000 that executives were targeting. Management blamed what they called short-term production challenges around the transition to new autopilot hardware that delayed shipping. Image source: Tesla. Investors will be looking for evidence this week that those production challenges are in the past. At the same time, there's less hope Tesla will announce bottom-line profitability this quarter, but gross margin and gross profit per car should continue marching higher. Looking forward, shareholders are eager to learn Musk's thinking on the company's sales targets for the coming year as the mass-market Model 3 comes online. Telsa is hoping to use that car to help bring its annual production up to 500,000 units from about 100,000 automobiles today, and its 2017 forecast will communicate a lot about whether that aggressive goal is realistic. Gap recently revealed encouraging operating details about the fourth-quarter report it will publish on Thursday. Comparable-store sales rose 1% to reverse an 8% dive in the prior-year period. That improvement includes a 5% uptick for the Old Navy brand, flat results for Gap, and a 3% drop for Banana Republic. ""Against a challenging retailer backdrop,"" CEO Art Peck said in early February, ""we're pleased to report growth in our top-line and comp sales during the critical holiday quarter."" This week's announcement will provide important context on those revenue gains, including whether Gap was forced to ramp up its promotions to protect market share from rivals. That's why investors will be focused on the retailer's merchandise margins and any comments management might have on customer traffic trends. Peck and his team will likely discuss Gap's plan to return to growth across the Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy franchises through improved product offerings like the recent Athleta launch. That job will be made harder by a weak retailing environment, though, and so investors might want to brace for a conservative 2017 forecast from management this week. ","
      
    3 Things to Watch in the Stock Market This Week -- The Motley Fool

  "
Rich Duprey,02232017,Fool,02162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently said some 4 million locations, or about 35% of all retail stores in the U.S., accept its Apple Pay mobile payment option. Although there are some notable exceptions among the largest retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Target, who don't offer it, others like Gap do, or soon will feature the payment solution. Because it's available on mobile phones, tablets, and even the Apple Watch, its ubiquity and relative ease of use make it the go-to choice for consumers on the go as well as those dissatisfied with the hassle and delays of embedded chip cards. According to data analytics firm TXN Solutions, which surveyed the transactions from over 3 million payment cards, Apple Pay usage has soared by 50% over the past year. Image source: Apple. Indeed, during Apple's first-quarter earnings conference call with analysts last month, CEO Tim Cook said transaction volume had risen sixfold from the prior year as Apple Pay expanded into four new countries, including Japan, Russia, New Zealand, and Spain. While that would seem to clash somewhat with TXN's more muted (though still significant) rise, it comes down to a difference in what's being measured. While Apple isn't particularly forthcoming on details of the Apple Pay ecosystem, it is talking about the actual number of transactions made, while the data analytics firm is referencing the percentage of transactions from its panel of consumers who provide their credit and debit card data and whose banks distinguish Apple Pay transactions. While that naturally limits the universe of transactions captured, over time it still tracks the acceptance of the mobile payment option and its growth, and what it found was that most people were using it in mobile apps and on websites. That surprising conclusion was reached after finding that of all the places Apple Pay users were using the payment option, getting a cheap hotel room at the last minute topped the list. Ordering takeout was apparently the second favorite way to use the service. Image source: HotelTonight. The TXN data, which examined payments made between December 2015 and December 2016, found mobile travel app HotelTonight, a last-minute reservation service, had 3.4% of all its credit cards transactions made with Apple Pay, followed by food delivery services Caviar, Postmates, and DoorDash, which all had around 2.5% usage rates or slightly higher. What is more notable about the survey results is that despite the broad proliferation of places accepting Apple Pay as an option, it really hasn't caught on among brick-and-mortar retailers, where most places saw it represent less than 1% of all credit card transactions. And ultimately, regardless of where it is used, it isn't creating much of a stir in the payments industry, as it represents just a small percentage of total credit card transactions. At the bottom of the list is Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which came in last on a list of the 13 top places processing Apple Pay transactions, accounting for about 0.5% of the coffee shop's total credit card transactions. Considering Starbucks has its own highly regarded mobile ordering and payment option, which is often looked at as the gold standard for convenience and ease of use, it raises eyebrows that people are using Apple Pay there at all. On its first-quarter earnings conference call with analysts two weeks ago, Starbucks President Kevin Johnson said, ""Mobile Order & Pay had a banner quarter, representing more than 7% of total transactions, double the figure from Q1 last year, and we now have nearly 1,200 stores with 20% or more Mobile Order & Pay transactions at peak, compared to only 13 stores one year ago."" When you have customer loyalty like that, who needs Apple Pay? Image source: Starbucks. Food retailers still represent the lion's share of places seeing Apple Pay usage, and Lowes Foods, Sprouts Farmers Markets, Panera Bread, and Schnucks round out the bottom five places for users of the mobile wallet, with around 0.6% of their credit card transactions accounted for using the payment method. So, if Starbucks and trendy grocery stores were bringing up the rear, who was it that was leading the brick-and-mortar pack? Would you believe Duane Reade, the New York metropolitan area drugstore chain owned by Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA)? According to the TXN data, the pharmacy operator was the top spot where people used Apple Pay, with 1.8% of the credit card transactions identifying the mobile payment option being chosen. That put it slightly ahead of No. 2 retailer Whole Foods Market (Nasdaq: WFM), which had about 1.7% of its credit card transactions using Apple Pay. Because both retailers have been with the service since Apple launched Apple Pay in 2014, it might not be so surprising they were well ahead of the others, including Canteen Vending at No. 3 with slightly less than 1% of its transactions, and fourth place Peet's Coffee with just under 0.8%. Whether that means Apple Pay will ever supplant EMV cards as a preferred payment option remains to be seen, but it seems hard to believe it will replace Starbucks' mobile order and pay app anytime soon. And though Apple Pay users seem to be a rare breed indeed, maybe all you need to see them in action is to simply stop by your local pharmacy.

    You'll Never Guess Where People Use Apple Pay the Most -- The Motley Fool

Anders Bylund,02232017,Fool,02162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been very good to investors so far. The stock has provided a 62% return over the last 52 weeks, 714% in five years, and a hair-raising 4,300% gain in a decade. The good times are not drawing to a close, either. Netflix is the largest and oldest component of my personal investment portfolio, and I would buy the stock today if I didn't already own it. It's a fantastic stock to own for the very long run, and I'm about to tell you why. Here are seven great reasons to buy Netflix stock and never sell. Image source: Netflix. ""It is not the most intellectual of the species that survives; it is not the strongest that survives; but the species that survives is the one that is able best to adapt and adjust to the changing environment in which it finds itself."" The same is true for businesses, especially if you plan to own them for a long time. Being ready to change your business model at the drop of a hat is a hallmark of great long-term investments, and Netflix has this quality in spades. What started as a simple pay-per-rental DVD service with a primitive version of the iconic red mailers soon became a game-changing subscription service instead. From there, Netflix moved on to provide the first serious digital video-streaming business -- included as a freebie with the standard DVD-mailing plans. Now the DVD and streaming services have separated, and Netflix has moved on to co-produce its own premium content. This will not be the last stop on Netflix's ever-changing business model, either. I don't know what's next, but can't wait to find out. When Netflix started that DVD-by-mail subscriptions service, it was a completely novel idea. Blockbuster tried to copy it but failed, destroying its own balance sheet in the process. Retail giant Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) tried too, but ended up just backing out and selling its mail-order subscriber list to Netflix. The streaming service was years ahead of similar plans from Hulu and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Netflix built that market from scratch, starting as a freebie before sufficient broadband speeds were broadly available. Sure, this progressive attitude adds risk to Netflix's business. But those well-planned gambles have played out beautifully so far, and I expect the winning streak to continue. These guys know what they are doing. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. Image source: Netflix. Hastings is running his business like the trained engineer he is, based on high-quality data and a great sense for tomorrow's evolving technologies. Sarandos adds a data-driven human touch to the building of an attractive content portfolio. Netflix makes mistakes. The most obvious example would be the ham-fisted Qwikster introduction in 2011, splitting the streaming service out as a completely separate business and rebranding the DVD service you knew and loved -- and charging a separate fee for each of these plans. That shocker went over like steak sauce on ice cream. Hastings soon killed the Qwikster name, kept both of the separated services under the proper Netflix umbrella, and apologized for the mess he made. The company's subscriber counts and financial figures turned turbulent for a while, before settling back into massive overall growth. Reed Hastings could definitely have handled this episode much better, but the final result was pretty much exactly what he wanted all along. Did you know that the Netflix DVD service now is known as DVD.com, managed through its namesake web address? The whole Qwikster plan has actually worked out, just a couple of years late and under a different name -- and largely out of the media spotlight. The U.S. streaming segment is still adding plenty of new subscribers, to the tune of 4.7 million net new customers in 2016. But the far bigger growth story today is found abroad. There, Netflix added 14 million new subscribers last year while covering nearly the entire globe in streaming services. The two divisions are nearly the same size at the moment, but international subscribers will soon outnumber the domestic customer list. What's more, the overseas growth story has only just begun and will have legs for years to come. Image source: Netflix. At the same time, the global market is only just becoming ready for serious digital video services like Netflix. According to data (link opens PDF) from the International Telecommunication Union, more than half of the world's population is not yet using the internet -- but online access is exploding in places like Africa, Latin America, and underdeveloped parts of Asia. Broadband access is still a rarity in Africa, reaching less than 1% of the continent's population today. Thanks to increased investments in mobile broadband networks, a consortium of African communications ministers hope to have broadband connections for 80% of the population by the year 2020. That's more than 1 billion people becoming potential Netflix users, just a couple of years from now. It's the perfect time for digital businesses to set up shop worldwide, as Netflix did a year ago with Amazon Prime Video following suit a few months later. If you build a great service, the overseas customers will come. Netflix critics often focus on the company's narrow bottom line. Net margins stopped at 2.1% in 2016, a modest increase from 1.8% in 2015. Free cash flows are negative, and will remain so for the next couple of years. Content licenses can be expensive, especially on a global scale. In-house productions are even more costly, at least up front. As a result, Netflix plans to finance its operations mostly via raising new debt for the foreseeable future. For many investors, this lack of capital is a deal-breaker. I would point out that debt is available at historically low interest rates these days, and many companies are selling bonds or taking out term loans for no other reason than to add leverage to their balance sheets at attractive rates. If there was a perfect time to take out some fresh debt, this would be it. Image source: Netflix. You gotta pay money to make money. Here, the cash payoff will come five years from now, or maybe more. Just another reason to hold on to your Netflix shares for a long time -- forever sounds like a good idea.

Same-day store pickup grew by 27% year-over-year, the company said. Wal-Mart reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.30, beating the $1.28 FactSet consensus. Sales totaled $130.9 billion for the quarter, up from $129.7 billion last year but below the $131.1 billion FactSet estimate.

Read also: Why people are delaying filing their taxes this year Wal-Mart has been investing heavily in its e-commerce channel, with acquisitions of outdoor retailer Moosejaw and Shoebuy among the recent purchase announcements. “While margins overall softened slightly year-over-year, we anticipated this given Wal-Mart’s various strategic investments in, among other things, people, price and continued expansion online, and thus were well within our expectations, especially when also factoring in the highly promotional environment that was evident throughout the holiday season,” said Moody’s lead retail analyst Charlie O’Shea in a statement. Buckingham Research expressed concerns over when Wal-Mart’s revenue growth will overcome the challenge of these investments. “We expect Wal-Mart shares to trade slightly higher today on these results but the question that remains unanswered in our minds is when sales growth can overcome investment spending and translate into earnings growth,” analysts wrote. Buckingham Research rates Wal-Mart shares neutral with a $69 price target. Though the investments are seen as a drag, analysts support the move, believing the long-term benefits will be worth it.

Estimize, a software platform that crowdsources estimates from buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers and others, sees EPS of $1.98.

Department stores like Macy’s are using their stores to e-commerce ends, like offering click-and-collect services. But integrating online sales with bricks-and-mortar sales creates inventory challenges. “The complexity of inventory management continues to rise as department stores balance in-stock positions at their locations with increased speed of product delivery for online orders,” said Moody’s in a note published Feb. 9. “Fast fashion and off-price have developed more efficient supply chains with shorter lead times, which results in faster turns and fresher product on its sales floor.” Stifel believe cost-cutting measures and real estate gains are a positive for Macy’s. In addition, the retailer’s brands and exclusive merchandise hit the right fashion trends and quality thresholds at an attractive price, analysts said. However, there are a number of headwinds. “While we believe the sale of selected real estate is the right choice for Macy’s, it is not an accurate indication of the fundamentals of the business,” analysts wrote in a Wednesday note. “With sales declining 3%, we believe the company is challenged to drive traffic and to offer the consumer a compelling shopping experience.” Stifel rates Macy’s shares hold with a $33 price target.

J.P. Morgan rates Macy’s shares neutral with a $28 price target. Cowen & Co. believes Macy’s is taking the right steps to diversify, and the mobile infrastructure from Gilt, Hudson Bay’s luxury off-price e-commerce retailer, could make a Macy’s/Hudson’s Bay combo a good move. “The most significant long-term value creation opportunities likely reside in obtaining incremental vendor scale, greater supply chain scale, and digital capabilities – all of these factors should better serve the consumers,” analysts wrote in a published Feb. 9. See also: For traditional retailers, the ‘Amazon effect’ extends to tech talent and not just sales Still, there are reasons why it wouldn’t work. “We do believe Hudson’s Bay continues to explore M&A opportunities to drive shareholder value and Neiman Marcus likely remains a key idea and opportunity given synergies with Saks, real-estate value, and customer and brand equity; debate likely exists around valuation and how to accomplish a deal at a reasonable price,” analysts said. Cowen rates Macy’s stock market perform with a $44 price target. ",Macy’s earnings: Shifts in retail are hurting major players   - MarketWatch

Boeing said nearly 74% of the votes cast by workers on Wednesday were against union representation. While at the plant Friday Trump will meet Boeing’s CEO and speak at the unveiling of the Dreamliner. Going to Charleston, South Carolina, in order to spend time with Boeing and talk jobs! Look forward to it. GOP health plan directs money to wealthy: House Republican leaders have sketched out a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and the New York Times writes that it looks like the plan would direct federal support away from poorer Americans and toward people who are wealthier. The Times’ example is Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. If he didn’t have a job in Trump’s cabinet and access to government health-care coverage, the Times says, a 64-year-old multimillionaire like him would get the same amount of financial aid as someone his age living in poverty. Plus he would get substantially more money than a poor, young person, says the Times.

                                  said earlier this month that its own widely reported decision to cut Ivanka Trump’s fashion brand from its lineup was also purely a business decision and not based on such protests as the #GrabYourWallet campaign. The company said sales of Ivanka Trump footwear and apparel fell 32% last year. “Each year we cut about 10% and refresh our assortment with about the same amount,” the company told MarketWatch. President Trump tweeted in response: “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!” That commercial decision became a political issue when Trump’s senior adviser Kellyanne Conway during a TV appearance urged viewers to buy Ivanka Trump products. Such a statement potentially violates federal ethics regulations that prohibit federal employees from making endorsements, Republican House Oversight Committee leader Jason Chaffetz said. Conway, appearing remotely for “Fox & Friends,” told viewers they should “go buy Ivanka stuff.” CNN later reported that Conway had apologized to Trump for the remarks. Don’t miss:  Demand surges for George Orwell’s ‘1984’ There has been a drip feed of stories about Trump products being dropped by major retailers. Also this month, Brian Hanover, a spokesman for Sears Holding Corp., which also owns Kmart, told the Reuters news agency, that it was discontinuing 31 Trump Home brand products online. “As part of the company’s initiative to optimize its online product assortment, we constantly refine that assortment to focus on our most profitable items,” he said. “Amid that streamlining effort, 31 Trump Home items were among the items removed online this week.” (Both Hanover and a spokesperson for Trump Home brand did not respond to request for comment.)

                                  are also on a list of retailers named by the online #GrabYourWallet campaign to boycott for carrying Trump family products. “Neiman Marcus has a very small Ivanka Trump precious jewelry business which is [composed] 100% of consigned merchandise,” a Neiman Marcus representative told MarketWatch earlier this month. “Based on productivity, we continuously assess whether our brands are carried in stores, on our website, or both.” Trump’s election as U.S. president also became a flashpoint for celebrities who backed out of his inauguration — and some companies, including L.L. Bean — particularly on social media. “It is due to the proliferation, speed and reach of social media that we perceive the resistance economy as a growing phenomenon in 2017,” Ryann Reynolds-McIlnay, assistant professor of merchandising management at Oregon State University, told MarketWatch. But she also said that, as with the recent jump in sales of Ivanka Trump’s perfume, this politically driven #GrabYourWallet campaigning can cut both ways.

Peter Morici,02232017,MarketWatch,02162017,"Published: Feb 17, 2017 12:45 p.m. ET Growth is too slow to bring higher wages, but costs for everything are rising fast By Buffeted by slow growth and too few decent paying jobs, Americans now have to deal with more inflation. In January, consumer prices rose 0.6%. Although that was driven by a surge in energy prices not likely to repeat, core inflation — prices less food and energy — has been greater than the Fed’s target of 2% for the last year. Yet, economic growth is not likely to accelerate enough to support wages that rise as fast as prices going forward. Donald Trump’s promised tax cuts and reforms, infrastructure and deregulation initiatives are likely to face a host of obstacles. Those include congressional Republican opposition to further increasing the budget deficit, opposition from adversely affected parties like Wal-Mart

                                    and other retailers regarding border tax adjustments, and legal challenges to executive orders — for example, easing labor market and financial regulations. The Federal Reserve will be faced with an uncomfortable choice — raise rates too quickly to combat inflation or continue printing more money in hopes of further supporting economic growth. Here are four things to know about higher inflation. 1. More Money Won’t Boost Growth Much of what caused the financial crisis and slow growth has not been fixed. Big banks are still too big to fail and without a structural solution — namely breaking up the largest institutions and reinstating Glass-Steagall — deregulation or simply lax enforcement of existing rules by former Wall Street executives, who made fortunes making deals and trading, poses new risks. Subsidized Chinese products are still flooding U.S. markets, destroying good-paying manufacturing jobs, and Trump is backing off his campaign promise to directly challenge Chinese protectionism. Similarly, oil prices

                                   are up enough to soon increase U.S. shale production to 2015 levels — drilling activity has risen significantly since May. However, Trump will face considerable political opposition and years of legal challenges if he tries to boost drilling activity in the Gulf and elsewhere offshore. That will leave the United States dependent on imported oil, and send consumer dollars abroad instead of creating jobs here. Absent fixes for those problems — and promised tax cuts — the Fed going slow on interest-rate increases will enable more inflation but won’t do much to boost growth. 2. Easy Money and High Inflation Steals from the Elderly Easy money pushes down rates on CDs where many retired Americans park savings to supplement Social Security and pensions. Even with the Federal Reserve pushing up the fed funds rate 0.5 to 0.75 percentage points this year, the rush of foreign capital into U.S. markets will likely keep long rates low, as it did when Ben Bernanke pushed up short rates in 2004-2006. Hence short-term CDs will pay a bit more than in recent years but rates on 5- and 10-year deposits are not likely to increase much — none will likely rise enough to compensate for higher inflation. 3. Federal Policies Make Too Much Inflation Certain Many households have only one practical source for high-speed Internet and cable TV, but the government does not regulate cable companies as it does electric utilities. Rates have risen rapidly in recent years. Health-care inflation is not likely to abate whether Obamacare stays in place, or the Republican Party successfully replaces it with other forms of subsidies to purchase insurance. Top private universities and a few elite public institutions have a lock on most good-paying jobs for graduates. Those schools have boosted tuition far more rapidly than even health-care costs. That sets the pace for other schools, and the Trump team is not likely to intervene in their monopoly pricing. Federal policies permit prescription-drug manufacturers to charge much higher prices than in Europe but don’t permit consumers to legally import drugs and force competition. Here we may see some presidential leadership for reform but progress will be slow. 4. A Higher Minimum Wage Will Only Make Matters Worse When President Barack Obama proposed a $10.10 minimum wage in 2014, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that would destroy about 500,000 jobs. Now absent any change in the federal wage floor, many states have gone into business for themselves — some mandating even more aggressive pay increases. Some restaurants and other labor-intensive establishments will shutter, but most will find better ways to use smart machines and save labor. Although those holding minimum-wage jobs will earn more, all those extra unemployed workers will push down wages of workers earning near the minimum. Floor managers at fast-food restaurants will have fewer people to supervise but end up accepting barely above new minimum wages to work. ",Why inflation threatens the middle class - MarketWatch

The bulls aim to keep fighting off the bears, and upbeat chart watcher Ari Wald has a few talking points that might help them.

The first one is tied to the so-called fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index

                                   . The VIX’s persistently low level is being cited as a reason to embrace a cautious market stance, writes Wald. But “bull markets are typically characterized by low VIX,” and “forward returns are usually higher when VIX is low,” he argues in response, offering the chart below. Bears are also warning that market breadth has narrowed, Wald says. That means fewer individual stocks are heading higher. Breadth is slightly lower, but that’s due to investors selling defensive stocks, Wald says. And most important, small-cap stocks are performing OK and not yet signaling the party is over. The third pushback stems from sentiment surveys showing high levels of investor optimism. The Oppenheimer analyst says the signs of cheeriness are his “biggest tactical trading concern.” But he also questions whether sentiment is as frothy as selected surveys suggest, noting history shows high optimism isn’t a problem until breadth really deteriorates.

,03022017,Reuters,02232017,"She also rejected shareholder claims that Wal-Mex and Wal-Mart were liable for Vega’s and Rank’s activity, and that Wal-Mex misled shareholders by saying it operated legally and ethically during the alleged bribery scheme. Lawyers for lead plaintiff Michael Fogel did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit is one of several targeting Wal-Mart after The New York Times in April 2012 reported that the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer bribed Mexican officials for years to speed up store openings. Wal-Mart’s market value fell about $17 billion over three days after that report was issued. The Times’ reporter later won a Pulitzer Prize for the report. Last September, a federal judge in Fayetteville, Arkansas said holders of Wal-Mart’s U.S.-listed shares, represented by a different law firm, may pursue their claims in a class action, potentially boosting their recovery. A federal appeals court later rejected Wal-Mart’s immediate appeal of that decision, without ruling on the merits. In the ADR case, Failla rejected as speculative a claim that Vega, who also chaired the Wal-Mex board’s audit committee, and Rank were put on notice of the alleged bribery because a senior Wal-Mex audit executive “reported” to them. Failla said it was at least equally likely that Vega in particular might not have known because his relationship with the audit executive “was attenuated, or because an employee is likely to hide his wrongdoing from his supervisor.” In her 45-page decision, Failla also said statements by Wal-Mex in several annual reports that it complied with Mexican law and tried to follow “corporate best practices” amounted to “inactionable, immaterial puffery.” Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove in an email said “we appreciate the court’s careful consideration of the issues and dismissing these claims,” and that it “wouldn’t be appropriate” to discuss how it might affect other lawsuits. The case is Fogel v Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB de CV et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-02282. ","

,03022017,Reuters,02232017,"Cincinnati-based Kroger said, excluding fuel, sales from stores open for at least a year fell 0.7 percent, widely missing analysts’ average estimate of a 0.1 percent rise, according to Consensus Metrix. Kroger blamed the decline on deflation. This was Kroger’s first quarterly same-store sales drop since the first quarter of 2003, raising concerns it is losing customers to rivals. Price competition in the industry has been increasing, with Wal-Mart reportedly running a new price-comparison test to knock out competition from German discount grocery chain Aldi Inc [ALDIEI.UL] and Kroger. Kroger has become more promotional and aggressive on some pricing as sales were softer, CEO Rodney McMullen told analysts on a call. “There is no doubt several competitors are improving and running better stores ... it’s much broader than just Walmart,” he added. Kroger, whose chains include Ralphs and Fred Meyer, forecast full-year earnings of $2.21-$2.25 per share, the midpoint of which meets analysts’ average estimate of $2.23, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We are disappointed in the comparable number and are starting to wonder how Kroger will get anywhere near its long-term outlook for 8-11 percent earnings per share growth in today’s environment,” Goldman added. The No. 1 U.S. supermarket chain said it expects full-year same-store sales excluding fuel to either remain flat or rise as much as 1 percent, short of the 1.2 percent rise analysts had estimated. Kroger’s shares, which had already taken a 4 percent hit this week after news of Wal-Mart and Target’s pricing strategies, were down 3.2 percent at $31.01 in morning trading. The company earned 53 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 28, beating the average analyst estimate by one cent. Net sales rose 5.5 percent to $27.61 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $27.31 billion. ","

 ,03022017,Reuters,02232017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday spoke positively about a border adjustment tax being pushed by Republicans in Congress as a way to boost exports, but he did not specifically endorse the proposal. Trump, who has lashed out at U.S. companies for moving operations and jobs to countries such as Mexico, had previously sent mixed signals on the proposal at the heart of a sweeping Republican plan to overhaul the tax code. “It could lead to a lot more jobs in the United States,” Trump told Reuters in an interview, using his most approving language to date on the proposal. Trump sent conflicting signals about his position on the border adjustment tax in separate media interviews in January, saying in one interview that it was “too complicated” and in another that it was still on the table. The proposal has divided American businesses. Critics say the planned 20 percent tax on imports could be passed along in higher prices to consumers, including manufacturers that rely on imported goods to make their products. Some critics have warned of a potential global trade war which would sharply curtail U.S. and world economic growth. Advocates say U.S. exporters will gain as their revenues will be excluded from federal taxes. They say the tax on imports will encourage domestic production and cause the already strong dollar to rise, offsetting upward pressure on import prices. Trump has also called for a 35-percent border tax on U.S. companies that move jobs abroad and import products back into the U.S. market. It has been unclear in the past if those references referred to the border adjustment proposal. “I certainly support a form of tax on the border,” he told Reuters on Thursday. “What is going to happen is companies are going to come back here, they’re going to build their factories and they’re going to create a lot of jobs and there’s no tax.” White House spokesman Sean Spicer also came to the defense of border adjustment on Thursday, disputing the claim that it could lead to higher consumer prices. “That benefits our economy, it helps American workers, it grows the manufacturing base,” Spicer told reporters at a White House briefing. The Mexican peso MXN= weakened slightly against the U.S. dollar immediately after Trump's comments and was last trading at 19.68 per dollar. Earlier on Thursday, the Mexican currency hit its strongest level since Trump's Nov. 8 election victory. Earlier on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC the Trump administration aimed to formulate a tax plan with support from the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Senate and pass it before August. Lawmakers and corporate lobbyists say the border adjustment tax could die in Congress, potentially jeopardizing the prospects for tax reform, mainly because of opposition from a handful of Senate Republicans. But experts say Trump’s endorsement could change the political climate. “If Trump supports it, that makes it considerably more likely,” Harvard Business School professor Mihir Desai told Reuters. Trump’s comments were followed by dueling statements from lobbying groups. A statement from the pro-border adjustment American Made Coalition said the White House was “sending its strongest signals yet that it’s leaning toward supporting the House blueprint with border adjustability.” The Americans for Affordable Products coalition that opposes the border adjustment tax issued a statement saying Trump’s remarks were “consistent with what he’s already said” and that it was “impossible” to know if they were specific to any individual legislative policy. Trump spoke to Reuters after meeting with more than 20 chief executives of major U.S. companies to discuss ways to return manufacturing jobs to the United States, one of the linchpins of his 2016 presidential campaign. A border adjustment has emerged as the most controversial segment of the House Republican tax reform blueprint. Under the House plan, it would raise more than $1 trillion in revenues to help pay for a corporate tax cut. ","

 ,03022017,Reuters,02232017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major U.S. corporations are going to war in Washington over a Republican ‘border adjustment’ tax proposal meant to boost  exports over imports, with lawmakers in Congress coming under pressure from some of the nation’s biggest employers. The political split that is opening, most pronounced in the narrowly divided Senate, could doom the proposal. If it dies, prospects for a thorough tax code reform, a top 2017 goal for President Donald Trump’s Republicans, would be diminished. Trump, who has vowed to produce a “phenomenal” tax reform package, without recently offering many specifics, has not taken a clear stand on border adjustment. He spoke favorably about it in a Reuters interview on Thursday. The main thrust of border adjustment is to exempt companies from having to pay federal income tax on export revenues, while ending the deductibility of import costs from taxable income. Border adjustment is a core part of a broad tax reform “blueprint” being pushed by House of Representatives Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and tax panel chairman Kevin Brady. The blueprint has not been put into formal legislation, but border adjustment is already a sticking point. If the Republican-dominated House approves the blueprint and moves it to the 100-seat Senate, Republicans could lose only a handful of votes and still be able to pass the blueprint. “If it came up today, I couldn’t support it,” Arkansas Republican Senator John Boozman told Reuters. “That’s not to say I couldn’t (support it) in the future with modifications.” Boozman said he was concerned that border adjustment would raise prices for consumer goods such as cars and gasoline. He said he worried that Arkansas farmers could be hurt, too, if border adjustment triggered a global trade war. Boozman’s state is home to Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer. Wal-Mart and its employees have been among Boozman’s biggest backers in 2011-2016, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog. Wal-Mart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs, on a conference call with reporters a week ago, said, “The things that are being discussed about the border adjustment tax pose a concern.” Republican Senator Tom Cotton, Boozman’s Arkansas colleague, has also expressed concerns on border adjustment. “He supports the goals of tax reform and job growth. But he believes that a new tax on working-class Americans is not the best way to achieve those goals,” said Cotton spokeswoman Caroline Rabbitt. Perhaps border adjustment’s most outspoken Senate critic is  Georgia Republican David Perdue. He has called the House proposal “a bad idea” and urged colleagues not to support it. One of Perdue’s top backers in 2013-2016, according to data from the center on its website, has been the Club for Growth, a conservative group that donates large sums to like-minded politicians. Club for Growth opposes border adjustment. Border adjustment has attracted opposition not only from retailers, but also from oil refiners and automakers. Texas Republican John Cornyn, a senior senator whose constituents include oil and gas firms, as well as companies that do business with Mexico, told Reuters: “If you’re talking about disrupting business models that people have come to depend on, there’s a lot in play and a lot at stake.” Chief executives of 16 big companies sent a letter this month to lawmakers urging tax reform including border adjustment. In it, the CEOs said border adjustment would make U.S.-manufactured products more competitive abroad and at home. Since Trump’s Reuters interview last week, the White House has sent mixed signals on border adjustment. Trump is scheduled to make a major speech to Congress on Tuesday. “We would be surprised if Trump specifically mentions (border adjustment) on Tuesday night,” said Chris Krueger, analyst at financial firm Cowen & Co. in a research report. The proposal “is a 15-round heavyweight fight and we are only in the 3rd round ... It can all end with a single uppercut from Trump in opposition, though that does not seem to be the direction the White House is headed,” Krueger said. ","

(WMT) is looking to lure more grocery shoppers from competitors like Kroger Co. (KR) and Aldi with a new price-comparison test that it is undertaking in no less than 1,200 U.S. stores. (See also: Two Wal-Mart Numbers are Working Against Each Other.) Reuters, citing sources familiar with Wal-Mart’s moves, reported that the big box retailer began the price test in 11 states across the Midwest and the Southeastern regions. Florida, Iowa and Illinois are reportedly among the states where the test is being performed. The pricing test is already reflecting in Illinois and Iowa. Reuters carried out a price comparison on a group of grocery products and found Wal-Mart’s prices to be consistently lower than the prices at Aldi. Source: Reuters Wal-Mart announced during an October 2015 investor conference that it would invest over a $1 billion on strategic pricing over a multi-year period. The latest price-comparison test appears to be one of the pricing investments the retailer has been making. During the most recent earnings call, Wal-Mart Chief Financial Officer Brett Briggs noted that the company’s gross margin dipped by 8 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016, saying the company’s pricing investment strategy offset gains from lower logistics cost and merchandise procurement. It’s therefore likely that the newest move to lower grocery prices will further bear weight on the retailer’s gross margin. The impact of the price-slashing initiatives could be significant, since groceries, which are the focus this time, account for roughly 56 percent WMT’s top-line. Wal-Mart has reportedly asked suppliers to lower the amount they charge the grocer by 15 percent. WMT is also looking to build on the recent merchandise procurement and logistics gains by asking its vendors to ship orders punctually and in full in a bid to lower delivery expenses and avoid having items out of stock. Overall, it appears that WMT is executing its price investment strategy effectively. Despite slashing prices, its gross margin has increased by roughly 3.38 percent in the last three years. This is an improvement on the 0.81 percent dip in gross margin over the preceding three-year period. ",Wal-Mart Wants Luring Shoppers From Kroger and Aldi (WMT) | Investopedia
Craig Adeyanju,03022017,Investopedia,02232017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Shares of Target Corp (TGT) are plummeting today, Feb. 28, following disappointing fourth quarter earnings results. The retailer also issued earnings guidance that is below consensus analyst estimates. (See also: Some Retailers Want to End Border Tax.) Target reported that it generated adjusted EPS of $1.45 on revenue of $20.69 billion in the fourth quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, revenue dipped by 4.3 percent, while EPS dipped by 37.6 percent. In addition, the fourth quarter was the sixth consecutive quarter of revenue slump at TGT. Analysts had estimated an EPS of $1.51 on a revenue of $20.7 billion. Same store sales dropped by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, worse than the 1.3 percent decline that analysts polled by Consensus Metrix were expecting. Target said it expects EPS for its first quarter to clock in between 80 cents and one dollar. Analysts had forecasted an EPS of $1.33 for the first quarter. For full-year 2017, TGT guided that EPS would fall between $3.80 and $4.20, compared to consensus analyst estimate of $5.06. Target also said it would not issue specific guidance after this year, citing uncertainties around its business as the reason for the decision. Slow-moving inventory is one of the reasons Target’s forecasts are disappointing. The company said it plans to give up about $1 billion on its margins, as it cuts prices to improve its e-commerce business, which rose by 34 percent during the fourth quarter. The retailer also said the majority of its stores will be fulfilling online orders by 2019. To this end, TGT said it will open about 100 additional small-format stores. Oliver Chen at Cowen wrote that Target’s struggles stems from competition in two phases – Walmart’s low prices at brick-and-mortar stores and Amazon’s e-commerce dominance. In the brick-and-mortar retail space, “Wal-Mart’s price investment strategies are likely helping yield superior traffic versus Target,” Chen noted. However, on a more positive note, Target’s 29.7 percent gross margin in 2016 is better than Wal-Mart’s 2016 gross margin of 25.65%. This leaves some room for price competition.

Krystina Gustafson,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"Wal-Mart's latest digital upgrades could deliver a one-two punch to its biggest competitors. Next month, the world's largest retailer will begin rolling out two features to its mobile app that take aim at Target and Amazon's weaknesses. The first allows customers to refill and manage their prescriptions from their mobile devices and skip the line when they reach the pharmacy counter. The enhancement comes amid traffic declines in Target's pharmacy department, following its sale of that unit to CVS in December 2015. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart will eliminate the physical paper trail now required of shoppers using its money transferring services, as well as the line at these desks. Combined with the retailer's pharmacy rollout, these two capabilities key into one of Wal-Mart's biggest strengths versus Amazon: its massive store network. The upgrades come less than one year after the retailer completed the nationwide rollout of its in-app payment system, Walmart Pay. ""We're leaning into a behavior and habit that began with Walmart Pay, and it was all centered around how to improve the overall experience at checkout,"" Daniel Eckert, senior vice president of Walmart Services, told reporters Monday. ""This is just going to add on to that overall experience."" As online sales continue to grab a larger chunk of consumer spending, Wal-Mart has been looking for ways to integrate its digital offerings with its massive store fleet. They include the continued rollout of Wal-Mart's online grocery business, which lets shoppers order food online and have it loaded into their cars at a nearby store. But with its latest announcement, Wal-Mart is targeting two high-traffic parts of the business known to generate repeat visits. One-fifth of the retailer's shoppers conduct a financial transaction while they're in a store, while pharmacy and over-the-counter sales represent 10 percent of the company's domestic revenue. During the fiscal fourth quarter, an increase in prescriptions helped lift Wal-Mart's health and wellness sales by a mid-single-digit percentage. At Target, which reported disappointing fiscal fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, trouble getting shoppers to switch their prescriptions over to CVS has been one culprit behind its recent traffic declines. Though the bull's-eye retailer said in November that it expects ""significant improvement"" in this part of the business in fiscal year 2017, questions remain. CVS, whose app already enables digital refills, said that month that it expects to lose more than 40 million prescriptions to Walgreens after it signed partnerships with pharmacy benefits managers that exclude CVS from their networks. Target said Tuesday it will invest its own cash to ensure it is ""clearly and competitively priced every day."" As for Wal-Mart, its new initiatives are the latest in its efforts to make shopping at its stores faster and simpler. While the average customer waits in its money services line for 11 minutes, it can take up to 70 minutes on a pay day, Eckert said. Wal-Mart has also started testing a Scan & Go technology that allows customers to scan items from their mobile devices as they add them to their cart. They then click a button to process their payment, and have an employee check their receipt as they exit the store. While it is so far only in three Wal-Mart stores, this technology has already been rolled out across Sam's Club's fleet. Shortening the time spent at checkout became an even bigger focal point lastyear, after Amazon said it would test a convenience store that eliminates the process. ""Our customers continue to tell us that the need to save time has become just as important as the need to save money,"" Eckert said. Wal-Mart expects its pharmacy and money services functionalities to be rolled out across the chain by fall. ",Wal-Mart's latest technology play takes aim at both Target and Amazon

THE INVESTMENTS WE'RE GOING TO MAKE, BOTH FROM AN OPERATING MARGIN STANDPOINT BUT IMPORTANTLY FROM A CAPITAL STANDPOINT TO REPOSITION THE COMPANY FOR THE FUTURE. SO, WE THINK WE'VE GOT THE RIGHT PLAN IN PLACE. IN FACT, WE KNOW WE HAVE THE RIGHT PLAN IN PLACE. WE'LL BE INVESTING IN REIMAGINING OUR STORES, REMODELING HUNDREDS OF STORES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE'VE SEEN GREAT RESPONSE TO THESE SMALL FORMAT STORES WE'VE OPENED UP. YOU'LL SEE US ACCELERATE THAT GOING FORWARD. TRANSFORMING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN TO MEET THE NEEDS OF TODAY'S BUSINESS MODEL. WE'LL BE LAUNCHING NEW BRANDS AND CONTINUING TO MAKE VERY IMPORTANT DIGITAL INVESTMENTS. WE THINK TODAYS WAS A VERY IMPORTANT DAY TO SET THE TONE FOR WHERE WE'RE GOING IN THE FUTURE AND POSITION THE COMPANY FOR FUTURE GROWTH AND MARKET SHARE GAINS. REAGAN: SO, TODAY YOU DEFINITELY RESET THE GUIDANCE NUMBERS. BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY NEW INVESTMENTS. THEY'RE INVESTMENTS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT AND INITIATIVES YOU'VE BEEN DOING FOR SEVERAL YEARS. I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY YOU THINK IT WILL WORK GOING FORWARD IF IT HASN'T WORKED SO FAR. CORNELL: WELL, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT HAS BEEN WORKING. WE'VE BEEN VERY DISCIPLINED ABOUT TESTING AND VALIDATING. NOW WE'RE READY TO ROLL OUT. WE HAVE TO INCREASE ONE THING. THAT'S SPEED. SO WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS TESTING A NEW STORE DESIGN, REMODELING STORES IN LOS ANGELES. WE CALL IT LA 25. WE'RE TAKING A LEARNING FROM THAT, MAKING MINOR ADJUSTMENTS AND NOW YOU'LL SEE US REMODEL HUNDREDS OF STORES OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. WE WERE VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT ENTERING NEW MARKETS, NEW NEIGHBORHOODS WITH SMALLER FORMATS, TAKING A LEARNING FROM TRIBECCA, BOSTON AND CHICAGO, YOU'LL SEE US DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF THOSE STORES NEXT YEAR AND WE SEE A PATH TO CONTINUED GROWTH GOING FORWARD. WE'VE BEEN REWORKING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN SYSTEM. YOU'LL SEE US ADVANCE THAT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. WE HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL NEW BRAND LAUNCH THIS YEAR, TWO BIG BRANDS PILLOWFORT AND CAT AND JACK. THEY'RE ON THE PATH TO BEING BILLION DOLLAR BRANDS. WE TALKED TODAY ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'LL HAVE OVER A DOZEN NEW BRANDS WE'LL ROLL OUT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. AND WE'VE HAD TWO OR THREE REALLY SOLID YEARS OF DIGITAL PERFORMANCE. WE FINISHED THE FOURTH QUARTER, WE WERE UP 34%. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, WE'VE MORE THAN DOUBLED OUR DIGITAL FOOTPRINT. WE'RE GOING TO ACCELERATE GOING FORWARD. TO DO THAT, WE HAD TO MAKE INVESTMENTS, BOTH IN OPERATING MARGIN AND IN CAPITAL. BUT THEY'RE THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS FOR THE BUSINESS, FOR THE BRAND AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS GOING FORWARD. AND TODAY WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE FACT WE'RE READY TO GO A LOT FASTER. REAGAN: I'M STILL JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT HOW IT'S DIFFERENT GOING FORWARD, THOUGH. YOUR COMP SALES TREND HAS BEEN DECLINING ABOUT THE LAST NINE QUARTERS IF YOU LOOK AT THAT TREND. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU'RE INVESTING THIS YOUR STORES, IN ONLINE. BUT YOU'VE BEEN DOING THAT AND IT'S NOT WORKING YET. SO, WHAT IS DIFFERENT? CORNELL: WELL, WE'LL BE DOING IT AT SCALE. THIS LAST YEAR, WE REMODELED 25 STORES. WE HAVE 1800. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, WE'LL TAKE THAT LEARNING TO OVER 600 AS WE REIMAGINE THESE STORES, WE KNOW HOW THE GUEST REACTS. IT DRIVES MORE TRAFFIC. IT BRINGS OUR GUESTS BACK MORE OFTEN, BUILDS GREATER ENGAGEMENT. WE HAVE TO DO THAT TO SCALE. IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME. NEXT YEAR WE'LL REMODEL OVER 100 STORES BUT IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS WE'LL TOUCH OVER 600 STORES. WE'VE HAD A HANDFUL OF THESE SMALL FORMAT STORES WE OPENED UP ARE DELIVERING GREAT PRODUCTIVITY, TWO OR THREE TIMES PRODUCTIVITY WE SEE IN A TRADITIONAL STORE. WE'LL DOUBLE THAT NEXT YEAR AND OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS YOU'LL SEE HUNDREDS NEW LOCATIONS. WE'RE STRENGTHENING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN SO WE TAKE COSTS OUT AND BUILD MORE SPEED. WE'VE BEEN TESTING THAT VERY CAREFULLY AND NOW WE'LL START TO ROLL IT OUT AT SCALE. WE'LL POPULATE OUR BUSINESS WITH MORE PROPRIETARY BRANDS. ALL THESE THINGS COME TOGETHER. WHAT WE ALSO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS EMBRACING THE NEW REALITY OF RETAIL. WE HAVE TO EMBRACE DIGITAL, RECOGNIZE HOW CONSUMERS ARE SHOPPING AND MAKE THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS TO BUILD MARKET SHARE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, TO MAKE SURE TARGET IS ONE OF THE FUTURE WINNERS OF RETAIL. REAGAN: YOU'RE NOT CLOSING STORES AT ALL. IN FACT, YOU'RE OPENING 100 NEW SMALL FORMAT STORES OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, AND REMODELING 600 LIKE YOU JUST SAID. IF YOU ALREADY LOST SHOPPERS AND THESE STORES ARE LOSING PRODUCTIVITY, AT WHAT POINT DO YOU SAY WE HAVE TO CLOSE STORES? THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR US FINANCIALLY. WHEN DO YOU GET TO THAT POINT? CORNELL: WE LOOK AT OUR STORE BASE ALL THE TIME. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, WE HAVE CLOSED STORES, WEE CLOSED DOZENS OF STORES EACH YEAR. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, A COUPLE HUNDRED STORES OVER THE LAST DECADE. BUT WE'RE FORTUNATE. WE'RE NOT MALL BASED. THEY'RE IN GREAT LOCATIONS. WE'RE NOT ATTACHED TO DYING SHOPPING MALLS. WE'RE IN GREAT LOCATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. NOW, WE'VE GOT TO BRING THOSE STORES TO LIFE DIFFERENTLY. WE KNOW SOME OF OUR STORES HAVE GOTTEN TIRED, THEY'VE GOTTEN OLD. I'VE GOT STORES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN REMODELLED IN OVER A DECADE. WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND BRING THE BEST OF TARGET TO THOSE STORES. WHEN WE DO THAT, THE GUEST RESPONDS, IT BRINGS TRAFFIC BACK AND DELIVERS THE EXPERIENCE HAD AN TODAY'S GUEST EXPECTS FROM TARGET. REAGAN: THIS IS A LOT OF WHAT WALMART DID A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, CLEANED UP THEIR STORES, IMPROVED THEIR IN STOCKS, INVESTED IN DIGITAL. KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE YOUR PLAN. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE IT WORK FOR YOU? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET BACK SHOPPERS AND SALES THAT YOU'VE LOST AS THEY'VE GROWN SHARE AND YOU'VE FALLEN? CORNELL: WE'RE LOOKING TO CREATE A SMART NETWORK OF STORES WHERE OUR STORES, OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, DIGITAL CAPABILITIES REALLY ALLOW THE GUEST TO CONNECT WITH TARGET ANY WAY THEY WANT. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE PROVIDE A GREAT IN-STORE EXPERIENCE AND CONTINUE TO ELEVATE OUR STYLE BRANDS BUT ALSO DELIVER THE VALUE OUR GUEST IS LOOKING FOR. WE HAVE TO MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO SHOP ONLINE. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE TAKE ALL THE FRICTION AWAY AND MAKE IT EASY AND RELIABLE. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE, IF YOU WANT TO ORDER ONLINE, YOU CAN PICK UP AT ONE OF OUR STORES. WE TO HAVE BRING ALL THOSE ELEMENTS TOGETHER. WE'VE GOT LOTS OF WORK TO DO. WHAT WE TALKED TO THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY ABOUT TODAY IS THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BUT A THREE-YEAR PLAN WE PUT IN PLACE. THIS FIRST YEAR IS ABOUT INVESTMENT. WE HAVE TO MATURE AND TRANSITION THESE INITIATIVES BUT ULTIMATELY WE'LL RETURN TO A POINT OF STABILITY AND GROWTH. AND WE THINK WITH THE DISRUPTION IN RETAIL TODAY, THERE'S SIGNIFICANT MARKET SHARE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE CLOSING STORES, AS YOU MENTIONED. AND AS THEY CLOSE, WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ONE OF THE FUTURE WINNERS. TO PICK UP MARKET SHARE BOTH IN STORE AND ONLINE. REAGAN: PART OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO TO PICK UP MARKET SHARE IS DROP YOUR PRICES, LOWER YOUR PRICES, BE MORE PRICE COMPETITIVE. TO DO THAT, YOU'RE WILLING TO PULL BACK ON THOSE MARGINS. WHAT HAPPENS, THOUGH, IF THE BORDER ADJUSTMENT TAX COMES THROUGH? DO YOU HAVE TO ABANDON YOUR PRICING PLAN ALL TOGETHER? CORNELL: LET'S TALK PRICING FIRST AND THEN I'LL TALK ABOUT BORDER ADJUSTMENT. WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY IS GOING BACK TO OUR TRADITIONAL PRICING MODEL AND COMING OUT OF THE DATA BREACH, WE BECAME VERY PROMOTIONAL. YOU'LL SEE US GO BACK TO OUR TRADITIONAL, EVERYDAY LOW PRICE MODEL AND MAKING SURE WE DELIVER GREAT VALUE ACROSS THE STORE. BUT STARTING WITH HOUSEHOLD ESSENTIALS, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD AND BEVERAGE BUSINESS. WE'RE REALLY GOING BACK TO WHERE WE HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST, A MODEL THAT'S WORKED FOR US BEFORE. NOW CERTAINLY YOU KNOW I'M SPENDING A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT THE NEW PLAN THAT THE HOUSE HAS PROPOSED FOR CORPORATE TAX REFORM, THE IMPACT OF THE BORDER ADJUSTABILITY COMPONENT. WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT VERY CAREFULLY. I THINK WE'VE HAD GREAT MEETINGS IN WASHINGTON, INCLUDING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE. I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THE CURRENT BORDER ADJUSTABILITY PLAN COULD HAVE A REALLY DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON AMERICAN FAMILY. REAGAN: THEY UNDERSTAND IT. ARE THEY WILLING TO DO IT? WHERE DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP STAND? CORNELL: WE'VE HAD SOME GREAT MEETINGS AND I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE PRICES GO UP 15, 20, 25% FOR FAMILIES BUYING CLOTHING FOR THEIR KIDS, SCHOOL SUPPLIES, BASIC STAPLES. THEY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF RETAIL. TARGET PAYS 35% EFFECTIVE TAXES TODAY. IF THIS WERE TO GO FORWARD, OUR TAX RATE WOULD GO OVER 75%. AND SO THEY UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO END UP IN A MUCH BETTER PLACE. REAGAN: WHAT DOES HAPPEN FOR TARGET? TARGET SPECIFICALLY, WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR PROFIT? WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PRICES THAT CONSUMERS PAY IF BORDER ADJUSTABILITY GOES THROUGH? CORNELL: I TALKED ABOUT IT. WE MODELED -- THIS IS ACROSS THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY, NOT JUST TARGET. AS THIS PLAN IS STRUCTURED, WE COULD SEE CONSUMER PRICES GO UP 20 OR 25%. THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR ANYONE IN AMERICA AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT GOOD FOR FAMILIES THAT SHOP OUR STORES. THOSE 30 MILLION GUESTS IN TARGET EVERY WEEK. SO WE'VE BEEN OUT THERE IN WASHINGTON REALLY ON BEHALF OF THE FAMILIES AND THE TARGET GUESTS WE SERVED AND MAKING SURE THEY DON'T SEE HIGHER PRICES, BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW AS PRICES RISE WE'LL SEE FURTHER CONTRACTION IN RETAIL. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR AMERICA, FOR FAMILIES AND WE'VE HAD GREAT CONVERSATIONS TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS PLAN. REAGAN: THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN RETAIL RIGHT NOW, BOTH WITH TARGET AS WELL AS THE BROADER INDUSTRY. THERE IS A LOT YOU HAVE TO JUGGLE. DOES THE BOARD STILL SUPPORT YOU AND YOUR INITIATIVES? CORNELL: THE BOARD HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE. OBVIOUSLY, WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH THE BOARD PRIOR TO TODAY. I CAN TELL YOU UNIVERSALLY, THEY SUPPORT THE PLAN. BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT'S THE RIGHT THING LONG TERM FOR THE COMPANY. IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR THE BRAND AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS. SO, WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY IS BUILDING THE TARGET OF THE FUTURE. AND OUR BOARD IS NOT THINKING ABOUT NEXT QUARTER. THEY'RE REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW WE MAKE SURE TEN YEARS FROM NOW WE'RE ONE OF THE FUTURE RETAIL WINNERS. SO A LOT OF TIME IN THE BOARD ROOM. A LOT OF TIME SITTING DOWN, SETTING PRIORITIES, MAKING SURE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S REQUIRED TO GO FORWARD, BUT TREMENDOUS SUPPORT. REAGAN: SO HOW LONG HAS THE BOARD GIVEN YOUR FOR-YEAR PLAN YOU? SAID IT'S A LONG GAME NOT A SHORT GAME BUT CERTAINLY IT'S NOT FOREVER. CORNELL: IT'S A THREE-YEAR INITIATIVE. IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME. THIS IS YEAR ONE. WE'VE GOT TO INVEST. WE'LL SEE THESE INITIATIVES MATURE OVER TIME. THREE YEARS FROM NOW, I HOPE TO BE SITTING HERE, TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE RETURNED A GROWTH, WE'RE A MARKETSHARE WINNER, BOTH PHYSICALLY AND DIGITALLY. REAGAN: YOU DON'T WANT TO BECOME ONE OF THOSE DISTRESSED RETAILERS ON THE LIST? YOU DON'T WANT TONIGHT ONE OF THOSE HEADLINES? CORNELL: WE WILL NOT BE ON THAT LIST. WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY IS MAKING SURE WE MOVE INTO THAT RETAIL WINNER'S CIRCLE. REAGAN: THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRIAN CORNELL. BACK OVER TO YOU ALL IN ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS.

Alex Rosenberg,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"Long-term investors ought to use the recent market rally to cut back on their equity holdings, according to Yale professor of economics Robert Shiller. The S&P 500 forward price-earnings ratio, a common measure of market valuations that compares the index's current price to analysts' consensus expectation for earnings over the next year, is now at the highest level since 2004, according to information from S&P Global. The cyclically adjusted price-earnings (or CAPE) ratio developed by Shiller shows even greater overvaluation; that metric, which compares current prices to average earnings over the past 10 years adjusted for inflation, is more elevated than it's been since 2002. The CAPE ratio, which aims to measure earnings over the course of an entire business cycle, is ""high enough to worry about,"" Shiller said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""At this level, it suggests that the expected returns for stocks might be negative, but only slightly so."" Shiller is quick to add that since short-term moves are nigh impossible to forecast, the metric ""is not suggesting, necessarily, any imminent disaster.""Still, the current level of the CAPE ratio ""would suggest reducing your holdings of stocks, especially for a long-term investor. We can't time the market accurately, but we know that when it's this high, over the long term, it usually doesn't do great.""In 2013, Shiller shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Eugene Fama and Lars Hansen for ""[laying] the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices."" Shiller's work, including on the CAPE ratio, was specifically noted to have ""identified a variety of variables that forecast future stock returns.""Despite the mainstream acclaim, the CAPE ratio has been the subject of widespread dispute and even controversy. Many have noted that the CAPE ratio does not integrate the level of bond yields, which are traditionally viewed as a key determinant of proper equity values. Of course, yields remain historically low, which could mean that stock prices deserve to be a bit higher as compared to earnings than would normally be appropriate.A bit more esoterically, Wharton professor of finance Jeremy Siegel has pointed out that accounting standards have not remained consistent over time. Siegel argues that since companies now report profits more conservatively than they used to, recent earnings numbers are depressed, and valuation levels unnaturally elevated. For his own part, Shiller grants that ""the CAPE ratio has been relatively high for 20 years now, so you might imagine that something has changed,"" but added, ""on the other hand, maybe not — it's been a fairly reliable indicator.""""My general thought is that I think it's quite reasonable to have an investment in U.S. stocks as part of a diversified portfolio,"" Shiller said Thursday. ""Just don't go overboard on it."" Shiller is quick to add that since short-term moves are nigh impossible to forecast, the metric ""is not suggesting, necessarily, any imminent disaster.""

Bill George,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"President Donald Trump's actions are sending shock waves through the business community, but will CEOs have the courage to challenge him? Publicly, most CEOs are declaring how pleased they are with the President's attention, which has been greater in the past three months from President Trump than it was in eight years under President Obama. Trump is promising them lower corporate taxes, fewer regulations on financial services, health care and energy, and improved infrastructure, while acknowledging business as the driver of economic growth. Every week the President is meeting with CEOs from major industries. Last week it was retailers; before that, airlines and automobiles. Beneath these rosy promises, Trump's policies are setting off alarm bells in C-suites. Even before his inauguration, he shook business leaders with a series of tweets attacking such great American stalwarts as Ford, General Motors, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and United Technologies, criticizing their global manufacturing plans, while threatening them with large tariffs for imported products. Ford and United Technologies' Carrier division immediately offered compromises to avoid Trump's wrath. Concerned their companies might be the next recipient of a Trump tweet, the CEOs of Amazon, Fiat/Chrysler, and Sprint rushed to Trump Tower with offers to employ more Americans. In reality, they were just re-announcing previously published expansion plans. CEO Brian Krzanich told the President that Intel was restarting a $7 billion facility in Arizona, which was originally launched in 2011 under President Obama, and then postponed in 2014 due to lack of demand. In a recent interview with  Harvard Business Review, former U.S. treasury secretary Larry Summers called on business leaders to stand up to the Trump administration, asking, ""If CEOs who employ hundreds of thousands of people are not in a position to speak truth to power, who is going to do so?"" Rather than trying to curry favor with President Trump, business leaders need to advocate for their long-term needs, and challenge him when his actions will harm their long-term futures. Since his January 20th inauguration, President Trump has signed more than 20 executive actions on issues including jobs, trade, immigration, national security, health care, and financial regulations. Most controversial to date was the 120-day travel ban, a move the State of Washington challenged as unconstitutional. The Washington court temporarily lifted the ban, which the Trump administration challenged in the Court of Appeals. This represented a seminal challenge to technology companies that rely heavily on immigrants. With more than 5.5 million jobs going unfilled for lack of qualified applicants, they cannot afford to hire only American-born citizens. Thus, 97 technology companies including Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, eBay, and Intel, stepped up by taking the unprecedented step of filing a  joint amicus brief challenging the order, claiming it ""threatens companies' ability to attract talent, business, and investment to the United States."" They were joined by Coca-Cola, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Starbucks – more than 140 companies in all – marking the first time CEOs had actively challenged Trump. On February 8, the President had his most significant defeat when the Court of Appeals refused to reinstate the travel ban. In addition to the travel ban, Trump's actions are shaking up leaders in other sectors. His proposed border adjustment tax on imports would adversely impact major apparel and electronics retailers like Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Nike, and Under Armour that rely on overseas production. A 20 percent border tax would lead to a 20 percent price increase for consumers, creating more strain on their wallets and threatening the jobs of 15 million retail employees. Trump's egregious tweet against Nordstrom accused the company of treating his daughter Ivanka unfairly for discontinuing her branded products. Tweet Nordstrom defended its decision, citing declining sales of Ivanka's products. Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank tried to curry Trump's favor, calling him ""a great asset to America."" He was forced to recant when Steph Curry, his firm's top sponsored athlete, responded he would agree if Plank removed the letters ""et"" from his praise. Plank acknowledged the border tax would hurt his firm's sales since ""there are no apparel makers or textile companies left in America."" Trump's numerous executive orders are easy to issue but often vague or unclear about details, making their implementation complex and confusing. As Trump tries to repeal Obamacare, he is learning how hard it is to design a reasonable replacement. The same is true for reducing financial regulations by gutting the 2010 Dodd-Frank bill, since no one wants to risk a 2008-style collapse. Given the chaos in Washington, how should business executives lead in the Trump era? Will they have the courage to step up to these new challenges? My advice is to stay focused on their business, while not letting the president's machinations throw them off course and speaking out whenever required. Here are five recommendations for business leaders: Business leaders have a responsibility to step up to the challenges presented by Trump's administration and lend their voices to shape a better country. By building their businesses for the long-term, they will strengthen the economy and the nation. ",CEOs need courage to lead in the Trump era—commentary
Giovanny Moreano,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"The sharp drop in natural gas prices this month could present a buying opportunity around those stocks that have been hit the hardest by the plunge, if history is any guide. Over the past month, natural gas prices dropped more than 15 percent on expectations of warmer weather throughout the United States, which could lower demand for the commodity. Given the magnitude of the pullback, however, history shows natural gas prices could be due for a rebound in the days ahead as bottom-fishing investors step in to buy. Using the quantitative tool Kensho, CNBC PRO searched for periods in the past decade when natural gas prices were down at least 15 percent in a month. We then looked at the performance of natural gas companies two weeks after a similar drop in natural gas prices. For our screen, we used the components of the First Trust Natural Gas ETF, an exchange-traded fund that aims to replicate the returns of the ISE-Revere Natural Gas Index, a benchmark comprised of companies involved in natural gas production and exploration. The results from our study show there have been 32 instances when natural gas prices fell at least 15 percent in a month. Two weeks after similar drops, the First Trust Natural Gas ETF was up 69 percent of the time two weeks out, posting an average gain of 3.2 percent, according to Kensho. Among individual names, Anadarko Petroleum, Concho Resources and Range Resources each saw their shares rise at least 4.5 percent on average two weeks out, data from Kensho shows.

Tom Buerkle,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"Bridgewater boss Ray Dalio's penchant for radical transparency and truthfulness may now be shortchanging his investors. He has long maintained that the culture at his $160 billion hedge fund is not for everyone. That discomfort now seems to persist at the very top: for the second time within a year the billionaire investor is overhauling who runs the firm. In some respects, they have had fair warning. Dalio has been characteristically open about his desire to relinquish management duties. He started the process seven years ago, trying out various executives and experimenting with anywhere from one to three chief executives at a time. Now he's stepping down and ditching co-CEO Jon Rubinstein as well. The former Apple and Hewlett-Packard executive had been recruited with much fanfare, but lasted just 10 months before finding out that he didn't fit in.

 ,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"WHEN: Today, Thursday, February 23rd WHERE: CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Following is the unofficial transcript of a FIRST ON CNBC interview with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and CNBC's Becky Quick on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" (M-F, 6AM-9AM ET) today, Thursday, February 23rd live from the Treasury Department in Washington, D.C. Following is a link to the full interview on CNBC.com: http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000595630. All references must be sourced to CNBC. BECKY QUICK: I WANT TO THANK THE TREASURY SECRETARY FOR TAKING THIS TIME TO SIT DOWN WITH US. STEVEN MNUCHIN IS THE NEW TREASURY SECRETARY THE 77THTREASURY SECRETARY. THIS IS YOUR FIRST SIT-DOWN TELEVISION INTERVIEW SINCE TAKING OVER IN THAT SPOT MR SECRETARY. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US AND INVITING US INTO THE BUILDING. STEVEN MNUCHIN: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. QUICK: AS JOE MENTIONED, THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU. THERE'S BEEN HUGE DEBATE ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES. ONE THING I'D LIKE TO CLEAR UP FIRST AND FOREMOST IS HOW YOU PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME. I'VE HEARD IT PRONOUNCED 15 DIFFERENT WAYS BY PEOPLE WHO SWEAR THEY KNOW YOUR FAMILY. MNUCHIN? MNUCHIN: I'LL GO WITH MNUCHIN. PERFECT. QUICK: JUST FOR THE RECORD SO WE CLEAR IT UP AND GET IT RIGHT ON OUR AIR. MNUCHIN: AND STEVEN. NOT STEVE. QUICK: STEVEN MNUCHIN SO EVERYONE KNOW IT SINCE WE HAVE BUTCHERED IT A FEW TIMES THROUGH HERE. SIR, I THINK THE THING THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO THE MARKETS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH TAX REFORM. YESTERDAY PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID WE COULD EXPECT TO SEE A PLAN MAYBE THE BEGINNING TO MIDDLE OF MARCH. HE SAID IT'S VERY WELL FINALIZED AT THIS POINT. I JUST WONDER, DOES IT RESEMBLE THE HOUSE PLAN? WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE PLAN AT THIS POINT? MNUCHIN: LET ME FIRST SAY THAT OUR ECONOMIC AGENDA, THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IS GROWTH AND THE FIRST, MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WILL IMPACT GROWTH IS A TAX PLAN. SO WE ARE COMMITTED TO PASS TAX REFORM. IT WILL BE VERY SIGNIFICANT. IT'S GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON MIDDLE INCOME TAX CUTS, SIMPLIFICATION, AND MAKING THE BUSINESS TAX COMPETITIVE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH HAS BEEN A BIG PROBLEM AND A LOT OF REASONS WHY COMPANIES ARE LEAVING AND CASH IS SITTING OFFSHORE. SO THAT'S REALLY OUR FOCUS. WE WANT TO GET THIS DONE BY THE AUGUST RECESS. WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, AND WE'RE WORKING ON A COMBINED PLAN. QUICK: LET'S BREAK DOWN SOME OF THE SPECIFICS YOU JUST MENTIONED. GROWTH BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU THINK WE CAN GET BACK TO 3% GDP, MAYBE BETTER THAN THAT. HOW DO WE DO THAT? MNUCHIN: I THINK IT'S VERY ACHIEVABLE. IF YOU LOOK AT LONG-TERM GROWTH, WE HAVE UNDERPERFORMED WHERE WE NEED TO BE. WE BELIEVE WE CAN BE COMPETITIVE AND GET BACK TO SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AT 3% OR MORE. THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WILL IMPACT IT. I THINK THE FIRST ISSUE, AS I MENTIONED, IS GOING TO BE TAX REFORM. I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE IS GOING TO BE REGULATORY RELIEF. WE NEED TO CUT BACK REGULATIONS THAT HAVE PREVENTED SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES FROM BEING THE ENGINE OF GROWTH IN THIS COUNTRY. WE'RE ALSO FOCUSED, AS YOU KNOW, ON DODD-FRANK AND LOOKING AT DODD-FRANK AND MAKING SURE BANKS CAN LEND. THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF LIQUIDITY OUT THERE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BANKS PUT IT TO WORK. QUICK: IF WE STICK TO YOUR TIME FRAME AND WE SEE SOMETHING PASSED BEFORE THE AUGUST RECESS, DO YOU THINK -- WE'VE ALREADY SEEN REGULATORY REFORM START. DO YOU THINK WE'D SEE 3% PLUS GDP BY NEXT YEAR? MNUCHIN: I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO GET THERE. SO I THINK IT WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, MORE TOWARDS THE END -- SEEING THE GROWTH TOWARDS THE END OF NEXT YEAR. I THINK BY THE TIME WE PASS TAX REFORM, YOU SEE THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY, YOU SEE THE IMPACT OF REGULATION, IT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO TAKE INTO NEXT YEAR TO SEE AN ENGINE OF GROWTH. QUICK: OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THIS, THE FED AND THE CDO, AND THEIR GROWTH PROJECTIONS ARE CLOSER TO 1.8%. WHAT ARE THEY MISSING? THEY DON'T SEE ANY OF THIS? MNUCHIN: I DON'T THINK THEY'RE MISSING ANYTHING. I THINK THEY'RE MAKING THOSE PROJECTIONS BASED ON THE STATUS QUO. THAT'S WHERE THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN. IT'S BEEN ACTUALLY LOWER THAN THAT UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AND I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC CHANGES. WE HAVE AN UNBELIEVABLE ECONOMIC TEAM. MYSELF, GARY COHN. I SPEAK TO GARY MANY TIMES A DAY. WE WERE WITH MICK MULVANEY YESTERDAY ON THE BUDGET AT OMB. WE HAVE WILBUR ROSS IN COMMERCE. WE HAVE A GREAT ECONOMIC TEAM, AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT FORTH POLICIES THAT ARE GOING TO REALLY CREATE GROWTH IN THIS COUNTRY. QUICK: LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW YOU GET A PLAN THROUGH CONGRESS BECAUSE THE HOUSE HAS ITS PLAN THAT PAUL RYAN HAS SHEPHERDED THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE UNDERSTAND VERY WELL. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS -- I CAN NAME AT LEAST SIX WHO HAVE SAID THE IDEA OF A BORDER ADJUSTMENT TAX IS SOMETHING THAT IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL, THAT THEY WILL NOT SUPPORT. THAT MAKES UP A HUGE PORTION, A TRILLION DOLLARS IN INCOME. FIRST OF ALL, DO YOU AGREE WITH THE BORDER ADJUSTMENT TAX AS SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED IN TAX REFORM? MNUCHIN: WELL, LET ME JUST SAY, I THINK THERE'S A CONSENSUS ON THE MAJORITY OF WHERE WE ARE ON TAX REFORM. WE'RE LOOKING CLOSELY AT THE ISSUES ON THE BORDER ADJUSTED TAX. I SPOKEN EXTENSIVELY WITH PAUL RYAN AND WITH CHAIRMAN BRADY ON THIS. WE'RE LOOKING AT IT. WE THINK THERE'S SOME INTERESTING ASPECTS OF IT. WE THINK THERE'S SOME CONCERNS ABOUT IT. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS, YOU KNOW, WE ARE ALL COMMITTED TO DO IS MAKE SURE THERE IS A COMBINED PLAN THAT'S A PLAN THAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING TOGETHER ON ONE PLAN THAT GETS PASSED. I THINK EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PAGE AND DOING THAT. QUICK: BUSINESS COMMUNITY OBVIOUSLY IS LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT A LOT OF THESE ISSUES. YOU HAVE MAJOR EXPORTERS LIKE A BOEING OR A GENERAL ELECTRIC WHO ARE ADAMANT WE SEE SOME SORT OF BORDER ADJUSTMENT. IF NOT THAT SORT OF TAX, BUT SOME OTHER WAY OF MAKING THE ADJUSTMENT. AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS ARE AT A HUGE DISADVANTAGE. WE'RE THE ONLY ONE OF 35 OECD COUNTRIES THAT DON'T DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IF YOU HEAR FROM THE BIG RETAILERS, SOMEBODY LIKE A WALMART OR TARGET, THEY SAY IT WOULD WIPE OUT THEIR PROFITS POTENTIALLY AND WOULD END UP BENG A TAX ON CONSUMERS. WHICH ONE OF THOSE CAMPS DO YOU HAVE YOUR OWN CONCERNS COMING IN MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH? MNUCHIN: ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE REACHING OUT TO BUSINESS. NOT JUST BIG BUSINESS, BUT SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES, AND WE'RE LISTENING TO WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THIS MORNING THE PRESIDENT IS HOSTING A GROUP. WE HAVE ABOUT 30 EXECUTIVES FROM VARIOUS MANUFACTURERS. I'LL BE GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND PARTICIPATING IN THAT. THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY HOSTED THE RETAIL GROUPS. SO WE'RE LISTENING. WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS. WE UNDERSTAND WHERE PEOPLE ARE, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PLAN THAT ADDRESSES THESE CONCERNS. QUICK: IS IT FAIR TO SAY IT'S STILL A LITTLE TOO EARLY TO TELL ON THESE DETAILS THAT HAS TO BE WORKED OUT? MNUCHIN: I WOULD SAY IT'S A LITTLE TOO EARLY TO ANNOUNCE. WE'RE WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES VERY CAREFULLY. WE'RE RUNNING A LOT OF NUMBERS. WE'RE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT A LOT OF ISSUES. AS I SAID, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WE'RE COMMITTED TO GET THIS PASSED BY AUGUST. QUICK: DOES THIS PLAN NEED TO BE REVENUE NEUTRAL? MNUCHIN: WELL, I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT REVENUE NEUTRAL, THERE'S GOING TO BE THE SCORING THAT THE JOINT COMMITTEE USES, THEN THERE'S OUR OWN INTERNAL VIEWS AT TREASURY AND THE ADMINISTRATION. MY GUESS IS THAT OUR GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS WILL BE HIGHER THAN WHAT THEY USE TO SCORE THE PLAN. AGAIN, THESE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT. WE'RE RUNNING A LOT OF NUMBERS. I THINK YOU'VE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT WE BELIEVE IN DYNAMIC, NOT STATIC, SCORING. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND I'LL TELL YOU, MY FIRST WEEK IN TREASURY, I HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE RESOURCES IN THIS BUILDING. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY AN INCREDIBLE HISTORY HERE, BUT THERE ARE JUST UNBELIEVABLE RESOURCES. THE STAFF IS SO TALENTED. THEY'RE SO FOCUSED ON DOING THINGS. WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE TAX GROUP AND MODELING AREA. THEY'RE WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK ON RUNNING SCENARIOS FOR US. QUICK: IT'S A FAIR POINT. IF YOU'RE USING DYNAMIC SCORING, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY IF GROWTH IS COMING IN FASTER THAN EXPECTED, THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE ALL THE DIFFERENT NUMBERS. IT ALWAYS GETS BACK TO THE QUESTION OF WHO GETS TO BE THE ARBITER OF THAT, WHO'S CALLING THE SHOTS, WHO'S MAKING THOSE DECISION. JUST TO BE CLEAR, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU'LL HAVE YOUR OWN INTERNAL SCORING OF ALL OF THIS. IT WON'T NECESSARILY BE SOMETHING THAT MATCHES UP WITH CBO OR ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS. MNUCHIN: WELL, AGAIN, THERE MAY BE DIFFERENCES IN GROWTH PROJECTIONS. I THINK YOU'VE SEEN THAT IN THE PAST. I THINK AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE GROWTH PROJECTIONS BASED UPON OUR PLAN THAT WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO CREATE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF GROWTH AND THAT'S GOING TO CREATE JOBS, CREATE TAX REVENUES. THAT'S GOING TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY. SO WE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE DOING A LOT OF WORK. AS I SAID, THIS IS MY NUMBER ONE AGENDA ITEM. THE PRESIDENT IS VERY FOCUSED ON THIS. THE LEADERSHIP IS VERY FOCUSED ON THIS, AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS DONE. QUICK: YOU MENTIONED YOU'RE MAKING SURE THIS IS GOING TO BRING TAX BREAKS TO MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS. WHEN YOU SAT DOWN WITH US ON ""SQUAWK BOX"" BACK IN NOVEMBER, YOU SAID EVEN IF WEALTHIER PEOPLE GET A TAX BREAK, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT THEY NECESSARILY ARE PAYING LESS IN TAXES BECAUSE THE DEDUCTIONS, THE LOOPHOLES WOULD BE CLOSED AS A RESULT. DO YOU STAND BY THAT NOW THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND IN YOUR POSITION AS TREASURY SECRETARY? MNUCHIN: THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COMMENTS ON THAT. I ACTUALLY THINK THERE'S A RULE. I THINK DURING MY CONFIRMATION, IT GOT NAMED THE MNUCHIN RULE. I WAS VERY KEEN ON THAT. THERE'S A VOLCKER RULE AND A MNUCHIN RULE AND A BUFFETT RULE. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE GOOD COMPANY. AS I'VE SAID BEFORE, WE'RE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON A MIDDLE INCOME TAX CUT AND SIMPLIFICATION FOR BUSINESS. WHAT WE ARE FOCUSED IS THAT ON THE HIGH END, IF THERE ARE TAX CUTS, THAT THEY ARE OFFSET WITH REDUCTION OF DEDUCTIONS AND OTHER THINGS. SO IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO CAREFULLY LOOK AT. WHEN WE COME OUT WITH THE PLAN, WE'LL COME OBVIOUSLY OUT WITH THE DISTRIBUTION AND HOW IT IMPACTS PEOPLE AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON. QUICK: IS THAT -- THE MNUCHIN RULE IS NOT SET IN STONE AT THIS POINT, IT'S DEBATABLE? MNUCHIN: WELL, AGAIN, WE HAVEN'T FINALIZED THE PLAN, BUT OUR OBJECTIVE AND WHAT I SAID BEFORE STILL STANDS. YOU KNOW, KIND OF THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS WHEN WE RUN THE NUMBERS. THE OBJECTIVE IS THIS IS A MIDDLE INCOME TAX CUT AND THIS IS TAX SIMPLIFICATION AND THIS IS MAKING BUSINESSES MORE COMPETITIVE. QUICK: THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE TIMING WOULD BE ON THIS. DO YOU EXPECT THAT THE TAX REFORMS WOULD BE RETROACTIVE TO TAKE PLACE IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, OR DO YOU EXPECT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LOOK FOR NEXT YEAR AT THE EARLIEST? MNUCHIN: AGAIN, I CAN'T COMMENT ON THE SPECIFICS OF WHEN WE ROLL THIS OUT. OBVIOUSLY THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE'LL BE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. REGARDLESS OF WHEN THEY GO IN PLACE, THIS WON'T REALLY IMPACT THE ECONOMY UNTIL NEXT YEAR WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SEE CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR. AND IT WILL TAKE A COUPLE YEARS TO GET GROWTH. BUT WE'RE COMMITTED IN THIS ADMINISTRATION, AND YOU CAN SEE THIS IN THE MARKETS. YOU CAN SEE THE STOCK MARKET IS UP, THE DOLLAR IS UP. THERE'S A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND IN THE DESIRE TO INVEST IN THE U.S. THIS IS A VERY COMPETITIVE PLACE TO DO BUSINESS. WE GOT GREAT COMPANIES. YOU SEE THAT REFLECTED IN THE MARKETS. QUICK: OBVIOUSLY THE STOCK MARKET HAS RALLIED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK OFFICE. ACTUALLY, SINCE THE ELECTION, AND AGAIN SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE. DO YOU VIEW THAT AS A REPORT CARD? MNUCHIN: ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY. THIS IS A MARKET TO MARKET BUSINESS AND YOU SEE WHAT THE MARKET THINKS. QUICK: IF THE MARKET WERE TO PULLBACK IS THAT JUST DISAPPOINTMENT AND THINGS NOT GETTING DONE AS THE MARKET HAD ANTICIPATED -- YOU'VE WATCHED THE MARKETS FOR A LONG TIME. DO YOU EXPECT A PULLBACK AT SOME POINT WHEN YOU SEE THINGS MOVE SO FAR, SO QUICKLY? MNUCHIN: I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FOCUSED IN THE MARKETS ON NOT DAY TRADING AND WHERE THEY ARE DAY TO DAY. WHETHER THE MARKET GOES UP OR DOWN ON ANY GIVEN DAY, YOU KNOW, I'VE GIVEN UP FIGURING OUT WHY THAT IS. QUICK: SMART MAN. MNUCHIN: BUT DO I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR -- WE'RE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE'S VERY ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE U.S. I THINK THAT'S REFLECTIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOALS AND WHAT THE MARKET THINKS OF IT. QUICK: YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU EXPECT INTEREST RATES TO REMAIN RELATIVELY LOW FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME, BUT WHEN WE GET TO THIS GROWTH YOU'RE EXPECTING OF 3% OR BETTER, HOW QUICKLY DO YOU THINK INTEREST RATES WILL HAVE TO ADJUST TO CATCH UP WITH THAT TO REFLECT A STRONG ECONOMY? MNUCHIN: WELL, LET ME SAY THIS IS REALLY MORE THE FED'S ROLE AND NOT MY ROLE. I DO LOOK FORWARD ON STARTING MY WEEKLY MEETINGS WITH JANET YELLEN AT THE FED. I LOOK FORWARD TO SPENDING TIME WITH HER. I WOULD COMMENT AGAIN, WE'RE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE'RE AT HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES. I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THIS ON A HISTORICAL BASIS, WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE LOW INTEREST RATES FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WITHIN THAT THERE'S NOT THE CONTEXT THAT INTEREST RATES CAN GO UP AND YOU'VE SEEN THE FED SIGNAL THAT. AGAIN, I'M NOT GOING TO SPECULATE ON WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. MY COMMENTS ARE REALLY ABOUT WHERE WE ARE NOT RELATIVE TO JUST TODAY BUT WHERE WE ARE RELATIVE TO WHERE INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. QUICK: THERE WERE SOME MARKET SPECULATION YESTERDAY THAT YOU MIGHT TODAY ANNOUNCE PLANS FOR A LONGER TERM TREASURY BOND, A 50-YEAR AND 100-YEAR BOND BECAUSE OF JUST THAT, INTEREST RATES BEING LOW RIGHT NOW. HAVE YOU GIVEN THAT SERIOUS THOUGHT, AND IS THAT SOMETHING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE? MNUCHIN: I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE. WE'RE IN THE GOING TO MAKE A FORMAL -- WE'RE NOT READY TO MAKE ANY FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT ON WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A 50-YEAR OR 100-YEAR. I HAVE SAID THIS BEFORE. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD SERIOUSLY LOOK AT. I'VE ALREADY BEGUN TO TALK TO THE STAFF ABOUT LOOKING AT THAT. AGAIN, WE'LL REACH OUT TO THE MARKET, INVESTORS, DIFFERENT PEOPLE, BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE OF WHETHER WE SHOULD EXPLORE, WHETHER WE CAN RAISE 50 OR 100-YEAR MONEY AT A VERY SLIGHT PREMIUM. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE FOR TREASURY TO LOOK AT. QUICK: IT DOES. YESTERDAY YOU CONTACTED CHRISTINE LAGARDE AT THE IMF AND HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH HER ABOUT MAKING SURE THE IMF IS POLICING THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE POLICIES OF ITS MEMBERS. IS THAT A WAY OF TRYING TO MONITOR CHINA AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE TREATING THINGS FAIRLY WITHOUT OFFICIALLY CALLING THEM CURRENCY MANIPULATORS? MNUCHIN: LET ME FIRST SAY I HAD A TERRIFIC CONVERSATION WITH HER. I THINK I'VE SPOKEN TO PROBABLY ABOUT 12 FOREIGN LEADERS AT THIS POINT. FINANCE MINISTERS AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNMENTS. I THINK I HAVE THE REST OF MY CALLS SCHEDULED FOR NEXT WEEK. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING TO THE G20 AND BADEN-BADEN IN MARCH. SO I THINK ONE OF THE IMPORTANT JOBS IN THIS ROLE IS TO MAKE SURE I REACH OUT TO MY COUNTERPARTS AND THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON CREATING OBJECTIVES THAT WILL CREATE ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR US AND SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS. CURRENCIES ARE ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOK AT, AND THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF MY COUNTERPARTS ABOUT. QUICK: IS IT FAIR TO SAY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE NAMING CHINA A CURRENCY MANIPULATOR ANY TIME SOON? MNUCHIN: AGAIN, WHAT'S FAIR TO SAY IS, FIRST OF ALL, I'VE HAD A TERRIFIC CONVERSATION WITH MY COUNTERPARTS THERE. I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING THEM. WE HAVE A PROCESS WITHIN TREASURY WHERE WE GO THROUGH AND LOOK AT CURRENCY MANIPULATION ACROSS THE BOARD. WE'LL GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS. WE'LL DO THAT AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST. WE'RE NOT MAKING ANY JUDGMENTS UNTIL WE CONTINUE THAT PROCESS. QUICK: DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THE EXIM BANK, THE EXPORT/IMPORT BANK? IT'S SOMETHING THAT BIG EXPORTERS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE HOPED TO SEE SOME SUPPORT FOR. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON IT. MNUCHIN: I'VE TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT ABOUT IT. IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW, IT'S OBVIOUSLY STALLED AT THE MOMENT. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS HISTORICALLY ABOUT THE XM BANK AND IS IT JUST SUBSIDIZING CERTAIN LARGE CORPORATIONS. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'RE INTERESTED IN DOING. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT, AND TO THE EXTENT WE THINK T EXPORT/I EXPORT/IMPORT BANK CAN BE COMPETITIVE IN HELPING SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES EXPORT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN MAKE LOANS UP TO $10 MILLION. THEY'RE DOING THAT, DOING PLENTY OF THEM. I ALREADY HAVE A TEAM LOOKING AT WHAT THE IMPACT IS ON THE ECONOMY IF WE EXPANDED THAT. QUICK: FANNIE AND FREDDIE. IT'S BEEN A HUGE ISSUE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SWIRLING AROUND. IT'S HARD TO SAY EXACTLY WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION STANDS ON IT, BUT YOU HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO HOUSING FINANCE REFORM. CAN YOU TELL US HOW YOU COME DOWN ON THAT AND WHAT SORT OF TIME FRAME WE SHOULD EXPECT. MNUCHIN: SURE. SO I MEAN, I'D SAY SOMETHING I'VE ALREADY STARTED WORKING ON. I MET WITH MEL WATT THIS WEEK WE HAD A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION. I MET WITH JEB HENSARLING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT VARIOUS DIFFERENT ISSUES. AS I I'VE SAID BEFORE, I'M COMMITTED THAT UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION WE'RE GOING TO HAVE HOUSING REFORM SO THAT WE DON'T JUST LEAVE THESE ENTITIES THE WAY THEY ARE. THEY'VE BEEN SITTING THERE FOR TOO LONG OF A PERIOD OF TIME. WE NEED A SOLUTION. WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS. I THINK THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT SHARE THE VIEW THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH THEM. THERE ARE DIFFERENT VIEWS. AS I SAID, YOU KNOW, I'VE ALREADY REACHED OUT TO PEOPLE. WE HAVE A TEAM INTERNALLY THAT WE'VE ALREADY ASSIGNED. SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO STUDY CAREFULLY. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING RIGHT AWAY FROM US, WHEREAS TAX REFORM IS A NEAR-TERM ISSUE, BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY ON THE AGENDA. WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO DO HERE. THERE'S HOUSING REFORM, THERE'S CYBERSECURITY. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON TECHNOLOGY. IT'S A BIG PRIORITY FOR ME TO MAKE SURE WHETHER IT'S THE IRS THAT WE PROTECT PEOPLE'S RECORDS. WE GOT TO UPDATE THE SYSTEMS AT THE IRS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BANKING INFRASTRUCTURE IS SAFE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS ON MY TO-DO LIST. QUICK: OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE A HUGE TO-DO LIST, A VERY BUSY DAY. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. BEFORE WE LET YOU GO, HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING ON YOUR SIGNATURE? MNUCHIN: I HAVE INDEED. MY SIGNATURE WAS GREAT BEFORE BECAUSE NOBODY COULD EVER COPY IT. QUICK: IT WAS A LOT OF LOOPS. MNUCHIN: I WAS ACTUALLY AT A DINNER, AND EVERYBODY AT THE DINNER LIKE SIGNED THE MENU AND PASSED IT AROUND. SOMEONE SAID TO ME, WHOSE SIGNATURE IS THIS? I REALIZED IT WAS MINE THAT NOBODY COULD READ. SO MY KIDS AND OTHERS HAVE ENCOURAGED ME TO HAVE A NEW SIGNATURE. I'VE BEEN PRACTICING IT SO IT'LL BE NICE AND NEAT ON THE MONEY. QUICK: CAN YOU SHOW US? I HAVE A SHARPIE HERE. MNUCHIN: I CAN. QUICK: HERE YOU GO. MNUCHIN: THIS IS A LITTLE DANGEROUS. I DON'T WANT YOU COPYING IT. QUICK: NO, NO. MNUCHIN: I'LL GIVE YOU -- THIS IS MY OLD SIGNATURE. AND THIS IS MY NEW SIGNATURE. QUICK: MUCH IMPROVED. LET ME JUST SHOW THE CAMERA THIS. MNUCHIN: VERY DIFFERENT. QUICK: THAT IS A MUCH IMPROVED SIGNATURE. WELL, MR. MNUCHIN, I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. TRULY APPRECIATE YOUR BEING WITH US. OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE A LOT OF NEWS TO GET TO. WE'LL LET YOU GET TO WORK. MNUCHIN: THANK YOU FOR COMING TO VISIT. I HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN HERE SOON.

",First on CNBC: CNBC Transcript: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin Sits Down with CNBC’s Becky Quick on “Squawk Box” Today
Tae Kim,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"Investors should buy Sarepta Therapeutics shares because its sales this year will come in above the biotech company's guidance, according to Leerink Partners, which upgraded the firm to outperform from market perform.The FDA granted accelerated approval for Sarepta's Exondys eteplirsen treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy last September. The company's shares are up 114 percent in the past 12 months.""We are upgrading SRPT … now that the stock appears to have fully consolidated and reflects reasonable expectations for the Exondys launch, following management's new revenue guidance ... which looks highly conservative to us,"" analyst Joseph Schwartz wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. ","This hot biotech stock will surge more than 50 percent this year, Leerink analyst says"
CNBC.com staff,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"The White House shared the following prepared remarks for President Donald Trump's first address before Congress: TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms. Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice –- in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding -- 250 years since the day we declared our Independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children? I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future. For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit -- and so many other places throughout our land. We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross -- and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And we've spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds -– families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns. But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus -- as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake – and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first ... because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve. Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people. It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises. Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs. The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government. We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential Federal workers. We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials –- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job‑crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners. We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines -- thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs -- and I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel. We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. With the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation. We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth -- and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. We want all Americans to succeed –- but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders. For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime. As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised. To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders? Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism. According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home -– from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center. We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world. It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe -- and to keep out those who would do us harm. As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS -- a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet. I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court -- from my list of 20 judges -- who will defend our Constitution. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination. Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined. We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars. And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters. Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes -- but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing. I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House. At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it's good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me -- without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. They weren't even asking for change. But I am. I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE. The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the ""abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people."" Lincoln was right -- and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore. I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others –- have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families –- including immigrant families –- enter the middle class. I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws. If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program –- the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country –- twice. And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate. To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States -- financed through both public and private capital –- creating millions of new jobs. This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American, and Hire American. Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare. Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State -- it is unsustainable and collapsing. One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges –- leaving many Americans with no choice at all. Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been broken. Obamacare is collapsing –- and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice –- it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans: First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts –- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government. Thirdly, we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out. Fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance – and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately. Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines –- creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care. Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more –- so why not join forces to finally get it done? On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people. My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future. An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old -- and a sophomore at Notre Dame. Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need. If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. In fact, our children will grow up in a Nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind –- and the souls –- of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time. I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them. Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone –- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society. Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job. But to create this future, we must work with –- not against -– the men and women of law enforcement. We must build bridges of cooperation and trust –- not drive the wedge of disunity and division. Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters – and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. The office is called VOICE –- Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback. But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine. Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands –- Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis –- were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna: I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you. To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica: I want you to know –- we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory. Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and –- if they must –- to fight and to win. I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this Nation –- and now we must deliver for them. The challenges we face as a Nation are great. But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform. We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William ""Ryan"" Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero –- battling against terrorism and securing our Nation. I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, ""Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies."" Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom –- we will never forget him. To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe. We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism. But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific –- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost. We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations. Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people –- and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past –- we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding. America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free. On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year. Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear -- schools where children learn in peace -- and jobs where Americans prosper and grow -- are not too much to ask. When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same flag. And we are all made by the same God. And when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts. The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls. And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action. From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears –- inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past –- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and -- Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America. Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States. THE WHITE HOUSE, February 28, 2017. ",Read President Trump's full prepared remarks for his first address to Congress
Daniel B. Kline,03022017,Fool,02232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has gotten aggressive in its battle with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for digital sales. The company has massively increased the number of products it sells online while also investing heavily in improving its ability to fulfill web or app orders through its warehouses and stores. In addition, the company has taken the bold step of dropping its $50-a-year Amazon Prime-like ShippingPass program, which gave customers unlimited, free two-day shipping. Instead, Wal-Mart now offers free two-day shipping on every order of at least $35, in some ways one-upping Amazon's $99-a-year Prime offer, which includes free, two-day shipping among other perks. These are daring moves led by the company's new head of digital operations Marc Lore, who came to Wal-Mart when it bought his Jet.com start-up for $3.3 billion. The e-commerce boss has preached the idea of Wal-Mart thinking like a start-up. By that Lore means making bold moves (like the free shipping offer) as a way to wrest market share from a well-entrenched competitor. That strategy can work, but it's very expensive. Start-ups, including Jet.com, and even Amazon as it has grown, lose money as they fight to attain and keep customers. Wal-Mart has decided to take that path, and it's a road fraught with peril. Wal-Mart now offers free shipping on orders over $35. Image source: Wal-Mart. ""We continue to invest in e-commerce to accelerate growth,"" said Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillion during the company's Q4 earnings call, which was transcribed by Seeking Alpha (registration required). ""We're gaining traction and moving faster. We're the second-largest U.S. online retailer by revenue, one of the top three online retailers by traffic and our Walmart app is among the top three apps in retail."" ""Invest"" is the operative word in what McMillion said. Wal-Mart has to spend heavily on infrastructure and it now has to eat the cost of two-day shipping on eligible orders, which drives margins down. The company has been growing its digital business. In Q4 U.S. e-commerce sales rose by 29% and McMillion said that ""Black Friday weekend sales marked the first time the number of people shopping online surpassed people shopping in stores."" Those are impressive feats, but it's also worth noting that the company saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop from $1.43 in Q4 2015, to $1.22 in the same period of 2016. The company already has scale when it comes to purchasing. That's a big hurdle for most new entrants in the digital space where Amazon has an inherent advantage in the fact that because it buys more, it pays better prices. Purchase price, however, is only one piece of the digital puzzle. Wal-Mart spent billions buying Jet.com and in some ways that's just the tip of the investment iceberg. Digital technology moves fast and Amazon has never hesitated to put its profits into its next innovation. Whether that's its warehouse network, its fleet of airplanes, or even its wild ideas like drone delivery and mobile trucks 3D-printing orders on demand, progress costs money. Paying for endless innovation while also having to pay for free shipping drives profits down. In addition, the easy ability for in-store or online customers to price check against Amazon could also force some prices lower. Not all of Amazon's revenue is from retail sales, but its growth has been incredible. Chart source: YCharts.com. Wal-Mart has the scale, some of the infrastructure, and much stronger ability to negotiate prices lower with vendors than Jet.com did on its own. That likely means the company won't lose money on its digital operations long-term or even short-term, but it's going to make less profit on each sale than it traditionally has in its stores. That's fine if the company can continue to grow its sales volume as it did in Q4. Amazon has essentially built a business where it lives on small margins, but makes it up in volume. Wal-Mart should be able to do the same and it has to because customers are moving toward digital. That said, the world's largest physical retailer is going to spend billions to build a business that's inherently less profitable than the one it's partially replacing. ","
      
    Can Wal-Mart Compete With Amazon and Make Money? -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,03022017,Fool,02232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. One of Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) biggest focuses over the past year has been reigniting its growth in e-commerce. It's taken several initiatives, including acquiring Jet.com for about $3.3 billion in August. But the acquisition, as well as a partnership with Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) haven't been able to push Wal-Mart's online sales growth rate past Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN). That's despite the fact that Amazon's online sales base was about seven times larger at the end of 2015. As more and more consumer spending moves from brick-and-mortar retail to digital storefronts, Wal-Mart's ability to grow revenue depends heavily on its e-commerce sites. But Amazon -- with its Prime membership flywheel -- is proving extremely difficult to overcome. Here's how Wal-Mart's e-commerce platform performed in 2016, what's driving its growth, and what Wal-Mart is doing to compete in 2017. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce sales growth outpaced Amazon's fourth-quarter North American sales growth, and Wal-Mart was sure to tout that in its earnings release. Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce sales improved 29% in the fourth quarter, and gross merchandise volume increased 36.1%. That's better than Amazon's 22% increase in North American sales. But instead of presenting global e-commerce sales and gross merchandise volume growth in its fourth-quarter release, as it has done in all three of its previous earnings reports, Wal-Mart only provided U.S. growth. It saved the global numbers for the earnings call. The table below should make it fairly evident why. Calendar Quarter Wal-Mart e-Commerce Revenue Growth Wal-Mart e-Commerce GMV Growth Amazon Retail Sales Growth Q1 2016 7% 7.5% 25.6% Q2 2016 11.8% 13% 28.8% Q3 2016 20.6% 16.8% 26.7% Q4 2016 15.5% 17.5% 20.6% Data source: Company's quarterly reports and earnings calls. Wal-Mart's global e-commerce revenue returned to deceleration after only a couple of quarters of acceleration. That fourth-quarter number includes its first full quarter of Jet.com sales, as well. Additionally, Wal-Mart's reported growth percentages are on a constant-currency basis (Amazon's are not), so it's seeing a slight benefit from its overseas sales as the dollar strengthens. There are several major factors that impacted Wal-Mart's online sales last year. Here's a quick rundown of the highlights. Wal-Mart continues to make new efforts in 2017, such as its recent announcement to offer free two-day shipping on select items. That's a shot directly at Amazon. Despite all of its initiatives and acquisitions, however, Wal-Mart's sales growth is still lagging Amazon's globally. That points to the huge moat around Amazon's operations, which is led by Amazon Prime. ","
      
    Wal-Mart Still Can't Keep Up With Amazon -- The Motley Fool

Jeremy Bowman,03022017,Fool,02232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In 2005, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) chief Warren Buffett began buying shares of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT). At the time, Wal-Mart seemed to embody many of the qualities Buffett looks for in a stock. With its size and scale, Wal-Mart could certainly claim the ""economic moat"" that Buffett favors, as it had put many independent retailers out of business during its rampant expansion. After trading sideways for several years, the stock was as cheap as it had been in at least a decade. And the company had shown its commitment to shareholders as a Dividend Aristocrat, raising its dividend payout every year for at least 25 years. Image source: The Motley Fool. Indeed, the retail giant was flying high back in 2005. Earnings per share grew 11% that year, on a 3% increase in comparable sales in the U.S., and its retail square footage jumped 14%, thanks in part to an acquisition in Brazil. Fast-forward a decade and things have changed. Wal-Mart's growth has ground to a halt as it is besieged by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other online retailers, and Buffett has taken notice, dumping nearly all of his stake in Wally World last year. After selling much of its position in prior quarters, Berkshire sold $900 million worth of Wal-Mart shares in the fourth, more than 90% of its remaining stake. As the chart below shows, the broad-market S&P 500 more than doubled the returns of Wal-Mart during the period when Buffett owned the stock: WMT data by YCharts. In other words, Wal-Mart was a clear loser for the Oracle of Omaha. Let's look for a few takeaways from Buffett's losing bet on Wal-Mart. For years, Buffett has told investors that one of the most important factors he looks for in a stock is a ""sustainable competitive advantage."" This can be anything from a brand name to a distribution network to a strong reputation, but it gives that business an ability to charge higher prices than competitors, and presents a barrier to entry to rivals. For years Buffett has favored big-brand stocks such as Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz Company, so it's no surprise he invested in Wal-Mart. Not only is the retailer a big brand, but its size also gave it economies of scale that its competitors couldn't match. Today, the company is still the world's largest by revenue. But some things happened in the last ten years that undermined Wal-Mart's competitive advantage. E-commerce companies like Amazon have increasingly taken sales from Wal-Mart as shopping patterns shift to the internet. And to a lesser extent, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) has stolen Wal-Mart's banner as the low-price operator. As the chart below shows, Amazon's revenue has grown much faster than Wal-Mart's, and even Costco's growth has doubled that of its larger rival: WMT Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Today, it seems that Amazon and Costco have competitive advantages over Wal-Mart. Though Buffett prefers companies that are so strong they could be run by anyone -- he famously once said even a ham sandwich could run Coke -- the difference between winners and losers in the stock market often comes down to who's in charge. Since Buffett first bought Wal-Mart, the company has had three different CEOs, and its strategy has changed several times. Though the company recognized the opportunity in e-commerce early on, it was slow to take advantage of it. Amazon's Jeff Bezos has built his business around that opportunity, and the company has aggressively expanded to provide faster delivery and add benefits to its Prime membership service. Buffett recognized Bezos last May, calling him a ""genius"" and saying, ""We haven't seen many businessmen like him."" That pronouncement seemed to foreshadow his selling of Wal-Mart as he realized it had been bested by Bezos and Amazon. It's been said about baseball that even the best players make outs most of the time they step up to the plate. Investing is similar. Even the best pick plenty of losers. Wal-Mart is far from alone among Buffett's bad bets. IBM has significantly underperformed the market since Berkshire began buying it a few years ago. Buffett has also admitted mistakes on companies such as Tesco PLC and Dexter Shoe Company. But part of Buffett's genius is that Berkshire has avoided the steep losses that plague the market during recessions: It's during those periods that his company has most outperformed the market. In the case of Wal-Mart, Buffett seemed to recognize that circumstances had changed since he first bought the stock in 2005. He still pocketed a gain on the stock, just less than an index fund would have yielded. As evidence of his always-evolving approach to investing, in the recent quarter, Buffett bought shares in a sector he had panned just a few years ago: airlines. That shows that it's never too late to refine your investing philosophy. ","
      
    3 Lessons From Warren Buffett's Decision to Dump Wal-Mart -- The Motley Fool

  "
Rich Duprey,03022017,Fool,02232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 20,000 for the first time last month and continues to set new records. Although investors tend to look at the index as a single entity, it is of course composed of 30 different companies, though they all don't affect the index equally. That's because the Dow is a price-weighted index, meaning pricier stocks in the index have a greater influence over its movements than do cheaper ones. Currently, Goldman Sachs, at more than $252 per share, has the greatest weight in the Dow, some 8.3%, while General Electric has the least, or 1%, as its stock trades at just over $30 a share. Image source: Getty Images. But the makeup of the Dow also changes over time, as companies are added to the index or dropped from it. The last time the components were changed was in 2015, when AT&T was removed and Apple added. Goldman Sachs, in fact, wasn't part of the Dow until 2013, when it, Nike, and Visa were put in and Alcoa, Bank of America, and Hewlett-Packard were taken out. The components have been changed 51 times since Charles Dow created the index in 1896, but the changes aren't made lightly, and you can still find 23 companies in the DJIA today that occupied that same space a decade ago. Unchanged Componentsof the Dow Jones Industrial Average,2007-2017 3M (NYSE:MMM) General Electric Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) American Express (NYSE:AXP) Home Depot (NYSE:HD) Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) Boeing (NYSE:BA) Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) IBM (NYSE:IBM) United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) Chevron (NYSE:CVX) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Verizon (NYSE:VZ) Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) DuPont (NYSE:DD) McDonald's (NYSE: MCD)(NYSE:MCD) Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Merck (NYSE:MRK) Ten years ago, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sat at around the 12,700 level and some might see parallels with today. Back then, the index was regularly hitting new highs and would go on to hit almost 14,000 just as the Great Recession hit, after which it would subsequently lose more than half its value. That it's nearly tripled over the past decade speaks to the strength of the components that comprise the Dow, but which one of these nearly two dozen stocks played the biggest role in its climb? Data sources: indexArb and Morningstar. Table by author. Looking at their total returns, the best performer was Home Depot, which generated 14.3% average annual returns for investors over the past 10 years, just ahead of McDonald's and Disney at around 13% each. That outsize performance certainly boosted the index's performance, but because of the Dow's price-weighting, which for the three of them averaged just above 4%, it probably would have muted their overall impact to a degree. So which stock came out on top? Industrial conglomerate 3M, which generated average annual returns of 10.6% and had the heaviest weighting of any of the 23 stocks at 6.07%. The combination of those two factors probably means it played a big role in the Dow index performance, and it should be remembered that this performance includes the 2008-2009 recession. http://www.3m.com.hk/wps/wcm/connect/db1c9bb5-2b2e-4db7-afef-1dd0b79f58fb/MovingIndustryForward_270.jpg?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE-db1c9bb5-2b2e-4db7-afef-1dd0b79f58fb-kYXl7I6Image source: 3M. Shares of 3M have more than doubled over the past 10 years, and in the past 12 months alone they're up 20%, but with good reason. It generates annual sales in excess of $30 billion, produces huge amounts of free cash, and is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat club, having raised its dividend for 59 consecutive years, most recently by 6% to $1.175 per share. While its fourth-quarter earnings were hampered by a weak performance by its healthcare and consumer divisions that typically do better, its industrial end markets were much stronger, allowing it to reaffirm its growth prospects for the coming year as well as forecast profits of $8.45 to $8.80 a share. While it would have been nice to see its consumer-facing businesses perform well now that the industrial segment is firing properly, the latter represents one-third of its total revenues and will be key to the future. Image source: 3M. Although management is always looking to calve off slower growth businesses to focus on maintaining high-single-digit revenue growth over the long term, 3M plans to invest approximately $1.8 billion in research and development this year to support its organic growth initiatives. Yet even with its uneven performance this past quarter, each segment of the business generated operating margins near 20% or above. If 3M is able to continue producing the kinds of numbers it has been, the industrial and consumer giant may be able to avoid the shades of the downfall that befell the Dow Jones Industrial Average 10 years ago.

There are many factors that make Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) a unique company. It has plunged itself headlong into a number of emerging markets, including e-commerce, cloud computing, and video streaming. It's been willing to sacrifice profits for long-term growth and market share in a way that no other company of its size has. But the company's culture has also set it apart. There are many Bezos mantras that guide the company, but none does more so than this: ""Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient."" Bezos says those three guidelines have been the secret to the company's success. Image source: Amazon. Elaborating on the first point, Bezos has repeatedly said that the company is obsessed with customers rather than focused on competitors, and that it responds to customer needs rather than competitive threats. However, Bezos is well known as a cutthroat competitor, and fosters a competitive environment both within the company and the markets it does business in. He has famously said about rivals, ""Your margin is my opportunity."" Though the idea that Amazon only cares about customers and not competitors may buffer the company's image as a consumer darling, it's far from the truth. Here are three occasions, including one just last week, when Amazon responded directly and determinedly to competitive threats. A year ago, Amazon lifted its minimum order for free shipping for Non-Prime members from $35 to $49. The move was seen as a push by Amazon to encourage customers who hadn't already to sign up for Prime memberships, and to trim exploding shipping costs. In the past year, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has stepped up its focus on e-commerce, expanding its online grocery pickup program and acquiring Jet.com for $3.3 billion. As part of that strategy, Wal-Mart said a month ago that it would offer free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more in an attempt to challenge Amazon Prime. Just a few weeks after Wal-Mart made that announcement, Amazon lowered its free-shipping minimum again to $35, back down from $49, in a clear response to Wal-Mart. Notably, Amazon does not promise two-day shipping for such orders, reserving that benefit for Prime members. Still, the move shows how closely Amazon is guarding its advantage in e-commerce and its reputation for fast, free shipping. In 2010, Amazon noticed that its diaper sales, a key category as it helps bring in new parents, were slipping, going instead to upstart Quidsi, which owned Diapers.com. Amazon dealt with the problem by attempting to buy Quidsi, but when it was rebuffed it responded by dropping its diaper prices by as much as a third in an attempt to strongarm Quidsi into a sale. Although Quidsi also received a bid from Wal-Mart, Amazon's strategy proved successful and it bought Quidsi for $545 million in November 2010. Notably, Amazon is facing off again with Quidsi co-founder Marc Lore, who went on to found Jet.com after a two-year stint with Amazon following the Quidsi purchase. Lore now has Wal-Mart's backing as he attempts another assault on Amazon, yet another reason why this rivalry is only heating up. Amazon's sophisticated pricing algorithm, which it adjusts millions of times a day, is perhaps the best example of how the company is often more focused on competitors than customers. The company, for instance, often prioritizes products it sells over those sold by thrid-party vendors on its marketplace even when those are cheaper, according to a study by ProPublica. Amazon also gives an advantage to vendors who pay it for services such as fulfillment. Oddly enough, Amazon's closest competitors are sometimes those vendors selling on its website. Another study showed that Amazon manipulates price perception by often offering a discount on the most popular items, but rarely doing so on less popular ones, creating the perception that it offers the lowest price when that's often not the case. The company may deserve its reputation for putting the customer first, as it often makes allowances that other businesses might not, and programs like Prime have been customer favorites -- but it's foolish to assume that Amazon ignores competitive actions just because it says so. Like any other business, it needs to respond to rivals in order to grow and succeed. ","
      
    3 Times Amazon Responded Directly to Competitive Threats -- The Motley Fool

Jeremy Bowman,03022017,Fool,02232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Retail CEOs from Target, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Gap Inc and other national chains flocked to the White House last week to meet with President Trump. At the top of the agenda was a potential border tax that the retail sector has widely protested, as it would likely force a significant price increase. Not featured at the meeting was Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the country's biggest e-commerce company, and the second-biggest retailer by sales behind Wal-Mart Stores, Inc, (NYSE:WMT), which was also absent. Image Source: Motley Fool. Oddly enough, despite Trump's former promise of ""such problems"" for Amazon, the e-commerce giant could be a big winner from the border tax as an indirect beneficiary. Though any tax on imports is far from finalized, Trump made such a tariff a cornerstone of his campaign and has continued to tout such a move as president. In his first week in the White House, he suggested implementing a 35% border tax on goods from Mexico as a way to make our southern neighbor pay for the border wall, but walked the idea back after a backlash. Now Trump and Congressional Republicans appear to be considering a 20% border tax as a replacement for tax revenue from a corporate tax cut and as an incentive to encourage American manufacturing. It's part of a tax overhaul plan that could also allow repatriation of foreign profits and let companies deduct the entirety of capital expenses instead of depreciating them gradually. Though it's often overlooked in financial discussions of Amazon, about half of Amazon's sales come from third-party vendors operating through its marketplace. In that sense, the company is operating almost like a retail franchisor. Much like McDonald's franchises restaurants, Amazon uses its website, brand name, technology, and infrastructure to leverage its retail platform for third-party vendors, giving it similar advantages to a company like McDonald's. Franchising removes much of the risk of operating the underlying business, as Amazon can collect sales commissions and operating fees and sell services like Fulfillment by Amazon, which handles storage, picking, packing, and shipping for its third-party vendors, without the risk and hassle of actually selling the merchandise. That marketplace system also means that Amazon itself would be protected from a border tax on about half of the merchandise sold on its website. The burden would instead fall on those third-party vendors, giving Amazon a clear advantage over brick-and-mortar retailers that do not have the luxury of passing the buck in such a way. Furthermore, Amazon derives about 37% of sales from outside North America, which would not be subject to such a border tax, and its cloud-computing segment AWS, which generates billions in operating income, would also not be affected. Amazon has also made a habit of tax avoidance in the past -- the company avoided charging sales tax for several years throughout much of the U.S., and only earlier this month began collecting sales tax in Arkansas. Though the company didn't deliberately plan for such a border tax, it stands to benefit over its brick-and-mortar rivals in much the same way. At a time when traditional retailers are struggling with a myriad challenges from e-commerce and shifting shopping patterns, a border tax could put a knife in the back of many of Amazon's competitors. While it's still unclear if the tax will be implemented, such a tariff would only be one more reason to bet on Amazon's continued growth as it expands its competitive advantages over physical retailers.

Even more, the company's total 2016 sales increased 27%, hitting an impressive $136 billion. But can Amazon keep up its steep growth over the long haul? Based on the trajectory of global e-commerce sales, Amazon is still barely tapping into a fast-growing trend. In 2016, Amazon's $136 billion of revenue only represented a small fraction of global online retail sales. In 2016, e-commerce sales worldwide hit $1.9 trillion, up from about $1.5 trillion in 2015.

    A Foolish Take: Amazon.com's Mind-Boggling Opportunity in 1 Chart -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,03022017,Fool,02232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There are few things more valuable for serious investors to read each year than Warren Buffett's annual letter to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B). His letter for 2016, released early Saturday morning, is no exception. In it, Buffett covers his usual range of subjects, from the performance of Berkshire Hathaway and its operating units, to the future prospects of the United States, to advice for corporate executives and individual investors. The whole letter is worth reading -- it is, after all, less than 30 pages long. But for those of you who want to view the highlight reel, here are my five favorite takeaways from Buffett's latest shareholder letter. Warren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. Image source: The Motley Fool. A growing number of high-profile investors and institutions have begun to issue warning signs that stocks are approaching unsustainable levels, following the market's surge in the wake of the presidential election. Prominent hedge fund managers such as Ray Dalio and Seth Klarman have both touched on this in the past month, and the chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, David Kostin, wrote in a recent report that ""financial market reconciliation lies ahead."" Buffett both buys this line of thinking and doesn't. While the market is certain to experience major declines, it's impossible to predict when they'll occur, he notes in this year's letter. At the same time, Buffett urges investors to look at these as opportunities to -- as he's said in the past -- be fearful when others are greedy: The years ahead will occasionally deliver major market declines -- even panics -- that will affect virtually all stocks. No one can tell you when these traumas will occur -- not me, not Charlie [Munger], not economists, not the media. Meg McConnell of the New York Fed aptly described the reality of panics: ""We spend a lot of time looking for systemic risk; in truth, however, it tends to find us."" During such scary periods, you should never forget two things: First, widespread fear is your friend as an investor, because it serves up bargain purchases. Second, personal fear is your enemy. It will also be unwarranted. Investors who avoid high and unnecessary costs and simply sit for an extended period with a collection of large, conservatively financed American businesses will almost certainly do well. One of the hottest topics in the corporate world over the past few years concerns share buybacks. Tepid economic growth and lagging confidence have led companies to allocate excess earnings not into business investments, but rather into share repurchases. In theory, there's nothing wrong with this, as stock buybacks are just another avenue for companies to return capital to shareholders. Done at the right price, moreover, they add value to existing shareholders' stakes. But in practice, as Buffett notes in this year's letter, companies tend to ignore this nuance, preferring instead to repurchase stock irrespective of price: Assessing the desirability of repurchases isn't that complicated. For continuing shareholders ... repurchases only make sense if the shares are bought at a price below intrinsic value. When that rule is followed, the remaining shares experience an immediate gain in intrinsic value. ... Ergo, the question of whether a repurchase action is value-enhancing or value-destroying for continuing shareholders is entirely purchase-price dependent. It is puzzling, therefore, that corporate repurchase announcements almost never refer to a price above which repurchases will be eschewed. That certainly wouldn't be the case if a management was buying an outside business. There, price would always factor into a buy-or-pass decision. When CEOs or boards are buying a small part of their own company, though, they all too often seem oblivious to price. Would they behave similarly if they were managing a private company with just a few owners and were evaluating the wisdom of buying out one of them? Of course not. My suggestion: Before even discussing repurchases, a CEO and his or her board should stand, join hands, and in unison declare, ""What is smart at one price is stupid at another."" If there's one thing I've learned from reading Buffett's letters, it's about the critical importance of competitive advantage. A company with a competitive advantage over others in its industry can continuously grow its market share while simultaneously earning superior returns. And no competitive advantage is stronger than efficiency. A company that operates at a lower cost base than its competitors has the world at its fingertips, so to speak. It can underprice other companies in its industry, capturing many of their customers, and still generate wider margins and thus higher profitability. As Buffett explains in this year's letter, Berkshire Hathaway's auto-insurance unit, Geico, offers a real-life demonstration of these forces in action: Auto insurance is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them -- and only a low-cost operation can deliver those. ... Geico's low costs create a moat -- an enduring one -- that competitors are unable to cross. As a result, the company gobbles up market share year after year, ending 2016 with about 12% of industry volume. That's up from 2.5% in 1995, the year Berkshire acquired control of Geico. Employment, meanwhile, grew from 8,575 to 36,085. Geico's growth accelerated dramatically during the second half of 2016. Loss costs throughout the auto-insurance industry had been increasing at an unexpected pace and some competitors lost their enthusiasm for taking on new customers. Geico's reaction to the profit squeeze, however, was to accelerate its new-business efforts. We like to make hay while the sun sets, knowing that it will surely rise again. Buffett prides himself on being a straight shooter. He calls things how he sees them and doesn't try to inflate the performance of Berkshire Hathaway through accounting adjustments that exclude temporary, but nevertheless real, costs, as so many companies do nowadays when reporting ""adjusted earnings."" The 86-year-old billionaire has taken issue with this practice in the past, and he does so again in this year's letter: Too many managements -- and the number seems to grow every year – are looking for any means to report, and indeed feature, ""adjusted earnings"" that are higher than their company's GAAP earnings. There are many ways for practitioners to perform this legerdemain. Two of their favorites are the omission of ""restructuring costs"" and ""stock-based compensation"" as expenses. Charlie and I want managements, in their commentary, to describe unusual items -- good or bad -- that affect the GAAP numbers. After all, the reason we look at these numbers of the past is to make estimates of the future. But a management that regularly attempts to wave away very real costs by highlighting ""adjusted per-share earnings"" makes us nervous. That's because bad behavior is contagious: CEOs who overtly look for ways to report high numbers tend to foster a culture in which subordinates strive to be ""helpful"" as well. Goals like that can lead, for example, to insurers underestimating their loss reserves, a practice that has destroyed many industry participants. Charlie and I cringe when we hear analysts talk admiringly about managements who always ""make the numbers."" In truth, business is too unpredictable for the numbers always to be met. Inevitably, surprises occur. When they do, a CEO whose focus is centered on Wall Street will be tempted to make up the numbers. If you scan the list of Berkshire Hathaway's major stock holdings on Page 19 of Buffett's latest letter, there's a glaring absence: Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). At Berkshire's 2003 annual meeting, Buffett was asked what his biggest mistake was in recent years. His response: ""Wal-Mart."" As he went on to note: ""I set out to buy 100 million shares of Wal-Mart at a [pre-split price of] $23. We bought a little and it moved up a little, and I thought maybe it will come back a bit. That thumb-sucking has cost us in the current area of $10 billion."" Two years later, in 2005, Buffett tried to remedy this matter by establishing a major position in the discount retailer. By 2016, Berkshire's stake in Wal-Mart was worth nearly $6 billion. But that stake is no more, causing some investors to question Buffett's sincerity when he said in the past that he and Munger's favorite holding period is ""forever."" But as Buffett clarified in this year's letter, this rule applies to the whole companies that Berkshire owns, not its stakes in marketable securities: Sometimes the comments of shareholders or media imply that we will own certain stocks ""forever."" It is true that we own some stocks that I have no intention of selling for as far as the eye can see (and we're talking 20/20 vision). But we have made no commitment that Berkshire will hold any of its marketable securities forever. Confusion about this point may have resulted from a too-casual reading of Economic Principle 11 on pages 110-111, which has been included in our annual reports since 1983. That principle covers controlled businesses, not marketable securities. This year I've added a final sentence to No. 11 to ensure that our owners understand that we regard any marketable security as available for sale, however unlikely such a sale now seems. That rounds out my five favorite lessons from Buffett's 2016 shareholder letter. But let me repeat: If you're a serious investor who's intent on getting better at the craft, there are few better ways to do so than digging into the Oracle of Omaha's letters yourself. ","
      
    Warren Buffett's Shareholder Letter: 5 Lessons for All Investors -- The Motley Fool

Scott Levine,03022017,Fool,02232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), a leader in fuel-cell solutions, plans on releasing its fourth-quarter earnings in the next few weeks. Although there will probably be much attention paid to the company's efforts to bring fuel-cell solutions to the electric-vehicle market in China -- something the company sees as a massive market opportunity -- investors must remain focused on the company's performance in the absence of the all-important investment tax credit. The stock has been on a wild ride so far this year, climbing as much as 8% and dropping as low as 28%. Will the earnings release be enough to charge up investors? Let's look at some things management is telling us to expect. Image source: Getty Images. While the market has proved that solar and wind power are viable energy options, the increasing acceptance of hydrogen fuel cells remains dubious. And with the renewal of the investment tax credit for fuel cells unlikely, even more skepticism surrounds the industry's success. Plug Power, however, is showing signs that industry acceptance may not be that unimaginable. Reporting 4,010 GenDrive deployments in 2016, management exceeded its guidance of deployments between 3,800 units to 4,000 units. In addition to longtime customers such as Wal-Mart, BMW, and Home Depot, the company also provided its GenDrive units to new customers, such as FM Logistics and Carrefour, a leading European retailer. According to preliminary results, the company secured $280 million in contract bookings for fiscal 2016, exceeding guidance that it provided in January 2016. Should the company proceed to report $280 million in bookings, it would represent growth of approximately 40% over the $200 million it secured in the previous year. Although Plug Power exceeded guidance in both GenDrive deployments and contract bookings, the earnings report will have surely have some misses. In the preliminary earnings release, management reported that it achieved breakeven status on an operational cash flow basis for the quarter. If correct, that means the company failed to achieve its annual guidance -- negative-$20 million or less -- regarding operational cash flow. Instead, the preliminary results indicate that the company will report negative-$29.6 million in operational cash flow. Over the past five years, the company has achieved success in growing revenue; however, it has been unable to find a way to convert this revenue to positive operational cash flow. PLUG Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts On the bright side, though, the apparent $29.6 million in negative operational cash flow does represent an improvement, stemming the downward trend it had been on. Lastly, investors will surely see management celebrate its presumed success in expanding the company's gross margin, which according to preliminary results will total 9.2%. If accurate, this would further mean the company achieved an annual gross margin of 4.5%, coming up short of management's guidance for a fiscal 2016 gross margin in excess of 10%. Though not meeting expectations, it still represents an improvement over the gross margin of negative-9.6% it reported in fiscal 2015. Presumably, the main driver of the company's gross-margin improvement is simple: success in controlling expenses related to its services performed on fuel-cell systems and related infrastructure. Image source: Getty Images. In the third quarter, the company -- for the first time -- reported a positive gross margin, of 5.9%, on its services business. In terms of the first nine months of fiscal 2016, the company still reported a negative services margin; however, a year-over-year comparison elucidates the improvement. Whereas the company reported a negative-72.3% gross margin on its services business through the first nine months of fiscal 2015, the company reported a gross margin on its services business through the first nine months of fiscal 2016 of only negative-5.2%. Plug Power's growth in contract bookings is commendable, and even though it exceeds management's guidance, investors must temper any excitement with the reminder that the company probably missed on operational cash flow and gross-margin guidance. Failing to achieve its guidance is nothing new for the company -- something that's imperative for investors to remember if management provides guidance for the year ahead. ","

Shares of JD didn't sell off after the report, but it raises concerns that regulators could force the company to alter parts of its business. Let's take a closer look at JD's business and how the allegations could impact the company's growth. JD.com CEO Richard Liu. Image source: JD.com JD, formerly known as 360buy, is the second largest B2C (business-to-commerce) website in China after Alibaba's Tmall. The company's major backers include internet giant Tencent (NASDAQOTH:TCEHY), which owns 15% of the company, and retail giant Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), which controls 11%. JD's e-commerce platform is integrated into Tencent's WeChat, the most popular messaging app in China, and it fulfills deliveries from Wal-Mart stores across China. JD generates most of its revenues from its core marketplace business. During the third quarter, its GMV (gross merchandise volume) rose 43% annually to 158.8 billion yuan ($23.8 billion). Annual active customer accounts rose 57% to 198.7 million. That robust growth lifted its total revenues by 38% to 60.7 billion yuan ($9.1 billion), but that represented a slowdown from 42% growth in the previous quarter and 52% growth in the prior year quarter. JD's bottom line remains in the red, and it's only posted one quarter of profitability over the past four quarters. JD's automated warehouse in Shanghai. Image source: JD.com In 2013, JD launched JD Finance, which offers financial services and products to consumers and small businesses in China. The unit formed a wide range of partnerships with companies like ZestFinance, which provides credit risk evaluation for Chinese companies, and UnionPay, the country's national banking card association. In 2014, JD Finance launched Baitiao, the first internet-based credit product in China. JD claims that Baitiao usage surged 800% annually during Singles Day (Nov. 11) -- the biggest online shopping day of the year -- in 2015. Its ecosystem also includes JD Zhongchuang, which finances promising start-ups, and the country's biggest crowdfunding platform. It recently announced plans to expand into the insurance and online brokerage markets as well. JD Finance's growth has attracted a lot of big investors. Last year, the unit raised $1 billion from investors and was valued at 46.65 billion yuan ($6.8 billion). JD doesn't disclose how much revenue JD Finance generates, but the company has admitted that it isn't profitable yet. Looking ahead, JD plans to spin off JD Finance as an entity entirely owned by Chinese investors, which would let it enter new financial markets (like securities) which entities with foreign investors are banned from. JD plans to acquire a minority stake in the new company, which would give it 40% of the unit's pre-tax profits -- assuming that it achieves profitability. That move would also remove JD Finance's more volatile cash flows from JD's balance sheet. This strategy closely mirrors Alibaba's spin off of Ant Financial Services Group, a domestic Chinese firm which remains closely tied to its former parent company. JD Finance must clear a lot of regulatory hurdles before the spin off is approved. That's probably why regulators are now putting its financial products under the microscope. Allegations of misconduct at JD aren't new -- a leaked internal memo from last October highlighted ten cases of internal corruption, with the staff accepting bribes, gifts, and banquets from suppliers prior to Singles Day. JD isn't the only tech company in the crosshairs of Chinese regulators. Prior to this year's Singles Day, regulators issued warnings to JD, Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Amazon's Chinese division regarding counterfeit products, false advertising, and falsified sales figures. That warning was likely related to Baidu's previous issues with misleading ads, Alibaba's ongoing issues with counterfeit products at Taobao and Tmall, and the SEC's current probe into Alibaba's accounting methods and the accuracy of its sales figures. Those issues tarnished the reputations of both companies, and it looks like it's JD's turn to be scrutinized. Facing a regulatory probe is never good news, but I think the investigation into JD Finance shouldn't be compared to the investigations at Alibaba and Baidu -- which targeted issues within their core businesses. JD Finance is a secondary business for JD, and any penalties levied against the unit should have a limited impact on its core marketplace business. But if the investigation kills the spin-off of JD Finance, it could weaken JD's competitive position against Tmall and weigh down its bottom line growth. If you already own JD.com shares, there's no reason to panic and sell. But it also isn't a great time to start a new position -- JD's slowing sales growth, lack of profitability, and regulatory pressures could all limit its upside potential for the foreseeable future.

Daniel Eckert, senior vice president of Walmart Services, said one in five customers conducts a money-service transaction, according to their findings. “These capabilities are the latest example of how we’re bringing together all of the conveniences of Walmart . . . to deliver one seamless shopping experience for customers,” Eckert said in a statement. “By making them faster and easier, we’re living up to our promise – to save customers money and time.” Wal-Mart has been refocusing on improving customer service at its stores in an effort to better compete with brick-and-mortar rivals as well as Amazon.com Inc.

But analysts wonder if the company should consider some closures in order to free up funds for the many projects the retailer has planned.

In that time, the company plans to revamp more than 600 of its approximately 1,800 locations, and open more than 100 small-format stores. The small-format stores will be focused on urban markets with dense populations and college campuses. Thirty of these stores will open in 2017. Target began rolling out smaller stores in cities in 2012, and opened 13 of them in places like Chicago, New York and Philadelphia in 2016.

But in order to drive traffic, Morgan Stanley analysts question what Target will do with grocery, which it says accounts for 20% of sales. Read also: J.C. Penney’s store closures are a good move, but could signal bigger problems See also: Nordstrom says Trump’s tweets after Ivanka’s collections were dropped didn’t hurt results Cornell said during the conference that grocery is a focus, and that Target has been taking steps to improve supply chain and assortment. But, the company has limits. “[O]ne of the things we’ve talked about over the last year as it pertains [to] Target’s food and beverage offering is the recognition that we don’t have a full-service grocery experience, we don’t have meat and seafood counters, we don’t have deli counters, we don’t provide a full assortment of experiences and services that many of our full-line competitors do,” said Cornell, highlighting that the company offers “a great self-service convenient experience and that starts with the right quality, the right assortment, the right in-store experience, great value.” Morgan Stanley sees this as a hurdle. “We believe it will be difficult for Target to become a primary destination for grocery and therefore it may not make financial sense to invest heavily in the category,” analysts said in a note published late Tuesday. “But the dilemma Target faces is in order to drive more traffic, the category needs greater investment (a catch-22). We continue to believe grocery will be a challenging part of the store fix.” Morgan Stanley rates Target shares underweight and lowered the price target to $52 from $65. Target shares closed down 1.6% on Wednesday, and shares are down 28.7% for the past year.

Quentin Fottrell,03022017,MarketWatch,02232017,"Published: Mar 2, 2017 4:59 p.m. ET Take a deep breath when you come face-to-face with the company head By The chief executive of Uber gets into an Uber… It sounds like the beginning of a bad joke, but that’s what happened to Travis Kalanick, the chief executive and co-founder of Uber Technologies Inc. He took an Uber with friends on Feb. 5 and got into a shouting match with the driver over his company’s policies. The argument was captured on the dash cam of Uber driver Fawzi Kamel in San Francisco. In it, Kamel complains about how Uber’s lower fares have hurt his income. “I lost money — $7,000 — because of you,” Kamel said. “I’m bankrupt because of you.” Kalanick shot back: “Bulls—! …Some people don’t like to take responsibility for their own s—.” On Tuesday evening, Kalanick apologized for his behavior and said he needed to “grow up.” (You can view the video here.) Clearly, there are no winners in this particular situation, but it raises an important question: What do you do if you have complaints about your company and you find yourself face-to-face with your boss in a café, elevator or even an Uber? “We should all have an elevator speech ready for our executives or our boss,” says Tim Sackett, president of HRU Technical Resources, an information technology and engineering staffing firm in Lansing, Mich. But the employee should have a statement or question that requires an answer. Or, even better, an idea. “Have you ever thought of…?” It should be an idea or question that can be answered fairly, yet in a way that positions you as someone who wants to be a part of the solution. “That answer will set you up for future success,” he says. Don’t miss: ‘The Mary Tyler Moore Show’ tackled workplace sexual harassment And if you see a big problem in the company, whether it’s one of policy or culture, tell the truth. Remember that scene in “Working Girl” where Melanie Griffith’s character (Tess) proves that she came up with the idea for a company merger? She took her moment and, in this context at least, gave her character Tess her Hollywood ending. Before that, of course, she crashed a society wedding and pitched the idea to the head of a fictional company. (Not to be recommended.) Real life is rarely so simple, but there’s a lesson in that confident and opportunistic approach, says Steve Langerud, workplace consultant and principal of Steve Langerud & Associates in Grinnell, Iowa. “Be clear, factual and solution-oriented,” he says. And brief. There may be less than a minute before one of you has to go. “If you had the CEO in an elevator use a simple structure to think about what you would start, stop, and continue doing to help the organization succeed.” It could be explaining a big idea, as Tess did in the movie, or it could be a valuable piece of advice, framed as a compliment rather than a criticism. “The Uber employee was right to share his experience. Bosses want to be successful and improve. Hearing from employees and customers downstream from decisions is critical to tweaking performance. This was a great opportunity for Uber that went south.” Also read:  From the Oscars to the Oval Office, tweeting and texting at work is catching flak “All CEOs want to hear what’s really going on in their companies, because they mostly get watered down, filtered versions from those who report to them directly,” Sackett says. “If we know this, the Uber driver might have gained favor and more time if he would have said, ‘I have some feedback I would really like to share with you directly on my experience as a driver.’” And if the conversation goes well, Sackett says, you could finish up with, “Can you give me a way to connect with you at a time when you’re ready to talk business?” Of course, having a conversation when either party is in a relaxed social setting or at the end of a long night may not be appropriate. “Employees should have a voice and I admire employees who have the courage to speak up,” says New York-based work place expert and digital marketer Piera Palazzolo. “However, if you want to have a fruitful exchange, you shouldn’t start by accusing someone. You immediately put the person on the defensive and they might stop listening. Now, while the driver embarrassed the CEO, I’m not sure he got his real message across.” Either way, she says, don’t wait until tomorrow to say what you want to say. Make the most of that moment, whether you’re in an Uber or standing by the water cooler. “Speaking out is always a good idea,” Palazzolo says. “But how you do it is key.” Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

                                   has notched 12 straight record closes. In its case, near-term support matches the range bottom, circa 20,730, and is followed by a deeper floor at the 20,640 breakout point. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has absorbed a modest late-month whipsaw. Recall that it bottomed last week on the 5,800 mark, a level matching support, and defining the week’s low. The swift reversal from support is constructive, placing the index within striking distance of record territory. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has established a range-bound posture just under record territory. Its latest plateau is underpinned by support matching the 5,800 mark. Conversely, the Nasdaq’s record close (5,865.95) and absolute record peak (5,867.89) remain firmly within view. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has notched 12 straight record closes, its longest such streak since 1987. The blue-chip benchmark has never registered 13 consecutive record closes. In the process, the Dow has thus far topped 149 points, or 0.7%, under the 21,000 mark. Separately, consider the 50-day moving average (in blue), currently 20,100, and rising about 20 points per session. Its steep slope exemplifies the Dow’s powerful 2017 bull trend. Similarly, the S&P 500 has sustained, and slightly extended, the decisive February breakout. Here again, the S&P has asserted a tight one-week range near record territory, signaling that selling pressure remains muted. As detailed at the top, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is vying for a 13th straight record close, a stretch never registered in its history. The headline winning streak, already the Dow’s longest since 1987, exemplifies the U.S. benchmarks’ otherwise powerful, and still firmly-grounded, bull trend.

Separately, last week’s low of 137.30 closely matched the breakout point, circa 137.60. The successful retest of first support is technically constructive. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400’s backdrop remains stronger. Recall that the 50-day moving average has defined the trend, currently 308.20, and is rising toward the breakout point, circa 311.

                                   backdrop remains incrementally stronger than that of the small- and mid-cap benchmarks. The SPY registered a fractional record close on Monday, rising from a tight one-week range. All told, the U.S. benchmarks are concluding a strong February run against a still firmly-bullish longer-term backdrop. The latest leg higher has been statistically unusual, as detailed last week, while the U.S. sub-sector price action remains rotational, and continues to support the bull case. Tactically, the S&P 500’s breakout point — S&P 2,351 — closely matches last week’s low, and the prior week’s close. Conversely, the initial 2,365 target has been satisfied, and a more distant target projects to the 2,390 area, detailed previously. Beyond technical levels, all trends technically point higher — the near-term, intermediate-term and longer-term trends — pending signs of a bearish pulse. The response to President Trump’s first address to Congress should add color. Also see: Charting a 30-year technical breakout, S&P 500 confirms bull trend (again).

Kim S. Nash,03022017,MarketWatch,02232017,"Published: Mar 2, 2017 10:04 a.m. ET Making in-store shopping more like online shopping By With the grocery business now stretching into cyberspace via websites and apps, Americans have never had so many choices in how, when and where to shop for products such as steaks and cereal. Consumers can shop online and either pick up the order or have it delivered to their homes. Inside stores, meanwhile, technology is changing the shopping experience.

Its mobile app can analyze shopping habits and produce relevant digital coupons. Kroger’s latest move: testing sensor-laden interactive shelves that detect shoppers in the aisles via their smartphones to offer them personal pricing and product suggestions as they walk along. “We want to bring technology to life in the store,” says Chris Hjelm, Kroger’s chief information officer since 2005.

It opened a cashierless Amazon Go convenience store, where customers scan their mobile phones at a kiosk upon entering, pick sensor-tagged items and see the tally charged to a mobile payment account. Also read: 12 ways to save on your rising grocery bill In an interview, Hjelm discussed the imperative to make store shopping more like online shopping—cutting wait times and creating a more interactive experience—with technology such as the Internet of Things, data analytics and video. Edited excerpts follow: WSJ: Which technologies are key to Kroger now? HJELM: We’re in the midst of deploying our video-management system, with new cameras that are all digital, and analytics technology to understand what we’re seeing. We’re running a pilot to do service queuing for the pharmacy, meat department or deli. It isn’t like everybody stands in a nice line, like they do at checkout. People come from the left side, they come from the right side. We can use video to not only detect how many are there but how long they’ve been waiting. If you’re a pharmacist, your head is down at the computer, working. We can alert you right on your display that you’ve got a customer who’s been waiting for 60 seconds and no one’s talked to them yet. So those little paper ‘Now Serving’ numbers don’t cut it? Customers get frustrated. They may have been there second, but they don’t get served until third. Or, if they are waiting too long, they can sometimes walk away. We can use this data to analyze what is the appropriate wait time. Stores are big and complicated. We need to make them simple. How is Kroger changing stores? We’re helping customers create “favorites” lists on our mobile app. We want to make sure they’re taking advantage of digital coupons. We’re expanding ClickList, which is a system to let you order online and pick up in a store. It’s in 441 stores now. We just launched same-day order and pickup. We’re testing delivery, as well. How viable is Amazon’s cashierless idea? It’s neat. Certainly, it’s doable. In a constrained, convenience-store format with a very limited set of product, it makes it a lot easier. But there are complexities, like making sure you deal with bad customer behavior — people who put items back into the wrong slots. I haven’t seen it yet, but I certainly will the next time I’m in Seattle. Will Kroger go cashierless? We have Scan, Bag, Go, which is a shopping solution where you use a wireless hand-held device and scan items. You bag them as you go, the way you want them bagged. Then you stop at checkout to pay and we send you on your way. I shop that way a lot. It’s in about 15 stores around Cincinnati. So with Scan, Bag, Go, we are kind of there. We’re now integrating mobile payment credentials, so you can avoid that last checkout step in the process. How else can stores use data to interact with consumers? We’re testing digital shelf edges in 14 stores. Sensors can detect when someone is walking down the aisle [with Kroger’s mobile app open]. I can highlight products for you on a high-definition display on the shelf edge. Let’s say you’re gluten-free. In the nutrition-bar section, I can highlight for you the gluten-free products. Or I could show you on the shelf your personal price for a product. Or highlight that bottle of wine on your shopping list. You’ve told me what you like and what you want. I know what’s in the aisle, and I can fuse all that data to create a magical experience. We’re working on it; it isn’t deployed yet. Kim S. Nash is a senior writer for CIO Journal in New York.

Barbara Kollmeyer,03022017,MarketWatch,02232017,"Published: Feb 28, 2017 9:52 a.m. ET Critical information ahead of the U.S. trading day By The wait is over. Tonight in Washington, D.C. investors may finally get some insight into whether the “Trump trade” is all it’s cracked up to be. Sure, there’s been a lot of talk about a stock bubble. But when President Donald Trump makes his not-a-State-of-the-Union address to Congress later, don’t be surprised if it turns out to be a call to action (even if history shows such speeches aren’t always big stock movers). “If anything seems all but certain, it is that the president’s words will move markets,” Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at Daily FX told clients. Health care, consumer and defense are among the industries that will be hanging on his every word. POTUS, who has whipsawed specific stocks and sectors via Twitter since he took office, gave defense stocks a boost Monday by saying he wanted to see the Pentagon’s budget upped by $54 billion. That brings us to our call of the day, which finds respite from the often-unclear world of politics in some come-hell-or-high-water stocks. These would be great adds to any portfolio, says Bret Jensen, blogging for Investors Alley. Jensen zeroes in on real estate, a sector that he says has been buoyed by recent data and has held up pretty well despite last November’s U.S. interest-rate rise.

The selloff was the biggest one-day price decline since Target’s stock started trading in January 1972, according to FactSet. The second-biggest price drop was $5.61 on May 18, 2016, also after reporting quarterly results. The one-day percentage decline was the fifth-biggest ever, and the largest since it plummeted 12.50% on Dec. 1, 2008, according to FactSet. The biggest decline was 33% on Oct. 19, 1987, or Black Monday. “Our fourth-quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly-changing consumer behavior, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores,” said Chief Executive Brian Cornell. “While the transition to this new model will present headwinds to our sales and profit performance in the short term, we are confident that these changes will best-position Target for continued success over the long term.” Target’s disappointing results were in contrast to better-than-expected earnings reported by rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Don’t miss: Nordstrom says Trump’s tweets after Ivanka’s collections were dropped didn’t hurt results The rating agency is the latest to weigh in on the state of the sector, and has 19 names in its retail and apparel portfolio, or 14% of the total, that are now trading at Caa/Ca. That’s deep into speculative, or “junk,” territory. It’s also a percentage close to the 16% considered distressed during the 2008/2009 period, said a Moody’s report led by retail analyst Charles O’Shea. The rise is part of a wider trend affecting sectors across Moody’s coverage that has retail replacing oil and gas as the most-troubled industry. Retailers are in the midst of a secular shift to online sales led by juggernaut Amazon.com Inc.

                                   and that’s forcing many of them to spend heavily on their e-commerce operations. At the same time, mall traffic has slowed dramatically as consumer behavior changes, forcing many to discount heavily, hurting profit margins. See also: Nike and Coach are fighting Amazon by creating stores that appeal to all the senses The 19 issuers on Moody’s list have more than $3.7 billion of debt maturing in the next five years, with about 30% of that total coming due by the end of 2018. The number is even higher when private credit is included. Read now: From a risk-of-bankruptcy standpoint, the retail business is the new oil and gas “While credit markets continue to provide ready access for companies spanning the rating spectrum—allowing many to proactively refinance debt and bolster balance sheets—that could change abruptly if market conditions or investor sentiment shift,” said O’Shea. The increase in distressed retailers comes after a long period of low interest rates, during which sponsor activity speeded up to meet investor appetite for yield. Each leveraged buyout cycle tends to produce a new pool of B2/B3 companies, a number of which inevitably get downgraded to Caa, said O’Shea. That was the case for Claire’s Stores Inc., J. Crew Group parent Chinos Intermediate Holdings A Inc., Tops Holding II Corp., and Rue 21 Inc., all of which now have weak credit metrics after taking on high levels of leverage to fund buyouts. LBOs almost always start life with high leverage, because sponsors are incentivized to minimize equity and maximize debt in each deal to ensure their own returns. “These companies are frequently challenged from the start, with weak credit metrics,” said O’Shea. “Exacerbating this is the cadence of distributions to boost sponsor returns that typically follow, pushing the leverage envelope. When a highly leveraged company faces operating difficulties, Caa is the usual result.” That makes companies more vulnerable to default if credit markets tighten, as they tend to tap external sources of uncommitted capital to fund maturities. Moody’s is expecting the overall speculative-grade default rate to fall to 3.5% in January 2017 from 5.8% last January. It did not provide a default rate forecast for retailers alone. But Fitch Ratings said recently it expects the default rate for the sector to spike to 9% in 2017 from its current 1% trailing 12-months level. S&P Global Ratings, meanwhile, said the majority of outlooks across retail and restaurants are stable but the ratings trends are negative. “Shifting consumer preferences and patches of global economic and policy uncertainty are contributing to the increasingly negative outlook bias,” the agency said in a recent report. The main factors causing downgrades are stressed liquidity, weak credit profiles, challenged competitive positions, sponsor ownership and erratic management structures, said Moody’s. Anytime there is a sudden change in the C-suite, credit risk rises and the rise will be exacerbated if there is no clear successor in sight.

A bigger pool of low-rated retailers also poses challenges for their stronger competitors, he said. “As they struggle to survive, distressed retailers can take more desperate measures, including highly promotional pricing that can border on irrational. This leaves stronger firms with the choice of either competing in a race to the bottom, or giving up sales in order to preserve margin.” See also: Sears is ‘one sick puppy,’ and there may be no remedy Other retailers on Moody’s list include Sears Holding Corp.

,03092017,Reuters,03022017,"Cincinnati-based Kroger said, excluding fuel, sales from stores open for at least a year fell 0.7 percent, widely missing analysts’ average estimate of a 0.1 percent rise, according to Consensus Metrix. Kroger blamed the decline on deflation. This was Kroger’s first quarterly same-store sales drop since the first quarter of 2003, raising concerns it is losing customers to rivals. Price competition in the industry has been increasing, with Wal-Mart reportedly running a new price-comparison test to knock out competition from German discount grocery chain Aldi Inc [ALDIEI.UL] and Kroger. Kroger has become more promotional and aggressive on some pricing as sales were softer, CEO Rodney McMullen told analysts on a call. “There is no doubt several competitors are improving and running better stores ... it’s much broader than just Walmart,” he added. Kroger, whose chains include Ralphs and Fred Meyer, forecast full-year earnings of $2.21-$2.25 per share, the midpoint of which meets analysts’ average estimate of $2.23, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We are disappointed in the comparable number and are starting to wonder how Kroger will get anywhere near its long-term outlook for 8-11 percent earnings per share growth in today’s environment,” Goldman added. The No. 1 U.S. supermarket chain said it expects full-year same-store sales excluding fuel to either remain flat or rise as much as 1 percent, short of the 1.2 percent rise analysts had estimated. Kroger’s shares, which had already taken a 4 percent hit this week after news of Wal-Mart and Target’s pricing strategies, were down 3.2 percent at $31.01 in morning trading. The company earned 53 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 28, beating the average analyst estimate by one cent. Net sales rose 5.5 percent to $27.61 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $27.31 billion. ","

Carol M. Kopp,03092017,Investopedia,03022017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs If you’re considering retiring abroad, Puerto Rico ought to be on your radar. Of course, Puerto Rico isn’t “abroad.” It’s an American territory. And that is not the least of the five reasons some Americans choose to retire to this particular sun-kissed Caribbean island. The reasons:  If you have any money invested, Puerto Rico will help you make the most of it. The island government’s Act 22, or Individual Investors Act, exempts residents entirely from taxes on dividends, interest and capital gains. For U.S. citizens to qualify for the exemptions, Puerto Rico must be their real home – they must reside in Puerto Rico at least 183 days of the year. The island’s government recently extended the program to Puerto Rican-born people now living in the states, in hopes of luring successful Puerto Ricans back home. There’s another tax-related benefit for Americans living in Puerto Rico. Since it is part of the United States, albeit with a unique status, the “double taxation” penalty for American citizens living abroad does not apply to those who live in Puerto Rico. (Under current law, American citizens must file U.S. taxes no matter where in the world they live. Many expats have to file both in the U.S. and in the countries where they live. By agreement with the U.S., most countries deduct U.S. taxes paid from any taxes owed by expats. But many expats, particularly those with higher incomes, still must pay taxes to both countries.) Never forget that Puerto Rico is a United States territory. Although Spanish remains the first language, English is widely spoken. You don’t need a residency permit to live there. The U.S. dollar is the currency. The electric plugs are the same. And as a U.S. territory, your Medicare card is as good in Puerto Rico is it is on the U.S. mainland. Many familiar brand names are on display there, too, for better or worse. Puerto Rico has more Walmart and Walgreens stores per square mile than anywhere else on Earth. A Google Maps search plots 19 Starbucks cafés in the San Juan area. Puerto Rico’s economy is struggling with nearly $70 billion of debt. A financial rescue bill signed by President Obama on June 29, 2016, has put the island's finances under a federal oversight board and has allowed some debt restructuring. A long, hard recession and inflation have been among its many problems and many professionals have left the island for better-paying jobs elsewhere. Yet Puerto Ricans still enjoy a lower cost of living than mainland Americans. The cost of living is more than 11% lower than the aggregate for the U.S., according to 2016 figures compiled by Numbeo.com. (Compare San Juan with a city where you live.) A breakdown of everyday costs shows big price differences within those bottom-line numbers. Real estate prices are relatively high, and beachfront property particularly so, but property taxes are comparatively low. Grocery prices are high, since most food has to be shipped to the island. But a gym membership in the business district in San Juan costs $45 a month, according to a breakdown on Expatisan.com. Best of all, home rental prices are lower even in the best neighborhoods. A furnished, 900-square-foot rental in an expensive neighborhood of San Juan averages $1,674, according to Expatisan. In a “normal” neighborhood, the average price for the same size furnished apartment is $933 (figures from August 2016). Did we mention that Puerto Rico is a tropical paradise? This could have been the top item on the list, but it’s a bit obvious. Warm weather is a constant year-round, with little seasonal variation. Temperatures in San Juan and its other coastal areas average in the mid-80s to 90 or so in the daytime, cooling to the mid-50s to about 70 degrees overnight. If that’s too hot for you, the island’s hilly center provides a cooler climate, along with a more rural atmosphere. Temperatures can even plunge into the 40s during the mid-winter nights. Wherever you are in the U.S., Puerto Rico is quicker and easier to get to than most other places that can compete as retirement destinations. A non-stop flight from Miami to San Juan takes under three hours. The flight from New York is about four hours. Puerto Rico has many of the advantages – along with the economic challenges – of its neighbors in Latin America and the Caribbean. This most recently includes the Zika virus, which is in many parts of the Caribbean and most recently has spread to sections of Florida. All the same, Puerto Rico's unique status as an American territory can make it particularly attractive to Americans looking for an affordable place to retire. It also makes the transition to a new home easy.

Annie Pei,03092017,CNBC,03022017," The man who called the bottom for gold now warns it could be time to fade one of the hottest commodity trades of the year. In December, when gold was trading around $1,130 an ounce, Carter Worth, of Cornerstone Macro, predicted the yellow metal could soon move higher. Since his contrarian call, gold has rallied 8 percent, driving the gold-tracking ETF GLD up by the same amount. But as the dollar has gained momentum, the economy has shown signs of strength and the odds of a March rate hike have increased in recent weeks, gold has dropped almost 2 percent. That coupled with a deteriorating technical backdrop leads Worth to believe a perfect storm could be brewing for the commodity. On a chart of GLD, Worth looks at both the uptrend and downtrend lines for the ETF. GLD's recent fall corresponds with a downtrend line that began in May of last year, suggesting that the metal will fail to rise above the line. Moreover, gold has also fallen below an uptrend line that appeared when the metal began its rally, suggesting that gold's run may be done. ""[My bet is] that we're going to move lower here,"" Worth said Friday on CNBC's ""Options Action."" ""This is just the beginning of a period of further weightness.""Given the fundamental and technical factors behind a drop in gold prices, Mike Khouw of Optimize Advisors on ""Options Action"" suggested buying the GLD May 116-strike puts and selling the GLD May 107-strike puts for a total of $1.35 per share. Should GLD close below $113.75 on May 19, more than 2 percent from current levels, then Khouw would profit from his trade.

Written by Karen Gilchrist; Reporting by Claire Fournier,03092017,CNBC,03022017,"General Motors' chief executive has refuted claims that the sale of its European Opel business was prompted by the Republican's proposed border tax policies. The U.S. car manufacturer will continue to distribute its iconic Chevrolet and Cadillac brands in Europe and will be on the lookout for ""future collaborations"" in the region, Mary Barra told CNBC Monday. Asked by CNBC if the deal was driven by the border tax, Barra responded: ""This (deal) is really focused on the synergies that we found in Europe across the board and really the two companies fit together quite nicely."" Her comments come hours after the firm agreed to sell its European manufacturing arm Opel to rival PSA Group, maker of Peugeot and Citron. The announcement had prompted claims that GM has shied away from the region due to proposals by the new Trump administration to impose punitive tariffs on importers into the U.S. President Donald Trump has spoken at length about lowering the tax burden on U.S. businesses. Meanwhile, Republicans in the House of Representatives have also proposed a reduction in U.S. statutory corporate tax which would likely lead to the introduction of a U.S. border tax adjustment, although plans are as yet unconfirmed. The 2.2 billion euro ($2.3 billion) deal will increase PSA Group's sales volumes by 40 percent and accelerate the firm's market share to 16 percent, leapfrogging Renault and bringing it closer in line with Europe's market leader Volkswagen. The deal sees GM remain in ""collaboration"" with PSA via 670 million euro ($709 million) share warrants, Barra added, insisting that the companies could work together in Europe despite competing in other regions. ""We understand that there'll be a point in time where that may indeed occur but we're also seeing areas to collaborate. ""I think if you look at business now there's many different businesses, even outside of this industry, where in some places you collaborate and some places you compete.""

Giovanny Moreano,03092017,CNBC,03022017,"The second-strongest bull market in history may be about to hit a wall as inflation ticks up, a feat that in the past caused stocks to underperform, according to Jefferies. ""Higher inflation has not been a good thing in the past for equity markets, as performance generally weakens as inflation rises. A faster pace of rising inflation could bring about more rate hikes, which also weakens returns,"" Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies, wrote in a research note. In a study released Thursday, the investment firm analyzed the market's performance going back to 1948 versus measures of inflation and found an inverse correlation between the two variables. ""As inflation ticks higher, small, mid, and large [cap companies] tend to weaken and vice versa. Inflation heading higher means that interest rates should also rise, and thus valuations for equities falls,"" McCarthy wrote. In a relatively short period of time, Jefferies says inflation has climbed higher and could continue on its uptrend through the rest of the year.

One of Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) biggest focuses over the past year has been reigniting its growth in e-commerce. It's taken several initiatives, including acquiring Jet.com for about $3.3 billion in August. But the acquisition, as well as a partnership with Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) haven't been able to push Wal-Mart's online sales growth rate past Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN). That's despite the fact that Amazon's online sales base was about seven times larger at the end of 2015. As more and more consumer spending moves from brick-and-mortar retail to digital storefronts, Wal-Mart's ability to grow revenue depends heavily on its e-commerce sites. But Amazon -- with its Prime membership flywheel -- is proving extremely difficult to overcome. Here's how Wal-Mart's e-commerce platform performed in 2016, what's driving its growth, and what Wal-Mart is doing to compete in 2017. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce sales growth outpaced Amazon's fourth-quarter North American sales growth, and Wal-Mart was sure to tout that in its earnings release. Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce sales improved 29% in the fourth quarter, and gross merchandise volume increased 36.1%. That's better than Amazon's 22% increase in North American sales. But instead of presenting global e-commerce sales and gross merchandise volume growth in its fourth-quarter release, as it has done in all three of its previous earnings reports, Wal-Mart only provided U.S. growth. It saved the global numbers for the earnings call. The table below should make it fairly evident why. Calendar Quarter Wal-Mart e-Commerce Revenue Growth Wal-Mart e-Commerce GMV Growth Amazon Retail Sales Growth Q1 2016 7% 7.5% 25.6% Q2 2016 11.8% 13% 28.8% Q3 2016 20.6% 16.8% 26.7% Q4 2016 15.5% 17.5% 20.6% Data source: Company's quarterly reports and earnings calls. Wal-Mart's global e-commerce revenue returned to deceleration after only a couple of quarters of acceleration. That fourth-quarter number includes its first full quarter of Jet.com sales, as well. Additionally, Wal-Mart's reported growth percentages are on a constant-currency basis (Amazon's are not), so it's seeing a slight benefit from its overseas sales as the dollar strengthens. There are several major factors that impacted Wal-Mart's online sales last year. Here's a quick rundown of the highlights. Wal-Mart continues to make new efforts in 2017, such as its recent announcement to offer free two-day shipping on select items. That's a shot directly at Amazon. Despite all of its initiatives and acquisitions, however, Wal-Mart's sales growth is still lagging Amazon's globally. That points to the huge moat around Amazon's operations, which is led by Amazon Prime. ","
      
    Wal-Mart Still Can't Keep Up With Amazon -- The Motley Fool

Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) have come to dominate U.S. retail. While that size is a testament to the company's historical success, lately it hasn't been much of advantage. Shopping habits are shifting as more people buy online, and Amazon.com has been rapidly outgrowing Costco and Wal-Mart lately, and even surpassed Costco in revenue last year. Confronted with the threat of e-commerce, Costco and Wal-Mart have chosen different strategies. Costco has largely doubled down on the warehouse/membership model, opening new stores and resisting omni-channel services that have become common at other retailers, and the company just announced it would raise its membership fee this year. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has transformed its strategy, acquiring Jet.com to get a jump-start in e-commerce and slowing down new store openings to invest instead in e-commerce, higher wages and better training, and improving its current store base. Let's take a closer look at these two retail behemoths to see which is the better buy today. Image source: Motley Fool. Costco shares sold off following the company's recent earnings report as it missed estimates on all accounts. The warehouse retailer posted a respectable comparable sales increase of 3%, but earnings per share actually shrunk from $1.24 to $1.17 as merchandise costs rose 6%, wiping out a similar increase in sales. The sell-off shows how Costco's premium valuation makes it vulnerable in a way that peers aren't. The warehouse chain has fared better than competitors recently as comparable sales continue to tick higher, but there have been pockets of weakness. Sales growth has slowed, and sales per square foot, a measure of how efficiently it's using its real estate, declined last year. The company has resisted ramping up e-commerce operations, with CFO Richard Galanti telling investors last year that it would not implement a buy online-pick up in-store program because the company's goal was to bring customers into the store. Costco's ""treasure hunt"" model means the company often gets incremental sales from customers walking through the stores. While other retailers are shuttering stores or holding back on growth, Costco has maintained its growth pace. The company has opened 13 warehouses through the first half of the year, and looks set to match last year's total of 32 for the full year, growing its store footprint by 4%. If sales per square foot continue to fall and same-store sales keep moderating, that strategy could become a problem. Image source: Wal-Mart In recent years, Costco has skated relatively unscathed past the industry challenges, but the same hasn't been true for Wal-Mart. A few years, the retail giant was seeing same-store sales fall, and the chain often ranked at the bottom of customer satisfaction surveys. CEO Doug McMillion has sought to right those wrongs by raising wages, revamping employee training, investing to clean up and spruce up stores, and building out the company's e-commerce business. As a result of those efforts, the company has now seen nine straight quarters of increasing comparable sales, reaching a peak of 1.8% in the fourth quarter. E-commerce sales growth has also recovered with the help of the Jet.com acquisition as online sales growth reached 29% in the recent quarter, up from single digits earlier in the year. However, all those investments have cost the company on the bottom line. In fiscal 2017, Wal-Mart's operating income fell 5.6% to $22.8 billion, and adjusted EPS fell 6% from $4.59 to $4.32. The company expects earnings to be flat this year, forecasting EPS of $4.20-$4.40. For fiscal 2019, Wal-Mart expects earnings to grow 5%. In other words, Wal-Mart investors will have to be patient with the company's new strategy. Both retailers find themselves in challenging positions today as shopping patterns shift. Costco has the better momentum of the two as its stock has outperformed Wal-Mart in pretty much every timeframe over the last decade, but investors are paying up for its shares. They currently carry a P/E valuation of 32, pricier than almost any other big retailer. Wal-Mart trades at a valuation of just half of that at 16, and offers the better dividend yield at 2.9% versus just 1% for Costco. While I'd be cautious with either one of these stocks given the challenging retail environment today, Wal-Mart looks like the better pick of the two. The company is aggressively shifting strategy to compete with Amazon and grow its business, and it's also cheaper and pays a better dividend. Costco shares, meanwhile, could slide if sales growth continue to decline. ","
      
    Better Buy: Costco Wholesale Corporation vs. Wal-Mart -- The Motley Fool

Jeremy Bowman,03092017,Fool,03022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Give Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) some credit. After years of being asleep at the retail wheel, under the leadership of CEO Doug McMilllon, the company is finally responding to the biggest threat it faces: Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Over the past year or so, Wal-Mart made several decisions to make itself more competitive as retail shopping patterns shift. The company raised its minimum wage to $10/hour and revamped its training and promotion process in an attempt to improve store performance. The decision seemed to be a result of management's realization that operating a bare-bones business to keep prices down and squeeze out profits is no longer a viable long-term strategy. Wal-Mart's customer satisfaction scores have long lagged the industry, a sharp contrast to those of Amazon and rival Costco Wholesale, which rank at the top of the retail sector. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart also took the bold step of acquiring the start-up e-commerce business Jet.com for $3.3 billion last summer. Some critics derided the move, saying Wal-Mart overpaid for a company that was barely a year old, while others called it an ""acqui-hire,"" implying that Wal-Mart bought the company just to bring founder Marc Lore on board. But Wal-Mart has deep pockets, and it needs to ramp up its e-commerce business as fast as possible. Already the move seems be having a positive effect, as Wal-Mart's e-commerce growth accelerated to 29% in the fourth quarter, up from just single digits earlier in the year. Strategically, the company is also becoming more aggressive as it unveiled free two-day shipping for orders over $35, a move that prompted Amazon to follow suit, lowering its free-shipping minimum to match Wal-Mart. Since it purchased Jet, Wal-Mart has made some smaller e-commerce acquisitions and aggressively expanded its online grocery pickup program. The company also sharply scaled back new store opening this year in order to invest in its current store base and improve e-commerce operations. The strategic shift is clear. Like Amazon, Wal-Mart is showing it's willing to sacrifice profits to build its business for the long-term. Profits shrunk this year due to the wage hike, and they are expected to remain flat. Management has projected them to grow modestly next year. However, while becoming more like Amazon by embracing e-commerce, sacrificing short-term profits, and improving the customer experience is the right thing to do for the business, it may not do much to push Wal-Mart's stock higher. That's because investors perceive the two stocks differently. Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos told investors he was building a company for the long-term from its inception. Though his business has put up scant profits throughout its history, investors have made it one of the most valuable companies on the market. Amazon has continued to hold a triple-digit earnings valuation as it has consistently delivered strong revenue growth, and developed valuable competitive advantages in areas like e-commerce and cloud computing that are expected to translate into profits over the years to come. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, is valued as a traditional retailer. It carries a P/E ratio of 15, which seems fair for its growth prospects and competitive position. Wal-Mart's shareholders own the stock because it has been a reliable dividend payer, not for its growth prospects. Amazon has earned the right to be treated as an exception. Wal-Mart has not. Even as the company transitions to challenge Amazon more directly, the stock is unlikely to move higher unless the company can demonstrate strong revenue or profit growth, which seem likely to be modest over the coming years even with the aggressive moves recently. Making Wal-Mart's situation even more challenging is the near certainty that Amazon will continue to expand and enhance its operations. Wal-Mart may be paddling faster, but the water's only rising. Investors may want to consider Buffett's wisdom. The upshot for Wal-Mart shareholders seems to be that the company will continue to make needed improvements, but it will likely be years before the stock sees a significant response to those efforts.

Neha Chamaria,03092017,Fool,03022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Gates' primary source of wealth has, of course, been Microsoft, but if you think he has parked the bulk of his money in Microsoft stock, you're as far from the truth as one can get. In fact, Microsoft isn't even part of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust's 18-stock portfolio! Bill Gates is a revered philanthropist. Image source: Getty Images. Before I reveal which stocks belong in the charitable venture's portfolio, you should know that Gates is more than just a business magnate -- he is among the world's most revered philanthropists today. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is testimony: As of the fourth quarter of 2015, it had made grant payments worth $36.7 billion since inception to combat diseases and alleviate poverty worldwide, among other social causes it champions. It's fascinating how a visit to Africa turned Gates toward philanthropy, but that's a story for another day. What's important to know is that Gates has been passing on a good chunk of his money to his foundation since establishing it with his wife, Melinda, in 2000. This task is entrusted to wealth manager Michael Larson, who manages both Gates' personal wealth and the endowments of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust via private firm Cascade Investments. Cascade doesn't publicly disclose its numbers, but the trust's portfolio can give you valuable insight into Larson's investment style -- or I might as well say Gates', as the endowments comprise Bill and Melinda's donated assets and Buffett's contributions. Yes, you guessed it right: Buffett is one of the trustees of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which isn't surprising given that the organization really found its footing in 2006, when Buffett pledged $30 billion in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) stock, to be spread over years, to support Gates' philanthropic causes. As Bill and Melinda put it in the foundation's 2017 Annual Letter addressing Buffett, ""It was the biggest single gift anyone ever gave anybody for anything. We knew we owed you a fantastic return on your investment."" By ""return,"" they mean all the ways they're helping improve lives across the globe. It isn't an easy task, but Larson ensures that the endowments are primarily invested in stocks that can generate good returns to support the foundation's charitable goals. While Bill and Melinda haven't disclosed their investment policies in detail, they're specific about not investing in ""companies whose profit model is centrally tied to corporate activity that they find egregious,"" such as tobacco stocks. Their investing style, though, closely resembles that of Buffett's. In other words, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust's portfolio is chock full of fundamentally strong companies with wide moats and sustainable competitive advantages. Most are dividend payers, too, much like Buffett stocks. According to the latest update, the trust has about $19 billion invested in stocks, of which nearly $15.6 billion comes from just five companies. Here they are, ranked according to their weighting in the portfolio. 1. Berkshire Hathaway (59.43%) 2. Waste Management Inc. (NYSE:WM) (6.95%) Waste Management's stock has more than doubled in the past decade, proving that trash can be valuable, too. While Waste Management's business of hauling, disposing, and recycling trash is resilient to business cycles, its unparalleled landfill network acts as a formidable barrier to competitors. Not surprisingly, Waste Management's margins were intact even during recessionary periods. WM Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. To top that, Waste Management has raised its dividend for 14 straight years, currently yielding 2.3% -- the highest among its peers. Today, Waste Management owns and operates the highest number of landfills, waste transfer, injection, and recycling facilities in the industry to serve more than 21 million customers across the U.S. and Canada, giving it a moat like no other. With the company also boasting best-in-class returns on invested capital of about 8%, it's no surprise the stock has made it into Gates' trust's portfolio. 3. Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) (6.07%) Railroad isn't the kind of industry to grow gangbusters, but the economy could come to a standstill if rail stops transporting goods. This ""essential"" nature of the business is perhaps why Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought Burlington Northern Santa Fe in its biggest deal ever in 2009, and why Canadian National Railway is in Gates' portfolio. Between Cascade Investments and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates is the largest shareholder in the Canadian railroad today. Why Canadian National Railway, of all railroads? As the only transcontinental railroad in North America, spanning three key coasts over 20,000 miles of track, it has the widest coverage area among its peers. Canadian National is also the most efficient railroad as measured by the operating ratio, and it generates boatloads of cash flows, a good portion of which go to shareholders. It recently increased its dividend by 10%, marking its 21st consecutive year of dividend increases. CNI Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts. Best-in-class efficiency and margins, and double-digit returns on equity and invested capital, make Canadian National a great buy-and-hold stock, the type Buffett and Gates prefer. 4. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) (5.49%) Gates recently told CNBC that he believes in ""the philosophy that Warren Buffett has put forth that you can find great companies and invest in them, then the macroeconomics can go up and down and the basic value of what you are holding on to there will be maintained throughout that."" That explains why Caterpillar is part of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust's investments despite the massive headwinds facing the company in recent years. Caterpillar is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and locomotives. This dominant position in a highly capital-intensive industry is a perfect ingredient for a moat, in addition to the indomitable brand image Caterpillar has built for itself during its 90 years of existence. The industry stalwart has even paid a dividend every year since 1925, currently yielding 3.3%. Caterpillar may not be in the best shape right now, but its leadership and brand power position it well to benefit tremendously as the mining and oil and gas sectors revive. 5. Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) (4.22%) With Buffett selling almost his entire stake in Wal-Mart in recent quarters, this is perhaps the most interesting of the top five stocks in the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's portfolio. Whether Larson will also exit the stock is anyone's guess, but why Wal-Mart made it into the portfolio in the first place isn't tough to figure out. Image source: Wal-Mart. With nearly $500 billion in sales, Wal-Mart is not only the largest retailer, but is the largest company in the world by revenue. Wal-Mart's commitment to shareholders is unquestionable: It's a Dividend Aristocrat, having raised its dividend for 44 straight years. The retailer has returned a whopping $55 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the past five years, and it yields 2.9% currently. Wal-Mart is doing its part to catch up with the e-commerce wave, but Amazon is proving a tough nut to crack. However, Wal-Mart continues to generate solid free cash flows -- about $18 billion for the trailing 12 months -- and boasts double-digit returns on equity and invested capital. The road ahead may not be easy for Wal-Mart, but Larson isn't losing faith in the retailer just yet. Clearly, stocks in Gates' trust are leaders in their own right. Going by the rich rewards shareholders in the above five stocks have reaped over the years, you may want to track the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust's investments going forward, if you aren't already doing so.

Target (NYSE:TGT) bought something extremely valuable last week when it released its outlook for 2017. It bought time. Three years, to be specific. The cost came directly out of the pockets of investors, though, and Target's stock plunged 12% following the company's fourth-quarter earnings report. Target told investors it's heading into a year of investment, and it won't return to profit growth until 2019. If that sounds familiar, it's because Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) told a similar story to investors in 2015. Shares of Wal-Mart faced a similar double-digit percentage-point drop when it announced its plans. Target plans to spend $7 billion to remodel stores, expand its small-store format, drive online sales growth, and lower its prices to compete with Wal-Mart and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Overall, it expects the investments to cost the company $1 billion in operating profits this year. While Target has no pressure to grow profits in the short term, will its investments pay off in the long run? Image source: Target While Wal-Mart and other brick-and-mortar retailers lowered prices to compete with Amazon.com, Target raised prices the past few years. In fact, Target's sales declines over the past few years would have been much worse if Target hadn't focused on higher-priced, higher-margin products. But now it's reversing direction, and it's hoping to drive greater foot traffic with lower gross margin. Target will work to lower prices over the next three years to compete with the pricing of Wal-Mart (which recently made its own efforts to lower prices even more) and Amazon. ""We are aggressively investing in the business to make sure we are highly competitive on price across our assortment,"" CEO Brian Cornell told investors. In an effort to drive higher foot traffic, it's also remodeling stores. It expects to remodel 600 stores by 2019, and each remodel will cost around $5.5 million, according to management. Target also plans to open 100 new smaller format stores in cities and on college campuses. While Target's remodels should help drive same-store-sales growth into positive territory again, those sales will come at a lower gross margin. It's hard to see how Target's bottom line benefits from all this new spending, even in the long run. One bright spot at Target is the growth of its digital sales. Digital sales increased 34% in the fourth quarter, well ahead of the growth of Wal-Mart or Amazon. But Target is growing off a much smaller base than its competing retailers. Digital sales amounted to just $3.4 billion last year for Target. By comparison, Amazon sold $124 billion worth of stuff online in 2016. Target plans to compete by revamping its supply chain and using stockrooms at its stores to ship directly to customers. With 1,800 stores in the U.S., that makes it extremely competitive with Amazon. Amazon only has a few dozen fulfillment centers, but they're very strategically located, as 44% of the U.S. population lives within 20 miles of an Amazon fulfillment center. Wal-Mart is working on something similar and recently started offering free two-day shipping on about 2 million products sold online. Of course, that pales in comparison with the selection of Prime-eligible products on Amazon. But Target again suffers from the same conundrum as Wal-Mart when it comes to attracting more online sales. Amazon is at the top of people's minds when they think of online shopping. Overcoming that hurdle is much more important than improving fulfillment speeds at this point. Target's plans to spend $7 billion over the next three years are bold, and given the current trend of sales declines, the company could use some shaking up. It's certainly feeling some pain in the short term as it resets expectations. It's unclear, though, if its plan to invigorate long-term growth will actually pay off. But that $7 billion and massive drop in market cap bought Target three years to prove the doubters wrong. ","

Quentin Fottrell,03092017,MarketWatch,03022017,"Published: Mar 2, 2017 4:59 p.m. ET Take a deep breath when you come face-to-face with the company head By The chief executive of Uber gets into an Uber… It sounds like the beginning of a bad joke, but that’s what happened to Travis Kalanick, the chief executive and co-founder of Uber Technologies Inc. He took an Uber with friends on Feb. 5 and got into a shouting match with the driver over his company’s policies. The argument was captured on the dash cam of Uber driver Fawzi Kamel in San Francisco. In it, Kamel complains about how Uber’s lower fares have hurt his income. “I lost money — $7,000 — because of you,” Kamel said. “I’m bankrupt because of you.” Kalanick shot back: “Bulls—! …Some people don’t like to take responsibility for their own s—.” On Tuesday evening, Kalanick apologized for his behavior and said he needed to “grow up.” (You can view the video here.) Clearly, there are no winners in this particular situation, but it raises an important question: What do you do if you have complaints about your company and you find yourself face-to-face with your boss in a café, elevator or even an Uber? “We should all have an elevator speech ready for our executives or our boss,” says Tim Sackett, president of HRU Technical Resources, an information technology and engineering staffing firm in Lansing, Mich. But the employee should have a statement or question that requires an answer. Or, even better, an idea. “Have you ever thought of…?” It should be an idea or question that can be answered fairly, yet in a way that positions you as someone who wants to be a part of the solution. “That answer will set you up for future success,” he says. Don’t miss: ‘The Mary Tyler Moore Show’ tackled workplace sexual harassment And if you see a big problem in the company, whether it’s one of policy or culture, tell the truth. Remember that scene in “Working Girl” where Melanie Griffith’s character (Tess) proves that she came up with the idea for a company merger? She took her moment and, in this context at least, gave her character Tess her Hollywood ending. Before that, of course, she crashed a society wedding and pitched the idea to the head of a fictional company. (Not to be recommended.) Real life is rarely so simple, but there’s a lesson in that confident and opportunistic approach, says Steve Langerud, workplace consultant and principal of Steve Langerud & Associates in Grinnell, Iowa. “Be clear, factual and solution-oriented,” he says. And brief. There may be less than a minute before one of you has to go. “If you had the CEO in an elevator use a simple structure to think about what you would start, stop, and continue doing to help the organization succeed.” It could be explaining a big idea, as Tess did in the movie, or it could be a valuable piece of advice, framed as a compliment rather than a criticism. “The Uber employee was right to share his experience. Bosses want to be successful and improve. Hearing from employees and customers downstream from decisions is critical to tweaking performance. This was a great opportunity for Uber that went south.” Also read:  From the Oscars to the Oval Office, tweeting and texting at work is catching flak “All CEOs want to hear what’s really going on in their companies, because they mostly get watered down, filtered versions from those who report to them directly,” Sackett says. “If we know this, the Uber driver might have gained favor and more time if he would have said, ‘I have some feedback I would really like to share with you directly on my experience as a driver.’” And if the conversation goes well, Sackett says, you could finish up with, “Can you give me a way to connect with you at a time when you’re ready to talk business?” Of course, having a conversation when either party is in a relaxed social setting or at the end of a long night may not be appropriate. “Employees should have a voice and I admire employees who have the courage to speak up,” says New York-based work place expert and digital marketer Piera Palazzolo. “However, if you want to have a fruitful exchange, you shouldn’t start by accusing someone. You immediately put the person on the defensive and they might stop listening. Now, while the driver embarrassed the CEO, I’m not sure he got his real message across.” Either way, she says, don’t wait until tomorrow to say what you want to say.

Caitlin Huston,03092017,MarketWatch,03022017,"Published: Mar 7, 2017 2:47 p.m. ET Saint Francis High School in California invested $15,000 in seed round By A private high school in California earned millions from the Snap Inc. public offering, after two students told their dad about the popularity of the app five years ago. Saint Francis High School in Mountain View, Calif., invested $15,000 in Snapchat’s seed round when the dad, Lightspeed partner Barry Eggers, invited the school’s board to participate in the seed round with his firm.

According to media outlets, Saint Francis sold two-thirds of its 2.1 million shares at the company’s $17 issue price, bringing in close to $24 million. Lightspeed invested $485,000 in the round. The firm sold at least 4,632,890 shares in the offering, bringing in about $78.8 million. Lightspeed still owns 81,996,629 shares, according to the prospectus, and has voting rights associated with its stock. The school invested in the round as part of its SF Growth Fund, an investment fund created for the school by parents and the school’s former president. See also: After Snap, more unicorns to Wall Street, but with horrible terms The school said it would be investing and managing the proceeds within the school’s endowment. The goal is to use the money toward the school’s strategic plan, which it says strives to “make Catholic education more affordable and accessible” and to bring on new staff, among other initiatives. “This incredible boon will not, by itself, completely fund the goals of the strategic plan, but it will help lay the necessary foundation and give us a remarkable head start,” Simon Chiu, president of the school, wrote in a news release.

Eggers approached the school about an investment after he saw his daughter and her friends sitting around the kitchen table “absorbed in their phones,” Eggers said in a blog post. Both she and his son confirmed that they used the app several times a day to message friends. Eggers then went to Stanford University to meet with Snap co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy. Ten days later he made the seed investment, with participation from the SF Growth Fund. “While I’ve enjoyed Snap’s journey with my partners as an early investor, I have the unexpected bonus of sharing the experience with my children,” Eggers wrote in the blog post. Lightspeed has also invested in App Dynamics, which agreed to be sold to Cisco Systems Inc.

                                    said this week it will raise its basic membership fees by $5 starting June 1, putting its “goldstar” individual membership, business and business add-on memberships at $60 per year, up from $55. Executive memberships will now cost $120, up from $110. But with that increase, Costco is also raising its maximum annual 2% reward to $1,000 from $750 for that membership. This is the first time Costco has increased its membership since 2011. The increase shouldn’t be a problem for the most diehard Costco customers, said Sucharita Mulpuru, chief retail strategist at Shoptalk, which hosts commerce events. The shopper who could afford the former $55 annual fee and the average cost of a Costco basket at check-out is already an affluent customer, she said. “These are customers who will pay $5 for a latte and not think twice about it,” she said. “I just don’t think they’ll drop their Costco membership because of this modest price increase.” (Costco said the price increase will affect about 35 million members. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) Many shoppers, particularly those with large families, are likely to save enough over the course of a year to offset the $60 cost, said Courtney Jespersen, a retail expert at the personal finance company NerdWallet. For instance, Costco offers significant discounts on its pharmacy items for members, said Brent Shelton, an online shopping expert at deal aggregator FatWallet.com. (Sam’s Club also has a pharmacy for its members with about the same discounts as Costco’s, but membership for that program costs $100 per year.) “If you or your family are in a position that you require a lot of prescription medicines, then a Costco membership can be one of the most valuable investments you’ll make,” Jespersen said, noting that even with insurance, not all prescriptions are covered for consumers. Diapers, wipes and formula are some of the other products that prove most cost-effective, and bulk-buying obviously means parents need to take fewer trips to the store. Costco also offers items other big-box stores do not, including gasoline, and even car rental discounts and vacation packages through Costco Travel, which is available to all members, Shelton said. Tires, wine, movie tickets, Nutella, gift cards, Extra Virgin olive oil and pure vanilla extract are some of the best deals at Costco, said Kyle James, the founder of the coupon and deal-finding site Rather-Be-Shopping.com. Others say shoppers who might already have been on the fence about whether their membership might want reevaluate, Jespersen added. After the price increase, Costco will be $15 more than rival $45 Sam’s Club’s standard membership (which doesn’t include the pharmacy discounts) and $10 more than the $50 membership at BJ’s stores. Sam’s Club online also has a partnership with the cash-back site Ebates, offering shoppers 1.5% cash back, whereas Costco does not participate in that program, Shelton said. If shoppers aren’t going to use Costco as their primary store, “You may want to think twice if you’re going to get the value back out of it,” Jespersen said. After all, big box stores Target

And not everything you buy at Costco or other warehouse stores will necessarily be cheaper, despite the reputation for low-cost prices, MarketWatch reported last year. Meats, such as bacon and chicken breasts, are often great buys at warehouse clubs (freeze whatever you don’t use), as are some kitchen appliances, but books, compact discs, and DVDs are often cheaper online; and condiments and perishables will obviously spoil if you don’t use them early. With or without memberships, some studies show that when you spend time in stores and touch the products, you are actually more likely to buy them. Merely touching an object results in an increase in perceived ownership of that object, one University of California, Los Angeles study found. “If you think everything’s a good deal, you might be tempted to overspend,” Jespersen said. And Costco isn’t the only retailer that offers deals, so consumers would likely benefit by shopping around before making a significant purchase, Jepsen added. And fewer people appear to be want to visit standalone big box retail stores, a December 2016 report by consulting firm Deloitte found. The number of those who said they planned to shop at big box stores during the 2016 holidays fell to 59% from 63%. And it’s not just big box stores: Those who plan to visit traditional malls fell to 50% from 53% over the same period. “Online shoppers are not just browsing either,” the report said. Those polled said they plan to spend just as much online as they do in physical stores. Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

It opened a cashierless Amazon Go convenience store, where customers scan their mobile phones at a kiosk upon entering, pick sensor-tagged items and see the tally charged to a mobile payment account. Also read: 12 ways to save on your rising grocery bill In an interview, Hjelm discussed the imperative to make store shopping more like online shopping—cutting wait times and creating a more interactive experience—with technology such as the Internet of Things, data analytics and video. Edited excerpts follow: WSJ: Which technologies are key to Kroger now? HJELM: We’re in the midst of deploying our video-management system, with new cameras that are all digital, and analytics technology to understand what we’re seeing. We’re running a pilot to do service queuing for the pharmacy, meat department or deli. It isn’t like everybody stands in a nice line, like they do at checkout. People come from the left side, they come from the right side. We can use video to not only detect how many are there but how long they’ve been waiting. If you’re a pharmacist, your head is down at the computer, working. We can alert you right on your display that you’ve got a customer who’s been waiting for 60 seconds and no one’s talked to them yet. So those little paper ‘Now Serving’ numbers don’t cut it? Customers get frustrated. They may have been there second, but they don’t get served until third. Or, if they are waiting too long, they can sometimes walk away. We can use this data to analyze what is the appropriate wait time. Stores are big and complicated. We need to make them simple. How is Kroger changing stores? We’re helping customers create “favorites” lists on our mobile app. We want to make sure they’re taking advantage of digital coupons. We’re expanding ClickList, which is a system to let you order online and pick up in a store. It’s in 441 stores now. We just launched same-day order and pickup. We’re testing delivery, as well. How viable is Amazon’s cashierless idea? It’s neat. Certainly, it’s doable. In a constrained, convenience-store format with a very limited set of product, it makes it a lot easier. But there are complexities, like making sure you deal with bad customer behavior — people who put items back into the wrong slots. I haven’t seen it yet, but I certainly will the next time I’m in Seattle. Will Kroger go cashierless? We have Scan, Bag, Go, which is a shopping solution where you use a wireless hand-held device and scan items. You bag them as you go, the way you want them bagged. Then you stop at checkout to pay and we send you on your way. I shop that way a lot. It’s in about 15 stores around Cincinnati. So with Scan, Bag, Go, we are kind of there. We’re now integrating mobile payment credentials, so you can avoid that last checkout step in the process. How else can stores use data to interact with consumers? We’re testing digital shelf edges in 14 stores. Sensors can detect when someone is walking down the aisle [with Kroger’s mobile app open]. I can highlight products for you on a high-definition display on the shelf edge. Let’s say you’re gluten-free. In the nutrition-bar section, I can highlight for you the gluten-free products. Or I could show you on the shelf your personal price for a product. Or highlight that bottle of wine on your shopping list. You’ve told me what you like and what you want. I know what’s in the aisle, and I can fuse all that data to create a magical experience. We’re working on it; it isn’t deployed yet. Kim S. Nash is a senior writer for CIO Journal in New York.

,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"About 6,700 pizzas sold under Wal-Mart’s Marketside brand were affected by the recall, a representative of the supplier said on Thursday. RBR Meat Company recalled about 21,220 pounds of Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza that were shipped to retail distribution centers in California, Nevada, Utah and Washington, the USDA said on Wednesday. The product carries the code 20547. Wal-Mart and the USDA said they were unaware of illnesses linked to the pizzas. The retailer said it started removing the products from its shelves and inventory as soon as it received notice of the recall from Rose & Shore, a food company affiliated with Vernon, California-based RBR. The pizzas were available in California, Colorado, Nevada, Washington state, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska and Hawaii, Wal-Mart said. Sam’s Club was not affected. People should not eat the pizzas, according to the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service. It said RBR discovered the possible listeria contamination during routine sampling. Listeriosis is a serious illness caused by eating food contaminated with listeria bacterium, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The infection is most likely to sicken pregnant women and babies, adults older than 65, and people with weakened immune systems. An estimated 1,600 people contract listeriosis each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC. In an unrelated case, the CDC is investigating a multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to the consumption of soft raw milk cheese made by Vulto Creamery that has led to two deaths. ","

,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"(Reuters Health) - - For current and former smokers, eating more fruits and vegetables may lower the risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a Swedish study suggests. Among more than 40,000 men, the current smokers who averaged five or more servings of fruit and vegetables daily were 40 percent less likely to develop COPD than smokers who ate two servings or less. Each additional serving of fruits and greens was tied to an 8 percent risk reduction. “All smokers and former smokers should eat as much fruits and vegetables as possible,” said lead author Joanna Kaluza of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. “Each extra serving of fruit and vegetable decreases significantly risk of COPD development,” Kaluza told Reuters Health by email. COPD is a category of lung diseases that make breathing difficult and can cause wheezing or coughing. The most common types of COPD are emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and they most often occur in smokers and former smokers. The antioxidants found in produce might help to protect lungs from smoking damage, the researchers write in the journal Thorax. The team studied data on 44,335 middle-aged and older Swedish men. None of the men included in the analysis had been diagnosed with COPD at the first assessment. At the start of the study, the participants completed questionnaires detailing how often they ate different types of foods, including fruits and vegetables, as well as their smoking history. Researchers followed the men from 1998 to 2012 and used a patient registry to determine if they were diagnosed with COPD during the study period. Almost two thirds of the men were current or former smokers and 1,918 were diagnosed with COPD by 2012. The research team divided participants into five groups according to how many servings of fruit and vegetables they ate daily. The top fifth ate more than five servings per day, while the bottom fifth ate less than two servings daily. After separating them again by smoking status, researchers found a significantly lowered risk of COPD tied to high fruit and vegetable consumption among smokers and former smokers, but not among never-smokers. Ex-smokers with high consumption of greens were 34 percent less likely to develop COPD than ex-smokers with low fruit and vegetable consumption, and each additional serving was tied to a 4 percent drop in COPD risk. When researchers analyzed the types of produce tied to lower COPD risk, they found an association with apples, pears, leafy greens and peppers but not with berries, citrus, tomatoes or onions. We rely on antioxidants, such as those found in fruits and vegetables, to defend our lungs against harmful substances in cigarette smoke and air pollution, said Seif Shaheen, a professor of respiratory epidemiology at Queen Mary University in London who coauthored an editorial accompanying the study. However, Shaheen stressed that diet is not a cure-all for the effects of smoking. “The most important thing you can do to reduce your chances of getting COPD is not to smoke/to stop smoking,” he said by email. “Eating more fruit and vegetables is likely to be beneficial for your health in many ways, and for smokers who can’t stop smoking this may help to reduce your risk of getting COPD,” added Shaheen, who was not involved in the study. “High fruit and vegetable consumption not only reduces the risk of chronic lung disease, but also cardiovascular disease, cancers, helps to keep proper body weight and other benefits,” Kaluza noted. “It is possible for everyone to include more fruits and vegetables in their diet,” she said.

,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"Britain’s No. 3 supermarket said on Monday it will offer its 135,000 store staff a base rate of 8.50 pounds ($10.39) an hour from October, up from 7.44 pounds. The new rate is 1 pound above the government mandated National Living Wage increase which comes into effect April 1. The new contract will require Asda staff to work in different parts of stores and different days or hours, including public holidays. All breaks will also move to being unpaid. Asda’s move comes as the Bank of England is closely watching a pick-up in inflation for signs it might fuel higher pay settlements. Asda said that 95 percent of current employees will be better off if they move to the new contract. If they do not, their base rate will move up to the minimum national rate of 7.50 pounds and they will retain their existing contract. However, a trading update last month showed it had stemmed the pace of sales decline, suggesting new CEO Sean Clarke’s focus on pricing and product quality was starting to have an impact. ","

,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"(Reuters Health) - Neighborhoods with a high proportion of black residents or high poverty tend to have the greatest density of stores selling cigarettes and tobacco products, U.S. researchers say. Poverty explained some of the association, but an urban planning concept, neighborhood “stability” - including the proportion of homes that are rented versus owned - accounted for most of the link, the study team reports in Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. “The neighborhood you live in shouldn’t determine how much cancer-causing product is present in your day-to-day life,” said lead study author Joseph Lee of East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina. “The tobacco industry spends a large portion of its advertising budget at retailers, so when we see differences by neighborhood, that’s a big investment by the tobacco industry,” he told Reuters Health. There are about 375,000 stores in the U.S. that sell tobacco products, Lee’s team writes. In 2014, U.S. stores contained an average of 30 tobacco ads, they add. Cigarette smoking causes about 480,000 deaths each year in the U.S., which is about one of every five deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Previous studies looking at the density of tobacco stores have mostly focused on small geographic areas, so it’s difficult to tell if the patterns are widespread the authors write. They calculated the density of 90,400 tobacco outlets in 97 counties across the nation to get a broader picture. These 97 counties contain 79 million people, or about a quarter of the population, the authors note. Across all counties, the average density of tobacco shops was 1.3 per 1,000 people. But as neighborhood income fell, density of tobacco shops rose. It also rose as the proportion of the neighborhood’s residents who were African American increased. In addition, a high proportion of vacant housing units or a high proportion of rental units were tied to sharp rises in the density of stores selling tobacco. Neighborhoods with a high proportion of Hispanic, white or Asian/Pacific Islander residents did not display changes in tobacco store density relative to race or ethnicity. “Environmental factors, including the location and density of tobacco retailers, have an influence on behaviors,” said Joanna Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Tobacco Control at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, who wasn’t involved in the study. “The more accessible a product is, the more likely consumers are to purchase it,” she told Reuters Health by email. “This further contributes to the high toll of tobacco on racial and socioeconomic health disparities.” Plus, Lee said, in neighborhoods with more tobacco outlets, stores are more likely to run price discounts and promotions, which boosts the advertising exposure and often prompts smokers who are thinking about quitting to buy another pack. “Each time kids go to the store for a snack, to pay for gas, or to pick up bread and milk, they’re getting a dose of advertising,” Lee added. “Any gas station has a wall of tobacco products behind the register, and that makes them present, visible and normalized.” One limitation of the study is that it doesn’t differentiate between types and sizes of stores, such as gas stations, grocery stores, pharmacy chains, alcohol stores, convenience stores, newsstands and the discount department store Walmart, which could affect density, the authors write. In recent years, policy changes have aimed to prevent the sale of menthol and flavored cigarettes near schools in Chicago, San Francisco and Baltimore. Other policies have suggested removing cigarettes from pharmacies and selling little cigars and cigarillos in bundles rather than singles to increase cost, said Phillip Gardiner of the University of California in Oakland, who wasn’t involved in the current study. “Smokers - especially young kids - are price sensitive,” he said. “We know that as price goes up, consumption goes down.” “When used as advertised, smoking kills,” Gardiner said. “The tobacco industry is promoting it, and that’s not right.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2m6xiRW Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, online March 1, 2017.

Craig Adeyanju,03162017,Investopedia,03092017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Analysts at Merrill Lynch retreated a Buy rating, at an $88 price target, on Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) in a recent report obtained by 24/7 Wall St. (See also: Wal-Mart Has $320M Plan to Win Back Brazilians.) The brokerage firm noted Wal-Mart’s better-than-expected comps growth in the fourth quarter as a sign of strength in a very competitive retail landscape. WMT reported comps of 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter, driven by a 1.4 percent increase in traffic, also comfortably beating consensus expectations of 1.3 percent. Target Corp. (TGT) reported Q4 comps decline of 1.5 percent, worse than the 1.4 percent consensus expectation. Kroger Co. (KR) reported a comps decline of 0.7 percent, versus the 0.1 percent growth that analysts expected. In addition to the 1.4 percent traffic growth at WMT’s established stores, Merrill Lynch believes that a Q4 36 percent gross merchandise value growth in the retailer’s U.S. ecommerce business, as well as positive comps in grocery sales despite the current food price deflation, instill confidence that WMT’s main U.S. strategy will continue to yield results in 2018. Merrill Lynch also noted that WMT is about to start seeing a sustainable 20 percent to 30 percent growth in its e-commerce business, pointing out four drivers. First, the brokerage firm said WMT’s strategic acquisition of Jet, which came with Hayneedle, as well as the acquisition of Shoebuy and Moosejaw, gives the retailer access to new technologies and more ritzy customers. Second, Merrill Lynch pointed at the retailer’s e-commerce marketplace expansion from 8 million items in Jan. 2016 to over 35 million items as of the last earnings call. Third is the expansion of the free two-day shipping on orders worth $35 or more to over 2 million items. Fourth is the planned extension of online grocery pickup to about 1,200 stores in 2018 from the current 600. Shares of Wal-Mart closed at $70.72, up 1.09 percent from the preceding closing price, on March 14. Based on Merrill Lynch’s $88 price target, WMT stock has roughly 24.4 percent upside potential.

Heidi Chung,03162017,CNBC,03092017," A confluence of decreasing foot traffic at brick-and-mortar stores and the potential for a border adjustment tax has sent retail stocks sinking this year, and that has one trader ringing the alarm on the beaten space. ""Retail is a train wreck,"" Dan Nathan of RiskReversal.com told CNBC's ""Fast Money"" on Thursday. The XRT retail ETF is down 4 percent in 2017 and hit a year-to-date low this week. ""The XRT might be the worst chart I have ever seen."" Looking at a long-term chart of the XRT, Nathan warned of what ""looks like a classic head and shoulders top forming."" Traders typically see this type of pattern as a possible indication of more trouble ahead for a stock. Retail has been in a precipitous decline over the last two years, falling more than 17 percent from its March 2015 high. According to Nathan, there's one name in the retail space that options traders are eyeing for even more pain: Target. The big-box retailer has gotten crushed after reporting weaker-than-expected earnings amid growing online competition. ""All the gaps [in the chart] tell you something about the visibility and competition,"" he said.Nathan noted that put volume was two times that of calls during Thursday's trading session. One trader bought 1,000 of the April 52.5-strike puts for 75 cents.

Annie Pei,03162017,CNBC,03092017," Renowned technician John Bollinger, creator of Bollinger Bands, believes that the charts are pointing to even more highs for stocks, meaning that the so-called Trump rally isn't over yet. Friday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation,"" Bollinger commented that while positive expectations surrounding President Donald Trump's proposed policies have driven the market so far, the technicals behind the market are just as strong. The technician is referring to two charts in particular, with the first being the NYSE composite advance-decline line. The indicator, according to Bollinger, is ""the number of advancing stocks each day [over] the number of declining stocks,"" which has pulled back recently. The second features Bollinger's own indicator, Bollinger Bands, which jointly measure recent prices and volatility in order to derive potential levels of support and resistance. While the S&P 500 has been doing a ""walk up the upper band,"" which indicates that the market may be overbought, the fact that the advance-decline line has moved alongside the S&P leads Bollinger to believe that there's room yet for the market to advance.""You can see that the S&P 500 has been marching up the upper band, that's that low-volatility advance that you were talking about, and the advance-decline line has been confirming every single tick of the S&P,"" said Bollinger. ""So until we see some divergences there, I don't think there are a lot of reasons to be too worried about this market.""But should those divergences occur, they would be red flags for the bulls. The first of the divergences, according to Bollinger, would be if ""changes in leadership"" did not occur in the market. The technician believes that small-cap stocks, in particular, would be an indicator of such a leadership change.""Small-cap stocks did really well in the post-election rally, so we'd look for them to start doing well again,"" he said. ""If that didn't happen, then that would be a reason to worry.""Otherwise, Bollinger believes that two other red flags could occur in the market, including a ""buildup"" of stocks suddenly hitting new yearly lows. The final indicator, according to the technician, would be if the advance-decline line started to ""roll over"" and head down, an indication that more stocks were declining rather than climbing on a daily basis.The S&P 500 is currently up almost 6 percent year to date.

Giovanny Moreano,03162017,CNBC,03092017,"The second-strongest bull market in history may be about to hit a wall as inflation ticks up, a feat that in the past caused stocks to underperform, according to Jefferies. ""Higher inflation has not been a good thing in the past for equity markets, as performance generally weakens as inflation rises. A faster pace of rising inflation could bring about more rate hikes, which also weakens returns,"" Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies, wrote in a research note. In a study released Thursday, the investment firm analyzed the market's performance going back to 1948 versus measures of inflation and found an inverse correlation between the two variables. ""As inflation ticks higher, small, mid, and large [cap companies] tend to weaken and vice versa. Inflation heading higher means that interest rates should also rise, and thus valuations for equities falls,"" McCarthy wrote. In a relatively short period of time, Jefferies says inflation has climbed higher and could continue on its uptrend through the rest of the year.

A JPMorgan analyst was behind the decline Monday after saying the company would need more than just a change at the top to turn around the underperforming stock. ""Further discussion of a CEO transition does not change our standing view that GE is an expensive stock, and we believe that a change would likely bring with it an imminent reset that would further reinforce our thesis,"" wrote JPMorgan's Stephen Tusa on Monday. The ""facts are cash is weak, margins/share of customer wallet are already at entitlement, the sum of the parts valuation points to a low 20s stock price, not even considering tax and GE corporate accounting dis-synergies, with businesses that are too big to be take-outs, in our view."" Tusa rates GE underweight with a $29 a share 12-month price target. The shares were down a little more than 1 percent in midday trading on the NYSE.

Matt Clinch,03162017,CNBC,03092017,"Months of spin and political rhetoric will culminate in Dutch voters heading to the polls this week, with investors contemplating what the general election could mean for their portfolios. Using hedge fund analytics tool Kensho, CNBC conducted a study to show how stock indexes in Europe perform following Dutch elections. The data shows the average return following 11 different elections in the Netherlands, which date back to the early 1980s. The figures show that the AEX index, which was derived from Amsterdam Exchange index in 1983 and is composed of 25 securities, usually falls in the two sessions immediately after a general election. The data also show that it has traded negatively for 56 percent of the time and has an average return of -0.31 percent. Rival benchmarks in Belgium and Germany also traditionally follow the AEX lower, the historical data shows, although the French CAC 40 and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 are largely unaffected. Meanwhile in the currency markets, Kensho data shows that Dutch elections can provide a fillip for foreign exchange crosses in the region. Over the five previous Dutch general elections since 2000, both the euro-U.S. dollar cross and the sterling-U.S. dollar cross have traded positive 100 percent of the time on the day of these elections. Although this historical data might inform this week's trades, it's worth noting that the wave of populism across the Western world is likely to complicate matters this time around. Geert Wilders, who has been called the Netherlands' Donald Trump, has seen early momentum ease off but his Party for Freedom is still poised to secure the second-largest number of seats in parliament. Nonetheless, Mary Pieterse-Bloem, the global head of fixed income at ABN AMRO Private Bank, told CNBC Monday that investors are not ""running scared at all"" from Dutch assets. ""With respect to the Netherlands, I don't think there is all that much to fear in respect to the Dutch government bonds,"" she said, adding that their scarcity would add to their attractiveness as part of a wider portfolio. She added that, more generally, ABN AMRO is advising clients to be ""underweight"" bonds in a larger cross-asset allocation and have a small ""overweight"" on equities.

As CNBC PRO pointed out before that better-than-expected report, Boeing had a track record of being the best Dow performer on days when the nonfarm payrolls number exceeds the estimate by a large margin. With expectations building for another blowout report Friday, CNBC PRO expanded its Kensho search to the whole S&P 500 in order to find more stocks that tend to be good buys when the job market is exceeding expectations.

Traders don't expect another blockbuster like that, but they wouldn't be surprised, especially after the strong ADP employment report this week, to see another nice number.

Daniel B. Kline,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When a company moves from being a start-up to becoming a more mature operation, it often loses some of what made it great in the first place. Once infrastructure, systems, and layers of management have been put in place, it becomes more difficult to charge forward, sometimes simply because it's harder to change direction when steering a larger ship. Both Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have been mature companies for a long time, but the two chains are each taking clear steps to make sure the entrepreneurial spirit has a place in their organizations. Wal-Mart has done so by putting Marc Lore, the serial entrepreneur who led Jet.com, which Wal-Mart purchased for $3.3 billion, in charge of its digital operations. Starbucks has taken a different approach, having both a dedicated executive in charge of leading entrepreneurial efforts and putting its outgoing CEO, Howard Schultz, in charge of its start-up effort to launch a premium brand. Wal-Mart ships online orders from fulfillment centers and its stores. Image source: Wal-Mart. In giving Lore the keys to its digital operations, Wal-Mart changed its entire way of thinking. That became evident when Walmart.com made the bold move of eliminating its $50-a-year membership, which gave customers access to unlimited two-day shipping, and replacing it by making that perk free for any qualifying order over $35. That move screams start-up. It's a money-losing action that will hurt the bottom line, but which should build audience share over the long term. That's the kind of thing Lore did at his previous start-up, Quidis (which owned Diapers.com), and at Jet.com, because in order to compete in an online retail market dominated by Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), you have to disrupt conventional thinking. Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon arguably bought Jet.com as much to secure Lore's services as he did to acquire its technology or customer base. The CEO also seems willing to allow his new hire to operate in the fashion he has become known for. ""If Marc can be Marc within this company, then great things are going to happen,"" McMillon said at the company's October investor day conference. Schultz actually built Starbucks as we know it from the ground up as an entrepreneur and he has clearly tried to keep that spirit alive over the years as his company has remained a pioneer, even as it became a global behemoth. This has led to failures like the company's soda line and its efforts to have an afternoon/evening menu, but it has also had great successes like the chain's technology. Starbucks was the first major restaurant brand to offer digital payment and mobile ordering, two technologies that are becoming standard across the industry. Those are some impressive feats, but Schultz clearly had an itch to go back to his entrepreneurial roots in a way he could not while running a company as large as Starbucks. To make that happen, he decided to leave his CEO job in order to take on a new challenge focusing ""on retail innovation and accelerating growth of Starbucks ultra-premium retail formats."" In his new job, Schultz plans to try to once again revolutionize how Americans drink coffee. The first time he did that he brought about his vision of a ""third place,"" after work and home, that became the cafe chain. Now he's going to develop the company's high-end Roastery and Reserve brands -- an entrepreneurial effort that attempts to build a wine-aficionado-like experience for coffee lovers on a global level. Schultz, however, is not the only person attempting to keep the start-up spirit alive at Starbucks. The company also employs Richard Tait, founder of the game company Cranium, as senior vice president and entrepreneur in residence. In addition to his own start-up journey, Tait spent years at Microsoft, where he also operated as an entrepreneur in residence, creating numerous start-ups within the company, according to his Starbucks biography. Tait's job, which he has held for almost a year, gives him a broad portfolio that includes ""helping the company foster a culture of innovation."" In addition, he is charged with applying ""an entrepreneurial lens to Starbucks operational planning and prioritization efforts across the organization, helping improve the speed and agility of decision-making."" On his LinkedIn profile, Tait calls himself ""Chief BoomBoom at Starbucks"" and describes his role as working with the company leadership to bring the ""energy and passion of a start-up inside the rhythm of a large corporation."" Tait reports to incoming CEO Kevin Johnson and also works in product development as part of the steering committee for Starbucks' Innovation Lab. In many ways, both Wal-Mart and Starbucks are following a path blazed by Amazon. The online retailer's CEO, Jeff Bezos, has famously and regularly used the phrase ""today is day one."" The company even named part of its Seattle office complex the ""Day One"" building, around the idea that the company is always a start-up. It's a philosophy that has empowered Amazon to act in its own long-term interest at the expense of quarterly results. Wal-Mart is clearly embracing the idea that continued growth requires breaking the mold and it has empowered Lore to make long-term moves that sacrifice short-term profit margin. Starbucks has always been a bit like Amazon as Schultz and Bezos seem to share a lot when it comes to vision, but Schultz's taking on a purely entrepreneurial role outside the core brand doubles down on that thinking. Add Tait to the mix and you can see that Starbucks' outgoing CEO wants to make sure that his company, no matter how big it gets, embraces the spirit that led to its growth in the first place.

"Brian Feroldi, Jason Hall, Rich Duprey, Jordan Wathen, and Dan Caplinger",03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, and George Soros have minted themselves a fortune by staying one step ahead of the markets. That's why we Fools like to dig through SEC filings each quarter to see what these brilliant investors have been buying or selling recently. After digging through those filings, our team of Fool contributors noticed that these investors have been selling off their positions in Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX), Transocean (NYSE:RIG), Seadrill Ltd. (NYSE:SDRL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Is it a good idea to follow suit? Image source: Getty Images. Dan Caplinger (Transocean): The offshore-drilling industry has been a tough place to make money lately, and many investors have started to lose faith in Transocean and its peers. Late last year, well-known activist investor and billionaire Carl Icahn slashed his position in Transocean, citing the need to take tax losses but also having suffered a dramatic decline in the value of the stock since his initial investment. Transocean and offshore drillers in general have been among the hardest hit in the industry, largely because the projects that rely on the company's drilling rigs tend to be more expensive than land-based exploration activity. When oil prices were above $100 per barrel, the higher potential reward made offshore drilling worth the effort, and that helped push demand for drilling equipment much higher. Yet when the energy market went into the tank, Transocean found itself with clients who no longer wanted to move full steam ahead on expensive offshore projects. In the aftermath, gluts of equipment have contributed to lower contract rates. Currently, Transocean is at a turning point. Current oil prices have rebounded somewhat, but they still aren't high enough to justify a return to full capacity. If oil rises further, then Transocean is in a position to recover its losses. But if oil sags, it could spell a long-term problem for Transocean and its growth prospects. Rich Duprey (Barrick Gold): Considering his track record lately, investors might not want to follow the moves billionaire investor George Soros is making these days, but he's not a billionaire for nothing. Soros Fund Management reportedly lost $1 billion betting against a market rally following Donald Trump's election and in the fourth quarter dumped all of its holdings in Barrick Gold, only to see shares of the miner surge this year. While it had jumped as much as 50% between its mid-December lows and the peak it hit mid-February, it's eased back a bit since, and investors should consider which way it will go from here. After all, Soros' biggest sin may have been simply selling too early -- but if we look at Barrick Gold's bigger picture, I'd say no, don't follow Soros' lead here. In its fourth-quarter earnings report last month, the gold miner reduced its all-in sustaining costs (AISC) to just $732 per ounce, or 40% below gold's current price. It shows that the cost-cutting initiatives Barrick has implemented are bearing fruit, and the gains are expected to accelerate this year, with AISC falling even further. The gold miner has paid off a good chunk of its long-term debt, and though it still carries some $8 billion worth on its balance sheet, there isn't much coming due anytime soon. Moreover, Barrick owns five core mines that should produce 70% of its volumes this year, with ore grades that are more than double that of the miner's peer group. It also expects to produce some 5.9 million ounces this year, or 5% more than in 2016. There's good reason to keep betting on gold generally and Barrick Gold in particular, and following George Soros in dumping your shares might just tarnish your portfolio. Brian Feroldi (Facebook): With a net worth of roughly $13 billion, Steven Cohen is one of the most successful hedge fund managers in the world. That's why it caught my attention when I found out that Point72 Asset Management -- one of Cohen's hedge funds -- dumped 96% of his position in Facebook in the fourth quarter. If you look at the numbers, you might be scratching your head as to why Cohen would want to give up on Facebook right now. Last quarter, Facebook's revenue surged 51% while expenses grew by only 29%. The difference caused margins to balloon and allowed EPS to more than double. Those are impressive figures for any company, let alone a megacap like Facebook. Given those terrific results, my hunch is that Cohen is worried that Facebook's revenue is going to significantly decelerate in the years ahead. That's a legitimate concern now that the company's ad load is leveling off. Furthermore, expenses are expected to continue to rise significantly as the company adds engineering talent. That could lead to a meaningful slowdown in profits. With shares trading near an all-time high, perhaps he wanted to cash in his chips while he could. Regardless of Cohen's move, I for one couldn't be more excited about Facebook's long-term potential. That's why I have no intentions to part ways with my shares anytime soon. Jason Hall (Seadrill Ltd.): After the company disclosed in its most recent quarterly earnings filing that Chapter 11 bankruptcy is on the table, investors of every ilk -- not just billionaires -- have been selling off shares of Seadrill. And for good reason, since the company is facing more than $1 billion in debt it must pay off between now and June, with hundreds of millions of it maturing at the end of April. As things stand today, the writing's on the wall that the company won't pay off that first debt maturity, which would put it in default on essentially all of its long-term debt soon after. Should you follow the rest of Seadrill's investors to the exits? Probably, yes, if you have capital at risk that you really can't afford to lose. The offshore-drilling industry remains an awful business right now. Offshore oil and gas producers are on track to spend less capital this year than anytime in the past decade-plus. There's still a chance that Seadrill can turn things around and come to terms with its debt holders, in which case today's price will end up being a bargain. If you're willing to take on that risk -- and acknowledge you could end up with nothing -- there's a case for staying invested. Just don't be shocked if it doesn't work out. Jordan Wathen (Wal-Mart): Warren Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, nearly blew out of its billion-dollar position in Wal-Mart in the most recent quarter. And while Wal-Mart may have been a small part of Berkshire's portfolio, few likely know more about Wal-Mart than Warren Buffett does. In May 2003, Berkshire Hathaway acquired a little-known Wal-Mart subsidiary known as McLane Company, a distributor of groceries and foods to stores all around the country. Shortly after that acquisition, in 2005, Berkshire purchased shares of Wal-Mart, perhaps having learned to appreciate the retailer's operations after observing it through McLane Company. More than a decade after Berkshire's investment, Buffett apparently wants out. Wal-Mart finds itself situated between fierce competition in grocery and general merchandise. In grocery, competitors such as Aldi, which has quietly opened more than 1,600 stores in the U.S., many of which are located in proximity to Wal-Mart stores, competes directly on price for core grocery items including milk and produce. In general merchandise, online stores such as Amazon.com have the lead in distribution and can deliver products directly to their customers' doors, often at a better price. Buffett has shared his praise for Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos, telling CNBC last May, ""We haven't seen many businessmen like him."" Keep in mind that Berkshire is awash in cash and prefers to leave gains unharvested rather than collect its winnings and pay taxes. That Berkshire is reassessing its stake in Wal-Mart should give shareholders pause about the company, and retail in general. ","
      
    Billionaires Are Dumping These 5 Stocks. Should You? -- The Motley Fool

Jeremy Bowman,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an unfamiliar position these days. The world's largest retailer, which put hundreds of mom-and-pop stores out of business with its superstores that offer rock-bottom prices, is now in a fight for its own relevance, playing catch-up to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Image source: Getty Images. After years of ignoring the opportunity in e-commerce, Wal-Mart finds itself playing second fiddle to Amazon, which now has a market cap nearly twice that of Wal-Mart's. In the last year, Wally World has taken steps to accelerate its e-commerce business by buying Jet.com, along with two smaller businesses, and rapidly expanding its online grocery pickup program. In many ways, Wal-Mart's struggles to overcome Amazon's advantages is similar to a battle between the leader and challenger in another industry -- Uber and Lyft. Uber was the first-mover in the app-based ridehailing industry, and is by far the leader in an increasingly fragmented space. It's valued at a whopping $68 billion, more than carmakers such as General Motors, Ford, and Tesla Motors, showing that investors have placed a premium on transportation rather than the car itself. Today, Uber is active in 81 countries and 581 cities around the world, including 209 in the U.S. Ridehailing seems like the type of industry that would lend itself to monopoly. Once a company like Uber builds up an army of drivers and gets thousands of passengers to download its app, it would seem to have the network effects and barriers to entry to block competition. But smaller ridehailing apps have crept into the mix. Lyft, the No. 2 ride-hailing company, has become Uber's principal challenger largely by positing itself as its cultural antithesis. Uber's brand is generally seen as bloodless and corporate, its logo draped in black. Lyft has positioned itself as the friendly ridehailing service, using hot pink as its principal color. For a while, Lyft drivers signified themselves by having hot pink mustaches over their cars' grills. Lyft, unlike Uber, allows passengers to tip, and encourages drivers to be friendly and make conversation with their fares. It also seems to treat its drivers better, and has not been subject to the protests and disputes that have become commonplace with Uber. Lyft aims for an overall different experience than Uber. That may have seemed like a minor detail, but in recent weeks a series of unforced errors have dramatically damaged Uber's already questionable reputation. First, a tweet accusing Uber of trying to break a temporary strike by New York cabbies at JFK airport went viral, prompting the hashtag #DeleteUber to start trending as thousands of users deleted their accounts and sent angry letters to the company. Later, a blog post vilified Uber for allowing rampant sexual harassment and a culture that demeaned women, and a video of CEO Travis Kalanick excoriating a driver was picked up by several media sources. Reports also emerged about software Uber created to undermine local regulations, and Kalanick is now reportedly seeking leadership counseling and searching for a COO. The narrative of Uber is a bad corporate citizen is now well established and has become a storyline in the media that will pop up every time there is a similar incident. Lyft wisely took advantage of Uber's mistakes. During the chaotic weekend of airport protests, Lyft responded to the Uber boycott by pledging to donate $1 million to the ACLU. In the wake of the Uber backlash, Lyft downloads surged into the top ten in the App Store with nearly 200,000 in one day -- a new company record. It was the first time Lyft's downloads topped Uber's, nothing short of a coup for a company valued at $5.5 billion, just a fraction of Uber's worth. As Uber retrenches and licks its wounds, Lyft is now reportedly seeking another $500 million in funding. Wal-Mart, with much greater profits than Amazon and a wealth of resources, is in a stronger position than Lyft, but the story above highlights one key way Wal-Mart can challenge Amazon as it attempts to build out its marketplace. Amazon isn't exactly vulnerable in the way that Uber is. The company has a stellar reputation with customers, but there are some who view it as overly cutthroat, and it has been known to step on its merchants' toes. Amazon's merchants have complained in the past about the company taking their best-selling products, and selling them itself, directly competing with the merchants and often undercutting them on price. For that reason, many merchants prefer selling on eBay, says Kevin North, CEO of Terapeak, an e-commerce analytics firm. eBay acts only as a marketplace and does not sell goods directly. Those merchants view Amazon ""very, very cautiously,"" he said. He sees an opportunity for Wal-Mart, saying it could win over merchants by being friendlier than Amazon and not competing with them. North added that merchants are still working for clarity from Wal-Mart on what kind of partner it would be. Wal-Mart has sped up its efforts to recruit vendors, but it's still going too slow. At the time of the acquisition of Jet.com, Wal-Mart had just 600 sellers, compared to Jet's 2,400 after just a year in business. Wal-Mart had been struggling with onboarding vendors previously, but acquiring Jet changes that. North called the Jet acquisition a ""game-changer"" for Wal-Mart in part because it brings on e-commerce mastermind Marc Lore, who founded Jet as well as Quidsi, which he sold to Amazon -- but also because it will help Wal-Mart ramp up its marketplace. The company has already upped the stakes by offering free two-day delivery on orders of $35 or more. Now it needs to aggressively pursue vendors, and eliminate the popular notion that Amazon is the only game in town when it comes to online shopping. Like Uber drivers, Amazon merchants are wary of the company's monopolistic ambitions, and are eager to spread their wares over multiple sites. As Lyft has found, there are benefits to being No. 2.

    To Challenge Amazon, Wal-Mart Should Follow Lyft's Example -- The Motley Fool

Leo Sun,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) went public in 1997 at $18 per share. A $2,000 investment would have been enough to buy 111 shares, and those shares would have split to 1,332 shares today -- which would be worth over $1.13 million. That explosive growth made Amazon one of the greatest multi-bagger growth stories of the past two decades. Yet Amazon continues to grow, soaring 50% over the past 12 months and lifting its market cap past $400 billion. Image source: Amazon. But after those big gains, investors might be wondering if it's too late to buy shares of this millionaire-maker stock. I believe it isn't, for six simple reasons. A common bearish argument against Amazon is that the stock looks too ""expensive"" at 174 times earnings. However, that view ignores Amazon's impressive earnings growth rate. Amazon grew its earnings per share by 292% in 2016, compared to 140% growth in 2015 and a net loss in 2014. Analysts expect Amazon's earnings to rise 49% this year and 75% next year. Based on those estimates, Amazon trades at just 67 times forward earnings -- which is reasonable relative to its growth rates. Amazon's key profit driver over the past few quarters has been AWS (Amazon Web Services), the largest cloud platform in the world. That platform lends out storage space, computing power, and software development platforms to massive customers like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), NASA, and the CDC. Last quarter, AWS revenue rose 47% annually and accounted for 8% of Amazon's top line. However, AWS' operating income rose 60% and brought in 52% of the company's operating profits thanks to its higher margins. That profit growth gives Amazon more freedom to expand its lower-margin marketplace businesses. A key part of that marketplace push is Prime, Amazon's prisoner-taking membership ecosystem which offers discounts, free shipping, e-books, streaming video, cloud storage, and other perks. The expansion of that ecosystem puts a lot of pressure on brick-and-mortar rivals like Wal-Mart and streaming video players like Netflix. Last October, eMarketer estimated that Amazon Video was adding users at a faster rate than both YouTube and Netflix. And last June, research firm CIRP estimated that Amazon's Prime customer base in the U.S. grew 19 million year-over-year to 63 million -- indicating that Prime shoppers outnumbered non-Prime shoppers. The study also found that Prime members spent about $1,200 annually on the site, compared to just $500 for non-members. Amazon is also expanding its Prime ecosystem into homes with cheap connected consumer electronic devices like the Kindle tablets, Fire TV set-top boxes, Echo family of smart speakers, Dash buttons, and DRS-enabled appliances. Image source: Amazon. Amazon has also taken steps to connect its Alexa voice assistant to other functions in smart homes and connected cars. Smart light bulbs, fans, thermostats, and locks already sync to Alexa and Echo. Amazon has also worked with Ford to sync newer vehicles to Alexa so users can control smart home devices from their cars or access their vehicles from inside the home. All these services help Amazon gather more data about its users' habits and reduces the friction in online purchases -- which gradually increases customer dependence on its services. Amazon's international marketplace business generated just a third of its revenues last quarter. That's why the company is expanding into new overseas markets like India, where it invested billions to challenge market leader Flipkart; and China, where it remains far behind market leaders Tmall and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD). Lastly, Amazon's closely watched logistics expenses will eventually fall with increased automation. We've already seen Amazon make progress here with thousands of warehouse robots and its own fleet of cargo planes, and its upcoming Prime Air drone deliveries could greatly reduce delivery costs further. Some skeptics might believe that widespread drone deliveries might not be feasible, but JD.com already launched ""thousands"" of delivery drones across rural China last November. The company stated that the test run, which was conducted during the massive Singles Day rush, went ""smoothly."" It's highly unlikely that Amazon can ever repeat its near 55,000% post-IPO rally. However, that doesn't mean that it's too late to get in on this millionaire-maker stock. I personally bought my shares when Amazon was in the low $600s, when many analysts called the stock expensive. The skeptics are still saying the same thing about the stock now, in the mid $800s, but I believe that it still has plenty of room to run. ","
      
    Is It Too Late to Get in on This Millionaire-Maker Stock? -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. RadioShack has filed for bankruptcy protection for a second time, with the company's owner immediately closing 200 stores, and considering its options for the remaining 1,300 it owns. At roughly the same time, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), another electronics retailer, has turned the corner in its battle for survival. Its earnings per share (EPS) rose dramatically, climbing from $2.30 in fiscal 2016 to $3.74 in the chain's fiscal 2017. In addition, its stock, which is currently trading around $45, has more than tripled since bottoming out in late 2012. That was enough for Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly to literally declare the company's turnaround efforts over. ""Since the introduction of Renew Blue in November 2012, we have improved the operating performance of the business dramatically,"" he said in the Q4 earnings release in early March. ""We now feel it is time to call Renew Blue officially over and launch our strategy for the next phase of our journey: Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue."" Those comments were released a week before RadioShack once again sought bankruptcy protection, raising the question as to why one electronics chain has succeeded while the other has failed. It's not a simple answer, as you will see below that both chains made many of the same moves. Best Buy has come back from the brink. Image source: Best Buy. Launched in 2012, Renew Blue was a road map to help Best Buy turn around its fortunes. At the time the plan was introduced, Best Buy was, like RadioShack, on the list of companies many expected to not survive, largely due to the internet and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) specifically. Its turnaround began because the company systematically attacked its weaknesses while building on its strengths. One key weakness was the fact that consumers did not see Best Buy as offering attractive prices. In a report the company shared in its Renew Blue presentation deck [opens in PDF], only 23% of consumers perceived Best Buy as having lower prices than its rivals while 56% of Amazon customers saw the online retailer that way and 71% of Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) customers believed it had the lowest prices. Best Buy aggressively addressed that by offering a price match program that let people pay the same price they would at top online competitors and ""local retailers,"" a category that includes Wal-Mart. That one move immediately removed the incentive for showrooming, that is, the practice of doing your research on a product at Best Buy but buying online or from another retailer. In addition to that major move, Best Buy did a number of things: Taken on its own, any one of these moves would probably have not been enough, but made together they left Best Buy with price-competitive stores that consumers had more reason to visit and a robust, easy-to-use digital presence. The company did not price match and its website, while it got some attention, was not made a priority in the way Best Buy's was. RadioShack also failed to articulate any clear reason for people to visit its stores aside from its long-standing function as a nearby option when you're missing cables or batteries and having them now trumps price in your mind. However, CEO Dene Rogers did share some info in the company's press release on the bankruptcy that shed some light on the steps it did take. ""In 2016, we reduced operating expenses by 23%, while at the same time saw gross profit dollars increase 8%,"" he said. ""Over the same time, we integrated FedEx pickup/drop-off into 140 RadioShack locations, delivered to customers over 700,000 Hulu login pins and sold more than a million RadioShack private brand headphones and speakers delivering high quality, value-based audio products to consumers across the country."" RadioShack management made some of the same moves that Best Buy did, yet it still failed. Some of that may be because it bet too heavily on Sprint as a partner. In addition, doing nothing to address consumer expectations on pricing certainly sent some business to Amazon, Wal-Mart, and even Best Buy. In the end, though, RadioShack may have been doomed by the fact that small, limited-selection stores are not the draw they once were now that people can simply go online and get nearly anything they need with two-day delivery. With the average RadioShack being roughly 2,400 square feet, it simply can't compete with destination chains like Best Buy that are 10 to 15 times larger on average. In its heyday, RadioShack succeeded because its many locations made it convenient for customers and it sold products that were interesting to look at, with many not being offered elsewhere. Add in being a source for things like blank cassettes, VHS tapes, and other accessories, the company filled a niche that does not exist any more. RadioShack has failed while Best Buy lives on to continue battling Amazon, because it may have outlived its usefulness without finding a new reason for being. Perhaps there was a pivot that could have saved the retailer (and maybe Blockbuster would still exist if it had become a chain of liquor store/vape shops) but non-extreme measures were always likely to end in this result.

Adam Levy,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's been a tough year for brick-and-mortar retailers trying to take on the growing popularity of e-commerce. In the fourth quarter last year, e-commerce accounted for 9.5% of all retail sales in the U.S., according to the census bureau. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been a huge beneficiary of the trend. Meanwhile, brick-and-mortar retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are working to catch up to Amazon. One big exception, however, is Costco (NASDAQ:COST), which would rather see customers come into its warehouse clubs. While that worked for a little while, Costco has started falling short of revenue and earnings expectations recently. In the fourth quarter, Costco fell short of analyst expectations for same-store sales growth and profit. Costco's membership model is often seen as well protected from Amazon, but that doesn't seem to be the case any longer. Image source: Costco. About a year ago, Costco CFO Richard Galanti said the only thing keeping him up at night is ""everybody in the world never wanting to leave their house and only typing stuff to order and get it at the front door."" While Costco has made some improvements to its online shopping platform, it's still holding back certain product features, like ordering online and picking up in the store. Galanti says it doesn't have room in its stores for in-store pickup anyway -- although Wal-Mart's Sam's Club was able to make it work. Costco doesn't think it's losing in e-commerce. It's currently attacking the ""low-hanging fruit,"" as Galanti put it. And that strategy is working. Online sales increased 11% to 12% last quarter. However, online sales totaled just $4.5 billion for the quarter -- 4% of total revenue. Membership fees generate the vast majority of Costco's profits as it sells its actual merchandise at razor-thin margins. But in the last few quarters, membership revenue growth has decelerated to around 5.5% from around 7%. Costco hopes to reaccelerate membership revenue growth by increasing its membership fees by 9% -- from $55 to $60 for its most popular rate. It's the company's first rate increase in five years. But as more shoppers are able to get what they need online, an increase in membership fees runs the risk of reducing gross membership additions and lowering renewal rates. Sam's Club memberships can be had for less than Costco ($45). Additionally, Wal-Mart.com just introduced free two-day shipping on two million items available online -- no membership required. Amazon Prime membership costs just $99 for unlimited two-day shipping, and includes video and music streaming among other bonus features. Importantly, Amazon Prime continues to prove its worth. Its video-streaming catalog is on par with premium cable networks, and its original series and films won multiple awards this past year. Its collection of Amazon-branded exclusives is expanding, as well, taking on Costco's Kirkland brand. For consumers facing a decision between Amazon Prime and a Costco membership, Prime continues to look more attractive. Meanwhile, the price hike at Costco makes it look slightly less attractive.

    Not Even Costco Is Safe From Amazon -- The Motley Fool

Rich Duprey,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Think of Costco (NASDAQ:COST) as a retail take on the razor-and-blade business model. The warehouse club essentially breaks even on the discounted food and merchandise it sells, but it makes up for it with the windfall it realizes on the membership fees it charges for the privilege of shopping its stores. Although Costco doesn't raise its fees often -- every three to five years, on average, and the last time it did so was in 2011 -- it just announced a new membership fee hike beginning on June 1. It may seem long overdue, but it could be the worst time for it and a move the warehouse club will regret. Image source: Getty Images. Where merchandise sales comprised around 98% of Costco's total revenues of $57.9 billion over the first six months of its fiscal year, membership fees amounted to about three quarters of its $1.7 billion operating income. It had 47.6 million paying members at the end of 2016, most of whom (some 77%) were individual Gold Star members; businesses made up the rest. Executive members, Costco's highest level of membership, who earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases up to a maximum reward of $750 per year, represent 39% of its membership base, and they also account for around two-thirds of its sales. Costco enjoys an amazing renewal rate, with around 90% of its paid members renewing every year. It's a testament to their loyalty to the warehouse club, and when you consider Costco is only increasing the Gold Star fee by $5 to $60 a year, with the business membership going up $10 to $120 annually, it doesn't seem like it should be a big deal. After all, the average Costco shopper has an average annual income of $85,000 and is more affluent than the medium- to low-income wage earners that patronize Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Its customers should be able to afford the nominal bump in fees and will even be rewarded since Executive members will see the maximum reward increased to $1,000 annually. Considering the quarter Costco just reported, it would seem now would be a good time to raise them, too. Net sales rose 6% as U.S. comparable-store sales increased 3% from last year, better than the 3% and 1% rise, respectively, it saw in the first quarter. It was also better than the 3% increase in sales it achieved a year ago when comps also rose 3%. However, now might not be the time to start raising costs on consumers. Costco's net income fell to $515 million from $546 million last year, as rising gas prices, investments in digital initiatives, and price cuts took a bite out of the bottom line. The problem is that Wal-Mart and other supermarket giants like Kroger (NYSE:KR) and even Target, are waging a war to retain and steal customers by cutting prices themselves. In particular, Wal-Mart, which has committed to being the discount destination for shoppers, reported one of its best quarters in more than four years, with revenues rising more than 1% to $130.9 billion on a 1.8% increase in comps, its 10th straight quarter with higher same-store sales. While that may appear to be an underwhelming performance compared to what Costco turned in, Wal-Mart is orders of magnitude larger than its rival, and it represents a significant gain for itself and over the competition. It could be that Wal-Mart stole customers from Kroger, as its own quarterly effort was a disappointment, but that just underscores why it is risky for Costco to be raising costs on its customers. Image source: Getty Images. For its part, Costco is dismissive of the competitive threat. While CFO Richard Galanti said the pricing actions by its rivals were ""formidable,"" he essentially also said that's something they have to worry about, not Costco. It wasn't cutting prices because of the competition, but rather because of independent decisions it made. Whether that will amount to a blind spot remains to be seen, but consumers across the board are proving to be more price-conscious. Fast-casual dining chains, for example, a niche that would serve a demographic intuitively similar to Costco's, has been almost uniformly beset by lower sales and profits as fast-food chains promote pricing deals. The low-cost price proposition of Costco's rivals just as the warehouse club raises prices could be the tipping point that causes it to stumble. It may seem to be only a de minimis increase in cost for Costco members, but it could be a price so high that new members may be unwilling to pay it.

    Here's Why Costco Shouldn't Be Raising Its Membership Fees -- The Motley Fool

  "
Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) opened its 100th warehouse in December 1992. A quarter-century later, the retailer generates $116 billion of annual business out of its 728 locations. Here are a few things you might not know about the world's second-biggest retailer by revenue. Image source: Getty Images. Costco is highly leveraged to the California market because of its high concentration of the retailer's biggest, most profitable warehouses. Almost one-third of its entire U.S. revenue came from that single state last year. And since the U.S. business accounts for over 70% of its operations, California plays an unusually large role in its global footprint. ""Any substantial slowing or sustained decline"" in this market, the company warns in its 10-K, ""could materially adversely affect our business and financial results."" Customer traffic gains have been the engine behind Costco's sales growth over the past decade. It handled a market-thumping 4% more member visits in each of the five years leading up to fiscal 2016, which helped produce comparable-store sales gains of 6% or better. Annual sales gains. Chart by author. That awesome streak ended last year, in part because its co-branded credit card switch produced a major disruption in membership renewals. Executives are hopeful that this will be just a temporary challenge, though, and renewal rates should climb back up above 90% over the coming quarters while bringing customer traffic levels higher as well. Rivals like Target (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) aim to stock as wide a selection of products as possible, but Costco deliberately takes the opposite tack. These retailers carry over 80,000 items while a typical Costco warehouse holds less than 4,000. By restricting selection to just the most popular, fastest-selling products, Costco can keep its expenses low through elevated sales volumes. In fact, the retailer moves through its inventory so quickly that in most cases it sells a product -- and receives payment for it -- before it has to pay its supplier. It can then use those savings to deliver prices that peers just can't match. Nearly all its earnings are generated by membership fees rather than the product markup that underpins most retailers' business models. That's why it's more useful to think of the company as a club engaged in subscription sales rather than a retailer interested in selling stuff. The approach makes for significantly lower profitability. Costco's gross profit margin is roughly half Wal-Mart's 26% of sales and even further from Target's 30%. The same is true on the bottom line, where the company is lucky to turn 2% of sales into net income, compared to 4% for Target and 3% for Wal-Mart. Yet Costco's earnings are much more stable since they're attached to recurring subscriber revenue and thus less exposed to swings in the economy. Especially considering its reliable profit stream, Costco delivers only a small portion of earnings to shareholders as dividends. Its payout ratio is about one-third of profits, compared to 50% for its retailing peers. One good reason for this skimpy capital return promise is that Costco is still aggressively expanding its store base and so there's less cash available to send right back to owners. On the other hand, its paltry 1% dividend yield understates its actual payout. Twice in the last five years it has issued a massive special dividend to investors, amounting to $7 per share in 2012 and $5 per share in 2015. ","

Also see: 10 best, 10 worst stocks in the eight-year bull market Each earnings season, numbers that dominate headlines are growth rates for comparable-store sales. But it’s also important to know whether sales have been juiced by promotional discounts, so investors need to consider gross profit margins, which are sales less the cost of goods sold, divided by sales. You can then look at net income margins, which are earnings divided by sales. But the problem with net income margin is that any company’s earnings can be skewed by one-time events. Amazon runs hardly any brick-and-mortar stores, so we’re going to exclude the company from our list of retailers that increased comparable-store sales while improving gross margins. The company’s sales for the fourth quarter were up 22% from a year earlier, but Amazon’s gross profit margin narrowed to 33.80% from 35.01% a year earlier. So the company paid a price for such stellar growth. Of the remaining 34 S&P 500 retailers, 17 reported increased comparable-store sales, and 11 of those improved gross profit margins. Here they are: Here’s how analysts view these retail sales winners: So it would appear that for most of the companies, analysts believe the stocks are close to being “fully valued.” However, analysts look out only 12 months with their price targets, a short period for a long-term investor, especially if the companies can continue their rapid sales growth. Here are total returns for the group, with dividends reinvested: As always, if you see any stocks listed here that you are interested in, it’s important to do your own research, hopefully with the assistance of a broker or investment adviser.

Those interactions, though, by his accounting, were “brief,” “banal,” “innocuous” and, ultimately, forgettable. A Democratic lawmaker from California, Rep. Eric Swalwell, contends that Stone, in fact, can be connected to Kremlin-related interests — as, according to Swalwell, can numerous other members of President Trump’s inner circle.

RBR Meat Company recalled about 21,220 pounds of Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza that were shipped to retail distribution centers in California, Nevada, Utah and Washington, the USDA said on Wednesday. The product carries the code 20547. Wal-Mart and the USDA said they were unaware of illnesses linked to the pizzas. The retailer said it started removing the products from its shelves and inventory as soon as it received notice of the recall from Rose & Shore, a food company affiliated with Vernon, California-based RBR. The pizzas were available in California, Colorado, Nevada, Washington state, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska and Hawaii, Wal-Mart said. Sam’s Club was not affected. People should not eat the pizzas, according to the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service. It said RBR discovered the possible listeria contamination during routine sampling. Listeriosis is a serious illness caused by eating food contaminated with listeria bacterium, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The infection is most likely to sicken pregnant women and babies, adults older than 65, and people with weakened immune systems.

,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"(Reuters Health) - - For current and former smokers, eating more fruits and vegetables may lower the risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a Swedish study suggests. Among more than 40,000 men, the current smokers who averaged five or more servings of fruit and vegetables daily were 40 percent less likely to develop COPD than smokers who ate two servings or less. Each additional serving of fruits and greens was tied to an 8 percent risk reduction. “All smokers and former smokers should eat as much fruits and vegetables as possible,” said lead author Joanna Kaluza of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. “Each extra serving of fruit and vegetable decreases significantly risk of COPD development,” Kaluza told Reuters Health by email. COPD is a category of lung diseases that make breathing difficult and can cause wheezing or coughing. The most common types of COPD are emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and they most often occur in smokers and former smokers. The antioxidants found in produce might help to protect lungs from smoking damage, the researchers write in the journal Thorax. The team studied data on 44,335 middle-aged and older Swedish men. None of the men included in the analysis had been diagnosed with COPD at the first assessment. At the start of the study, the participants completed questionnaires detailing how often they ate different types of foods, including fruits and vegetables, as well as their smoking history. Researchers followed the men from 1998 to 2012 and used a patient registry to determine if they were diagnosed with COPD during the study period. Almost two thirds of the men were current or former smokers and 1,918 were diagnosed with COPD by 2012. The research team divided participants into five groups according to how many servings of fruit and vegetables they ate daily. The top fifth ate more than five servings per day, while the bottom fifth ate less than two servings daily. After separating them again by smoking status, researchers found a significantly lowered risk of COPD tied to high fruit and vegetable consumption among smokers and former smokers, but not among never-smokers. Ex-smokers with high consumption of greens were 34 percent less likely to develop COPD than ex-smokers with low fruit and vegetable consumption, and each additional serving was tied to a 4 percent drop in COPD risk. When researchers analyzed the types of produce tied to lower COPD risk, they found an association with apples, pears, leafy greens and peppers but not with berries, citrus, tomatoes or onions. We rely on antioxidants, such as those found in fruits and vegetables, to defend our lungs against harmful substances in cigarette smoke and air pollution, said Seif Shaheen, a professor of respiratory epidemiology at Queen Mary University in London who coauthored an editorial accompanying the study. However, Shaheen stressed that diet is not a cure-all for the effects of smoking. “The most important thing you can do to reduce your chances of getting COPD is not to smoke/to stop smoking,” he said by email. “Eating more fruit and vegetables is likely to be beneficial for your health in many ways, and for smokers who can’t stop smoking this may help to reduce your risk of getting COPD,” added Shaheen, who was not involved in the study. “High fruit and vegetable consumption not only reduces the risk of chronic lung disease, but also cardiovascular disease, cancers, helps to keep proper body weight and other benefits,” Kaluza noted. “It is possible for everyone to include more fruits and vegetables in their diet,” she said.

The new rate is 1 pound above the government mandated National Living Wage increase which comes into effect April 1. The new contract will require Asda staff to work in different parts of stores and different days or hours, including public holidays. All breaks will also move to being unpaid. Asda’s move comes as the Bank of England is closely watching a pick-up in inflation for signs it might fuel higher pay settlements. Asda said that 95 percent of current employees will be better off if they move to the new contract. If they do not, their base rate will move up to the minimum national rate of 7.50 pounds and they will retain their existing contract. However, a trading update last month showed it had stemmed the pace of sales decline, suggesting new CEO Sean Clarke’s focus on pricing and product quality was starting to have an impact. ","

,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"(Reuters Health) - Neighborhoods with a high proportion of black residents or high poverty tend to have the greatest density of stores selling cigarettes and tobacco products, U.S. researchers say. Poverty explained some of the association, but an urban planning concept, neighborhood “stability” - including the proportion of homes that are rented versus owned - accounted for most of the link, the study team reports in Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. “The neighborhood you live in shouldn’t determine how much cancer-causing product is present in your day-to-day life,” said lead study author Joseph Lee of East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina. “The tobacco industry spends a large portion of its advertising budget at retailers, so when we see differences by neighborhood, that’s a big investment by the tobacco industry,” he told Reuters Health. There are about 375,000 stores in the U.S. that sell tobacco products, Lee’s team writes. In 2014, U.S. stores contained an average of 30 tobacco ads, they add. Cigarette smoking causes about 480,000 deaths each year in the U.S., which is about one of every five deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Previous studies looking at the density of tobacco stores have mostly focused on small geographic areas, so it’s difficult to tell if the patterns are widespread the authors write. They calculated the density of 90,400 tobacco outlets in 97 counties across the nation to get a broader picture. These 97 counties contain 79 million people, or about a quarter of the population, the authors note. Across all counties, the average density of tobacco shops was 1.3 per 1,000 people. But as neighborhood income fell, density of tobacco shops rose. It also rose as the proportion of the neighborhood’s residents who were African American increased. In addition, a high proportion of vacant housing units or a high proportion of rental units were tied to sharp rises in the density of stores selling tobacco. Neighborhoods with a high proportion of Hispanic, white or Asian/Pacific Islander residents did not display changes in tobacco store density relative to race or ethnicity. “Environmental factors, including the location and density of tobacco retailers, have an influence on behaviors,” said Joanna Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Tobacco Control at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, who wasn’t involved in the study. “The more accessible a product is, the more likely consumers are to purchase it,” she told Reuters Health by email. “This further contributes to the high toll of tobacco on racial and socioeconomic health disparities.” Plus, Lee said, in neighborhoods with more tobacco outlets, stores are more likely to run price discounts and promotions, which boosts the advertising exposure and often prompts smokers who are thinking about quitting to buy another pack. “Each time kids go to the store for a snack, to pay for gas, or to pick up bread and milk, they’re getting a dose of advertising,” Lee added. “Any gas station has a wall of tobacco products behind the register, and that makes them present, visible and normalized.” One limitation of the study is that it doesn’t differentiate between types and sizes of stores, such as gas stations, grocery stores, pharmacy chains, alcohol stores, convenience stores, newsstands and the discount department store Walmart, which could affect density, the authors write. In recent years, policy changes have aimed to prevent the sale of menthol and flavored cigarettes near schools in Chicago, San Francisco and Baltimore. Other policies have suggested removing cigarettes from pharmacies and selling little cigars and cigarillos in bundles rather than singles to increase cost, said Phillip Gardiner of the University of California in Oakland, who wasn’t involved in the current study. “Smokers - especially young kids - are price sensitive,” he said. “We know that as price goes up, consumption goes down.” “When used as advertised, smoking kills,” Gardiner said. “The tobacco industry is promoting it, and that’s not right.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2m6xiRW Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, online March 1, 2017.

(WMT) in a recent report obtained by 24/7 Wall St. (See also: Wal-Mart Has $320M Plan to Win Back Brazilians.) The brokerage firm noted Wal-Mart’s better-than-expected comps growth in the fourth quarter as a sign of strength in a very competitive retail landscape. WMT reported comps of 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter, driven by a 1.4 percent increase in traffic, also comfortably beating consensus expectations of 1.3 percent. Target Corp. (TGT) reported Q4 comps decline of 1.5 percent, worse than the 1.4 percent consensus expectation. Kroger Co. (KR) reported a comps decline of 0.7 percent, versus the 0.1 percent growth that analysts expected. In addition to the 1.4 percent traffic growth at WMT’s established stores, Merrill Lynch believes that a Q4 36 percent gross merchandise value growth in the retailer’s U.S. ecommerce business, as well as positive comps in grocery sales despite the current food price deflation, instill confidence that WMT’s main U.S. strategy will continue to yield results in 2018. Merrill Lynch also noted that WMT is about to start seeing a sustainable 20 percent to 30 percent growth in its e-commerce business, pointing out four drivers. First, the brokerage firm said WMT’s strategic acquisition of Jet, which came with Hayneedle, as well as the acquisition of Shoebuy and Moosejaw, gives the retailer access to new technologies and more ritzy customers. Second, Merrill Lynch pointed at the retailer’s e-commerce marketplace expansion from 8 million items in Jan. 2016 to over 35 million items as of the last earnings call. Third is the expansion of the free two-day shipping on orders worth $35 or more to over 2 million items. Fourth is the planned extension of online grocery pickup to about 1,200 stores in 2018 from the current 600. Shares of Wal-Mart closed at $70.72, up 1.09 percent from the preceding closing price, on March 14. Based on Merrill Lynch’s $88 price target, WMT stock has roughly 24.4 percent upside potential.

Annie Pei,03162017,CNBC,03092017," Renowned technician John Bollinger, creator of Bollinger Bands, believes that the charts are pointing to even more highs for stocks, meaning that the so-called Trump rally isn't over yet. Friday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation,"" Bollinger commented that while positive expectations surrounding President Donald Trump's proposed policies have driven the market so far, the technicals behind the market are just as strong. The technician is referring to two charts in particular, with the first being the NYSE composite advance-decline line. The indicator, according to Bollinger, is ""the number of advancing stocks each day [over] the number of declining stocks,"" which has pulled back recently. The second features Bollinger's own indicator, Bollinger Bands, which jointly measure recent prices and volatility in order to derive potential levels of support and resistance. While the S&P 500 has been doing a ""walk up the upper band,"" which indicates that the market may be overbought, the fact that the advance-decline line has moved alongside the S&P leads Bollinger to believe that there's room yet for the market to advance.""You can see that the S&P 500 has been marching up the upper band, that's that low-volatility advance that you were talking about, and the advance-decline line has been confirming every single tick of the S&P,"" said Bollinger. ""So until we see some divergences there, I don't think there are a lot of reasons to be too worried about this market.""But should those divergences occur, they would be red flags for the bulls. The first of the divergences, according to Bollinger, would be if ""changes in leadership"" did not occur in the market. The technician believes that small-cap stocks, in particular, would be an indicator of such a leadership change.""Small-cap stocks did really well in the post-election rally, so we'd look for them to start doing well again,"" he said. ""If that didn't happen, then that would be a reason to worry.""Otherwise, Bollinger believes that two other red flags could occur in the market, including a ""buildup"" of stocks suddenly hitting new yearly lows. The final indicator, according to the technician, would be if the advance-decline line started to ""roll over"" and head down, an indication that more stocks were declining rather than climbing on a daily basis.The S&P 500 is currently up almost 6 percent year to date.

Matt Clinch,03162017,CNBC,03092017,"Months of spin and political rhetoric will culminate in Dutch voters heading to the polls this week, with investors contemplating what the general election could mean for their portfolios. Using hedge fund analytics tool Kensho, CNBC conducted a study to show how stock indexes in Europe perform following Dutch elections. The data shows the average return following 11 different elections in the Netherlands, which date back to the early 1980s. The figures show that the AEX index, which was derived from Amsterdam Exchange index in 1983 and is composed of 25 securities, usually falls in the two sessions immediately after a general election. The data also show that it has traded negatively for 56 percent of the time and has an average return of -0.31 percent. Rival benchmarks in Belgium and Germany also traditionally follow the AEX lower, the historical data shows, although the French CAC 40 and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 are largely unaffected. Meanwhile in the currency markets, Kensho data shows that Dutch elections can provide a fillip for foreign exchange crosses in the region. Over the five previous Dutch general elections since 2000, both the euro-U.S. dollar cross and the sterling-U.S. dollar cross have traded positive 100 percent of the time on the day of these elections. Although this historical data might inform this week's trades, it's worth noting that the wave of populism across the Western world is likely to complicate matters this time around. Geert Wilders, who has been called the Netherlands' Donald Trump, has seen early momentum ease off but his Party for Freedom is still poised to secure the second-largest number of seats in parliament. Nonetheless, Mary Pieterse-Bloem, the global head of fixed income at ABN AMRO Private Bank, told CNBC Monday that investors are not ""running scared at all"" from Dutch assets. ""With respect to the Netherlands, I don't think there is all that much to fear in respect to the Dutch government bonds,"" she said, adding that their scarcity would add to their attractiveness as part of a wider portfolio.

When a company moves from being a start-up to becoming a more mature operation, it often loses some of what made it great in the first place. Once infrastructure, systems, and layers of management have been put in place, it becomes more difficult to charge forward, sometimes simply because it's harder to change direction when steering a larger ship. Both Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have been mature companies for a long time, but the two chains are each taking clear steps to make sure the entrepreneurial spirit has a place in their organizations. Wal-Mart has done so by putting Marc Lore, the serial entrepreneur who led Jet.com, which Wal-Mart purchased for $3.3 billion, in charge of its digital operations. Starbucks has taken a different approach, having both a dedicated executive in charge of leading entrepreneurial efforts and putting its outgoing CEO, Howard Schultz, in charge of its start-up effort to launch a premium brand. Wal-Mart ships online orders from fulfillment centers and its stores. Image source: Wal-Mart. In giving Lore the keys to its digital operations, Wal-Mart changed its entire way of thinking. That became evident when Walmart.com made the bold move of eliminating its $50-a-year membership, which gave customers access to unlimited two-day shipping, and replacing it by making that perk free for any qualifying order over $35. That move screams start-up. It's a money-losing action that will hurt the bottom line, but which should build audience share over the long term. That's the kind of thing Lore did at his previous start-up, Quidis (which owned Diapers.com), and at Jet.com, because in order to compete in an online retail market dominated by Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), you have to disrupt conventional thinking. Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon arguably bought Jet.com as much to secure Lore's services as he did to acquire its technology or customer base. The CEO also seems willing to allow his new hire to operate in the fashion he has become known for. ""If Marc can be Marc within this company, then great things are going to happen,"" McMillon said at the company's October investor day conference. Schultz actually built Starbucks as we know it from the ground up as an entrepreneur and he has clearly tried to keep that spirit alive over the years as his company has remained a pioneer, even as it became a global behemoth. This has led to failures like the company's soda line and its efforts to have an afternoon/evening menu, but it has also had great successes like the chain's technology. Starbucks was the first major restaurant brand to offer digital payment and mobile ordering, two technologies that are becoming standard across the industry. Those are some impressive feats, but Schultz clearly had an itch to go back to his entrepreneurial roots in a way he could not while running a company as large as Starbucks. To make that happen, he decided to leave his CEO job in order to take on a new challenge focusing ""on retail innovation and accelerating growth of Starbucks ultra-premium retail formats."" In his new job, Schultz plans to try to once again revolutionize how Americans drink coffee. The first time he did that he brought about his vision of a ""third place,"" after work and home, that became the cafe chain. Now he's going to develop the company's high-end Roastery and Reserve brands -- an entrepreneurial effort that attempts to build a wine-aficionado-like experience for coffee lovers on a global level. Schultz, however, is not the only person attempting to keep the start-up spirit alive at Starbucks. The company also employs Richard Tait, founder of the game company Cranium, as senior vice president and entrepreneur in residence. In addition to his own start-up journey, Tait spent years at Microsoft, where he also operated as an entrepreneur in residence, creating numerous start-ups within the company, according to his Starbucks biography. Tait's job, which he has held for almost a year, gives him a broad portfolio that includes ""helping the company foster a culture of innovation."" In addition, he is charged with applying ""an entrepreneurial lens to Starbucks operational planning and prioritization efforts across the organization, helping improve the speed and agility of decision-making."" On his LinkedIn profile, Tait calls himself ""Chief BoomBoom at Starbucks"" and describes his role as working with the company leadership to bring the ""energy and passion of a start-up inside the rhythm of a large corporation."" Tait reports to incoming CEO Kevin Johnson and also works in product development as part of the steering committee for Starbucks' Innovation Lab. In many ways, both Wal-Mart and Starbucks are following a path blazed by Amazon. The online retailer's CEO, Jeff Bezos, has famously and regularly used the phrase ""today is day one."" The company even named part of its Seattle office complex the ""Day One"" building, around the idea that the company is always a start-up. It's a philosophy that has empowered Amazon to act in its own long-term interest at the expense of quarterly results. Wal-Mart is clearly embracing the idea that continued growth requires breaking the mold and it has empowered Lore to make long-term moves that sacrifice short-term profit margin. Starbucks has always been a bit like Amazon as Schultz and Bezos seem to share a lot when it comes to vision, but Schultz's taking on a purely entrepreneurial role outside the core brand doubles down on that thinking. Add Tait to the mix and you can see that Starbucks' outgoing CEO wants to make sure that his company, no matter how big it gets, embraces the spirit that led to its growth in the first place.

"Brian Feroldi, Jason Hall, Rich Duprey, Jordan Wathen, and Dan Caplinger",03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, and George Soros have minted themselves a fortune by staying one step ahead of the markets. That's why we Fools like to dig through SEC filings each quarter to see what these brilliant investors have been buying or selling recently. After digging through those filings, our team of Fool contributors noticed that these investors have been selling off their positions in Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX), Transocean (NYSE:RIG), Seadrill Ltd. (NYSE:SDRL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Is it a good idea to follow suit? Image source: Getty Images. Dan Caplinger (Transocean): The offshore-drilling industry has been a tough place to make money lately, and many investors have started to lose faith in Transocean and its peers. Late last year, well-known activist investor and billionaire Carl Icahn slashed his position in Transocean, citing the need to take tax losses but also having suffered a dramatic decline in the value of the stock since his initial investment. Transocean and offshore drillers in general have been among the hardest hit in the industry, largely because the projects that rely on the company's drilling rigs tend to be more expensive than land-based exploration activity. When oil prices were above $100 per barrel, the higher potential reward made offshore drilling worth the effort, and that helped push demand for drilling equipment much higher. Yet when the energy market went into the tank, Transocean found itself with clients who no longer wanted to move full steam ahead on expensive offshore projects. In the aftermath, gluts of equipment have contributed to lower contract rates. Currently, Transocean is at a turning point. Current oil prices have rebounded somewhat, but they still aren't high enough to justify a return to full capacity. If oil rises further, then Transocean is in a position to recover its losses. But if oil sags, it could spell a long-term problem for Transocean and its growth prospects. Rich Duprey (Barrick Gold): Considering his track record lately, investors might not want to follow the moves billionaire investor George Soros is making these days, but he's not a billionaire for nothing. Soros Fund Management reportedly lost $1 billion betting against a market rally following Donald Trump's election and in the fourth quarter dumped all of its holdings in Barrick Gold, only to see shares of the miner surge this year. While it had jumped as much as 50% between its mid-December lows and the peak it hit mid-February, it's eased back a bit since, and investors should consider which way it will go from here. After all, Soros' biggest sin may have been simply selling too early -- but if we look at Barrick Gold's bigger picture, I'd say no, don't follow Soros' lead here. In its fourth-quarter earnings report last month, the gold miner reduced its all-in sustaining costs (AISC) to just $732 per ounce, or 40% below gold's current price. It shows that the cost-cutting initiatives Barrick has implemented are bearing fruit, and the gains are expected to accelerate this year, with AISC falling even further. The gold miner has paid off a good chunk of its long-term debt, and though it still carries some $8 billion worth on its balance sheet, there isn't much coming due anytime soon. Moreover, Barrick owns five core mines that should produce 70% of its volumes this year, with ore grades that are more than double that of the miner's peer group. It also expects to produce some 5.9 million ounces this year, or 5% more than in 2016. There's good reason to keep betting on gold generally and Barrick Gold in particular, and following George Soros in dumping your shares might just tarnish your portfolio. Brian Feroldi (Facebook): With a net worth of roughly $13 billion, Steven Cohen is one of the most successful hedge fund managers in the world. That's why it caught my attention when I found out that Point72 Asset Management -- one of Cohen's hedge funds -- dumped 96% of his position in Facebook in the fourth quarter. If you look at the numbers, you might be scratching your head as to why Cohen would want to give up on Facebook right now. Last quarter, Facebook's revenue surged 51% while expenses grew by only 29%. The difference caused margins to balloon and allowed EPS to more than double. Those are impressive figures for any company, let alone a megacap like Facebook. Given those terrific results, my hunch is that Cohen is worried that Facebook's revenue is going to significantly decelerate in the years ahead. That's a legitimate concern now that the company's ad load is leveling off. Furthermore, expenses are expected to continue to rise significantly as the company adds engineering talent. That could lead to a meaningful slowdown in profits. With shares trading near an all-time high, perhaps he wanted to cash in his chips while he could. Regardless of Cohen's move, I for one couldn't be more excited about Facebook's long-term potential. That's why I have no intentions to part ways with my shares anytime soon. Jason Hall (Seadrill Ltd.): After the company disclosed in its most recent quarterly earnings filing that Chapter 11 bankruptcy is on the table, investors of every ilk -- not just billionaires -- have been selling off shares of Seadrill. And for good reason, since the company is facing more than $1 billion in debt it must pay off between now and June, with hundreds of millions of it maturing at the end of April. As things stand today, the writing's on the wall that the company won't pay off that first debt maturity, which would put it in default on essentially all of its long-term debt soon after. Should you follow the rest of Seadrill's investors to the exits? Probably, yes, if you have capital at risk that you really can't afford to lose. The offshore-drilling industry remains an awful business right now. Offshore oil and gas producers are on track to spend less capital this year than anytime in the past decade-plus. There's still a chance that Seadrill can turn things around and come to terms with its debt holders, in which case today's price will end up being a bargain. If you're willing to take on that risk -- and acknowledge you could end up with nothing -- there's a case for staying invested. Just don't be shocked if it doesn't work out. Jordan Wathen (Wal-Mart): Warren Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, nearly blew out of its billion-dollar position in Wal-Mart in the most recent quarter. And while Wal-Mart may have been a small part of Berkshire's portfolio, few likely know more about Wal-Mart than Warren Buffett does. In May 2003, Berkshire Hathaway acquired a little-known Wal-Mart subsidiary known as McLane Company, a distributor of groceries and foods to stores all around the country. Shortly after that acquisition, in 2005, Berkshire purchased shares of Wal-Mart, perhaps having learned to appreciate the retailer's operations after observing it through McLane Company. More than a decade after Berkshire's investment, Buffett apparently wants out. Wal-Mart finds itself situated between fierce competition in grocery and general merchandise. In grocery, competitors such as Aldi, which has quietly opened more than 1,600 stores in the U.S., many of which are located in proximity to Wal-Mart stores, competes directly on price for core grocery items including milk and produce. In general merchandise, online stores such as Amazon.com have the lead in distribution and can deliver products directly to their customers' doors, often at a better price. Buffett has shared his praise for Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos, telling CNBC last May, ""We haven't seen many businessmen like him."" Keep in mind that Berkshire is awash in cash and prefers to leave gains unharvested rather than collect its winnings and pay taxes. That Berkshire is reassessing its stake in Wal-Mart should give shareholders pause about the company, and retail in general. ","
      
    Billionaires Are Dumping These 5 Stocks. Should You? -- The Motley Fool

Jeremy Bowman,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an unfamiliar position these days. The world's largest retailer, which put hundreds of mom-and-pop stores out of business with its superstores that offer rock-bottom prices, is now in a fight for its own relevance, playing catch-up to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Image source: Getty Images. After years of ignoring the opportunity in e-commerce, Wal-Mart finds itself playing second fiddle to Amazon, which now has a market cap nearly twice that of Wal-Mart's. In the last year, Wally World has taken steps to accelerate its e-commerce business by buying Jet.com, along with two smaller businesses, and rapidly expanding its online grocery pickup program. In many ways, Wal-Mart's struggles to overcome Amazon's advantages is similar to a battle between the leader and challenger in another industry -- Uber and Lyft. Uber was the first-mover in the app-based ridehailing industry, and is by far the leader in an increasingly fragmented space. It's valued at a whopping $68 billion, more than carmakers such as General Motors, Ford, and Tesla Motors, showing that investors have placed a premium on transportation rather than the car itself. Today, Uber is active in 81 countries and 581 cities around the world, including 209 in the U.S. Ridehailing seems like the type of industry that would lend itself to monopoly. Once a company like Uber builds up an army of drivers and gets thousands of passengers to download its app, it would seem to have the network effects and barriers to entry to block competition. But smaller ridehailing apps have crept into the mix. Lyft, the No. 2 ride-hailing company, has become Uber's principal challenger largely by positing itself as its cultural antithesis. Uber's brand is generally seen as bloodless and corporate, its logo draped in black. Lyft has positioned itself as the friendly ridehailing service, using hot pink as its principal color. For a while, Lyft drivers signified themselves by having hot pink mustaches over their cars' grills. Lyft, unlike Uber, allows passengers to tip, and encourages drivers to be friendly and make conversation with their fares. It also seems to treat its drivers better, and has not been subject to the protests and disputes that have become commonplace with Uber. Lyft aims for an overall different experience than Uber. That may have seemed like a minor detail, but in recent weeks a series of unforced errors have dramatically damaged Uber's already questionable reputation. First, a tweet accusing Uber of trying to break a temporary strike by New York cabbies at JFK airport went viral, prompting the hashtag #DeleteUber to start trending as thousands of users deleted their accounts and sent angry letters to the company. Later, a blog post vilified Uber for allowing rampant sexual harassment and a culture that demeaned women, and a video of CEO Travis Kalanick excoriating a driver was picked up by several media sources. Reports also emerged about software Uber created to undermine local regulations, and Kalanick is now reportedly seeking leadership counseling and searching for a COO. The narrative of Uber is a bad corporate citizen is now well established and has become a storyline in the media that will pop up every time there is a similar incident. Lyft wisely took advantage of Uber's mistakes. During the chaotic weekend of airport protests, Lyft responded to the Uber boycott by pledging to donate $1 million to the ACLU. In the wake of the Uber backlash, Lyft downloads surged into the top ten in the App Store with nearly 200,000 in one day -- a new company record. It was the first time Lyft's downloads topped Uber's, nothing short of a coup for a company valued at $5.5 billion, just a fraction of Uber's worth. As Uber retrenches and licks its wounds, Lyft is now reportedly seeking another $500 million in funding. Wal-Mart, with much greater profits than Amazon and a wealth of resources, is in a stronger position than Lyft, but the story above highlights one key way Wal-Mart can challenge Amazon as it attempts to build out its marketplace. Amazon isn't exactly vulnerable in the way that Uber is. The company has a stellar reputation with customers, but there are some who view it as overly cutthroat, and it has been known to step on its merchants' toes. Amazon's merchants have complained in the past about the company taking their best-selling products, and selling them itself, directly competing with the merchants and often undercutting them on price. For that reason, many merchants prefer selling on eBay, says Kevin North, CEO of Terapeak, an e-commerce analytics firm. eBay acts only as a marketplace and does not sell goods directly. Those merchants view Amazon ""very, very cautiously,"" he said. He sees an opportunity for Wal-Mart, saying it could win over merchants by being friendlier than Amazon and not competing with them. North added that merchants are still working for clarity from Wal-Mart on what kind of partner it would be. Wal-Mart has sped up its efforts to recruit vendors, but it's still going too slow. At the time of the acquisition of Jet.com, Wal-Mart had just 600 sellers, compared to Jet's 2,400 after just a year in business. Wal-Mart had been struggling with onboarding vendors previously, but acquiring Jet changes that. North called the Jet acquisition a ""game-changer"" for Wal-Mart in part because it brings on e-commerce mastermind Marc Lore, who founded Jet as well as Quidsi, which he sold to Amazon -- but also because it will help Wal-Mart ramp up its marketplace. The company has already upped the stakes by offering free two-day delivery on orders of $35 or more. Now it needs to aggressively pursue vendors, and eliminate the popular notion that Amazon is the only game in town when it comes to online shopping. Like Uber drivers, Amazon merchants are wary of the company's monopolistic ambitions, and are eager to spread their wares over multiple sites. As Lyft has found, there are benefits to being No. 2.

    To Challenge Amazon, Wal-Mart Should Follow Lyft's Example -- The Motley Fool

Leo Sun,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) went public in 1997 at $18 per share. A $2,000 investment would have been enough to buy 111 shares, and those shares would have split to 1,332 shares today -- which would be worth over $1.13 million. That explosive growth made Amazon one of the greatest multi-bagger growth stories of the past two decades. Yet Amazon continues to grow, soaring 50% over the past 12 months and lifting its market cap past $400 billion. Image source: Amazon. But after those big gains, investors might be wondering if it's too late to buy shares of this millionaire-maker stock. I believe it isn't, for six simple reasons. A common bearish argument against Amazon is that the stock looks too ""expensive"" at 174 times earnings. However, that view ignores Amazon's impressive earnings growth rate. Amazon grew its earnings per share by 292% in 2016, compared to 140% growth in 2015 and a net loss in 2014. Analysts expect Amazon's earnings to rise 49% this year and 75% next year. Based on those estimates, Amazon trades at just 67 times forward earnings -- which is reasonable relative to its growth rates. Amazon's key profit driver over the past few quarters has been AWS (Amazon Web Services), the largest cloud platform in the world. That platform lends out storage space, computing power, and software development platforms to massive customers like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), NASA, and the CDC. Last quarter, AWS revenue rose 47% annually and accounted for 8% of Amazon's top line. However, AWS' operating income rose 60% and brought in 52% of the company's operating profits thanks to its higher margins. That profit growth gives Amazon more freedom to expand its lower-margin marketplace businesses. A key part of that marketplace push is Prime, Amazon's prisoner-taking membership ecosystem which offers discounts, free shipping, e-books, streaming video, cloud storage, and other perks. The expansion of that ecosystem puts a lot of pressure on brick-and-mortar rivals like Wal-Mart and streaming video players like Netflix. Last October, eMarketer estimated that Amazon Video was adding users at a faster rate than both YouTube and Netflix. And last June, research firm CIRP estimated that Amazon's Prime customer base in the U.S. grew 19 million year-over-year to 63 million -- indicating that Prime shoppers outnumbered non-Prime shoppers. The study also found that Prime members spent about $1,200 annually on the site, compared to just $500 for non-members. Amazon is also expanding its Prime ecosystem into homes with cheap connected consumer electronic devices like the Kindle tablets, Fire TV set-top boxes, Echo family of smart speakers, Dash buttons, and DRS-enabled appliances. Image source: Amazon. Amazon has also taken steps to connect its Alexa voice assistant to other functions in smart homes and connected cars. Smart light bulbs, fans, thermostats, and locks already sync to Alexa and Echo. Amazon has also worked with Ford to sync newer vehicles to Alexa so users can control smart home devices from their cars or access their vehicles from inside the home. All these services help Amazon gather more data about its users' habits and reduces the friction in online purchases -- which gradually increases customer dependence on its services. Amazon's international marketplace business generated just a third of its revenues last quarter. That's why the company is expanding into new overseas markets like India, where it invested billions to challenge market leader Flipkart; and China, where it remains far behind market leaders Tmall and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD). Lastly, Amazon's closely watched logistics expenses will eventually fall with increased automation. We've already seen Amazon make progress here with thousands of warehouse robots and its own fleet of cargo planes, and its upcoming Prime Air drone deliveries could greatly reduce delivery costs further. Some skeptics might believe that widespread drone deliveries might not be feasible, but JD.com already launched ""thousands"" of delivery drones across rural China last November. The company stated that the test run, which was conducted during the massive Singles Day rush, went ""smoothly."" It's highly unlikely that Amazon can ever repeat its near 55,000% post-IPO rally. However, that doesn't mean that it's too late to get in on this millionaire-maker stock. I personally bought my shares when Amazon was in the low $600s, when many analysts called the stock expensive. The skeptics are still saying the same thing about the stock now, in the mid $800s, but I believe that it still has plenty of room to run. ","
      
    Is It Too Late to Get in on This Millionaire-Maker Stock? -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B.

RadioShack has filed for bankruptcy protection for a second time, with the company's owner immediately closing 200 stores, and considering its options for the remaining 1,300 it owns. At roughly the same time, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), another electronics retailer, has turned the corner in its battle for survival. Its earnings per share (EPS) rose dramatically, climbing from $2.30 in fiscal 2016 to $3.74 in the chain's fiscal 2017. In addition, its stock, which is currently trading around $45, has more than tripled since bottoming out in late 2012. That was enough for Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly to literally declare the company's turnaround efforts over. ""Since the introduction of Renew Blue in November 2012, we have improved the operating performance of the business dramatically,"" he said in the Q4 earnings release in early March. ""We now feel it is time to call Renew Blue officially over and launch our strategy for the next phase of our journey: Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue."" Those comments were released a week before RadioShack once again sought bankruptcy protection, raising the question as to why one electronics chain has succeeded while the other has failed. It's not a simple answer, as you will see below that both chains made many of the same moves. Best Buy has come back from the brink. Image source: Best Buy. Launched in 2012, Renew Blue was a road map to help Best Buy turn around its fortunes. At the time the plan was introduced, Best Buy was, like RadioShack, on the list of companies many expected to not survive, largely due to the internet and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) specifically. Its turnaround began because the company systematically attacked its weaknesses while building on its strengths. One key weakness was the fact that consumers did not see Best Buy as offering attractive prices. In a report the company shared in its Renew Blue presentation deck [opens in PDF], only 23% of consumers perceived Best Buy as having lower prices than its rivals while 56% of Amazon customers saw the online retailer that way and 71% of Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) customers believed it had the lowest prices. Best Buy aggressively addressed that by offering a price match program that let people pay the same price they would at top online competitors and ""local retailers,"" a category that includes Wal-Mart. That one move immediately removed the incentive for showrooming, that is, the practice of doing your research on a product at Best Buy but buying online or from another retailer. In addition to that major move, Best Buy did a number of things: Taken on its own, any one of these moves would probably have not been enough, but made together they left Best Buy with price-competitive stores that consumers had more reason to visit and a robust, easy-to-use digital presence. The company did not price match and its website, while it got some attention, was not made a priority in the way Best Buy's was. RadioShack also failed to articulate any clear reason for people to visit its stores aside from its long-standing function as a nearby option when you're missing cables or batteries and having them now trumps price in your mind. However, CEO Dene Rogers did share some info in the company's press release on the bankruptcy that shed some light on the steps it did take. ""In 2016, we reduced operating expenses by 23%, while at the same time saw gross profit dollars increase 8%,"" he said. ""Over the same time, we integrated FedEx pickup/drop-off into 140 RadioShack locations, delivered to customers over 700,000 Hulu login pins and sold more than a million RadioShack private brand headphones and speakers delivering high quality, value-based audio products to consumers across the country."" RadioShack management made some of the same moves that Best Buy did, yet it still failed. Some of that may be because it bet too heavily on Sprint as a partner. In addition, doing nothing to address consumer expectations on pricing certainly sent some business to Amazon, Wal-Mart, and even Best Buy. In the end, though, RadioShack may have been doomed by the fact that small, limited-selection stores are not the draw they once were now that people can simply go online and get nearly anything they need with two-day delivery. With the average RadioShack being roughly 2,400 square feet, it simply can't compete with destination chains like Best Buy that are 10 to 15 times larger on average. In its heyday, RadioShack succeeded because its many locations made it convenient for customers and it sold products that were interesting to look at, with many not being offered elsewhere. Add in being a source for things like blank cassettes, VHS tapes, and other accessories, the company filled a niche that does not exist any more. RadioShack has failed while Best Buy lives on to continue battling Amazon, because it may have outlived its usefulness without finding a new reason for being. Perhaps there was a pivot that could have saved the retailer (and maybe Blockbuster would still exist if it had become a chain of liquor store/vape shops) but non-extreme measures were always likely to end in this result.

It's been a tough year for brick-and-mortar retailers trying to take on the growing popularity of e-commerce. In the fourth quarter last year, e-commerce accounted for 9.5% of all retail sales in the U.S., according to the census bureau. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been a huge beneficiary of the trend. Meanwhile, brick-and-mortar retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are working to catch up to Amazon. One big exception, however, is Costco (NASDAQ:COST), which would rather see customers come into its warehouse clubs. While that worked for a little while, Costco has started falling short of revenue and earnings expectations recently. In the fourth quarter, Costco fell short of analyst expectations for same-store sales growth and profit. Costco's membership model is often seen as well protected from Amazon, but that doesn't seem to be the case any longer. Image source: Costco. About a year ago, Costco CFO Richard Galanti said the only thing keeping him up at night is ""everybody in the world never wanting to leave their house and only typing stuff to order and get it at the front door."" While Costco has made some improvements to its online shopping platform, it's still holding back certain product features, like ordering online and picking up in the store. Galanti says it doesn't have room in its stores for in-store pickup anyway -- although Wal-Mart's Sam's Club was able to make it work. Costco doesn't think it's losing in e-commerce. It's currently attacking the ""low-hanging fruit,"" as Galanti put it. And that strategy is working. Online sales increased 11% to 12% last quarter. However, online sales totaled just $4.5 billion for the quarter -- 4% of total revenue. Membership fees generate the vast majority of Costco's profits as it sells its actual merchandise at razor-thin margins. But in the last few quarters, membership revenue growth has decelerated to around 5.5% from around 7%. Costco hopes to reaccelerate membership revenue growth by increasing its membership fees by 9% -- from $55 to $60 for its most popular rate. It's the company's first rate increase in five years. But as more shoppers are able to get what they need online, an increase in membership fees runs the risk of reducing gross membership additions and lowering renewal rates. Sam's Club memberships can be had for less than Costco ($45). Additionally, Wal-Mart.com just introduced free two-day shipping on two million items available online -- no membership required. Amazon Prime membership costs just $99 for unlimited two-day shipping, and includes video and music streaming among other bonus features. Importantly, Amazon Prime continues to prove its worth. Its video-streaming catalog is on par with premium cable networks, and its original series and films won multiple awards this past year. Its collection of Amazon-branded exclusives is expanding, as well, taking on Costco's Kirkland brand. For consumers facing a decision between Amazon Prime and a Costco membership, Prime continues to look more attractive. Meanwhile, the price hike at Costco makes it look slightly less attractive.

The warehouse club essentially breaks even on the discounted food and merchandise it sells, but it makes up for it with the windfall it realizes on the membership fees it charges for the privilege of shopping its stores. Although Costco doesn't raise its fees often -- every three to five years, on average, and the last time it did so was in 2011 -- it just announced a new membership fee hike beginning on June 1. It may seem long overdue, but it could be the worst time for it and a move the warehouse club will regret. Image source: Getty Images. Where merchandise sales comprised around 98% of Costco's total revenues of $57.9 billion over the first six months of its fiscal year, membership fees amounted to about three quarters of its $1.7 billion operating income. It had 47.6 million paying members at the end of 2016, most of whom (some 77%) were individual Gold Star members; businesses made up the rest. Executive members, Costco's highest level of membership, who earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases up to a maximum reward of $750 per year, represent 39% of its membership base, and they also account for around two-thirds of its sales. Costco enjoys an amazing renewal rate, with around 90% of its paid members renewing every year. It's a testament to their loyalty to the warehouse club, and when you consider Costco is only increasing the Gold Star fee by $5 to $60 a year, with the business membership going up $10 to $120 annually, it doesn't seem like it should be a big deal. After all, the average Costco shopper has an average annual income of $85,000 and is more affluent than the medium- to low-income wage earners that patronize Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Its customers should be able to afford the nominal bump in fees and will even be rewarded since Executive members will see the maximum reward increased to $1,000 annually. Considering the quarter Costco just reported, it would seem now would be a good time to raise them, too. Net sales rose 6% as U.S. comparable-store sales increased 3% from last year, better than the 3% and 1% rise, respectively, it saw in the first quarter. It was also better than the 3% increase in sales it achieved a year ago when comps also rose 3%. However, now might not be the time to start raising costs on consumers. Costco's net income fell to $515 million from $546 million last year, as rising gas prices, investments in digital initiatives, and price cuts took a bite out of the bottom line. The problem is that Wal-Mart and other supermarket giants like Kroger (NYSE:KR) and even Target, are waging a war to retain and steal customers by cutting prices themselves. In particular, Wal-Mart, which has committed to being the discount destination for shoppers, reported one of its best quarters in more than four years, with revenues rising more than 1% to $130.9 billion on a 1.8% increase in comps, its 10th straight quarter with higher same-store sales. While that may appear to be an underwhelming performance compared to what Costco turned in, Wal-Mart is orders of magnitude larger than its rival, and it represents a significant gain for itself and over the competition. It could be that Wal-Mart stole customers from Kroger, as its own quarterly effort was a disappointment, but that just underscores why it is risky for Costco to be raising costs on its customers. Image source: Getty Images. For its part, Costco is dismissive of the competitive threat. While CFO Richard Galanti said the pricing actions by its rivals were ""formidable,"" he essentially also said that's something they have to worry about, not Costco. It wasn't cutting prices because of the competition, but rather because of independent decisions it made. Whether that will amount to a blind spot remains to be seen, but consumers across the board are proving to be more price-conscious. Fast-casual dining chains, for example, a niche that would serve a demographic intuitively similar to Costco's, has been almost uniformly beset by lower sales and profits as fast-food chains promote pricing deals. The low-cost price proposition of Costco's rivals just as the warehouse club raises prices could be the tipping point that causes it to stumble. It may seem to be only a de minimis increase in cost for Costco members, but it could be a price so high that new members may be unwilling to pay it.

    Here's Why Costco Shouldn't Be Raising Its Membership Fees -- The Motley Fool

  "
Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) opened its 100th warehouse in December 1992. A quarter-century later, the retailer generates $116 billion of annual business out of its 728 locations. Here are a few things you might not know about the world's second-biggest retailer by revenue. Image source: Getty Images. Costco is highly leveraged to the California market because of its high concentration of the retailer's biggest, most profitable warehouses. Almost one-third of its entire U.S. revenue came from that single state last year. And since the U.S. business accounts for over 70% of its operations, California plays an unusually large role in its global footprint. ""Any substantial slowing or sustained decline"" in this market, the company warns in its 10-K, ""could materially adversely affect our business and financial results."" Customer traffic gains have been the engine behind Costco's sales growth over the past decade. It handled a market-thumping 4% more member visits in each of the five years leading up to fiscal 2016, which helped produce comparable-store sales gains of 6% or better. Annual sales gains. Chart by author. That awesome streak ended last year, in part because its co-branded credit card switch produced a major disruption in membership renewals. Executives are hopeful that this will be just a temporary challenge, though, and renewal rates should climb back up above 90% over the coming quarters while bringing customer traffic levels higher as well. Rivals like Target (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) aim to stock as wide a selection of products as possible, but Costco deliberately takes the opposite tack. These retailers carry over 80,000 items while a typical Costco warehouse holds less than 4,000. By restricting selection to just the most popular, fastest-selling products, Costco can keep its expenses low through elevated sales volumes. In fact, the retailer moves through its inventory so quickly that in most cases it sells a product -- and receives payment for it -- before it has to pay its supplier. It can then use those savings to deliver prices that peers just can't match. Nearly all its earnings are generated by membership fees rather than the product markup that underpins most retailers' business models. That's why it's more useful to think of the company as a club engaged in subscription sales rather than a retailer interested in selling stuff. The approach makes for significantly lower profitability. Costco's gross profit margin is roughly half Wal-Mart's 26% of sales and even further from Target's 30%. The same is true on the bottom line, where the company is lucky to turn 2% of sales into net income, compared to 4% for Target and 3% for Wal-Mart. Yet Costco's earnings are much more stable since they're attached to recurring subscriber revenue and thus less exposed to swings in the economy. Especially considering its reliable profit stream, Costco delivers only a small portion of earnings to shareholders as dividends. Its payout ratio is about one-third of profits, compared to 50% for its retailing peers. One good reason for this skimpy capital return promise is that Costco is still aggressively expanding its store base and so there's less cash available to send right back to owners. On the other hand, its paltry 1% dividend yield understates its actual payout. Twice in the last five years it has issued a massive special dividend to investors, amounting to $7 per share in 2012 and $5 per share in 2015. ","

Also see: 10 best, 10 worst stocks in the eight-year bull market Each earnings season, numbers that dominate headlines are growth rates for comparable-store sales. But it’s also important to know whether sales have been juiced by promotional discounts, so investors need to consider gross profit margins, which are sales less the cost of goods sold, divided by sales. You can then look at net income margins, which are earnings divided by sales. But the problem with net income margin is that any company’s earnings can be skewed by one-time events. Amazon runs hardly any brick-and-mortar stores, so we’re going to exclude the company from our list of retailers that increased comparable-store sales while improving gross margins. The company’s sales for the fourth quarter were up 22% from a year earlier, but Amazon’s gross profit margin narrowed to 33.80% from 35.01% a year earlier. So the company paid a price for such stellar growth. Of the remaining 34 S&P 500 retailers, 17 reported increased comparable-store sales, and 11 of those improved gross profit margins. Here they are: Here’s how analysts view these retail sales winners: So it would appear that for most of the companies, analysts believe the stocks are close to being “fully valued.” However, analysts look out only 12 months with their price targets, a short period for a long-term investor, especially if the companies can continue their rapid sales growth. Here are total returns for the group, with dividends reinvested: As always, if you see any stocks listed here that you are interested in, it’s important to do your own research, hopefully with the assistance of a broker or investment adviser.

,03302017,Investopedia,03232017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Operating leverage is the degree to which a firm or project can increase operating income by increasing revenue. A business that generates sales with a high gross margin and low variable costs has high operating leverage. The higher the degree of operating leverage, the greater the potential danger from forecasting risk, where a relatively small error in forecasting sales can be magnified into large errors in cash flow projections. Operating leverage may be used for calculating a company’s break-even point and substantially affecting profits by changing its pricing structure. Because businesses with higher operating leverage do not proportionately increase expenses as they increase sales, those companies may bring in more operating income than other companies. However, businesses with high operating leverage are also more affected by poor corporate decisions and other factors that may result in income decreases. It is key to compare operating leverage among companies in the same industry, as some industries have higher fixed costs than others. The concept of a high or low ratio is then more clearly determined. Most of a company’s costs are fixed costs that occur regardless of sales volume. As long as a business earns a substantial profit on each sale and sustains adequate sales volume, fixed costs are covered and profits are earned. Other company costs are variable costs incurred when sales occur. The business earns less profit on each sale but needs a lower sales volume for covering fixed costs. For example, a software business has greater fixed costs in developers’ salaries and lower variable costs with software sales. Therefore, the business has high operating leverage. In contrast, a computer consulting firm charges its clients hourly, resulting in variable consultant wages. Therefore, the business has low operating leverage. The formula for operating leverage is: Which breaks down as: Quantity x (Price - Variable Cost per Unit) / [Quantity x (Price - Variable Cost per Unit) - Fixed Operating Cost] For example, Company A sells 500,000 products for $6 each. The company’s fixed costs are $800,000. It costs $0.05 in variable per unit to make each product. Company A’s degree of operating leverage is: 500,000 x ($6 - $0.05) / [500,000 x ($6 - $0.05) - $800,000] = $2,975,000 / $2,175,000 = 1.37 or 137%. Therefore, a 10% revenue increase should result in a 13.7% increase in operating income (10% x 1.37 = 13.7%). Most of Microsoft’s costs are fixed, such as expenses for upfront development and marketing. With each dollar in sales revenue earned beyond the break-even point, the company makes a profit. Therefore, Microsoft has high operating leverage. Conversely, Walmart retail stores have low fixed costs and large variable costs, especially for merchandise. Because Walmart stores pay for the items it sells, the cost of goods sold increases as sales increase. Therefore, Walmart stores have low operating leverage.

Mrinalini Krishna,03302017,Investopedia,03232017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The German confectionery giant Haribo, best known for gummy bears, worms, frogs and just about every animal found in nature, has announced plans to set up its first North American manufacturing plant in Kenosha County, Wisconsin yesterday. HARIBO’s investment in the 50,000 sq ft. project is expected to be $242 million, which makes it one of the largest by a foreign company to set up operations in Wisconsin. The factory is likely completed by 2020, according to a statement by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker’s Office. “As we are embarking on building one of the largest facilities in the confectionery industry, this location provides ideal conditions to further grow HARIBO’s successful business in the USA,” said Wes Saber, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of HARIBO of America Inc. The plan will also give a sugar rush to the economy of the area, adding nearly 400 jobs. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data as of January 2017, the Lake County-Kenosha County, IL-WI metro area has 428 employed persons and an unemployment rate of 6.5%. The family-owned company was founded in 1920 in Bonn, and continued operations throughout the Second World War. Today HARIBO produces gummy creatures and liquorice candy across 16 locations across the globe, averaging a 100 million gummy bears a day. So far, HARIBO only had a sales presence in the U.S., but with a manufacturing plant in place, it may be the beginning of gummy bear wars. Top candy makers have their own version of gummy and chewy candies like Sour Patch Kids by Mondelez (MDLZ).

Jeff Daniels,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"Wal-Mart Stores appears ""best positioned"" among the major food retailers to capitalize on the next phase of growth in online grocery and take on Amazon, according to a new report from Citi Research. Kroger also scored high among the pure-play grocers in terms of its online grocery positioning compared with e-commerce giant Amazon, particularly as it related to pricing. But at the bottom of the list was Whole Foods Market. Citi looked at the potential winners and losers in the online grocery space using a five-point analysis that looked at factors such as profitability, brick-and-mortar pricing, online pricing, exposure to Seattle-based Amazon, as well as any early adopter advantage. ""Based on our analysis, we determined that Wal-Mart was the winner (low exposure to Amazon Fresh/Prime Now markets and low EPS impact from exposure to those exposed markets),"" Citi said in the 43-page report. ""Whole Foods Market came in last place overall in our analysis, largely due to their urban store exposure, which overlaps highly with Amazon Fresh and Prime Now, as well as their higher price points."" Online grocery shopping could grow five-fold over the next decade, with American consumers spending upwards of $100 billion on food-at-home items by 2025, according an forecast released earlier this year by Food Marketing Institute and Nielsen. While many of the large grocers are still testing and investing in different formats to see which one works best, there's no denying the changing demographics and rise of millennials weaned on digital technologies supports the case for significant future growth in online grocery spending. Amazon's growing presence in the grocery space with different approaches highlights how much profit potential it sees in capturing spending from food and beverage sales. Amazon's grocery operating margin potential could be about 3 percent, or roughly comparable to North American retail industry margins, according to Citi. The estimate assumes inclusion of revenue from membership fees. Amazon's prices on grocery items tend to be higher than Wal-Mart, which accounts for about 20 percent of grocery sales domestically. Citi's research found the price gap between Wal-Mart's store pick-up prices relative to AmazonFresh was an average of 30 percent. Wal-Mart has been rapidly expanding its online grocery business and concentrating on the so-called click-and-collect model, which allows consumers to pickup orders at stores. A spokesman for the retailer told CNBC the retailer has expanded pickup to more than 100 markets in the U.S. last year and now has more than 600 locations offering the service. Whole Foods has partnered with Shipt for third-party grocery delivery and uses InstaCart too. Rival organic and natural foods chain Sprouts Farmers Market has an alliance with Amazon Prime Now. According to Citi, Whole Foods has more than 60 percent of their stores overlapped with Amazon's current or future delivery markets while Wal-Mart is just 23 percent exposed. Sprouts also has a high overlap with Amazon delivery markets but given the partnership Citi said that ""could therefore be a complementary, rather than adversarial scenario and could mute the threat, or even create an opportunity."" Yet Wal-Mart's exposure and threats from Amazon go well beyond groceries and include other merchandise categories, Citi noted. Similarly, Costco and Target also have online grocery activities through mostly third party services and compete with Amazon on several fronts such as consumer electronics, among other things. As for Kroger, the Citi report found that in addition to its competitive pricing compared with Amazon that the Cincinnati-based grocer was poised to benefit from growth in online grocery due to its ""early adopter advantage."" Even so, Kroger maybe seeing market share erosion in some markets against Wal-Mart, according to analysts. They believe part of the reason is the price-cutting strategy Wal-Mart embarked on to gain advantage against Kroger and Aldi, a rapidly expanding deep discounter. ""Kroger looks like they're losing share,"" said PiperJaffray analyst Sean Naughton. He explained that Kroger's same-store sales trends have been lagging Wal-Mart's in groceries. Meantime, analysts suggest both Wal-Mart and Kroger are likely to continue expanding their ""hybrid"" online grocer model, which includes focusing on both click-and-collect or in-store pickup as well as utilizing third-party or direct delivery services. ""Both models are going to thrive in 2017 and 2018,"" said Diana Sheehan, director of retail insights for Kantar Retail. ""I would actually predict that within 3 to 5 years — maybe sooner — that we would start to see some of these third parties getting acquired by major retailers."" Third-party home delivery services such as InstaCart, Shipt and Uber are expanding alliances with large national retail chains. The list of major retailers teaming with these services is growing and now includes not just traditional grocers such as Kroger and Whole Foods but warehouse club operators such as Costco. For example, Shipt this week announced it was offering Costco grocery deliveries in some Florida areas. Sheehan said retailers partnered with the third-party delivery services are relying on them not just to deliver groceries but also be the face of the brand to shoppers. And she said it's doubtful that the ""strongest-branded retailers"" in the U.S. will allow this to happen for an extended period of time. Still, some experts believe the grocery delivery model will ultimately work best for dense urban areas such as New York, a market where several pure-play grocery delivery companies such as FreshDirect have thrived. ""We're still in the test-and-learn phase,"" said Edward Yruma, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets. He said the traditional grocery delivery model will continue to grow although Amazon's plans to open several brick-and-mortar grocery pickup locations maybe a sign that grocery shoppers prefer this approach over home delivery. Yruma sees the grocery delivery model a lot like ""waiting for the cable guy. You need to be at home between 5 and 8 o'clock versus just driving by a location and dumping groceries into the car [when you want it]."" Wal-Mart doesn't charge extra for online grocery orders picked up at stores, while rival Kroger offers a free trial but then charges after two deliveries. Kroger has been growing its online business with both its ClickList online grocery ordering service as well as providing grocery deliveries through third-party providers, including InstaCart, Shipt as well as conducting tests with Uber. ""Kroger is not wedded long term to charging a fee,"" said Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem. ""If they determined that is a competitive disadvantage then they could potentially change that. I don't necessarily think it hurts them to charge a fee right now because of the relatively solid results."" ",Wal-Mart 'best positioned' in online grocery battle against Amazon
Marguerite Ward,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"Books have played a crucial role in Jeff Bezos' life, in more ways than one. There's the obvious reason: The company that made him a multi-billionaire originally started as an online book retailer. He's also spent his career changing the way books are published and sold, devouring many small bookstores in the process. But the Amazon founder and CEO also has an abiding love of reading, and it has played a key role in forming him as a leader. In biography ""The Everything Store,"" author Brad Stone describes how books shaped Bezos' leadership style and way of thinking. In fact, according to the book, there is a list of books Amazon employees refer to as ""Jeff's Reading List."" It includes autobiographies, business and technology reads and even a novel, and according to Stone, many Amazon executives have made their way through these volumes. How many of these have you read? 1. ""The Remains of the Day"" by Kazuo Ishiguro Ishiguro's novel is a first-person narrative told by a butler who recalls his time serving in the army during the first World War. Stone writes that it is Bezos' favorite novel. ""Bezos has said he learns more from novels than nonfiction,"" Stone writes. 2. ""Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies"" by Jim Collins This famous management read explains how companies that succeed build environments where ""employees who embrace the central mission flourish,"" Stone writes. 3. ""Creation: Life and How to Make It"" by Steve Grand ""A video game designer argues that intelligent systems can be created from the bottom up if one devises a set of primitive building blocks,"" Stone writes. ""The book was influential in the creation of Amazon Web Services, or AWS, the service that popularized the notion of the cloud."" 4. ""Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap … and Others Don't"" by Jim Collins Author and business consultant Collins briefed Amazon executives on many of the principles in this book before its publication, according to Stone. It explains how ""companies must confront the brutal facts of their business, find out what they are uniquely good at, and master their flywheel, in which each part of the business reinforces and accelerates the other parts."" 5. ""The Innovator's Dilemma"" by Clayton Christensen In this book, Christensen argues that companies improve by embracing disruptive innovation. Michael Bloomberg, founder and CEO of the eponymous company, once described the book as ""absolutely brilliant."" ""An enormously influential business book whose principles Amazon acted on and that facilitated the creation of the Kindle and [Amazon Web Services],"" Stone writes. ""Some companies are reluctant to embrace disruptive technology because it might alienate customers and undermine their core business, but Christensen argues that ignoring potential disruption is even costlier."" 6. ""Sam Walton: Made in America"" by Sam Walton ""In his autobiography, Walmart's founder expounds on the principles of discount retailing and discusses his core values of frugality and a bias for action — a willingness to try a lot of things and make many mistakes,"" Stone writes. ""Bezos included both in Amazon's corporate values."" 7. ""Lean Thinking: Banish Waste and Create Wealth in Your Corporation"" by James Womack and Daniel Jones This book explores how major American, European and Japanese companies applied a series of ""lean thinking"" principles in an attempt to cut costs and boost efficiency to survive the 1991 recession and grow over the rest of the decade. 8.""Memos from the Chairman"" by Alan Greenberg ""[The book is] a collection of memos to employees by the chairman of the now defunct investment bank Bear Stearns,"" Stone writes. ""In his memos, Greenberg is constantly restating the bank's core values, especially modesty and frugality."" 9. ""The Mythical Man-Month"" by Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. ""An influential computer scientist makes the counterintuitive argument that small groups of engineers are more effective than larger ones at handling complex software projects,"" Stone writes. 10. ""The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvements"" by Eliyahu Goldratt ""An exposition of the science of manufacturing written in the guise of the novel, the book encourages companies to identify the biggest constraints in their operations,"" Stone writes, ""and then structure their organizations to get the most out of those constraints."" 11. ""Data-Driven Marketing: The 15 Metrics Everyone in Marketing Should Know"" by Mark Jeffery ""[This is] a guide to using data to measure everything from customer satisfaction to the effectiveness of marketing,"" Stone writes. ""Amazon employees must support all assertions with data, and if the data has a weakness, they must point it out or their colleagues will do it for them."" 12. ""The Black Swan"" by Nassim Taleb ""The scholar argues that people are wired to see patterns in chaos while remaining blind to unpredictable events, with massive consequences. Experimentation and empiricism trumps the easy and obvious narrative,"" Stone writes. For Bezos, the most important thing a book can provide is an escape. ""The key thing about a book is that you lose yourself in the author's world,"" Bezos tells The Washington Post.

Investors in Theranos' latest funding rounds could get about two additional shares for each one they bought, according to the Journal, which cited unnamed people familiar with the matter. Investors likely paid $15 to $17 a share, but with the additional shares, the effective cost would now be lowered to about $5, the sources told the Journal. Holmes would give up her majority stake in the start-up as part of the deal,  which could potentially affect early shareholders such as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Walmart's founding family, and media titan Rupert Murdoch, the Journal reported. Neither Theranos nor the organizations affiliated with named investors were immediately available for comment. Though Theranos raked in more than $600 million in its latest funding rounds,  it now has about $150 million or less in cash, excluding debt, a source told the Journal. Theranos was founded by Holmes to realize the dream of testing blood by the drop, not the vial.

Rebecca Ungarino,03302017,CNBC,03232017,"By one measure, investors are more bullish than they've been in three years, and market sentiment is approaching ""euphoric territory,"" according to a new report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The BofAML Bull & Bear Indicator is now at 7, the highest level since July 2014. The indicator, on a scale of one to 10, is derived from six measurements of sentiment: hedge fund positioning, credit market technicals, equity market breadth, equity flows, bond flows and long-only fund positioning. Currently, the first three areas have reached what BofAML analysts deem ""very bullish"" levels. As a result, the gauge's current level of 7 is closing in on a ""sell signal,"" a team led by BofAML chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett wrote in a recent report while advising clients to ""stay long risk assets until sentiment reaches euphoric territory of 8.0."" On the other end of the spectrum, the indicator ticked toward ""extreme bearish"" levels during the market's lows of February 2016. In hindsight, that was obviously a great time to buy stocks. This gauge's current level, however, isn't a substantial warning sign to Erin Gibbs, equity chief investment officer at S&P Global. In fact, based on the indicator's past readings in conjunction with the market's moves during these bullish sentiment levels, if investors were to sell their holdings now, they could miss out.""The indicator has reached 7 and turned back down three times in [its] history so it's not a total assumption that we'll hit the euphoric 8 level. If investors pull the trigger early, at the 7 level, they'd typically miss about 5.5% positive return 12 months after the indicator hit 7,"" Gibbs wrote to CNBC on Friday.

""The indicator has reached 7 and turned back down three times in [its] history so it's not a total assumption that we'll hit the euphoric 8 level.

Adam Levy,03302017,Fool,03232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is the king of retail. Well, it's the king of brick-and-mortar retail. When it comes to online sales, it's still well behind Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Wal-Mart, though, is spending heavily to catch up, acquiring Jet.com and several other e-commerce websites over the past year. But for all Wal-Mart's efforts, Amazon is still widening the gap. Amazon accounted for over half of U.S. e-commerce growth last year, according to some estimates. And e-commerce is by far the biggest driving factor of overall retail growth in the United States. E-commerce accounted for 9.5% of all retail in the fourth quarter, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Online sales increased around 15% for the year, while the overall industry was up just about 3%. Wal-Mart is the biggest brick-and-mortar retailer in the world. As Amazon and other e-commerce sites start eating into more traditional brick-and-mortar retail segments, Wal-Mart investors may have something to worry about. Image source: Wal-Mart Wal-Mart made big headlines when it announced the acquisition of Jet.com for $3.3 billion last year. Few people paid attention to the streak of acquisitions Wal-Mart and Jet have made since then. Jet.com acquired Hayneedle just before the deal with Wal-Mart closed. Under Wal-Mart it acquired ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, and ModCloth. What's more, Wal-Mart's head of e-commerce in the U.S., Marc Lore, said it's ""a fair assumption"" that Jet and Wal-Mart will pursue more of these types of acquisitions. Wal-Mart is also investing in building out its own technology. It's creating a start-up incubator called Store No. 8 to build new technologies to enhance the customer experience both in stores and online. The company didn't disclose how much it plans to pour into the project. Wal-Mart doesn't have an R&D expense on its income statement, but if it did, it'd surely be rocketing higher. Still, it has to compete with the $16 billion Amazon spent on technology and content last year. (Some of that spending goes to support Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud-computing division, as well as Prime Instant Video). Wal-Mart may have the resources to spend that much, but there's one big concern Wal-Mart investors should have. Amazon has a huge moat called Amazon Prime. Amazon likely has over 70 million Prime subscribers, and the first place they go when they want to buy something online is Amazon.com. Wal-Mart tried to compete with Amazon Prime by offering its own shipping service -- ShippingPass. Earlier this year it ended the $49 per year program and started offering free two-day shipping to everyone for over 2 million items on its website (on orders $35 or more). That won't show up in R&D either, but it'll likely hit Wal-Mart's operating margin. The bigger problem, though, is that Amazon is at the top of mind for consumers shopping online. More than half of online shoppers start their product search on Amazon.com. Wal-Mart can piece together a bunch of web properties with a few million in sales each, but it won't cut into Amazon's huge dedicated customer base. So Wal-Mart may be spending heavily to grow its e-commerce through acquisitions and a new start-up incubator, but there's no indication that any of its efforts will produce results for the company -- especially considering the premiums it's paying for all these relatively small web stores. Again, e-commerce is the main driving force behind retail growth in the U.S. If Wal-Mart's only means of growing its online sales is through expensive acquisitions, that should concern investors. That's especially true considering nobody has been capable of cutting into Amazon's lead. ","

Daniel B. Kline,03302017,Fool,03232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ""No retailer is immune to the challenge of crime. We recognize the importance of this issue at the highest levels of the company, and we are investing in people and technology to support our stores,"" he wrote, noting that police are not being cut out of the loop. Alleged shoplifters who get the chance to participate in the course must pay a fee to take it. The company does not disclose what it charges, but the paper noted that ""the rate of repeat theft is low among those who have gone through the program."" If that proves to be true over a national rollout for the long run, then the company could save some serious money. Wal-Mart's large, often crowded stores can make it harder to stop shoplifters. Image source: Wal-Mart. The 2016 National Retail Security Survey (NRSS), conducted by the National Retail Federation (NRF) and Dr. Richard Hollinger of the University of Florida, shows that shrinkage (theft including shoplifting and employees stealing) cost retailers $45.2 billion in 2015. That's 1.38% of total sales and for the second year in a row shoplifting ""has surpassed employee theft as the greatest cause of inventory shrink,"" according to the study. The NRSS found that the average loss per shoplifting incident was $377, a nearly $60 increase from 2014. The cost of employees stealing actually dropped from $1,546.83 to $1,233.77 year over year. ""Loss prevention professionals continue to do an exceptional job at locating the issues and finding solutions to prevent additional loss in their retail stores,"" said NRSS lead author Hollinger in a press reelase. ""It is important for retailers to continue building relationships with law enforcement and leverage new technologies that can further provide protection to their assets, customers and employees."" Wal-Mart's hours and relatively lean staffing for the size of its stores means that in some, maybe many cases, the chain is impacted by shoplifters more than other retailers. Clearly that incentivizes Wal-Mart to change how it handles shoplifting. Adding more employees in general or in loss prevention might help catch more people, but the restorative justice program could actually lower repeat incidences of shoplifting without increasing costs for the chain. That's a big win for Wal-Mart, but it's also a model that might begin to make a dent in the $45.2 billion in shrinkage the industry experienced in 2015 should other retailers adopt it as well.

Timothy Green,03302017,Fool,03232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The retail industry is going through a major disruption, with e-commerce reaching critical mass and forcing even the most successful brick-and-mortar retailers to adapt. Already we've seen some bankruptcies, including RadioShack, hhgregg, and Sports Authority, and companies like Sears Holdings are knocking on death's door. Buying retail stocks amid this carnage is a delicate task, to say the least. There are a few retailers, however, that have bucked the trend. Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) is investing in both its stores and e-commerce, driving growth across the board. Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) is getting more efficient, slashing costs and delivering impressive profit growth. And Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is proving that its business is about as Amazon-proof as it gets. Here's why these three retailers are the top picks for 2017. Wal-Mart dominated the era of big-box discount stores, driving countless competitors out of business with its low prices. Amazon is now dominating the era of e-commerce, at least so far, putting every brick-and-mortar retailer at risk. Competing with Amazon will be neither easy nor cheap, but Wal-Mart is finally taking the threat seriously. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart's stores are, somewhat surprisingly, doing just fine in the age of e-commerce. Comparable-store sales have risen in the U.S. each quarter for the past few years, driven in part by investments the company has made in its stores, including higher wages and better training for employees. While other retailers were struggling to attract customers during the holiday quarter, Wal-Mart managed a 1.8% increase in U.S. comparable sales, driven almost entirely by an increase in traffic. The stores also provide a platform for Wal-Mart's online grocery pickup service, where customers order online and pick up for free at a store, with delivery available for an additional fee. This service, along with Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com last year, led to a 29% increase in online sales during the fourth quarter. Going forward, the recent move to offer free two-day shipping for all orders above $35, which dealt a blow to the value proposition offered by Amazon Prime, should help Wal-Mart maintain its e-commerce momentum. All of these investments are taking a toll on the bottom line. Wal-Mart expects to produce EPS between $4.20 and $4.40 this year, down at the midpoint compared to last year and substantially below peak earnings in 2014. But the cost of ignoring the threat posed by Amazon would be far higher in the long run. After dominating traditional discount retailing for decades, Wal-Mart is positioning itself to be a major force in e-commerce as well. Since 2012, Best Buy has staged an impressive turnaround. Unnecessary costs were slashed, with layers of management removed and efficiencies wrung out of the supply chain. Investments in e-commerce have led to booming online sales, driven by both increased web traffic and higher conversion rates. U.S. online sales jumped 17.5% year over year during the fourth quarter, with a larger 20.8% gain registered for the full year. Most importantly for investors, profits have soared. Adjusted EPS surged 28% during 2016 on a slight decline in total sales, driven by a higher gross margin and lower operating costs. Best Buy has become more competitive on price during its turnaround, but its gross margin is now not too far below historical levels. At the same time, the company has become far more efficient, spending just 19.2% of revenue on operating costs in 2016. That compares to 20.5% in 2010. Further earnings growth will be tougher to achieve, as there is a limit to Best Buy's cost-cutting efforts. Results last year were hurt by product availability issues, recalls like that of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, and a general lack of exciting new products, but Best Buy still managed to drive earnings higher. Trading at just 10 times earnings after backing out the net cash on the balance sheet, Best Buy is one of the best deals in retail. While some retailers have done better than others in the age of Amazon, Home Depot is firing on all cylinders. Revenue has grown consistently since 2009, jumping 6.9% in 2016 largely thanks to a 5.6% increase in comparable sales. Home Depot's operating margin last year was an impressive 14.2%, nearly double its operating margin in 2009. Based on this performance, it should be no surprise that the stock has nearly tripled over the past five years. HD data by YCharts. Selling large appliances, power tools, fixtures, outdoor furniture, lumber, and other products that don't translate well online, Home Depot has been able put up record numbers despite the ongoing consumer shift toward e-commerce. Home Depot isn't ignoring e-commerce, with online sales jumping 19% in 2016 and representing 5.9% of total revenue. But its stores are driving a big part of that growth, with 45% of all online orders being picked up by customers. Home Depot's stellar performance doesn't come cheap for investors. The stock trades for about 23 times earnings, a lofty valuation for a retailer with nearly $100 billion in annual sales. Still, the company's record over the past few years, and its potential to grow earnings going forward, may be enough to justify the price tag. Home Depot certainly isn't a stock for bargain hunters, but it is a good choice for those wanting to invest in one of the best retailers around. ","
      
    3 Top Retail Stocks to Buy in 2017 -- The Motley Fool

  "
Retail,03302017,MarketWatch,03232017,"Shoptalk 2017 Keynote Session: ebay CEO Devin Wenig and Recode Editor Jason Del ReySource: Fung Global Retail & Technology This week, the Fung Global Retail & Technology team was in Las Vegas to attend Shoptalk 2017, the next-generation commerce event which brings together technology and retail. One of our ongoing research themes has been the retail revolution that is currently taking place in the US and globally. With announcements earlier this week that Payless, Sears and Bebe will likely be the next major retailers to file for bankruptcy or put themselves up for sale, we believe we are still in the early stages of what will end up being a dramatic reorganization of the industry. While this means that there is still a lot of pain to come for traditional industry players, we are starting to see some of the successful next-generation strategies take shape. We picked these out from some of the companies attending Shoptalk. The Race To Become the “Everything Store” The race to become the “everything store” is well under way and it appears to be a two-horse competition with Amazon and Walmart locked in what we anticipate will be a very intense battle. For a while, it seemed like Amazon would inevitably usurp Walmart’s leading position, but now Walmart is showing that it is up to the task. Walmart e-commerce CEO, Marc Lore, was on stage at Shoptalk, and he indicated that: i) later this year, we will see Walmart start leveraging its biggest tactical advantage—its physical footprint and logistics knowhow—a lot more and in new ways; and ii) much like Amazon, Walmart will start incubating retail technologies at Store No 8—its new Silicon Valley program for entrepreneurs. These announcements come on top of the company’s recent acquisitions of Jet.com, which brought in Lore, Moosejaw and ModCloth, which are boosting the company’s online and digital marketplace businesses. In sum, the transformation under Lore has been quick and brings a lot of promise, and, at this point, it looks like the price tag for bringing him on board was in fact well justified. At Shoptalk, we saw that Amazon is continuing to make strides in improving its retail offering. The VP of Marketplaces, Peter Faricy, delivered a solid pitch to brands to start selling on Amazon’s marketplace. The marketplace already makes up more than 50% of the company’s sell-through and the retailer is continuing to invest in its infrastructure. Faricy highlighted Amazon’s fulfillment, brand protection and customer services initiatives, which, together with Amazon’s 300 million customers, make the marketplace a compelling distribution channel for any brand. With the rate of artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and logistics innovation that the company is showing, it is hard to argue that Amazon won’t be the most frictionless place for any brand to sell its products digitally.  Is There a Dark Horse? Yes, there is—Alibaba. Even though Alibaba is still relatively less known in the US, the company is arguably at the frontier of retail. The Chinese retail giant has already moved on from pure-play e-commerce into physical retail—with the acquisition of Intime and its partnership with Bailian in its core market—and is the quintessential digital marketplace, with an impressive ecosystem of support services for retailers and brands selling domestically and cross-border. Given the scale at which Alibaba already operates, no one should be underestimating its global aspirations. Lee McCabe, VP of North America for Alibaba Keynote at Shoptalk 2017Source What Does this Mean for Retail? “The Brand of One” In the digital marketplace age, the requirements and resources to start and operate a brand-driven business have changed. When setting up scalable distribution takes only 30 minutes on an Amazon, Walmart or Alibaba website, the definition of a brand changes to “anyone who has an engaged following.” This means we’ll likely see more new influencer-driven brands selling on digital marketplaces across product categories, a trend which is already playing out in China, where cewebrity stores are some of the highest-grossing retailers on Tmall, Alibaba’s marketplace. And on that note, at Shoptalk, we listened to Lionel Richie discuss expanding his namesake line of home products into more categories. “Content, Community and Lifestyle” Platforms How do you compete with an Amazon, a Walmart or even an Alibaba? The strategy that has emerged can be coined as “a vertical platform that combines content, community and product.” At Shoptalk, we saw presentations and interviews with companies such as Houzz and Thrive Market, and in the discussions with their CEOs, the same terms kept coming up: vertical, community, curation, content and lifestyle. For Houzz, this means creating a community around home design inspiration and services, and for Thrive Market—an online market for food, health and pet products, which cater to a healthy lifestyle. These companies are betting on creating a curated offering for a niche category as a way to differentiate from the “everything stores.” Omnichannel is Not Just a Strategy, It’s a Tactic The retail revolution is both consolidating and fragmenting the landscape at the same time, and retailers will need to decide on which end of the spectrum they want to compete: i) on scope and price of the product offering; or ii) on creating curated experiences that serve the particular lifestyle needs of the consumer. In this sense, the online-offline decision is a purely tactical one, rather than a strategy in itself. Successful retailers will build strategies with their target customers’ lifestyles at the core, and design products and services around that. It’s an exciting time for retail!

Analysts there estimate that the e-commerce giant has a $14 billion-plus apparel business. “We believe that Amazon is taking advantage of the dislocation in apparel retailing and aggressively rolling out a more-expansive private label offering,” KeyBanc analysts wrote in a recent note. They highlight that the merchandise underneath these brand umbrellas, including dress shirts and underwear, are “replenishment” products that “lend themselves to repeat purchases, have fewer national wholesale brand competitors, and can leverage Amazon’s data advantage.” See also: Shoppers get mad as hell when their favorite brand is bought out by the big guys Moreover, Amazon is highlighting the brands when customers do a generic search.

                                   is number 10 with $9.0 billion. Just because Amazon didn’t make the top 10 list doesn’t mean it won’t gain ground, and quickly. More than 50 cents of every dollar spent online in the U.S. goes to Amazon, according to a video by The Economist posted Friday on Twitter. And apparel is the number one e-commerce category, according to the latest comScore figures, with $20.3 billion in sales in the fourth-quarter of 2016. With that in mind, it’s important for Wal-Mart, and all other retailers, to carve out a stake now. “The acquisitions are about assortment and expertise,” said Ravi Jariwala, spokesperson for Wal-Mart. He said these brands have cultivated customers who “have come to love and trust these brands,” which is why “it’s important to maintain the sites separately.” “They may not have shopped Wal-Mart in the past, but now we can reach them through these sites and brands,” he said. See also: Wal-Mart targets new, wealthier customers with niche site acquisitions This is also a part of what Laura Kennedy, director of retail insights at Kantar Retail, calls the “evolution” of Wal-Mart. “They’ve been around for more than 50 years. For at least 30 of that, they were America’s mass retailer,” she said. “Their customer is the average American.” With more people shopping online, and shopping at Amazon, what it means to win in retail is being redefined. “The ones that have a very clear role with shoppers, a clear place in their lives, are successful right now,” said Kennedy. To achieve that special place with apparel, Wal-Mart has chosen retailers with a “distinctive brand and assortment,” Kennedy said.

The bigger threat may be to the companies being acquired. “There’s a risk that smaller companies are being overwhelmed by the size of the acquirer,” said Stephan Schambach, founder and chief executive of NewStore, a mobile retail platform, something he believes Lore will avoid. Once Wal-Mart has the fashion expertise, then they can start considering more private label brands, which can increase margins. “I think much of what they’re doing right now is getting the initial set of experiences,” said Schambach. “You want to have a nucleus of brands that know how this works. To me, that makes all the sense in the world.” ","Wal-Mart is beating the pants off Amazon in apparel, and it’s fighting to keep it that way - MarketWatch"

recently bought ModCloth, the online women’s clothing and accessories retailer with a vintage flair. ModCloth’s customers are not happy, and took to Twitter to share their dismay after the acquisition, saying they’ll no longer shop there and going so far as to share retail alternatives. For some customers, it might seem an odd match. Wal-Mart ranks among the lowest of department and discount stores in terms of customer satisfaction, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, and has landed well below the industry average for years. Wal-Mart, which has also faced high employee turnover in the past, is working on better worker compensation, complete with pay increase structures and training programs. The company also supports philanthropic causes and local communities, such as volunteering and grants, said Ravi Jariwala, a Wal-Mart spokesman. “Wal-Mart is very different from some of the perceptions some people still hold,” he said. “ModCloth is special because they created a community,” said Michelle Madhok, an online shopping expert and founder of deals site shefinds.com. “It’s really like Wal-Mart buying up your friends.” ModCloth will continue to act as a stand-alone company, with its online site and one brick-and-mortar location in Austin, Texas. The management team will also stay intact, Jariwala said. ModCloth may lose some core customers, Madhok said, but then there are others who will complain and keep buying from them because they like their products. “The question is, how long are people’s memories?” she said. But customers who tweeted show concern the two companies have misaligned values, and said they could no longer support the vintage retailer. Alternative places to buy instead of Modcloth. Plus Size companies are marked. pic.twitter.com/8nqIrRlf1R The acquisition will allow ModCloth to continue on its mission to promote a positive body image and empower individual personalities, said ModCloth’s chief executive officer, Matt Kaness. “It will give us the ability to reach more women, to grow our community.” Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but TechCrunch reports the price for ModCloth was between $50 and $75 million. Company values are important to customers, according to consulting firm Corporate Executive Board study published by the Harvard Business Review in 2012: 64% of 7,000 consumers in the U.S., U.K. and Australia said shared values are a primary reason for a strong brand relationship. Other brands that promote their values include shoe company Toms, which came up with a One for One movement to give pairs of shoes to those in need, and Timberland, which promotes environmentally friendly causes, such as 233 million plastic water bottles that have become part of its footwear, the report noted. (Private equity company Bain Capital acquired Toms in 2014 and VF Corporation, which owns North Face and Nautica, acquired Timberland in 2011).

Dominic Chopping,03302017,MarketWatch,03232017,"Published: Mar 30, 2017 2:51 a.m. ET By STOCKHOLM--Fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz AB (HM-B.SK) said Thursday that its first-quarter net profit dropped 3% from a year earlier after seeing lower sales growth than planned and increased mark-downs. The company said the fashion retail market has been tough in many of its large markets in central and southern Europe and in the U.S., and this was reflected in sales. In response, H&M will invest heavily in its supply chain, such as in new logistics solutions with greater levels of automation, and in optimising lead times. It is also shuffling its store portfolio, paying particular attention to markets that did not perform sufficiently well, which will see closures, the addition of more store space and rebuilds while also developing a new and upgraded version of its H&M stores. The cheap-chic retailer also announced a new brand that will be launched in early autumn this year called ARKET, offering a range of clothing for men, women and children, as well as a small assortment of home products. The range will be supported by a selection of external brands, it added. H&M's net profit in the first quarter, which runs from Dec. 1, 2016 to Feb. 28, 2017, was 2.46 billion Swedish kronor ($277.1 million), compared with SEK2.55 billion for the same period last year, but topping expectations of SEK2.34 billion according to a FactSet poll.

Alessandra Malito,03302017,MarketWatch,03232017,"Published: Mar 29, 2017 12:41 p.m. ET More than a third of Americans expect to help their parents financially in the next seven years By William Lau, a 27-year-old marketing professional in New York City, splits all of his parents’ expenses with his older brother Simon and older sister Kaity, including property tax on their Brooklyn home, utilities, auto insurance and day-to-day spending. The trio has been doing this for the past three years, though Lau pays a little more since he still lives at home. Prior to that, they were supporting 75% of the bills. His parents are immigrants, and though they work, they have little in savings and no retirement plan. Lau and his siblings will financially support them now and in the future, he says. “If you care about your parents and they did right by you your whole life, I think it makes sense to care for them when they need it,” Lau said. Millennials, the generation of people in their 20s to mid-30s, have a bad reputation for relying on mom and dad for financial support, but that’s not always the case. In some situations, such as Lau’s and his siblings, millennials are the ones supporting their parents financially, because they want to or because their parents need them to do so. In fact, Millennials spent about $18,000 a year on average to help their family, according to a 2015 TD Ameritrade study: 70% said they supported a mother and 43% said they supported a father. See: My roommate is the most entitled millennial in America. Do I tell her? This trend will only continue, as millennials and their parents age, experts say. Many in this young generation will eventually assume the role of the “sandwich generation,” providing financial assistance to the generation following and before them, such as their growing children and aging parents. More than a third of Americans expect to help their parents financially in the next seven years, according to the Society of Grownups, a Brookline, Mass.-based online financial advice group. “As millennials get older and independent, their parents get older and become dependent,” said Ariel Anderson, a financial planner with the Society of Grownups. Retirement isn't at the top of minds for many, and the savings gap is widening: 52% of American households may not be able to maintain their standard of living in retirement, up from 45% in 2004, Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research found. For many millennials, helping their parents is just giving back for all the help that they received. Parents sometimes weigh their children’s education as more important than their retirement — 76% of parents said they would delay their retirement to pay for their children’s college, according to a 2016 T. Rowe Price survey. See also:  What do we owe our parents in their old age? This millennial asked the internet However, they may also be stuck between helping their own parents and their adult children with money — in the same TD Ameritrade study, the average amount people spent on either was $12,000 a year. They might have also been struck with bad luck in the economy or struggled as business owners. Some millennials have found more direct ways to help their folks — by employing them. Allen Walton, a 29-year-old entrepreneur in Dallas with an online security company, employs his mother full-time in his business, and his father is a contractor on projects. His parents also hold equity in the business, which means they receive a check every year and will get a lump sum when he sells his company. The two owned a business while he was growing up, but it didn’t last and they didn’t set money aside for their retirement. When he started his company three years ago, Walton knew he wanted to help them get by — and that he could handle it financially. “I have my entire life’s earning potential ahead of me,” he said. Of course millennials’ reputation of depending on their parents for money and shelter isn’t entirely unfounded — one in three Americans between the ages of 21 and 45 is receiving financial support in some way from their parents, according to a May 2016 Society of Grownups survey. As an entire generation, millennials are holding off on moving out, getting married and having children. At the same time, however, they face the highest amount of student debt of any generation and earn lower income on average than previous generations did at their ages. Still, adult children say they’ll be happy to help out their parents in the future. If forced to choose, people who financially support families were four times more likely to decide to help their aging parent than an adult child, and 64% are very glad to help a parent, according to a TD Ameritrade study from 2015. And even those living at home aren't as entitled as some studies might suggest. After leaving town for a job, Ty Gates, a 26-year-old media relations professional, found himself living back at home with his mom in Los Angeles. He had lived at home throughout college, but this time is different: he gives her money for rent, pays all or at least half of the family cellphone plan every month and pays for her dog’s day care. “I try to help as much as possible,” Gates said. “She let me stay there for free in college. I should give back in some way.” Don’t miss: Millennials need to worry about these 4 things -- in addition to saving for retirement Perhaps the most important thing millennials can do when faced with these financial challenges is have an honest conversation with their parents about their money and future earnings potential. “It doesn’t happen with the snap of a finger but the opportunity to explore these different options can lighten the burden,” Anderson said. Not many parents or adult children are likely to spark conversations on finances — 11% of parents and 37% of adult children, according to New York-based financial services firm TIAA. They consider these discussions to be awkward or uncomfortable. Millennials also need to think of their own futures and plan accordingly since helping their parents can have an impact on their own financial obligations, such as how many children they have or the size of their homes, said Erin Lowry, author of “Broke Millennial: Stop Scraping By and Get Your Financial Life Together,” coming out in May. “It can feel daunting at first and that’s okay,” she said. “Part of it is just putting a little bit more aside and having the idea in the back of your mind that you probably will have to take care of your parents.” Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending barely rose in February amid delays in the payment of income tax refunds, but the biggest annual increase in inflation in nearly five years supported expectations of further interest rate hikes this year. The slowdown in consumer spending reported by the Commerce Department on Friday is, however, likely to be temporary with consumer confidence at a more than 16-year high and a tightening labor market pushing up wage growth. “Given the weather-related weakness in utilities spending as well as some delays in tax refunds for low- and middle-income earners in February, we expect consumer spending to strengthen in the quarters ahead,” said Eugenio Aleman, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, edged up 0.1 percent. That was the smallest gain since August and followed an unrevised 0.2 percent rise in January. Economists had expected a 0.2 percent increase. The government delayed the issuing of tax refunds this year as part of efforts to combat fraud. Spending last month was held back by a 0.1 percent dip in purchases of big-ticket items like automobiles. While unseasonably warm weather lowered households’ heating bills, it restricted spending growth last month. Weak consumer spending resulted in the Atlanta Federal Reserve trimming its first-quarter economic growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 0.9 percent annualized rate. Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter, stepping down from the July-September quarter’s brisk 3.5 percent pace. Despite signs of moderate growth, economists expect the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at least twice more this year. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month. Other data on Friday showed the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index slipping to a reading of 96.9 in March from 97.6 earlier in the month. The final reading was a touch higher than February’s 96.3. A report from the Conference Board this week showed its consumer confidence index surging in March to its highest reading since December 2000. The dollar was trading slightly higher against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks fell marginally as investors skimmed profits off recent gains. Prices for U.S. government bonds rose modestly. INFLATION PRESSURES BUILDINGEven with economic growth slowing at the start of the year, inflation is rising. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 0.1 percent last month after jumping 0.4 percent in January. That lifted the year-on-year rate of increase in the PCE price index to 2.1 percent, the biggest gain since April 2012. The PCE price index rose 1.9 percent in January. Excluding food and energy, the so-called core PCE price index increased 0.2 percent last month after rising 0.3 percent in January. In the 12 months through February, the core PCE price index increased 1.8 percent after a similar gain in January. The core PCE is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure and is running below its 2 percent target. Inflation is now in the upper end of the range that Fed officials in March felt would be reached this year. “There is nothing in this report that suggests the Fed should pause in June in its gradual renormalization of monetary policy but the Fed will look closely at the evolution of core inflation over the next two months in making that decision,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Rising price pressures are also eating into consumer spending. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending fell 0.1 percent in February after declining 0.2 percent in January. That was the first back-to-back monthly decline in real consumer spending since April 2009. Personal income rose 0.4 percent last month after advancing 0.5 percent in January. Wages increased 0.5 percent, the biggest gain in five months. Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation increased 0.2 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in January. Savings rose to a five-month high of $808.0 billion from $770.9 billion in January. Rising incomes and higher savings bode well for future consumer spending. ","

,04062017,Reuters,03302017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A sophisticated hacking group that pursues Chinese government interests broke into the website of a private U.S. trade group ahead of Thursday’s summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to researchers. The hackers left a malicious link on web pages where members of the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) register for upcoming meetings, according to researchers at Fidelis Cybersecurity and a person familiar with the trade group. The malicious link deployed a spying tool called Scanbox, which would have recorded the type and versions of software running on the computers of those exposed to it, said Fidelis researcher John Bambenek. Such reconnaissance is typically followed by new attacks using known flaws in the detected software, especially older versions. Scanbox has only been used by groups associated with the Chinese government, Fidelis said, and was recently seen on a political site aimed at Uyghurs, an ethnic minority under close government scrutiny in China. The breach was detected about five weeks ago by a NFTC director who is a customer of Fidelis, the security company said. Both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the NFTC were notified and the malicious link removed, and Fidelis said it had no evidence of NFTC members being infected. The FBI and the NFTC declined to comment. A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Bambenek said he believed the attack was classic espionage related to international trade talks, rather than a violation of a 2015 agreement between former U.S. President Barack Obama and Xi to end spying for commercial motives. The summit starting on Thursday is the first meeting between Xi and Trump, who blamed China on the campaign trail for the loss of many U.S. jobs and vowed to confront the country’s leaders on the matters of trade and currency manipulation. “I think it’s traditional espionage that happens ahead of any summit,” said Bambenek. “They would like to know what we, the Americans, really care about and use that for leverage.” Other security firms agreed that wholesale theft of U.S. intellectual property has not returned. FireEye researcher John Hultquist said heavy industries in Nordic countries have been hacked more often as Beijing switches priorities. “They are certainly taking those resources and pushing them to other places where they can still get away with this behavior,” Hultquist said.

Nathan Reiff,04062017,Investopedia,03302017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs For Frank Yiannas, the vice president of food safety at Walmart (WMT), monitoring the source and distribution routes of food products is key to ensuring customer safety. The U.S. retailer has worked with IBM (IBM) to develop means of utilizing blockchain technology to track its supply chain, with a particular emphasis on food products. This emerges as the most recent of several examples of non-tech companies adopting blockchain technology for purposes outside of the realm of its original design, which was as a ledger and tracking services for transactions made with digital currency Bitcoin. How will Walmart use this new technology? And could it be a revolutionary step for the retail industry in a broader sense? Yiannas explains in an article by Fortune that his company was inspired to utilize blockchain technology for supply chain monitoring by a deadly E. coli scare that happened about a decade ago. The tainted food was, in this case, spinach, and Yiannas believes it goes back to poor practices of sourcing and tracing the contaminated food products. ""Consumers, in general, stopped eating spinach...if you could track and pinpoint where that came from faster, you could alleviate all that and ensure consumer confidence continues,"" he said. Beyond that, in a case like this one, you could also potentially reduce the number of people who were sickened or killed by poisoned food. With an effort at retaining consumer confidence in the event of a similar scare, Walmart has worked with IBM and Beijing's Tsinghua University to use blockchain to digitally track how pork products in China move. Walmart's experiment makes use of blockchain technology designed specifically for this purpose by the Hyperledger Project. This is an open source project that was based out of the Linux Foundation and which aims to create blockchain applications for non-cryptocurrency purposes. Previously, many companies tracked their products via barcodes or radio ID tags. While this was a generally reliable way of monitoring food supply chains for a single company, it did not allow for multiple companies to easily access or share data. Blockchain, on the other hand, provides both accessibility in a broader sense as well as security. It is generally agreed that blockchain ledgers are less prone to fraud and inaccuracy than other types of ledger systems. This means that blockchains storing supply details like source, expiration date, shipping history, and more could be used to keep food safer and food information easier to track down. Walmart is betting that this will alleviate the risk of contamination outbreaks and that other companies will jump on board with the new technology. Of course, this remains to be seen, but early success by the retailer could inspire confidence in other brands.

Target Corporation (TGT) has experienced a particularly difficult start to the year after reporting an abysmal fourth quarter. Revenue fell 4.3% year over year to $20.69 billion, but a 100 basis point reduction in gross margins and a 30 basis point reduction in EBITDA margins were the market's biggest concerns. Analysts see the stock as caught between Walmart Stores Inc. (WMT) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN​) in terms of its strategy. On a technical level, Target shares remain near their 52-week lows after making an attempt to breakout higher earlier this month. Relative strength index readings suggest the stock is oversold at 35.63 while moving average convergence-divergence readings showed a modest bullish uptrend. Traders should watch for a breakout from these levels toward R1 resistance and the 50-day moving average at $59.16 if the stock can rebound from its lows. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY​) may have only fallen about 4% so far this year, but the stock also trades near its 52-week low of $37.28. Unlike Target, the company topped fourth quarter estimates with a 0.4% increase in comparable sales, although it expects EPS to fall at a low single-digit pace this year. The company was also boosted by a $1.7 billion share repurchase plan, of which, $171 million was spent during the fourth quarter. On a technical level, the stock remains near its 52-week lows and has experienced troubles breaking out from its 50-day moving average at $39.73. Traders should watch for a breakout from these levels with strong downside protection at prior lows and S1 support at $37.82. A breakout could send shares to R2 resistance and 200-day moving average levels at $42.38. Both RSI and MACD readings remain more neutral than Target, however. With retail stocks having moved significantly lower, traders may want to watch for oversold conditions and opportunities to buy into a rebound. Stock charts courtesy of StockCharts.com.

Rakesh Sharma,04062017,Investopedia,03302017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Now you can buy products from Amazon.com, Inc.'s (AMZN) e-commerce site using cash. The online retailer announced the launch of Amazon Cash to facilitate purchases from its site for customers who do not have a credit card or access to a bank account. To implement the system, the e-commerce site has partnered with several retailers, such as CVS Health Corporation (CVS). Customers receive a barcode on their phone if they inform Amazon's site that they would like to pay with cash. They can add money to their Amazon account by showing the barcode at the nearest participating retailer. Amazon's latest payment innovation is similar to PayPal Holdings, Inc.'s (PYPL) My Paypal Cash card, which has a similar partnership with retailers that enables its customers to make cash payments on multiple sites. However, in Amazon's case, the move benefits its e-commerce operations. Its competitor Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) launched a ""Pay with Cash"" initiative for online purchases back in 2012. (See also: Walmart E-Commerce Intimidating Amazon.) According to the National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households in 2015 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), 7 percent (9 million) and 19.5 percent (24.5 million) of U.S. households were unbanked and underbanked, respectively, in 2015. The report stated that 62.5 percent of unbanked households used cash to make purchases, and a significant majority of underbanked households used alternative financial services (AFS). Amazon has made efforts to expand its reach by targeting this demographic. For example, the company has run promotional campaigns and offered free Prime membership to low-income households. It has also ramped up its operations in underserved neighborhoods after news reports that criticized its services in such neighborhoods. The move also benefits the company's bottom line by helping bolster membership to its Amazon Prime program. (See also: Amazon Filing Reveals Prime Numbers for the First Time.)

Lauren Thomas,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"Jeff Bezos' Amazon is now worth almost double Wal-Mart's market value — in case investors need yet another reminder of the revolution in retail. The Seattle-based giant has a market capitalization of over $430 billion, according to FactSet data. In comparison, Wal-Mart's market cap sits below $220 billion as of Wednesday morning. Like Wal-Mart, Amazon pitches itself to investors as a retailer, but is also a filmmaker, a cloud computing company, a grocery chain and a bookstore, among other things. So the comparison is, to a degree, apples to oranges — with one company aiming to take people to space and another that's staying focused on keeping its prices low, and not venturing outside the retail sector. ""[Wal-Mart] continues to work to blend physical and digital assets in its operations, including a focus on buy online pick-up in-store, online grocery pickup, and 2-day shipping from its 5 e-commerce fulfillment centers,"" Guggenheim Securities wrote in a Tuesday note to clients. ""Walmart.com's offering has grown increasingly competitive and the company continues to work on getting its e-commerce inventory levels in the right place to meet its 2-day free shipping promise,"" the note added. Some analysts, however, believe Wal-Mart has missed out on opportunities to be as expansive as Amazon, especially when it comes to groceries. Online grocery shopping could grow five-fold over the next decade, with U.S. consumers spending upwards of $100 billion on food-at-home items by 2025, according an forecast released earlier this year by Food Marketing Institute and Nielsen. AmazonFresh is Bezos' way of capitalizing on this trend. On Tuesday, BMO Capital Markets issued a new note on Wal-Mart to investors, maintaining its underperform rating on the stock and citing price cuts in grocery and households essentials as pressuring the retailer's top line. Recent pricing data suggest Wal-Mart could have trouble hitting its upcoming quarterly comparable sales growth targets, analyst Wayne Hood said. As of Tuesday's close, Wal-Mart has climbed nearly 5 percent over the past 12 months, while Amazon has risen close to 55 percent. Amazon hit an all-time intraday high of $908.54 on Tuesday. Wal-Mart had its last intraday high in January 2015, when the stock peaked at $90.97 per share. ",Amazon worth twice Wal-Mart
Ari Levy,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"Amazon's explanation last week that it was closing Quidsi because the unit was unprofitable didn't sound much like Jeff Bezos. The Amazon founder is famous for operating retail businesses at such slim margins that rivals can't compete. Quidsi employees had another reason to be surprised. As recently as late 2016, at Quidsi's quarterly all-hands meeting in Jersey City, New Jersey, executives from Amazon headquarters in Seattle spoke to the unit's 250-plus workers and affirmed the parent company's commitment to Quidsi's business, according to multiple people who were in attendance. (Recode previously reported on some details of this meeting.) One of the executives to present was John Boumphrey, Amazon's vice president who oversees baby products, and the direct boss of Quidsi CEO Emilie Arel Scott, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the meeting was confidential. Yet last Wednesday, with the first quarter coming to a close, employees were informed that Amazon was shutting Quidsi down and laying off hundreds of workers, ostensibly because the division was unable to make a profit. The diapers, toiletries, beauty products and pet care items sold by the various Quidsi brands would all be available on Amazon.com, the company said. Not everyone was shocked. Earlier in March, Quidsi's finance chief, Randy Greben, left to become CFO of clothing company Ann Taylor, though as of Monday morning he was still listed as the No. 2 executive on Quidsi's leadership page. One person who spoke to CNBC.com said Greben's departure was a ""huge red flag."" Behind the scenes, the winding down of Quidsi had been quietly underway for over a year. Unlike shoe seller Zappos, which Amazon acquired in 2009 and has flourished as an established independent brand, Quidsi's commodity products play right into Amazon's core business. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Amazon started redirecting inventory from Quidsi's three fulfillment centers -- in Nevada, Kansas and Pennsylvania -- to Amazon's own massive network of warehouses, sources said. That process continued throughout 2016 and is still underway, two people told us. Quidsi's facilities were running out of capacity. The robots that ran through Quidsi's fulfillment centers, pulling goods from shelves and efficiently boxing them up, were owned by Amazon through the 2012 acquisition of robot maker Kiva Systems. Amazon was investing in improving the robots but directing those upgrades primarily to its own facilities, not Quidsi's, sources said. Furthermore, from a customer perspective, Amazon preferred to keep buyers on its own website rather than on Quidsi's network of sites like Diapers.com and Soap.com. With its inventory fleeing to Amazon's warehouses and the Quidsi sites being de-emphasized, there was no longer a strategic reason to have a separate Quidsi operation. ""They didn't buy service with Quidsi, they bought domain names and customer lists,"" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has a buy rating on Amazon. ""It was inevitable that both diapers and soap would be absorbed into Amazon's overall business, as there is no competitive advantage given up by doing so."" An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment. Amazon executives have not mentioned Quidsi on an earnings call since July 2015, and that was only in response to an analyst's question about recent management changes. Amazon's then-CFO Thomas Szkutak said, ""We're pleased that business and the team -- our retail team works very closely with the Quidsi business and [we're] excited to have it as part of the Amazon team."" Quidsi management has always been a sensitive subject for Amazon and Bezos. Marc Lore co-founded Quidsi in 2005 and waged a tough fight against Amazon in the categories of diapers and toiletries. Amazon responded by slashing prices on diapers, pressuring Quidsi's margins and making investors in the upstart reluctant to pour in more cash. In 2010, a bidding war for Quidsi ensued between Amazon and Wal-Mart, with Bezos ultimately winning with a bid of $545 million. Lore left Amazon and Quidsi in 2013, then turned around and raised billions of dollars for his next venture, Jet.com, a broader e-commerce effort that was originally intended to work on a membership basis, sort of like Costco. Wal-Mart bought Jet last year for $3.3 billion, putting Lore in charge of the discounter's e-commerce efforts and pitting him squarely against Bezos. Analysts and former employees said Bezos's personal rivalry with Lore could be one reason why the Amazon CEO shuttered the Quidsi business. Five days after employees were told of the shutdown, Quidsi's website continues to tell a different story. It says the unit has 1,100 employees, a number that presumably includes warehouse jobs, and is ""still growing!"" As of Monday morning, the site had 16 job listings, including for a buying manager, director of mobile apps and multiple software engineers. We've also asked Amazon how it plans to repurpose Quidsi's fulfillment centers, and haven't yet heard back. ",Amazon was sucking in Quidsi's inventory over a year before shutdown

Anita Balakrishnan,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"Amazon is quietly expanding its bookstore footprint — a move that could offer clues about its ambitions for other types of stores. The e-commerce giant told CNBC on Tuesday it will open another New York City bookstore location this summer at 7 West 34th St., across from Empire State Building. Amazon's bookstores look ordinary at first glance. But by pulling out a mobile phone with the Amazon app, shoppers can use visual search technology to identify books and objects around them. The search reveals reviews, shipping options and price. While Amazon is keeping the wraps on its physical grocery experiments, these high-tech brick-and-mortar bookstores could give a hint at the future of retail. Customers walking out of an Amazon convenience store in Seattle on Tuesday haven't had to stand in any sort of line or checkout. Instead, they scan their phone when they enter, grab what they need and just walk out. It's thanks to a technology Amazon aptly calls ""just walk out,"" though it's currently limited to employees while it is in test mode. The experiment is crucial for Amazon, which has invested in competing with brands like Walmart and Kroger. Data from Tabs Analytics shows that penetration of online grocery shopping has been consistently low, suggesting that people still want to go to physical stores and pick out their groceries. If models like Amazon Go are adopted on a larger scales — perhaps also for home appliance showrooms, as suggested by The New York Times — Amazon could chart a new omnichannel experience.

""We continue to view AMZN as one of the top large-cap growth stories in Internet,"" Patil wrote, pointing specifically to the company's strength in e-commerce and cloud services. According to Stacey Gilbert, Susquehanna's head of derivative strategy, using options would be the best way to play Amazon right now. ""Options in Amazon are about as cheap as we have seen, so if you are uncomfortable that our $1,250 price target is too bullish, or you're just concerned that that downside could be higher probability than we're pricing, the options are certainly an attractive way to play it right now,"" Gilbert said. For example, investors may want to go out three months and buy an at-the-money call option. That would cost a little over 4 percent of its spot price, so the investment wouldn't be cheap ""in dollar terms,"" Gilbert said, but as a percent of spot price, ""this is in the bottom 10 percentile of what we've seen over the last two years.""

In a Feb. 2 note published as Amazon reported a revenue miss in the fourth quarter, Patil wrote that investors should buy Amazon ""aggressively on any potential dislocation."" ""We continue to view AMZN as one of the top large-cap growth stories in Internet,"" Patil wrote, pointing specifically to the company's strength in e-commerce and cloud services. According to Stacey Gilbert, Susquehanna's head of derivative strategy, using options would be the best way to play Amazon right now. ""Options in Amazon are about as cheap as we have seen, so if you are uncomfortable that our $1,250 price target is too bullish, or you're just concerned that that downside could be higher probability than we're pricing, the options are certainly an attractive way to play it right now,"" Gilbert said. For example, investors may want to go out three months and buy an at-the-money call option. That would cost a little over 4 percent of its spot price, so the investment wouldn't be cheap ""in dollar terms,"" Gilbert said, but as a percent of spot price, ""this is in the bottom 10 percentile of what we've seen over the last two years."" ""So all that being said, if you wanted the embedded protection that comes in options, the options themselves are about as cheap as we've seen,"" she said.

Eric Rosenbaum,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"P.T. Barnum has nothing on Elon Musk, whose every word and tweet are met with excitement by millions around the world. In fact, when CNBC asked the founders and CEOs of young start-ups that made the recent CNBC Upstart 25 list who they would want as a guest speaker at their company, nine of the 25 named the Tesla Motors, SpaceX and PayPal founder. ""When he sees a problem or opportunity to do something better, he builds a company to solve it,"" said Jason Palmer, co-founder and COO of on-the-go charging company MobileQubes. Indeed, Musk announced another new company this week, called Neuralink, which will work on neural lace, a technology he's hoping will literally meld man and machine, attaching artificial intelligence to the human brain's cortex (he'll figure out the details later). Musk was also busy raising the bar in rocketry this week: For the first time in history SpaceX was able to re-use a rocket in a successful launch. Musk is even an inspiration in the low-tech industries on our Upstart 25 list. Galit Laibow is CEO and co-founder of Foodstirs, the on-demand healthy baking start-up that lists actress Sarah Michelle Gellar among its founders. Laibow told CNBC she would want Musk first because he ""is all about vision, challenging status quo and reinventing the norm — much as we're about reinventing the baking industry."" The founders of DroneDeploy noted, ""We're three South African co-founders trying to bring a completely new technology to the world. He's a South African-born entrepreneur whose done it three times."" But founders and CEOs of Upstart 25 companies also revealed a few surprises: Some great visionaries of our time and some from long ago. Although Silicon Valley hasn't earned high marks for its treatment of gender, many more start-ups are being founded by women, including 10 on the Upstart 25 list. The founders of feminine hygiene products company Lola and investing firm Ellevest — started by one of Wall Street's most powerful women (Sallie Krawcheck) — named Gloria Steinem as the speaker they would bring in before anyone else. These were also the only founders who added no explanatory language supporting their selection — the name alone was enough. But the feminist icon was not the most popular female choice. Michelle Obama, former First Lady, was the most in-demand speaker after Musk. ""We know she's on a beach somewhere, but we'd love hearing from Michelle Obama. She brings many lessons on rallying people to causes that are important,"" said Ursula Mead, CEO and founder of InHerSight, a start-up focused on helping women find the best career fits. For Grokker, an on-demand fitness start-up, this is no hypothetical exercise. Its founder and CEO, Lorna Borenstein, has been hosting a series of webinars featuring business leaders on Silicon Valley secrets and culture, for which she has had ""high-powered girlfriends who hail from Pinterest, Google, Yahoo!, Lifelock, Kleiner Perkins, etc."" It's Ed Feitzinger, vice president of global logistics at Amazon, not CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, who actually helps move packages with maximum efficiency. And that's why the co-founder of Kenya-based agriculture start-up Markit Opportunity would invite Feitzinger before Bezos. ""Our offer to smallholder farmers is creating supply chains that are more efficient and effective at increasing transparency, and having his expertise and experience with supply-chain logistics, combined with the ability to lead, would be very insightful for the team,"" said Zeluis Teixeira, co-founder. Amazon hired Feitzinger, a former CEO of UTi Worldwide, one of the largest supply-chain management companies, last September. While Amazon says publicly it won't compete with FedEx or UPS, Amazon has now built facilities within 20 miles of 44 percent of the U.S. population, according to PiperJaffray. And at the same time, it's becoming more global. This week Amazon announced it had acquired the Middle East's largest online retailer, Souq, for $800 million. Shipping economics have never been more important to Amazon. A big reason for its current vicious price war with consumer brands and Wal-Mart is difficulty moving lots of packages at a profit. Regulators may seem like the boring people of technology, seeking to limit its reach rather than lead innovation, but this week new Federal Communications Commission chair Ajit Pai demonstrated a little bit of his power to influence, if not inspire, every single move made online. Congress voted to reverse an Obama-era rule that limited the ability of the telecommunications companies that provide broadband access to sell private-user data without consent. It is a decision that Pai supports (he voted against the Obama-era rule when he was in the minority among FCC members). Pai is also expected to revisit net neutrality rules enacted during the Obama era, which was designed to prohibit broadband providers from playing favorites among apps and services. Pai attracted the attention of cloud software services start-up Midfin Systems founders, who said, ""We would like to bring Ajit Pai, the new FCC chair, so that we can help inform the national and global agenda on the future of internet."" The start-up's co-founders share something in common with Pai: All three are Indian-Americans. Since Donald J. Trump's election, copies of George Orwell's dystopian classic ""1984"" have returned to the best-seller list. So it should not come as too big a surprise that start-ups don't just want to read the book but have George Orwell as their dream guest speaker. It also makes sense that it's cybersecurity founders who are infatuated with the novelist who created the ""Big Brother"" surveillance state. Pavel Gurvich, CEO of GuardiCore, one of the growing number of Israeli-founded cybersecurity start-ups, said of Orwell, ""I think he had a very far-looking vision of how technology and society can evolve. '1984' is a warning of a future world where the machine exerts complete control over social life. ... We believe that technology should serve mankind, not control it. ... It would also be incredibly interesting to hear Orwell's vision now — if he knew what we know today — about how technology and society have evolved since his publishing of '1984' in 1949."" We're gonna guess this is a name most people don't know today, even if once upon a time, Norbert Weiner was a cultural sensation. This child prodigy was all over the popular press between the 1900s and 1910s for graduating high school and attending Tufts University at 11, then receiving his Ph.D. from Harvard at 18. Weiner spent decades as an MIT professor and wrote a book that widely popularized the idea of machine intelligence, ""Cybernetics,"" in 1948 (one year before Orwell's classic). The book's title was chosen by Weiner himself, and terms such as cyberspace and cyborg stem from it, summing up just how far it has reached, The actual theory of cybernetics — that machine intelligence could recreate the brain — were way ahead of actual science. But as today's research into artificial intelligence continues — and as Musk looks for a way into the human brain directly — start-up founders do look back to Weiner as a touchstone. Interestingly, it's the founders of a start-up that melds man and machine in a physical relationship that cited Weiner. Assaf Biderman, CEO of Superpedestrian, which is aiming to reinvent cycling through a robotic approach — and from Weiner's home turf at MIT — noted that Weiner's ""theories of human machine interaction in the 1960s pioneered a transformative new field of cybernetics."" The rise of machine intelligence has led to dire predictions about an apocalypse from noted thinkers including Musk and physicist Stephen Hawking. But the founders of Scalable Capital, while citing Hawking, had a less well-known figure in mind as a guest speaker on A.I.: Pedro Domingos, a professor at the University of Washington. Scalable Capital is one of the so-called robo-advisors betting that computers can do a better job of investing than human financial advisors and stock pickers. Musk has cited the book ""Superintelligence"" by Oxford University philosopher Nick Bostrom as the most important work on the risks posed by A.I., but Scalable Capital's founders said Domingos ""wrote one of the best books about A.I."" His book, ""The Master Algorithm,"" has other fans. In fact, you don't need to choose between Bostrom and Domingos: Bill Gates recently recommended reading both. Melinda Gates said at last year's Code Conference, ""I can always tell what's on his mind by what's in his bag of books. And there have been a lot of A.I. books."" Sean Parker is known for many things, from his early days shaking up the music industry and mentoring a young Mark Zuckerberg to currently being among the world's billionaires. But less known is Parker's devotion to allergy and asthma research. That did not escape the notice of the founders of Nima, a start-up also born out of MIT that has created a personal food allergen detector. Nima's co-founder and CEO Shireen Yates said they would bring Sean Parker in to speak to Nima ""because he is an innovative thinker with a long history in technology who also knows the food allergen space. He is taking great strides to improve research, care and increase awareness around autoimmune diseases and food allergens."" In addition to founding Napster and once serving as Facebook president, Parker founded the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford University. Parker pledged $24 million to the effort in 2014, one of the largest private gifts to allergy research ever made. Doctor-diagnosed food allergies affect 1 in 12 American children under the age of 21 and 1 in 50 adults, according to the Center. Approximately 25 percent of those with a food allergy will have a near-fatal anaphylactic reaction at some point in their lives. Parker knows: He suffers from a life-threatening nut allergy. He has also made large donations to cancer research. ",Beyond Bezos and Musk: The surprising people CEOs worship

Tae Kim,04062017,CNBC,03302017,"After the Republican health-care reform effort failed, some investors are worried about the prospects for the rest of President Donald Trump's economic agenda. In fact, the S&P 500 turned lower during Wednesday trading in part because House Speaker Paul Ryan said tax reform may take longer than the Obamacare replacement effort. But Jefferies told clients corporate tax reform has a large margin for error and there are companies that will still significantly benefit even if a smaller tax cut plan is implemented. ""Many point to the postelection rally as evidence that market expectations are high for tax reform, but certain data challenges that view. We detail 40 stocks that Jefferies analysts believe are likely to benefit from even a slimmed-down tax package. When all you're expecting is soggy bread with cheese, it's not that hard to be positively surprised,"" Jefferies' research team wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. The analysts said the current Republican and Trump plans to lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent or 20 percent from 35 percent will be difficult to pass due to controversy over the border adjusted tax. ""Still, the political importance of getting something done after the health-care failure is perhaps even higher; now is a unique time given Republican majorities, so there's still a good argument for some sort of reform,"" the report said. As a result, Jefferies analysts looked for the companies that will benefit most from a more modest corporate tax rate reduction to 25 percent, the removal of some deductions and no border adjusted tax. ""Even a 25 percent rate would be a significant positive for many companies ... the market doesn't seem to be pricing in a high likelihood of successful reform,"" the note said.

Jeremy Bowman,04062017,Fool,03302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There's no question who the king of retail is these days -- at least according to Wall Street. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the e-commerce player that grew up with the internet, now carries a market cap of $425 billion, nearly double that of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT), the most valuable brick-and-mortar retailer. Amazon managed to achieve that status, which makes it one of the most valuable companies in the world, with much less revenue than Wal-Mart, and barely any profit until two years ago. Instead, Amazon's premium is based on its extraordinary growth and the network of competitive advantages that have evolved out of its Prime membership service, its network of fulfillment centers, and Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, however, has finally begun fighting back under CEO Doug McMillon. The company has scaled back on new store openings to invest in current ones and raised wages to improve service. It's also accelerated its grocery pickup service with plans to have nearly 1,000 kiosks in store parking lots by the end of the year. More importantly, the company signaled its focus on e-commerce by spending $3.3 billion on Jet.com last summer, which brought in Jet Founder Marc Lore. Since then, the company's e-commerce sales have accelerated as it's made smaller e-commerce acquisitions like Moosejaw and ModCloth, and has begun offering free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more. Though Wal-Mart is still widely considered the underdog in this retail battle, the company is not without advantages. Here are three of them. Thanks to Jeff Bezos's long-term mantra, Amazon has been able to earn a valuation above $400 billion with little to show on the bottom line as Wall Street has given it a special allowance. Wal-Mart's profits not only underpin the stock's value, but also give the company the ability to outbid Amazon for potential acquisitions and more money to invest in growth. Last year, Wal-Mart had $13.6 billion net income compared to Amazon's $2.4 billion. On a free cash flow basis, Wal-Mart had nearly $21 billion against $9.7 billion for Amazon. Though Wal-Mart pays out about $6 billion annually in dividends, the company still has about $15 billion in cash flow left over. Those profits also give the company an advantage in a potential price war with Amazon, which seems increasingly likely as the e-commerce giant pushes aggressively into groceries. Wal-Mart could better survive such a competition as it has a larger profit cushion. Wal-Mart's own investors also seem more willing to give it some leeway to invest in itself, as the company has previously said that profits would ebb as it hikes wages and cleans up stores. After a dip following the announcement, the stock has rebounded. Amazon built its empire on e-commerce, but the company is increasingly looking to brick-and-mortar real estate to drive growth. It's opened up pop-up shops in malls to sell gadgets and a handful of AmazonBooks stores which sell books as well as gadgets, and it's experimenting with different brick-and-mortar grocery formats including Amazon Go and AmazonFresh Pickup. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, has already blanketed the country with stores, claiming that there's a Wal-Mart within 5 miles of 70% of the U.S. population. At one point, e-commerce was seen as more efficient than brick-and-mortar retail, but the high shipping costs involved in last-mile delivery mean that retailers often make higher margins on in-store sales than online. That store network has given Wal-Mart an advantage with services like grocery pickup, which it can implement by simply adding kiosks to store parking lots, unlike Amazon which has to build such facilities from scratch. Wal-Mart's stores can further assist the company's e-commerce distribution and support services like buy online/pick-up in store. Amazon, as part of its focus on growing grocery sales, has been pressuring suppliers like General Mills, Mondelez, and others to adapt packaging to e-commerce, which could mean eliminating colorful boxes and changing materials to make such items lighter and smaller to save on shipping. But Wal-Mart still controls nearly 10% of non-automotive retail spending in the country, meaning when it talks suppliers listen. Despite the growth of e-commerce, the vast majority of retail sales still take place in stores. Though Amazon's growth is certainly appealing, Wal-Mart is too big for the consumer packaged goods companies to ignore. ","
      
    3 Advantages Wal-Mart Has Over Amazon -- The Motley Fool

  "
Adam Levy,04062017,Fool,03302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is the king of retail. Well, it's the king of brick-and-mortar retail. When it comes to online sales, it's still well behind Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Wal-Mart, though, is spending heavily to catch up, acquiring Jet.com and several other e-commerce websites over the past year. But for all Wal-Mart's efforts, Amazon is still widening the gap. Amazon accounted for over half of U.S. e-commerce growth last year, according to some estimates. And e-commerce is by far the biggest driving factor of overall retail growth in the United States. E-commerce accounted for 9.5% of all retail in the fourth quarter, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Online sales increased around 15% for the year, while the overall industry was up just about 3%. Wal-Mart is the biggest brick-and-mortar retailer in the world. As Amazon and other e-commerce sites start eating into more traditional brick-and-mortar retail segments, Wal-Mart investors may have something to worry about. Image source: Wal-Mart Wal-Mart made big headlines when it announced the acquisition of Jet.com for $3.3 billion last year. Few people paid attention to the streak of acquisitions Wal-Mart and Jet have made since then. Jet.com acquired Hayneedle just before the deal with Wal-Mart closed. Under Wal-Mart it acquired ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, and ModCloth. What's more, Wal-Mart's head of e-commerce in the U.S., Marc Lore, said it's ""a fair assumption"" that Jet and Wal-Mart will pursue more of these types of acquisitions. Wal-Mart is also investing in building out its own technology. It's creating a start-up incubator called Store No. 8 to build new technologies to enhance the customer experience both in stores and online. The company didn't disclose how much it plans to pour into the project. Wal-Mart doesn't have an R&D expense on its income statement, but if it did, it'd surely be rocketing higher. Still, it has to compete with the $16 billion Amazon spent on technology and content last year. (Some of that spending goes to support Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud-computing division, as well as Prime Instant Video). Wal-Mart may have the resources to spend that much, but there's one big concern Wal-Mart investors should have. Amazon has a huge moat called Amazon Prime. Amazon likely has over 70 million Prime subscribers, and the first place they go when they want to buy something online is Amazon.com. Wal-Mart tried to compete with Amazon Prime by offering its own shipping service -- ShippingPass. Earlier this year it ended the $49 per year program and started offering free two-day shipping to everyone for over 2 million items on its website (on orders $35 or more). That won't show up in R&D either, but it'll likely hit Wal-Mart's operating margin. The bigger problem, though, is that Amazon is at the top of mind for consumers shopping online. More than half of online shoppers start their product search on Amazon.com. Wal-Mart can piece together a bunch of web properties with a few million in sales each, but it won't cut into Amazon's huge dedicated customer base. So Wal-Mart may be spending heavily to grow its e-commerce through acquisitions and a new start-up incubator, but there's no indication that any of its efforts will produce results for the company -- especially considering the premiums it's paying for all these relatively small web stores. Again, e-commerce is the main driving force behind retail growth in the U.S. If Wal-Mart's only means of growing its online sales is through expensive acquisitions, that should concern investors. That's especially true considering nobody has been capable of cutting into Amazon's lead. ","
      
    Why Wal-Mart Shareholders Have Something to Worry About -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,04062017,Fool,03302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) have recently begun to make major changes to their brands. The two retail giants are trying to transform their physical stores to better align with a customer base that's increasingly thinking digital first. It's a massive shift and both companies have different angles on tackling the problem. Deciding which stock is a better buy largely depends on whether you believe either has a chance to make the transformation. Both want to increase the use of their stores for pickups of online orders, returns, and, in many cases, as shipping points to facilitate faster delivery. Neither chain faces an easy road and both bump up against the giant shadow of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). This is a long-term battle that won't play out quickly, but one of them seems to have an edge. Image source: YCharts. Target stock has been going in the wrong direction for the past few months. That fall was caused by the company's disappointing holiday sales numbers, with same-store sales slumping by 1.5%. That overshadowed news in the chain's Q4 earnings report that comparable digital sales rose by 34% and store traffic was actually up slightly (0.2%). As with most retailers that turned in disappointing holiday sales, Target's stock price also tumbled. In my opinion, investors were more worried about the long-term prospects for physical retailers, though, than about Target's numbers. Going forward, however, the chain has what it called its ""ambitious store redesign to date"" in a press release, which quoted remarks CEO Brian Cornell made at the recent ShopTalk show in Las Vegas. ""With our next generation of store design, we're investing to take the Target shopping experience to the next level by offering more elevated product presentations and a number of time-saving features,"" said Cornell. ""The new design for this Houston store will provide the vision for the 500 reimagined stores planned for 2018 and 2019, with the goal of taking a customized approach to creating an enhanced shopping experience."" The new stores will feature two entrances. One will be optimized to serve online customers picking up orders or making returns as well as people looking to quickly buy items for immediate use. The second will focus on fashion and exclusive Target lines. It's a bold change designed to embrace the idea that customers still need stores for some things -- buying a snack online is not useful if you are hungry now, for example -- but want to see digital and physical experiences that complement one another. As part of its transformation, Target is also opening smaller-format stores in city markets where its full-size locations were impractical. Wall-Mart has been growing its shipping capacity. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is doing many of the same things as Target to make its stores support its digital sales. It has gone a step further, however, in growing its online operations by spending $3.3 billion to buy Jet.com and then putting its CEO, Marc Lore, in charge of its entire digital operation. That's a bold step, one that brings a different type of thinking to a traditional company. Lore has already shaken things up by eliminating Wal-Mart's $50 program that offered unlimited two-day shipping as an answer to Amazon Prime. Lore saw Amazon's lead and changed the program to offer free two-day shipping on any order of eligible items over $35. It's too early to know how that change will work, but Wal-Mart did post U.S. e-commerce growth of 29% in Q4. CEO Doug McMillion spoke abut those efforts in the company's earnings release. ""We're moving with speed to become more of a digital enterprise and better serve customers,"" he said. While Target may also be successful, Lore's presence gives Wal-Mart, already the No. 2 online retailer in the U.S., an edge. Taking on Amazon is not easy for any company, but Wal-Mart's low prices and differentiated customer base give it a better chance. In a difficult retail market, both retailers are making smart moves to adapt to changing consumer behavior. Target and Wal-Mart understand that stores will have to be integrated into the digital experience for returns, pickups, and shipping. Exactly how well that will work remains to be seen. Wal-Mart has been the bolder of the two companies and that's what's needed to take on a rival like Amazon. Target's place -- and you can see it embracing it with the plan to go into city markets with smaller stores and its efforts to offer hip, exclusive fashion lines -- is to serve a more niche role. That may result in a solid business, but Wal-Mart's going after a bigger potential audience and Lore appears to be the one to help the company reach it. ","

Target is adding more small-format city locations. Image source: Target. While the past year has been brutal for many retailers, with numerous chains either closing stores or shutting down entirely, there are some companies bucking that trend. These are retailers that have seized the opportunities created by a down market.

The chain has plodded along in its usual fashion year after year seemingly unfazed by industry headwinds and competitive jostling. In 2016, the wholesale retailer opened 29 new warehouses with 21 of them in the U.S. That followed 23 new stores globally in 2015, and this year, the company will continue with plans to add 31 new stores (17 of them in the U.S). Wal-Mart has plans to expand in the U.S. in 2017. Image source: Wal-Mart. Last year, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) closed 269 locations, but it still saw net additions to its network. Over 100 of those closures stemmed from the shuttering of its small-format Express locations, which management originally hoped would be a source of future growth. Going forward, Wal-Mart plans to open 59 new locations in the U.S. in 2017. That is in line with its normal expansion pace, and that growth will include new SuperCenters and more Sam's Club locations. To service those stores and a growing digital business, Wal-Mart will open new distribution centers as well. Artist renderings of the new Target store design. Image source: Target. While Wal-Mart has abandoned its Express concept, Target (NYSE:TGT) is embracing the idea that going small can allow it to access markets and areas it otherwise would not be able to. The chain expects to operate over 100 small-format stores within the next few years, including one in New York City's Herald Square. Furthermore, Target also plans to redesign 600 of its locations by 2018. Like the smaller stores, they will feature a modernized design highlighted by ""glazed, large glass windows at the front of store, stenciled concrete floors and unique lighting throughout,"" the company said in a press release. ""Additionally, the new design offers two entrances, each with a specific guest need in mind."" One entrance will be for customers looking to shop the store. It will feature market-appropriate seasonal displays. The second location will serve grab-and-go customers looking for a quick snack or other fast-serve items as well as those picking up digital orders. Nordstrom has been expanding its ""Rack"" off-price chain. Image source: Nordstrom. While many of its department store rivals have struggled mightily, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) has done surprisingly well. The chain exceeded its earnings forecast in 2016 despite full-year comparable-store growth falling 0.9%. The company has been slowly growing its store footprint, adding five locations in Canada in the fourth quarter alone, along with 21 of its lower-priced (albeit still higher-end) Nordstrom Rack stores. In 2017, the company has planned one new full-line store as well as 15 new Rack locations. Image source: Marshalls. Like many of the other persevering companies on this list, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), which owns Marshalls and T.J. Maxx, has succeeded by discounting. Both chains, as well as sister brand HomeGoods, offer a wide, changing selection of lower-priced merchandise. This model helps drive customer traffic as shoppers visit the stores more often, not knowing what deals they might find each trip. It has clearly worked well with the company delivering 21 straight years of comparable-store sales increases. In its past fiscal year, TJX Companies added nearly 200 stores globally. It plans to continue that growth in 2017 with the company having a long-term plan to add 1,800 more locations for a total of 5,600. And that only includes growth of existing chains in established markets. The company is launching a fourth concept in 2017, which the company will test in two locations. Hobby Lobby has grown by serving hobbyists needs. Image source: Hobby Lobby. Hobby Lobby opened 56 new stores in 2016 with more coming this year. The chain, which bills itself as ""the world's largest privately owned arts and crafts retailer,"" expects to open 60 new locations in 2017, all in the U.S. That would bring its total number of stores to over 750. Between 1,700 and 2,500 employees will be hired to staff the additional locations. Dick's has seen a number of rivals go out of business. Image source: Dick's Sporting Goods. Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) has been a rare success story in a market that has seen major competitors like Sports Authority go bankrupt, while remaining players struggle to stay afloat. Dick's has encountered its own challenges, but overall, it has managed to deliver growth in the face of increased online competition. In 2017, the company, which operates the Golf Galaxy chain as well, expects to open 43 new Dick's and nine Golf Galaxy stores. In some cases, the new stores will be converted Sports Authority or Golfsmith locations that Dick's acquired. ","
      
    These 8 Retailers Are Actually Opening Stores -- The Motley Fool

Jeremy Bowman,04062017,Fool,03302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced its latest initiative in grocery this week. The e-commerce giant is taking the wraps off of its new AmazonFresh pickup service, which allows customers to place an order online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes from a drive-in kiosk. The company is beta-testing two locations in Seattle, which are currently open only to Amazon employees but are expected to be ready for the general public soon. Unlike the Amazon Go cashier-less convenience store the company is currently testing, which relies on a network of cameras and sensors to automatically charge customers, the AmazonFresh pickup service is not a new idea. Rivals like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) have already opened hundreds of such pickup kiosks at their stores and are expanding them quickly. Wal-Mart plans to have close to a thousand of them by the end of the year. With its Prime membership program and e-commerce scale, Amazon usually operates from a position of strength, but that isn't the case here. The company is at a number of disadvantages as it opens another front in the grocery industry. First, Wal-Mart and Kroger have a clear head start with hundreds of kiosks already up and running. If Amazon wants to truly compete with them, it would need to open hundreds of its own locations across the country. Without its own consumer-facing real estate like Wal-Mart and Kroger have, Amazon needs to find and convert space to open more pickup centers, a time-consuming, expensive, and difficult task. Economically, it's much more efficient for Wal-Mart and Kroger to provide such a service since they only need to build a kiosk in a store parking lot at one of their thousands of stores. Curiously, Amazon's new pickup locations don't also offer customers the option of coming into the store, as most grocery shoppers still do. That means the company will lose out on impulse purchases from shoppers passing by the location, or from those who simply prefer to select their produce themselves. Building out what's essentially a grocery store without allowing customers to enter it seems like a mistake. Finally, the service is only available to Prime members, and the 15-minute ordering window is exclusive to AmazonFresh members, who pay an additional $15/month for that service. With approximately half of American households already signed up for Prime, Amazon likely isn't losing many potential customers since those who would consider Amazon for food shopping are probably already Prime members, but positioning Fresh pickup as an exclusive benefit worth paying for creates an odd juxtaposition. Wal-Mart, the grocery leader, offers its pickup service for free, to everyone. Kroger's ClickList, on the other hand, costs $4.95 per order. Who exactly is AmazonFresh Pickup for? In most metro areas, Amazon already offers its Fresh grocery delivery service, which, for an additional $15/month, provides same-day or next-day delivery to customers' doorsteps. And since the new pickup service excludes non-Prime members, the target market seems to be only people who pay for Prime, but aren't willing to spend the extra $15/month to get groceries delivered. After all, if customers are willing to place orders on their phones, the additional convenience of getting delivery rather than schlepping to the pick-up site seems worth the monthly fee. Image source: Amazon. With such a narrow target market, AmazonFresh Pickup just doesn't seem to make good business sense. Wal-Mart introduced such a program as a compromise between delivery, which it found to be too expensive, and the traditional form of in-store grocery shopping. The pickup service offers more convenience than entering a store, but less than delivery, and it carries no additional cost. That works for Wal-Mart because it already has the infrastructure and store network to make pickup easy and cost-effective. Amazon does not. The Fresh Pickup launch is clearly an experiment, and Amazon may not expand it nationwide. But 10 years after the company first launched Fresh, it's still grasping for a foothold in the $800 billion U.S. grocery market. The groundbreaking technology featured in the Amazon Go store has the potential to disrupt the industry, but the delay in its public opening is not encouraging. As for AmazonFresh Pickup, the service is at a disadvantage to competitors both from a customer perspective and a business one. For now, Amazon still seems stuck in a supermarket no-man's land.

    Amazon Fresh Pickup Is a Tough Sell -- The Motley Fool

Jeremy Bowman,04062017,Fool,03302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dubbed the ""Everything Store,"" Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is making that name truer and truer with each passing year. The company is dominating retail sectors ranging from books to electronics to sporting goods and even apparel.  And it's branching beyond retail into areas like video streaming and cloud computing to flex its muscles. But one component of the retail industry has eluded Amazon's grasp: groceries. With annual nationwide sales of groceries in the $800 billion range, it's easy to see why the company covets a piece of that market. Not only can fresh food bring a huge revenue stream into Amazon's fold, as it did with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), but the repetitive nature of grocery shopping also fits within Amazon's overall business model, which favors repeated small purchases over big-ticket one-time purchases like car parts or building materials. Recently, Amazon has intensified its efforts in the grocery space. Last year, the company expanded its AmazonFresh delivery program to a number of new cities and lowered the price from $299/year to $15/month, equal to a substantial drop. In December, it unveiled Amazon Go, a cashierless convenience store that uses cameras, sensors and other technology to charge customers based on what they take out of the store. The store was supposed to open to the public last week, but issues with the technology have delayed that opening. An AmazonFresh Pickup attendant puts groceries in a trunk. Source: Amazon Just last week, Amazon announced a new program called AmazonFresh Pickup at two locations in Seattle where customers will soon be able to order groceries on their phones and then retrieve them at a drive-thru kiosk. In an unrelated move, the company also shuttered its Quidsi subsidisary, the parent of Diapers.com, and said it would move its software development team to ""focus on building technology for AmazonFresh."" Clearly, grocery has become a key focus for Amazon's domestic business. The opportunity is huge, with nearly $1 trillion in annual sales, but the timing of its current push is curious -- Amazon moved slowly with Fresh after first introducing it in Seattle in 2007. The most logical explanation for Amazon's increased fixation on disrupting the supermarket business is that the company needs to continue growing its top line. Wall Street demands growth from nearly every publicly traded company, but Amazon, with its triple-digit P/E valuation and track record of 20% revenue growth or better in nearly every quarter in its history, needs to maintain that growth rate. Without it, the stock would likely plummet unless profits suddenly jumped. Amazon Prime, the $99/year membership program that offers free two-day shipping, video streaming, and a host of other benefits, has proven to be enormously popular, but with roughly half of American households signed up for the service, that growth engine may be fading as Amazon runs out of new customers to convert. The grocery sector is one of the few opportunities with the potential to replace it. With speedy delivery and tens of millions of items available on its website, Amazon has long aspired to be a one-shop for its customers. It's used Prime to further strengthen that bond, persuading customers to shop on Amazon before, or even without, considering any alternatives. But groceries has long been a weakness. Most Americans shop for fresh food multiple times a month, and losing out on that frequent purchase means shoppers depend on rivals like Wal-Mart and Costco, rather than just looking to Amazon for all their needs. Selling groceries also gives Amazon the potential to further bundle services to a membership model as it's tried to do with AmazonFresh, strengthening its competitive advantages. Of all of Amazon's ideas, Amazon Go with its breakthrough technology has the most potential to disrupt the industry, but the recent delays call its future into question. AmazonFresh Pickup seems to be little more than a clone of a service Wal-Mart and Kroger are already providing at hundreds of stores. And the delivery model, for a number of reasons, has just not taken off. Grocery will likely continue to be challenging for Amazon. In addition to the special requirements of handling and delivering perishable goods, consumers often have urgent needs for food, like picking up something for dinner on the way home, and can't always order in advance and wait for it. Consumers have also shown they like to handle and select the produce they buy, creating a need for an in-person visit to the supermarket. E-commerce is slowly influencing the industry as we see with the ""click-and-collect"" model, but without a significant innovation, Amazon is unlikely to see dramatic growth in the space. Its e-commerce strengths have historically been speed of delivery and selection, but those attributes simply aren't as valuable in the grocery industry. ","

As politicians and interest groups debate the future of climate change policies and renewable energy mandates across the country, a big power in the world of energy is making its strategy well-known. The business community has made a big commitment to transform their businesses to renewable energy, which is now driving wind and solar investment around the world. The latest to make a 100% renewable electricity commitment is Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD), the world's biggest beer maker, which said on Monday that it will make the transition by 2025. Make no mistake, AB-InBev isn't suddenly an environmentally focused company. They're making an economic decision to buy renewable energy. It's a trend the corporate world is taking very seriously. Image source: Getty Images. Below is the infographic AB-InBev used to announce its renewable energy commitment. It highlights the move from 7% renewable energy to 100% by 2025 and shines a light on Mexico as a focus. Image source: AB-InBev. The Mexico announcement is interesting because the country held two renewable energy auctions in 2016 that got very favorable terms. A year ago, bids were announced at 5.07 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity and by October bids averaged 3.35 cents per kWh for clean energy. This compares to average retail electricity prices of about 12 cents per kWh, so renewable energy is very economical for big companies. And these projects will be completed by the end of the decade, so the price AB-InBev will pay by 2025 will be lower than the contracts signed in 2016. In total, the announcement says some 6 terawatt-hours, or around 3 gigawatts (GW) of solar, will produce energy for AB-InBev. AB-InBev isn't the first company to take interest in renewable energy. In the U.S., Target (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are the two biggest corporate solar users, with 147.5 MW and 145.0 MW, respectively, according to SEIA's Solar Means Business 2016 report. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) says it has been 100% powered by renewable energy since 2014 and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google says it will reach that level in 2017. Companies aren't just looking at renewable energy as a PR move; they're looking at it as a way to save money. Target and Wal-Mart are primarily installing solar directly on their rooftops, reducing electricity bills from the utility. And data centers by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft, and Alphabet are now installing renewable energy nearby so they can use renewable energy directly. Apple has co-located nearly 100 MW of solar at data centers in North Carolina and Nevada with another 100 MW in development. Microsoft recently signed a deal to buy energy from 237 MW of wind farms in Wyoming and Kansas to power a Wyoming data center. Alphabet has invested $2.5 billion in renewable energy projects to power its business. This is becoming big business for wind and solar companies. For over a decade, renewable energy has been driven by mandates and subsidies around the world, and in many places, it still is today. But costs have come down so far that corporations are now looking at it as a way to save money on their operations long-term. And that'll only drive more wind and solar installations as more companies join the renewable energy bandwagon. ","

"Keith Noonan, Jason Hall, and Dan Caplinger",04062017,Fool,03302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When it comes to owning strong, well-run companies, Warren Buffett's preferred holding time is ""forever,"" but the man known as the Oracle of Omaha will sell a stock when he thinks that the money would be better utilized elsewhere. Read on to learn why our writers thinks Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) could be the next stocks to be unloaded by Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B). Image source: Getty Images. Dan Caplinger (Mondelez International): Among the positions that Warren Buffett has in his portfolio, some clearly carry more conviction than others. Mondelez International is on the low end of Buffett's holdings list, with his company reporting holdings of just 578,000 shares of the food giant, worth only a bit more than $25 million. That might sound like a lot, but when you consider the many positions that Buffett owns that are worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, the small stature that Mondelez enjoys within his pantheon is much clearer. Rumors had surfaced that more extensive Buffett holding Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) might want to merge with Mondelez to take advantage of greater scale in the food industry; that might ordinarily explain a small position in Buffett's portfolio. Yet if any such rumors seemed credible in the past, that credibility largely evaporated when Kraft Heinz instead decided to offer $143 billion to purchase industry rival Unilever (NYSE: UL) (NYSE: UN). Unilever rejected that proposal, and given that Buffett has denied the Kraft Heinz and Mondelez rumors in the past, there's little reason to think the issue will come back up now. Mondelez has also seen some struggles recently. In its most recent quarterly report, the food giant said revenue fell 7% from year-ago levels, leading the company to perform more poorly on the bottom line than investors had expected. CEO Irene Rosenfeld pointed to ""significant economic disruptions, political uncertainties, and slower global category growth"" for the poor performance, although she also emphasized that her views on the company's longer-term growth prospects were sound. In the end, Mondelez is little more than an afterthought in Buffett's portfolio. Buffett might well end up selling the position to help fund a more promising acquisition elsewhere. Keith Noonan (Wal-Mart): After reducing its position in Wal-Mart by roughly 90% last quarter, it's not a stretch to imagine that Berkshire Hathaway will liquidate the rest of its stake in the world's largest retailer. Buffett's company has held Wal-Mart shares since 2005, but began rapidly unloading the stock last year -- bringing its holdings in the retail chain down from $3 billion in mid-2016 to roughly $100 million by the end of the year. Increased competition from online retailers, and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in particular, was apparently at the heart of Berkshire's decision to shed Wal-Mart shares. Buffett has indicated that the retail sector now looks too challenging. That suggests he will have little reason to hold onto Wal-Mart, and his recent comments back the idea that his company will sell the rest of its position in the big-box retailer -- if it hasn't already. It's an entity that's gonna have everybody in their sights. And they have got delighted customers. And it's extraordinary what they've accomplished. And a lot of people like the delivery. That is a tough, tough, tough, competitive force. He went on to say that, while Wal-Mart has strengths that could aid the company's crucial push into online selling, he also thinks ""the online thing is very hard to figure out."" So, between the recent divestiture and Buffett's own comments on the tough competitive retail climate, there's a good chance that Berkshire will complete its exit from Wally World in the near future. Jason Hall (Wal-Mart): I agree with Keith and think Berkshire will soon sell off the last of its Wal-Mart stake. Furthermore, there's a good chance that Buffett has already sold off all of ""his"" Wal-Mart stock; the small position (less than $100 million in shares) the company still held at last reporting is likely in the portfolio managed by one of Berkshire's other two portfolio managers. Why has Wal-Mart lost favor at Berkshire Hathaway? In short, Wal-Mart's competitive advantages in scale and distribution may not be as valuable as they once were. The fact is, fewer people are choosing to go to physical stores, and this trend seems far more likely to accelerate than it is to slow. In the past, Wal-Mart has been able to fuel growth by expanding into new segments, such as groceries, as well as expanding its store base. But at this stage of the game, the dynamic has shifted: Wal-Mart is being forced to play defense simply to maintain current sales, as online competition ramps up, and the power of the company's massive distribution network is watered down by the high fixed expense of its underperforming retail stores. At the same time, there's an argument to be made that Wal-Mart is actually worth buying; it trades at 16 times last year's earnings, and pays a 2.9% dividend yield. But when it comes to long-term prospects for the retailing behemoth, I think its best days are behind it. ","

Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) dove into the Middle Eastern market for the first time ever this week. The e-commerce giant said it would acquire Souq.com, the largest online platform in the Arab world with 8.4 million unique products for sale and operations in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt. Souq.com CEO Ronaldo Mouchawar. Image source: Souq.com Souq is the latest in a long history of mostly successful acquisitions for Amazon. Among the other online retailers Amazon has taken over are the popular shoe seller Zappos and Diapers.com-parent Quidsi, where Amazon just announced it was laying off hundreds of employees. Another notable move was the company's purchase of Kiva Systems, which makes robots that move shelves and has helped boost efficiency in its warehouses. While Amazon's acquisition strategy has helped consolidate its lead in e-commerce and drive growth in other areas like cloud computing, video streaming, and audio books, the company's results in international markets have been less impressive. In 2016, Amazon post an operating loss of nearly $1.3 billion outside North America, and that loss nearly doubled from the year before. At $44 billion in revenue, Amazon's international segment is about half the size of its North American division. Over the last three years, international growth has also significantly lagged growth in its home market, even when the effects of a stronger dollar are stripped out. During those three years, Amazon has also suffered a total operating loss abroad of more than $2.6 billion. Amazon has been operating outside North America for nearly 20 years, but even for a company whose mantra is ""long-term,"" investors would be remiss if they didn't question whether the company's international segment will ever generate profits. While plenty of American companies have found success and billions in profits abroad, including tech giants like Apple and Alphabet, it's been tougher going for retailers. Target recently abandoned its Canadian operations; several retailers, including Home Depot, have pulled out of China, and even Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), with subsidiaries in major international markets like the UK, China, Brazil, and Mexico, has struggled at times to replicate its success at home as operating margins are thinner outside the US. About a quarter of Wal-Mart's revenue comes from abroad. For retailers, entering foreign markets means massive investments in real estate and supply chain infrastructure. Even an e-commerce company like Amazon still needs a network of fulfillment centers to serve its overseas customers. It has over 100 such warehouses in the US, which have allowed it to offer services like Prime Now and Amazon Fresh, but matching that density abroad won't be easy. The company's competitive advantage often lies in the fast delivery that its Prime membership program offers, which helps explain why it's profitable in North America but not internationally. Amazon has stepped up its focus on foreign markets. After losing out to Alibaba in China, the company has pledged $5 billion in investments in India, challenging local companies like Flipkart and Snapdeal, as well as Alibaba. It also recently made Prime Video global, offering rock-bottom prices in markets like India and undercutting Netflix in the process. However, in the vast majority of those countries where its video streaming service is now offered, the two-day delivery that Americans associate with Prime is not available. Buying the biggest e-commerce company in the Middle East seems like a smart move, and will certainly accelerate Amazon's growth in that corner of the world. But investors need to be mindful that Amazon is in a much earlier stage of development abroad than it is in the US. The company is still making investments to drive growth, and seems less concerned with profits. While Prime has reached a penetration rate of about 50% of US households, that rate is much lower overseas. It's unclear at this point if Amazon will ever be consistently profitable in the international segment. A weaker dollar would help, but the company also faces a number of challenges unique to the international market including infrastructure, different cultures and regulations, and local competition. With Souq joining its portfolio, expect Amazon's international revenue growth to continue, but profits will likely remain absent for the foreseeable future, as the company's scale overseas is still far from what it is at home.

This idea isn't really new. Back in 2013, IKEA launched an AR app which let customers project furniture into their living rooms via a smartphone camera. Last year, home improvement retailer Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) installed Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) HoloLens mixed reality headset at select stores to let shoppers design virtual rooms. Image source: Getty Images. However, Amazon's AR plans coincide with its recent moves into the brick-and-mortar space with test bookstores, grocery stores, and now rumored homewares stores. Let's see what that push means for Amazon, and how it could boost demand for Microsoft's HoloLens and holographic apps. Amazon's brick-and-mortar expansion might seem counterproductive, since its online marketplace is forcing many brick-and-mortar retailers to shutter stores and invest more heavily in e-commerce. However, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has proven that some customers still prefer placing orders online and picking them up immediately to avoid wait times and shipping fees. To cut overhead costs, Amazon's grocery store model uses a ""just walk out"" system called Amazon Go. The store tracks the items taken by the customer and charges their Amazon accounts once they walk out -- eliminating the need for checkout lines and cashiers. Its bookstores offer special discounts to Prime members, and offers self-checkout via the Amazon app. For the rumored homewares push, the idea will likely be the same -- to offer self-checkout for smaller items, delivery for larger items, and discounts for Prime members. Assuming that you have pictures of your living room, you can potentially project the home furnishings into your home like the IKEA app. Since these brick-and-mortar stores all give preferential treatment to Prime members, that expansion can boost the growth of the Prime ecosystem. Last June, research firm CIRP estimated that Amazon had 63 million Prime members in the U.S., a 19 million increase from a year earlier. It also estimated that the average Prime member spent $1,200 annually at Amazon, while non-members spent just $500. This isn't Amazon's first move into the AR market. However, its previous moves have been all over the map. In late 2015, it patented an AR projection system, similar to Microsoft's IllumiRoom, which ""transformed"" living rooms into completely different, interactive environments. For example, a user could theoretically tap the wall and turn it into a TV screen, or tap the desk to open an e-book. Last year, Amazon offered jobs for a virtual reality team. It didn't say much about the team's goals, except that it would focus on a platform for ""immersive storytelling"". Analysts and investors speculated that Amazon could apply VR to games on the Fire TV, or add VR viewing options to Amazon Video. However, the recent report about AR homewares indicates that the team might actually be developing new AR features for the Amazon app to enhance the shopping experience at its brick-and-mortar stores. Amazon's rumored AR app or homewares stores might never see the light of day, since the company hasn't publicly said anything about them yet. But Amazon's interest might get other retailers interested in using AR tools in brick-and-mortar stores. A HoloLens demo at Lowe's. Image source: Lowe's. That would be great news for Microsoft, since the HoloLens is the most mature ""mixed reality"" headset today. The upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update, which will add easy-to-use holographic tools for developers, could also make it much easier for retailers to build custom apps for the HoloLens without Microsoft's help. This wouldn't only apply to big box retailers like Lowe's -- Volvo is also using the HoloLens in dealerships to let customers virtually view cars which aren't in stock. It's hard to tell if Amazon and Microsoft's early AR moves into the retail space will ignite a major shift in how stores showcase their products. However, tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital estimates that the AR market will grow from nearly nothing today to $90 billion by 2020, with much of that growth generated by sales of AR hardware, e-commerce uses, and enterprise applications.

Mitch Tuchman,04062017,MarketWatch,03302017,"Published: Apr 1, 2017 11:30 a.m. ET Investing secrets don’t stay secret for long By By now you've begun to notice a pattern in the news about hedge funds: Nobody is making money anymore, so managers are returning millions to disappointed investors. The latest to close is Eton Park Capital. But the decision by that fund's managers is hot on the heels of epic losses by previously high-flying funds. A few of the notables include Pershing Square Capital (run by activist investor Bill Ackman) and startling declines reported by John Paulson, the manager who famously bet against the housing market before it collapsed. There has been a lot of interesting analysis as to why this is happening. As my MarketWatch colleague Howard Gold concludes in a recent column, mostly it's a problem of supply and demand. Essentially, the ability to consistently beat the stock market is a vanishingly rare talent. Investors who were early in the hedge fund game saw some distinct advantages, which only drew in more investors. The resulting flood of money, some $3 trillion in total, created demand for which there is no natural supply — managers who deliver repeatable, above-the-market returns after fees. In a real sense, it's not different from the dot-com boom, the housing boom, the gold boom and so on. People just pile into the lifeboat until it sinks. In addition, any kind of secret sauce developed by a given manager will be figured out and replicated, erasing the advantage. It's inevitable. For a number of years the big endowments at Yale and Harvard enjoyed a wide-open playing field. Their managers prospered, returned double-digit gains year after year. Yet in fiscal 2016 Yale delivered 3.4%, a modest return that nevertheless trounced the rest of the Ivy League managers. Yale's respected chief investment officer, David Swensen, offers this advice to retirement investors: Use low-cost index funds, diversify globally and rebalance. That's enough to get the job done. So why hedge funds? The fundamental lesson taught in business schools is ""don't be in the middle."" If you are going to try to sell a product to a high-end clientele, build that product and charge accordingly. Think perfumes, exotic cars and designer fashion. The rest belongs to discounters, businesses that market around price and try to create enough quality to keep up.

                                    WMT, -0.90% The hedge fund industry is the ultimate high-end offer, a very costly and very exclusive product. Taking into account risk, hedge funds ultimately don't work much differently than ordinary mutual funds but certainly they thrived, for a while at least, on the mere perception of difference. Read: Here’s a big roadblock to your dreams of early retirement Perception matters. One study found that the name of the fund affects investment inflows, irrespective of performance. Call yourself ""Master Alpha"" or ""Capital Dynamic"" and the money pours over the transom. Go with ""Splitrock Moderate"" and fewer want in. Now the hedge-fund lifeboat is flooded and investors are clamoring to get out. Who knows what they'll pour money into next? Most likely something else that seems exclusive, costly and secretive — and promises to somehow bend the laws of finance in their favor. In short, another lifeboat. Swensen has it right. Retirement investors are best served by diversification, indexing and rebalancing, along with steady contributions. Compounding, the way money grows through reinvestment, is the real secret sauce. Furthermore, investors are often much better served by ignoring return data, which is actually fairly predictable over long periods, and instead focusing on risk. If you can keep your investment risk in line with your goals, that is, if you can keep from jumping into the next high-risk lifeboat, you can retire with more.

Sara Sjolin,04062017,MarketWatch,03302017,"Published: Apr 6, 2017 6:25 a.m. ET Hint: It’s all about inflation By Stop the guesswork — there’s no longer need to speculate about where European Central Bank interest rates are going, after President Mario Draghi revealed his checklist for future policy moves. In a speech at the Watchers Conference in Frankfurt on Thursday, the ECB chief downplayed expectations of any imminent type of tightening. He reminded people that he and his fellow policy makers look at four criteria before even considering an end to the central bank’s ultra-accommodative policy stance. First: Headline inflation is on a path to levels below, but close to 2% over a meaningful medium-term horizon. Second: Inflation will be durable and stabilize around those levels with sufficient confidence. Third: Inflation will be self-sustained, meaning it will maintain its trajectory even with diminishing support from monetary policy. Finally: It goes without saying that in each case, the relevant metric is eurozone inflation, not the inflation rates of any individual country. Draghi admitted the first goal had almost been met, but said the second still is off target. “For us to be confident in the second criterion — that inflation is not just converging towards our aim, but stabilizing around it — we would need to see signs of such pressures building. But there is so far scant evidence of this,” he said. Over the past month, there’s been lots of chatter about when the ECB would take its deposit rate out of negative territory. That came after Draghi’s somewhat hawkish comments at the bank’s March meeting, as well as after a rapid rise in eurozone inflation to 2% in February. Additionally, there have been calls from German officials for the ECB to tighten its monetary policy, after inflation in that country rose at the fastest pace in four years in February. Against that backdrop, investors started to price in a more than 50% probability of a rate hike by December, up from just 11% about two months ago, according to Bloomberg. Read: Euro bulls just got a wake-up call from the ECB However, since the ECB’s March meeting, eurozone inflation has slipped back to 1.5% and several ECB officials have sought to dampen speculation that rates are about to go up in 2017. “We have not yet seen sufficient evidence to materially alter our assessment of the inflation outlook,” Draghi said in the speech on Thursday. “Hence a reassessment of the current monetary policy stance is not warranted at this stage.” According to the ECB’s current forward guidance, interest rates are expected to “remain at present or lower levels” well past the end of its quantitative-easing program. The €60-billion-a-month bond-buying scheme is slated to run until the end of the year, but economists expect it to be extended into 2018.
