,08312017,Reuters,08242017,"(Reuters) - Demand for Confederate flags at Chris Ackerman’s Civil War memorabilia shop in Pennsylvania has surged since violence at a white nationalist rally in Virginia this month reignited the United States’ debate over race and the legacy of slavery. The trend has been similar for other sellers of the Confederate battle flag, retailers report. But now that most major U.S. flag makers no longer produce it, given the controversy over the banner, much of the new demand is filled by imports from China and other countries. “We need to get more flags,” Ackerman recalled saying following the first order after the Aug. 12 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. His Gettysburg Regimental Quartermaster store, near a historic Civil War battlefield, and website sells $400 handmade flags to re-enactors and $40 ones shipped from China. Ackerman said demand had jumped fourfold to as many as 40 sales a week, an increase he likened to the surge in gun sales that occur whenever new gun control measures are weighed or feared. Since then, a national debate has intensified over symbols of the pro-slavery Confederacy. Civil rights activists say they promote racism, while advocates contend they recognize Civil War valor and are a vital reminder of their Southern heritage. The flashpoint for the Aug. 12 violence in Charlottesville was the protest organized by white nationalists against plans to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. A 32-year-old local woman was killed when a man crashed a car into a crowd of anti-racism counter-protesters. Amid the renewed discussion of the Civil War’s legacy, many cities in the South have stepped up their removal of Confederate monuments and other contentious symbols of the failed effort by the Confederacy’s 11 states to secede from the Union. Some businesses also got involved: The Six Flags over Texas amusement park removed a Confederate flag from its entrance. A group of Mississippi history professors called for the Confederate emblem to be removed from their state’s flag. And local news media reported that a flea market in Pennsylvania asked vendors not to sell Confederate flags. But at Alabama Flag and Banner, one of the few remaining U.S. makers of Confederate battle flags, sales topped 150 in a single day last week, equivalent to about a quarter of average annual sales. “I have been quite surprised,” said Belinda Melson-Kennedy, who owns the Huntsville-area company. Flag orders also quadrupled at Dixie Outfitters in Odum, Georgia, whose website says tongue in cheek that it has been “preserving Southern heritage since 1861” - the year the Civil War began. Owner Dewey Barber said he sells as many as 15,000 Confederate flags a year, which he obtains from distributors who often source them from overseas. Few major U.S. flag manufacturers still produce the Confederate battle flag, said Reggie VandenBosch, secretary of the Flag Manufacturers Association of America. He did not know exactly how many are made or sold each year. The flags can still be found at independent shops selling higher-end versions, websites with cheap imported flags, flea markets and from smaller makers such as the Southern Pride Flag Co, whose website says it is located in “occupied Georgia.” The flag carried into battle by Confederate forces has long been a fixture in popular culture, including prominently on the roof of an orange Dodge Charger muscle car in the popular 1980s TV show “Dukes of Hazzard.” It has often been adopted as a sign of independence or defiance, often without historical context, said Karen Cox, professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. But it also serves as rallying symbol for the far right and was carried by marchers in Charlottesville who included Ku Klux Klan members and neo-Nazis. Alabama Flag and Banner’s Melson-Kennedy, whose distant relatives fought for the Confederacy, said she disliked seeing the flag used by white supremacists. But she said it remained an important reminder of Southern history and culture. While it remains unclear whether the push to remove Confederate monuments will result in more flags coming down, acceptance of their display in public spaces appears to be declining, said Brandy Faulkner, a Virginia Tech expert on race and politics. Dixie Outfitters’ Barber disagreed. “It’s not going away,” Barber said. “They can take down monuments, they can ban this and that, but it doesn’t take away from the fact that we’re celebrating our heritage.” ","

Rob Walton, who served as the chairman of Wal-Mart until 2015, mainta ins 106.3 million shares of WMT, worth more than $8.4 billion. The former executive is still a member of the Bentonville, Ark.-based company’s board of directors.

(AMZN) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), speculation abounds as to which companies they may acquire next. After all, Amazon’s multi-billion-dollar acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM) just got shareholder approval, and Wal-Mart this week inked a voice-command shopping deal with Alphabet Inc’s (GOOG) Google. (See also: Walmart, Google Team on Voice Shopping.) With that in mind, Foursquare, the location intelligence technology company, is out with its list of targets for both retailers. While potential M&A deals usually arise from Wall Street, Foursquare argues it is in a good position to make predictions given all the data it collects on its users. “We can make informed recommendations about which brands Amazon and Wal-Mart should target next using our proprietary data-driven insights,” wrote Foursquare Chief Executive Jeff Glueck in a blog post this week. “Our analysis is driven by the unique perspective we have based on our location intelligence and our understanding of how people move through more than 105M locations around the globe.” The way Foursquare sees it, Amazon tends to invest in brands that are smaller and more upscale than its rivals while Wal-Mart is in e-commerce catch-up mode and is looking to broaden it reach and digital footprint. What’s more, both retailers want to experiment with so-called showrooming​, in which they roll out limited retail locations but offer on-the-spot (or later) online purchases. (See also: Why Amazon Is Losing to JD.com and Wal-Mart.) So which company tops the list of would-be targets for the two to fight over? According to Foursquare, it's department store operator Nordstrom Inc. (JWN). In the case of Amazon, Glueck argued the customers at Whole Foods and Nordstrom share similarities—the department store’s consumers are nearly twice as likely to purchase goods at Whole Foods. By acquiring the retailer, Glueck said, it would deepen its relationship with its growing base of customers. “Though Nordstrom has a strong presence within the high-growth, e-commerce-resistant industry of department stores, Nordstrom Rack is not the category leader in the discount category; that honor goes to T.J. Maxx,” wrote Glueck. “We found that Nordstrom Rack has actually lost more than 2% of its visit share to competitive discount retailers in the last two years. Amazon’s ability to slash prices further could lift the competitor brand, and give Amazon a strong foothold into the brick-and-mortar discount market.” As for Wal-Mart, Glueck said it will be able to reach new customers by acquiring Nordstrom and getting Nordstrom Rack under its control. Foursquare’s foot traffic shows Nordstrom customers are around 55% less likely to shop at Wal-Mart stores than the average American. “What Nordstrom does have is a bona-fide track record as well as a healthy concentration of Millennials and females, a nice addition for Wal-Mart to balance out the the purchase of Bonobos [an online men’s clothing retailer], which has a wider male reach,” wrote Glueck. Other targets the two could fight over include Warby Parker, the online eyeglasses and sunglasses retailer, which would push the whole showrooming concept because of its 45 click-and-mortar boutiques and plans to open 25 more. It doesn’t hurt that 55% of its consumer base is made up of Millennials. Glueck noted Lowe’s Companies Inc. (LOW) is uniquely attractive to Amazon while Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA) is a potential target for Wal-Mart. “Of course, this is all speculation, supported by our data on foot traffic patterns (we know that foot traffic is just one indicator used to determine acquisition targets),” the CEO wrote. “But inevitably, both will acquire other interesting brands in the future.” ",Is Nordstrom the Next Bout in Amazon v.

Shoshanna Delventhal,08312017,Investopedia,08242017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Seattle-based e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is moving fast to disrupt the grocery retail space by cutting prices at the newly acquired Whole Foods Market Inc. chain. Investors are reacting by pushing shares of rival chains even lower. Having completed the $13.7 billion purchase of the natural food grocer, the global tech giant cut Whole Foods prices by as much as 43%, extending losses in the shares of rivals, including the Kroger Co. (KR), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST). Kroger shares have declined more than 28% since Amazon-Whole Foods deal was announced in mid-June. Traders at Cowen & Co. remain concerned about Wal-Mart in particular, indicating that the acquisition is a direct attack on its grocery segment, the $244 billion company’s largest revenue driver. “With these cost cuts, Whole Foods is going to be able to go after Wal-Mart's market share, because they're going to attack and go after the customer and take them from Wal-Mart,"" said David Seaburg, head of equity sales trading at Cowen & Co. ""They're going to be able to compete on price and provide a much higher-quality product, and Wal-Mart's going to suffer.” Seaburg also highlights competition from German discount supermarket chain Aldi, which has recently ramped up its U.S. presence alongside German rival Lidl. The trader suggests WMT stock is expensive at current levels, as he foresees very limited upside. While the retailer has been seen as a “relatively safe bet,"" Seaburg warns that competitive pressure will soon “come to a head.” (See also: German Supermarket Giant Lidl Makes its U.S. Debut.) The downbeat sentiment contrasts with analysts at MKM Partners, who suggest that Walmart’s grocery business is “pretty well-differentiated,” and that Whole Foods' lower prices will not be enough to lure away the “core Wal-Mart customer.” (See also: Walmart, Google Team on Voice Shopping.)

David Floyd,08312017,Investopedia,08242017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs It sounds like the Northwest Passage, the Fountain of Youth or El Dorado: the kind of tantalizing myth that spurs minor Spanish nobility to tramp through unfamiliar continents for years on end, but simply doesn't exist. Be that as it may, the Amazon-Proof Retailer might just be a real thing. Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY) has not just avoided the ugly ravages suffered by the likes of Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD) and Macy's Inc. (M). Its shares have actually returned more over the past two years (121%) than Amazon.com Inc.'s (AMZN) have (94%). Unlike other big box retailers, Best Buy has managed to keep its revenues and profits intact in the face of the online juggernaut. Same-store sales growth has been bumpy, but an unexpected surge in the first quarter of 2017 – 1.6% growth compared to a forecast 1.5% decline – sent the stock up by over 20% on May 25. What explains Best Buy's resilience? It has not been able to employ the same defense as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), which simply bought Amazon's competitor Jet.com. Best Buy is less than a twelfth the size of Walmart, measured by market capitalization. However, as CFRA's Efraim Levy wrote in a recent note, the firm uses its physical presence to its advantage: it ""encourages consumers to browse and test electronics, including TVs and stereos in-store."" Any real-world retailer could potentially appeal on similar grounds, but buying a stereo or a flat-screen TV is different from buying a set of drill bits or a dress shirt. You could go to Sears for the drill bits, but they're standardized anyway, so why not order them online? You could go to Macy's for the dress shirt, but you know the size and brand you want, so again, why not go online? In both cases the stakes are low because the costs are. That's not the case for expensive electronics: you want to scrutinize them in person. The risk, from Best Buy's perspective, is that you do that, decide on the exact product you want, then order it on Amazon. To combat that trend, Levy points out, Best Buy matches Amazon's prices. He writes that Geek Squad, the company's technical support service, also acts as a draw, although Amazon has begun offering in-home consultations with Alexa experts. This ""encroachment,"" as Levy puts it, is a reminder that perhaps no retailer is totally Amazon-proof. Grocery stores had appeared immune to disruption since the collapse of dotcom darling Webvan in 2001. Then Amazon bought Whole Foods, knocking 9% off Kroger Co.'s (KR) stock on June 16. If it can be sold, Amazon is likely to try to dominate the market for it. Best Buy may be holding its own for now, but there are no guarantees in Primeworld.

(AMZN) may be spending a ton of money to position itself for future growth, but that isn’t worrying MKM Partners, which urged investors to buy the stock in a research report this week. With shares surging after the company closed on its purchase of Whole Foods Market, MKM Partners thinks there’s room for Amazon’s stock to climb higher. The firm has a $1,275 price target and buy rating on the online retailer. Even with shares up 1.1% or $10.78 to $978.38 a share Thursday, MKM thinks it can gain an additional 30%. Robert Sanderson, an analyst at MKM Partners wrote in a research report covered by the media that the Seattle-based e-commerce giant “has the largest and most tangible set of long-term growth opportunities of any company in the world.” Sanderson argued that while the value of a business lies on the cash earnings it can produce, it shouldn’t be the main focus for management or investors. Sanderson pointed to Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a company that could have used its cash for growth in the early days of the smartphone and digital media markets but chose not to. “Rather than acquiring emerging businesses or making large bets to expand its value-chain, Apple generated a huge amount of earnings, paid $110 billion in taxes, redistributed $215 billion of cash to shareholders and still has $260 billion on its balance sheet,” Sanderson wrote. (See also: Amazon Set for 'Spectacular Collapse.') In the future, growth for Amazon will come from its retail investments and Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing unit, said Sanderson, predicting that its position in 12 international markets will generate 40% of its commerce sales, and that excludes China. He sees the company’s growth internationally continuing over time. That’s not to say it won’t continue to kill it in the U.S. as well. With e-commerce only accounting for 9% of retail sales in the U.S., Sanderson said there’s a lot of room for growth. “While initial categories like books and electronics have already seen significant impact (R.I.P. Borders and Circuit City), growth in online sales is now pressuring incumbent business models across most categories of retail,” the analyst said in the research report. MKM's call comes at the same time that Moody’s Investors Service is warning that the perception that Amazon is outdoing all of its brick-and-mortar rivals may be overstated. In a research report, the firm argued that while Whole Foods is seen as the e-commerce giant's way to overtake the retail food market, online sales paint a different picture. ""Many see Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods as further evidence that the online giant is dominating US retail, and the company is likely to remain the preeminent player in online shopping,"" said Moody's Vice President Charlie O'Shea in a report. ""But online sales still account for only about 10% of overall US retail sales, with a much lower percentage in the grocery segment, leaving the big brick and mortar retailers, led by Walmart, still really formidable competitors in the industry.""

Thomas Franck,08312017,CNBC,08242017,"Google's partnership with Wal-Mart won't affect Amazon's ascent because similar deals between the search engine and other large retailers have had ""little to no impact"" on the growth of Amazon's shopping services, according to Cowen research. The partnership between Wal-Mart and Google, announced Wednesday, will give shoppers the ability to order hundreds of thousands of products from Wal-Mart by voice through Google Express, its online shopping service. The deal is another strategic step by Wal-Mart to advance its e-commerce operations to compete with Amazon's powerful voice-enabled network Alexa. Google Express came about in 2013 and has deals with Costco and Target, which offer similar goods as Wal-Mart, Cowen analyst John Blackledge said, but those partnerships have ""had little to no impact on Amazon's retail business or the growth of Amazon Prime households."" ""While we are encouraged to see Google continue to enhance its eCommerce/Shopping offering, we believe the attention the announcement received was overblown,"" Blackledge wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. As of Wednesday, Google also began offering free delivery on Google Express orders so long as the order is above each retailer's minimum threshold. Amazon said Thursday that its acquisition of Whole Foods will close Monday, promising ""more to come,"" as the internet giant begins to integrate its Prime membership offerings into the Whole Foods network. Prime members will eventually receive ""special savings and in-store benefits."" Shares of Amazon pared earlier losses Thursday afternoon and sat down 0.33 percent at 3:09 p.m. ET. Shares of Wal-Mart fell after the announcement of the Amazon-Whole Foods deal closure, now down 1.92 percent. While attention has largely been focused on Wal-Mart's new opportunities from the deal, Cowen research also noted that Google could see a meaningful uptick in its Express service. ""Of the United States households purchasing groceries online each month (about 12 percent of U.S. households on average), only about 4 percent bought groceries via Google Express in July '17,"" added Blackledge. That stands in stark comparison to the 46 percent of online grocery shoppers who said they bought goods on Amazon Prime, according to the Cowen report. Still, the analyst said he isn't persuaded that the Google-Wal-Mart agreement means much for Amazon. ""Amazon's end to end voice-enabled shopping solution is a significant advantage versus the Wal-Mart/Google pairing in our view.

Matt Maley,08312017,CNBC,08242017,"The S&P 500 has suffered a 7 to 10 percent decline in each year since 1995. I believe this year is no different — and that, in fact, such a decline is around the corner. First of all, the market's strength appears to be flagging. Sure, the S&P is up 9.2 percent this year, but more than half of that advance came in the first two months of 2017. It is striking to note that right now the index stands almost exactly where it found itself at the beginning of June. This is odd, because the fundamentals have proceeded quite well. The improvement in earnings we saw in the first and second quarters, and the recent better-than-expected economic data, have all become evident after most of this year's rally had already taken place. In other words, this is yet another example of when the market moves differently than the way fundamentals tell us it ""should"" move. But this distinction isn't encouraging; quite the contrary. Beyond the stalling in the level of the S&P 500 itself, it is interesting to note that the number of stocks above their 200-day moving average has declined markedly. This tells us that the market is becoming more ""narrow"" in leadership. Even worse, we're also seeing a divergence in the breadth of the market on days in which the S&P sees a big move. Last Tuesday, when the S&P 500 enjoyed a 1 percent rise, 4.5 stocks in the index advanced for each that declined. Yet two Thursdays ago, when the market slid 1.5 percent, 20 stocks fell for each that rose. And let's not forget about the macroeconomic backdrop. The Federal Reserve plans to begin to shrink its balance sheet, which means there will be less liquidity in the system than there has been in many years. As we have shown many times in the past, this liquidity has been the key fuel for the rally over the past eight to nine years — so the fact that it's going to be less plentiful going forward makes us quite cautious. With monetary policy changing, we need to see fiscal policy pick up the slack. Although we do think we'll get some sort of tax package and other fiscal stimulus before next year's election, it's going to be a lot less than people were hoping for, and won't be enough to make up the difference. In other words, the improvement in fundamentals is already behind us. Looking forward, several catalysts would seem to suggest that a drop is more likely than a rise. And for close watchers of the charts, the market's ""internals"" are telling us that already. Long-time money manager Bob Doll is warning investors that stocks could breach October's correction lows.

Alex Rosenberg,08312017,CNBC,08242017,"After a disappointing few years for precious metals investors, gold is finally taking the lead. With a 12.2 percent year-to-date rally for gold futures and a 9.3 percent year-to-date rise for the S&P 500, 2017 is set to be the first year in which the yellow metal has beaten stocks since 2011. In that year, gold advanced 10.2 percent while the S&P 500 finished flat. This time around, traders are pinning gold's advance on falling interest rates and a falling U.S. dollar. Both are typically good for gold, a non-yielding asset that is priced in dollars. The dollar index is currently down nearly 9 percent on the year, while the 10-year Treasury yield has declined from nearly 2.45 percent to below 2.2 percent. The moves have come as the heady economic growth and inflation expectations so prevalent at the end of 2016 have been checked. For all the talk of gold serving as a play on rising inflation, then, a moderation in inflation has actually been gold's fast friend in 2017 — given that it has tamped down on Federal Reserve rate hikes, reducing interest rates and thus making non-yielding assets like gold look less inferior in comparison.

Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is the biggest retailer on the planet. A ruthless competitive strategy focused on offering the lowest possible prices has yielded a business that generates nearly $500 billion of annual revenue. Its long-term stock returns have been phenomenal, too, as its founding share owners are some of the richest people in the world. Let's take a look at the main sources of revenue and profits for one of capitalism's greatest success stories. Image source: Getty Images. Wal-Mart's business is split into three segments: U.S. retailing, international retailing, and the warehouse division that operates under the Sam's Club brand. The U.S. unit is by far the largest. It's comprised of 4,600 Wal-Mart stores that spread out 700 million square feet of selling space across the country. The segment generated $308 billion of revenue in the most recent fiscal year to account for 64% of the entire business. For context, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is the nation's second-largest retailer, with approximately $84 billion of annual sales. Next up is the international segment that's worth one-quarter of Wal-Mart's annual sales haul, or $116 billion. This segment has been shrinking as a percentage of total sales for several years, but that's only because of unfavorable foreign currency moves. When adjusted for that shift, the division would have ticked higher by 3% to $127 billion last year as opposed to the 6% decline that the company actually reported. Finally, Wal-Mart's membership club business accounts for $60 billion of annual sales, or about 12% of the revenue base. The segment is dwarfed by industry leader Costco, whose 512 U.S. locations generate over $80 billion of annual revenue. Wal-Mart is making less money today than in years past. In fact, operating income has decreased for two consecutive years and earnings last year were $13.6 billion, down from $16.2 billion in 2015. Return on investment, a key measure of operating efficiency, also slipped to 15.2% in fiscal 2017 from 15.5% the prior year. WMT Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts. Increased spending is the main driver behind that slump. Wal-Mart is directing more cash toward its employees through training, education, and increased wages in the core U.S. market. It has also been shelling out billions of dollars in building up its online infrastructure in response to the long-run shift toward digital shopping. The moves appear to be paying off for the business. E-commerce sales spiked 60% in the most recent quarter as the company's online inventory ballooned to almost 70 million items, many of which can be delivered to a customer's home in two business days or less. Wal-Mart's physical locations are also enjoying a healthy rebound. Increased customer traffic has helped comparable-store sales improve for 12 consecutive quarters. Wal-Mart's growth pace is still modest, and that's partly a consequence of its massive size. Costco is expanding at a 5% rate these days, after all, compared to the retailing king's 2% uptick. The online sales threat should continue pressuring profits in the coming years, and so shareholders can't count on anything like the booming earnings growth that characterized this business in the past. WMT Cash from Operations (Annual) data by YCharts. Yet Wal-Mart remains an attractive investment thanks to its dominant market position, stellar cash flow, and solid dividend yield. These metrics point to decent returns for shareholders of this industry leader despite the likelihood that its market share will shift toward online-focused rivals over time. ","
      
    How Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Makes Most of Its Money -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A number of analysts, journalists, pundits, and investors have spent a lot of time trying to guess which companies Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) may buy next. In fact, you could probably find an article or a report linking one brand or the other to nearly every struggling retailer and upstart pure-digital brand. This type of speculation has only gotten stronger since Amazon agreed to buy grocer Whole Foods for $13.7 billion and Wal-Mart agreed to spend $310 million to buy upscale men's clothing retailer Bonobos. Beyond pure speculation, the people at Foursquare, which calls itself a ""location intelligence"" company, believe they can use data-driven insights to predict which companies both retailers will target next. ""Our analysis is driven by the unique perspective we have based on our location intelligence and our understanding of how people move through more than 105 million locations around the globe,"" the company said in a post on Medium by CEO Jeff Glueck. Could Wal-Mart or Amazon be eyeing Nordstrom? Image source: Nordstrom. Foursquare went into its research using what can be gleaned about each company's potential purchases based on its past ones. It found, for example, that Amazon ""prefers brands that foster an even deeper relationship with its current shopping base,"" while Wal-Mart is looking for companies that help it play catch-up in e-commerce. Both companies, Glueck wrote, ""are interested in attacking verticals that have proved resistant to e-commerce penetration."" In addition, both appear to value companies that use a limited amount of retail locations to push immediate in-person or later online purchases. Based on those assumptions and its interpretation of data, Foursquare came up with a list of three companies the retailers could be interested in. The company does acknowledge that ""location intelligence is only one factor in evaluating such a transaction,"" but pointed out that its past history of prediction success shows ""it's a good one."" Foursquare found that both companies would be smart to consider buying fashion retailer Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN) and growing eyeglasses company Warby Parker. The analysis shows that Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack customers are 55% less likely to go to Wal-Mart than the average American. ""What Nordstrom does have is a bona-fide track record as well as a healthy concentration of Millennials and females, a nice addition for Walmart to balance out the purchase of Bonobos, which has a wider male reach,"" according to the report. Foursquare believes that while Wal-Mart could buy Nordstrom to reach new customers, Amazon might buy it to expand its offerings to core customers. ""Nordstrom shoppers are almost 2X more likely to shop at Whole Foods than the average consumer,"" wrote Glueck. ""So an Amazon-owned Nordstrom chain would deepen Amazon's relationships with its expanding core base."" When it comes to Warby Parker, many of the reasons are the same. A shocking 80% of Warby Parker customers also shop at Whole Foods, according to Foursquare data. ""Amazon's acquisition would improve Warby Parker's distribution and reduce their shipping costs -- fueling growth and padding pockets, too,"" Glueck wrote. Were Wal-Mart to buy the eyeglass brand, it would be doing so to bring in women and millennial customers to its stores. Foursquare's data show that 55% of Warby Parker shoppers are millennial. ""It's a similar hand to what Walmart played for Bonobos, but on a bigger scale,"" Foursquare reported. Warby Parker customers are also 80% less likely to visit a Wal-Mart compared to the average American. So a purchase would, much like the Bonobos deal, give the retailer a way to bring in fresh customers. Foursquare's research also showed that Amazon might buy Lowe's while Wal-Mart could make a play for Ulta Beauty. Just because a deal falls in line with what a company has done in the past does not mean it will make it. Foursquare's research is interesting because it uses data to identify logical purchases for both retailers. You can see why Amazon or Wal-Mart would want Nordstrom or Warby Parker, but factors like price and management would play into any deal as well. This type of research may be useful to both companies in helping them evaluate potential purchases. Knowing where else your customers do (and don't) shop allows both brands to look at whether a deal would bring in new users or deepen their relationship with existing ones. ","

Anders Bylund,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Critics of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) often point out that the e-tailer's earnings are slim and unpredictable. Hence, Amazon's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios tend to sit in the nosebleed section and make it a no-go for value investors. But earnings can be deceptive. Have you seen the size of Amazon's cash flows lately? Let me show you how Amazon's free cash flows and EBITDA profits compare to a few more traditional retailers: Company Free Cash Flows (TTM) EBITDA Earnings (TTM) Revenue (TTM) Net Income (TTM) Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) $20.3 billion $32.9 billion $490 billion $14.2 billion Amazon.com $8.8 billion $12.3 billion $150 billion $1.9 billion Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) $6.6 billion $7.3 billion $117 billion $4.3 billion Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) $2.2 billion $5.2 billion $123 billion $2.6 billion Kroger (NYSE:KR) $1.1 billion $5.5 billion $117 billion $1.6 billion Data source: Morningstar. TTM = trailing twelve months. Over the last four quarters, Amazon generated just $1.9 billion on net income from a $150 billion top-line till. That works out to a net profit margin of just 1.3% -- below every other name on the list above. From this perspective, Walgreens rules the roost with a 3.7% net margin. But the picture changes when we move over to the more cash-intensive profit metrics. About 5.9% of Amazon's revenue trickles all the way down to the free cash flow line of its financial statements. That's ahead of Walgreens' 5.6% free cash flow margin, Wal-Mart's 4.1%, Costco at 1.8%, and Kroger's barely profitable 0.9% reading. If Amazon can maintain these top-notch cash flow margins while also matching Wal-Mart's industry-leading revenue volume, the company would generate something like $29 billion in annual free cash flows. The difference is even clearer in EBITDA terms. Amazon's EBITDA margin is a lofty 8.2%, far ahead of Wal-Mart's second-place 6.7% and Walgreens' 6.2% in third place. Matching Wal-Mart's revenue to Amazon's EBITDA margin, you'd get a hypothetical annual EBITDA profit of $40.2 billion. Image source: Amazon. You could see my hypothetical margin-plus-revenue combos as a measure of Amazon's mighty cash machine, or as an opportunity for other retailers to widen their margins. Either way, it's clear that Amazon is doing something very right here -- it just doesn't show up in ordinary headline fodder like bottom-line earnings and the related P/E ratio. I would argue that Amazon is doing an excellent job of limiting its tax bills while producing stupendous amounts of cash profits. Furthermore, Amazon is doing this while also producing some terrific top-line growth. And that's not a new phenomenon; Amazon's revenue growth has been outpacing the industry for years: AMZN Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. So what do you get when you pair industry-leading cash margins with equally fantastic sales growth? In my eyes, that combination builds a shareholder-friendly cash machine for the ages.

Joe Tenebruso,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Since its IPO in 1998, eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) shares have soared by more than 4,000%. The company quickly became one of the largest winners during the Internet boom, survived the bust, and went on to create a fortune for its early investors. Yet even the best-performing businesses have risks, and it's important to study the threats that could derail your investments. That way, you can identify the key trends you should be watching so you won't be blindsided by them. On that note, here are two reasons eBay's stock may be vulnerable to a fall in the coming years. Image source: Getty Images. After more than two decades of solid growth, eBay is certainly one of the leading e-commerce companies on the planet. It connects more than 170 million buyers with millions of sellers around the world. These sellers in aggregate sold $21 billion in gross merchandise volume on eBay's platform in the second quarter alone, which in turn helped eBay rake in more than $2.3 billion in revenue. Yet this revenue figure represents year-over-year growth of only 4.4%, and eBay is battling rivals that are far larger and growing much faster. E-commerce juggernaut Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) saw its second-quarter revenue jump 25% to $38 billion. And retail behemoth Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) generated a whopping $123 billion in sales in Q2, boosted by a 60% surge in its e-commerce business. Moreover, Amazon's and Wal-Mart's cash flow production dwarfs that of eBay. WMT Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts. With their far greater financial resources, Amazon and Wal-Mart are able to invest more aggressively than eBay to fuel their growth. Amazon is spending billions to strengthen its global fulfillment network and expand its content and service offerings, which helps to drive its Prime membership growth. And once a consumer becomes a Prime member, they have a powerful incentive to conduct more of their purchases on Amazon. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart spent $3.3 billion to acquire fast-growing e-commerce start-up Jet.com and hundreds of millions more for a host of other online retailers. Wal-Mart quickly moved to install Jet.com founder Marc Lore as head of its e-commerce operations, with impressive results since he took the helm. EBay, however, has instead been shedding assets, including its longtime primary growth driver, PayPal. To eBay's credit, its asset-light business model does not require much in the way of capital investment. But in some ways, this is part of the problem. Without significant reinvestment opportunities, eBay's growth is likely to continue to be outpaced by that of its larger rivals. Perhaps most troubling is that eBay appears to be losing the battle for consumer mindshare. A September 2016 report by personalization platform company BloomReach showed that 55% of U.S. consumers begin their online product searches on Amazon, up from 44% in 2015. Only 16% of shoppers started their searches on another retailer's site -- down from 21% the prior-year period -- with search engines accounting for the rest. And, incredibly, approximately 9 in 10 consumers will check Amazon even if they find a product they want on another retailer's site. As these results demonstrate, Amazon is often the first -- and likely last -- place people go to shop online. Amazon's growing dominance is a dangerous trend for eBay. EBay knows this, and it's likely a major reason it's ramping up its advertising spending. But even with a major new brand awareness campaign underway, it's going to be difficult for eBay to chip away at Amazon's commanding lead in consumer mindshare. More likely is that Amazon continues to take share in this vital area, which could result in eBay suffering a loss of relevance in the years ahead. ","

The massive shift from brick and mortar retail to online shopping has picked up steam the last few years. Digital sales have been growing at a double-digit rate, and online sales as a percentage of total U.S. shopping is now at 9%. Online-only stores are no longer the only ones driving this number, though. Chart by author. Data source: U.S. Census Bureau Monthly Retail Sales Report. For years, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been leading the charge in retail disruption by offering convenient online shopping, competitive pricing, and fast delivery times direct to consumer's homes. Revenue has doubled several times over in the last decade as the company gobbles up market share, and in the meantime Amazon has become not only the largest digital retailer in the U.S., but also one of the largest retailers overall. Brick-and-mortar stores have been slow to move on the changing trends, but this year could end up being a turning point. It's estimated that over 5,000 stores have closed through the first half of the year, which puts 2017 on pace to be the worst year for store closures ever (over 6,000 stores closed in 2008). The pain has been widespread, from the well-documented woes of department store Sears (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ) to smaller specialty retailers like Rue 21 and Gymboree. When Amazon reported second quarter 2017 results, the company's overall revenue continued to grow double digits, but retail sales slowed down with momentum favoring the company's newer web services business. Meanwhile, traditional retailers like Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) have been showing signs of life, with digital store sales growth well in excess of, not just the above illustrated national average, but in excess of Amazon's retail growth too. Year-over-Year Online Retail Sales Growth Company 2015 2016 Q1 2017 Q2 2017 Amazon 13% 19% 22% 17% Wal-Mart 12% 16% 63% 60% Target 31% 29% 22% 32% Chart by author. Data source: Amazon, Wal-Mart, and Target quarterly earnings. It is worth noting that both company's total digital sales are in the mid-single-digits and are much smaller than the hefty lead Amazon has. Looking at the numbers, Amazon is still driving total U.S. e-commerce sales growth as the largest player in that space, but other retailers getting into the online action are making up an increasingly larger share of those gains. Not convinced these recent efforts will be enough? That may be fair, as the couple billion in digital sales at Wal-Mart and Target pale in comparison to the $48.5 billion in retail revenue at Amazon so far this year. Plus, while both Wal-Mart and Target have been reporting positive e-commerce progress, there have been multiple quarters in the last two years where in-store foot traffic was declining. That means online sales are merely replacing store traffic in many cases. With that being the case, traditional retailers race to go online isn't against Amazon as much as it is against each other. The physical store is under transformation, not going extinct. Even Amazon apparently thinks this with its pending purchase of Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM). The battle isn't just among big-box stores either. Companies like Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), a big supporter of small businesses and provider of digital-physical hybrid retailer software, are booming because of the migration to online. Shopify's revenue is up 75% so far this year to $279 million and was up 90% last year as demand for online support from small businesses continues to ramp up. As of the mid-point of 2017, the company supported the online efforts of half a million businesses worldwide. Image source: Getty. Headlines would suggest that the retail industry is in a world of hurt, and for those that are late to the digital party, that may be the case. However, for those quicker to follow Amazon's blazed trail, life has been a little easier. It's still early on in this battle, but with the majority of shopping still done in-store, consumer demand for a digital experience is pitting old brick-and-mortar stores against each other in new ways. As the retail industry innovates, investors should make sure the retail companies they own are leading the way. ","

Value investing isn't just about buying cheap stocks. A true value investor wants to pay less than something is worth, and the worth of a company depends on its future. A cheap-looking stock in a declining industry with no hope may not be a value stock at all. For senior citizens, sticking to companies that have durable competitive advantages, meaning that they're unlikely to be upended by competition, is crucial. We asked three of our Foolish investors to each discuss a high-quality value stock well suited for a senior citizen's portfolio. Here's why Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B), and Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) fit the bill. Image source: Getty Images. The company has fallen under a shadow in recent years, brought on by fears of cord-cutting. In its most recent quarter, media networks, consisting of TV stations and cable networks such as ESPN, accounted for 41% of Disney's revenue and 46% of its operating income, so it's easy to see why investors might be uneasy. In spite of these challenges, Disney grew revenue in fiscal 2016 by 6% to a record $55.6 billion year over year, while earnings jumped 12% to a record $9.4 billion. It also pays an increasing dividend that yields 1.5% and represents just 26% of earnings, giving the company plenty of opportunity for future increases. The most recent boost of 10% came earlier this year. Meanwhile, Disney is not sitting idly by, but positioning itself for the future. A string of recent studio hits demonstrates the depth of its bench, which also provides the merchandising maestro with opportunities to cross-pollinate these newest stars across its consumer-product ecosystem. The company also plans streaming services that will cut out the cable middleman and go directly to consumers, for both its vast library of movies and its ESPN content. These opportunities will soon eclipse any cord-cutting fears, and investors can reap the rewards. I'm going to Disneyland! Tim Green (Berkshire Hathaway): Warren Buffett's $440 billion conglomerate should be at the top of every value investor's list. Berkshire operates across a wide variety of industries, including railroads, insurance, energy, retail, consumer goods, and manufacturing. The company's stock portfolio is valued at $160 billion, and it's sitting on nearly $100 billion of cash, waiting for Buffett to use it for major acquisitions. Valuing Berkshire is difficult, given the investment portfolio and volatile insurance operations. The stock trades for less than 1.5 times book value and about 20 times trailing-12-month earnings. In a market where the S&P 500 sports a price-to-book ratio above 3 and a price-to-earnings ratio around 24, Berkshire seems like a solid value stock to me. With Berkshire's businesses so widely diversified, and with Buffett known for ensuring that all of his acquisitions and investments come with competitive advantages, Berkshire should survive long after Buffett, now 86 years old, no longer runs the company. Berkshire will have trouble growing its book value and earnings at the same rate it has during the past, given its enormous size. But investors looking for a company that can stand the test of time, and that's available at a lower valuation than the market, should seriously consider Berkshire Hathaway. Rich Duprey (Wal-Mart): Investors who are senior citizens often seek out two main ideals when choosing stocks: safety and income. They smartly want to preserve their capital, so betting on some untested, high-flying upstart is out, and they want a regular stream of income coming in through dividend payments. Few investments will provide both items better than Wal-Mart . Obviously, the retailer is a behemoth with over $490 billion in annual sales. It is able to provide great prices to consumers by buying in huge quantities and squeezing suppliers for the best price. Those savings are passed along to you. And even with the daily upheavals in how people shop, Wal-Mart remains a leader. It may hit a few potholes along the way, but like a battleship on the high seas, much of the daily churn doesn't affect it. And even when there are significant storms, Wal-Mart fares well. During the market crash a decade ago, the S&P 500 lost almost 38% of its value; Wal-Mart, on the other hand, actually gained 20% because during tough times people turned to the place where they could stretch their wallets. It also has consistently provided investors with a steady stream of income, paying a dividend for more than 40 consecutive years. With the payout currently yielding 2.5%, senior citizens will find it a respectable stream considering the relative safety that comes with it. Income, security, growth, and stability are a tough combination to find, but senior citizens can confidently add Wal-Mart to their portfolio and know they'll be getting all four. ","
      
    3 Value Stocks Senior Citizens Should Consider Buying Today -- The Motley Fool

Anders Bylund,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) just got the go-ahead to close its $13.7 billion buyout of Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM). Wasting no time at all, the merger is now scheduled for Monday, Aug. 28. Let me walk you through what that means to shoppers and investors. Image source: Getty Images. The companies originally expected to close their merger in the second half of 2017. Whole Foods shareholders approved the deal in a vote this Wednesday, hours after the Federal Trade Commission's decision to end its review of the deal's potential anticompetitive business effects. The end markets for Amazon and Whole Foods don't overlap much today, despite Amazon's best efforts to break into the groceries market, so the regulators found no reason to object. And the very next day, the two companies announced their final nuptials. Whole Foods investors will get their cash payouts deposited in their brokerage accounts on Monday, $42 per share. If you want to become an Amazon shareholder as part of this deal, there's nothing stopping you from buying Amazon stock with this cash. There just won't be any automatic stock-for-stock swaps in this all-cash deal. Amazon will start to distribute Whole Foods' store-brand products across its online food shopping portals, while some Whole Foods stores will add Amazon Lockers for local pick-up of some Amazon orders. Whole Foods will also replace its customer rewards program with Amazon Prime in the near future, including special discounts for Prime members who shop in Whole Foods stores. But above all, Amazon promised to lower prices on many food items at Whole Foods, starting on Monday. And that's ""just the beginning,"" according to press materials. Whole Foods under Amazon's management will continue to sell the same natural and organic foods as before, but at lower prices over time. Amazon's superior logistics and marketing tools will contribute to these savings. On top of increased process efficiencies, Whole Foods has room to slim down its profit margin and still make sense as a profitable business. Profit margins are famously slender in the retail sector as a whole, and even more so among grocery stores. But Whole Foods has more room for belt-tightening than most, because it is a market leader today: Grocery Retailer Operating Margin (TTM) Free Cash Flow Margin (TTM) Whole Foods 4.3% 5.9% Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) 4.7% 4.2% Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) 3.1% 1.7% Kroger (NYSE:KR) 2.4% 0.9% Data source: Morningstar. TTM = trailing 12 months. Whole Foods' focus on organic, free-range, natural, and otherwise premium foods gives the company lots of leeway to set high item prices. Even if the new Amazon-inspired discounts cut Whole Foods' cash profits in half, it would still be among the most efficient cash machines in the supermarket sector. The discounts will also start out with just a few hand-picked items rather than a blanket coupon for the entire Whole Foods experience. The press release mentioned best-sellers such as organic bananas, large brown eggs, and lean ground beef -- crowd-pleasing attention magnets that will bring discount-savvy shoppers into the store. Standard operating procedure at that point will put plenty of higher-margin goods near these discounted items. So yeah, Whole Foods shoppers are about to get a significant helping of in-store discounts on Monday. Later on, prices should drift lower overall and the Amazon Prime loyalty program also kicks in later. None of these moves will destroy the business value of Amazon's new asset. Together, Whole Foods and Amazon could scoop out a hefty portion of the highly fragmented trillion-dollar market for grocery sales. That's a serious business prospect, even if it takes many years to materialize. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

Adam Levy,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When it comes to online search, there's Google and then there's everyone else. When it comes to online retail, there's Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and then there's everyone else. But when you put the two dominant companies head to head, it may be a tough call on which one makes a better buy for investors. Both Amazon and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stocks have meaningfully outperformed the S&P 500 year to date. But investors can't dwell on the past; they have to look to the future to determine where to invest. Let's look at how these two companies' prospects stack up, to determine which is a better buy. Image source: Google. The vast majority of Alphabet's revenue and practically all of its profits come from Google. And nearly all of Google's revenue comes from advertising. Google's ad revenue continues to climb at a steady pace, up 18% year over year, benefiting from the megatrend of the shift from television advertising to digital advertising. But Google isn't the only force in advertising. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is still growing rapidly, with ad revenue up 47% year over year last quarter. Combined, Facebook and Google account for nearly all the revenue growth in digital advertising. Facebook is investing heavily in video, and its new Watch tab could eventually have a negative impact on YouTube. Meanwhile, Amazon is taking away product search queries from its search engine, which are some of the most valuable searches for advertising. That said, Google is still very much a dominant force in advertising. It has seven products with over 1 billion users -- Search, Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Play, Chrome, and Android. Not even Facebook can make the same claim (yet). That kind of broad engagement gives Google an unparalleled data set to produce strong returns on investment for its ad buyers. That's a huge competitive advantage that's almost impossible for smaller competitors to overcome. It explains why Google and Facebook are capturing all of the growth in digital advertising. Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon's moat in online retail is even bigger than Google's moat in digital advertising. Amazon's Prime program makes customers extremely loyal, attracts tons of third-party merchants to its marketplace, and helps fund Amazon's investments in fulfillment capacity and technology. As a result, Amazon is the first place the majority of consumers go to when searching for a product online. While Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has taken steps to compete online and is starting to attract third-party merchants to its online marketplace as well, it was never able to make customers loyal through a membership program. Amazon Prime now has around 80 million members in the United States and a growing number of international subscribers as it expands to more countries. It rolled out Prime Video globally at the end of last year, establishing the Prime brand in more countries and setting itself up for full Prime benefits in more markets in the future. The acquisition of Whole Foods provides another way to convince customers to join Prime. It could also help upsell customers to its grocery delivery service AmazonFresh. And it also provides another avenue to sell its hardware like Echo and Kindle. No other retailer can compete with Prime and the loyalty it instills in Amazon's customers. That gives it a huge competitive advantage. To be sure, both Alphabet and Amazon present excellent investment opportunities and capitalize on several megatrends. But Amazon's competitive advantages appear stronger than Google's, which faces serious competition for ad dollars from Facebook and could see increased competition for attention (and ad display opportunities) in the future. Amazon has lots of competition as well, but it's created a virtuous cycle with Prime. It's hard to judge Amazon's valuation using metrics such as earnings or EBITDA because of the constant investments management makes to grow the business in various avenues. Nonetheless, I believe the growth of Amazon Web Services (its cloud computing division), Prime, AmazonFresh, and other subscription revenue, scale of its international operations, and further scale in its fulfillment center capacity ought to push operating margin higher. While Amazon might not produce a profit margin near the same level as Alphabet, it could produce operating margin on par with Wal-Mart (about 6%). For reference, last year Amazon's operating margin was 3.1%. But it was 5% in North America. As operating margin expands and revenue continues to grow, that money will eventually find its way to the bottom line and produce huge earnings-per-share growth for Amazon and its investors.

    Better Buy: Amazon.com, Inc. vs Google -- The Motley Fool

Joe Tenebruso,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Out of all the traditional retail businesses in the U.S., Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is considered by many to be best in class. The warehouse-club chain has delivered impressive growth for more than three decades, earning long-term investors a fortune along the way. Yet even the best-performing businesses have risks, and it's important to study the threats that could derail your investments. That way, you can identify the key trends you should be watching so you won't be blindsided by them. On that note, here are the three reasons Costco's stock could fall in the years ahead. Image source: Getty Images. With the increasing convenience of online ordering, it's becoming harder to lure shoppers into stores. Costco fares better here than most retailers, with its reputation for low prices, free samples, and treasure hunt-like shopping experience. Still, it's kind of like owning the nicest home in a bad neighborhood. Eventually, the value of Costco's business will fall if more people abandon traditional in-store shopping trips and move their purchases online. So far, Costco's sales and profits have been insulated from this trend; membership and comparable store sales growth remain on solid ground. Yet this may be part of the problem. Because of Costco's tremendous in-store success, management has been reluctant to invest heavily to build out the retailer's e-commerce operations. As a result, Costco's website is widely considered to be substandard to other big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT), and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). Moreover, Costco's e-commerce sales make up only about 4% of its total revenue, and its online sales growth has trailed that of its major rivals by a wide margin. Data source: company financial filings. Chart by author. E-commerce juggernaut Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) poses an even more dangerous threat to Costco's store-based business model. Costco has long enjoyed scale advantages over many rival retailers, which it uses to acquire goods from suppliers at rock-bottom prices. It then passes on these savings to its customers, which drives membership growth and retention. Unfortunately for Costco, Amazon has grown into a titan that can match -- and even exceed -- its scale. Like Costco, Amazon is notorious for being willing to sacrifice profit margin in order to grow sales and market share. And Amazon Prime is very similar to Costco's membership program, though at $99 per year it's cheaper than Costco's top tier executive membership, which costs $120 annually. Amazon Prime also offers services -- such as online video and music streaming, unlimited photo storage, and free two-day shipping -- that many people find more valuable than what's currently included in a Costco membership. Perhaps most troubling is that about half of Costco's customers are also Amazon Prime members, according to shopper data analytics company Kantar Retail, up from 14% five years ago. If Amazon continues to aggressively expand its Prime member perks at a pace faster than Costco can match, it's possible that many consumers may decide to ditch their Costco memberships and remain only Prime members. That would be devastating to Costco's business. Amazon's recent $13.7 billion acquisition of leading natural and organic grocer Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM) represents another significant risk to Costco's business. Costco's shares got hit on the news, with investors fearing that the deal signified Amazon's intent to expand aggressively into a segment that accounts for more than a third of Costco's sales. And when Amazon enters a new industry, value destruction tends to follow for the incumbents. Amazon has already moved to slash prices at Whole Foods -- a trend that's probably just beginning as it works to eliminate its new subsidiary's ""Whole Paycheck"" reputation. Worse still, Whole Foods 365+ stores can now be used to strengthen Amazon's e-commerce distribution network and thereby further widen its lead over Costco in the online arena. Despite these challenges, Costco's stock remains richly priced. Shares are currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of more than 26 based on analysts' estimates for fiscal 2017. With Costco projected to grow earnings at an annualized rate of about 10.5% over the next half-decade, the stock's price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio, or PEG, of more than 2.5 is well above the 1.0 that's widely considered to represent bargain territory. Moreover, Costco's forward P/E is substantially higher than that of its peers. COST PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts If investors start to believe that Costco's competitive position is weakening, they may begin to value its stock at a level more in line with its competitors. As an example, if Costco's forward price-to-earnings ratio was to fall to 18 -- a level matching Wal-Mart's forward P/E but still well above Best Buy's and Target's ratios -- its stock price would plunge more than 30%. Such a situation could result in violent losses for shareholders, if the premium investors have so far been willing to pay for Costco's stock quickly disappears. ","

During a CNBC interview a little after 1 p.m. Eastern, Ryan said Republicans are “eye to eye” with President Donald Trump regarding policy. The statement comes after the president late Tuesday threatened to close down the federal government if he wasn’t able to secure the estimated $1.6 billion in funding from Congress to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico. With stocks experiencing their lightest trading volumes of the year, the market is very easy to influence, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist, at Prudential Financial, in an interview. “Ryan wasn’t just positive but he provided more details than we have had so far,” Krosby said. “In a pragmatic manner, he laid out what congress is able to do, and that was helpful. That’s something the market has been looking for.” Stocks had their lightest volume day of the year on Wednesday, with about 5 billion shares traded, well below the year-to-date average of 6.54 billion. At the close, 2.76 billion shares had traded on the New York Stock Exchange and 1.52 billion had changed hands on the Nasdaq, both well below the already light average daily volumes for August. The latest economic data also painted a mixed picture of economic conditions. Jobless claims rose by 2,000 in the latest week, a smaller increase than expected. Separately, a read on new-home sales came in at 571,000, below the 608,000 that had been expected, while mortgage rates fell to their lowest level of the year. The meeting of central bankers is likely to be the primary driver of trading, even though such key speakers as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen won’t appear until Friday. “You can’t underestimate the importance of Jackson Hole, and this year is especially interesting,” said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners. “Yellen’s commentary will be closely watched, because investors want to know both if the Fed will be raising rates, and also the timing and the magnitude of the Fed unwinding its portfolio.” For the week, the Dow is on pace to gain 0.5%, the S&P 500 is set to add 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite is on track to rise 0.9%, a move that would end a four-week string of declines for the technology-heavy index. Words from Wyoming: The program for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank’s symposium, titled “Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy,” is set for release at 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The meeting runs through Saturday. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.

                                   this year, in part because of they got Amazon-ed. This kind of havoc, courtesy of the online retailing giant, has inspired efforts to identify companies that might be safe from Amazon, including this column by my colleague Philip van Doorn, and this one from me. Those pieces provided good ideas. But now it’s time to bear down and find the ultimate Amazon-proof companies. Here’s my take. While Amazon will likely revolutionize delivery with drones, and you can buy just about anything on its site from ladybugs to Lamborghinis, one sector looks safe: railroads and the companies that supply them. Read: The bad news on Amazon’s stock price is only beginning Amazon will probably never get into selling the oil, coal, chemicals and agricultural commodities they schlep around the country.

Here are five companies in the space that aren’t only Amazon-proof. They’re attractive for other reasons too. American Railcar Industries 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                            
                                    ARII, -0.23% You can buy miniature railroad cars on Amazon.com, but the online retailer will not likely ever get into the business of selling the real thing. American Railcar’s tankers and hoppers can weigh as much as 35 tons, and they are complicated to make. So we will never see an “Amazon Basics” version of the railroad car. Rail cars often have customized features and they require expensive equipment to make, says value investor George Putnam, who likes this company’s stock because the business is in what he thinks will turn out to be a temporary downturn. American Railcar provides follow-up services like maintenance, which would be tough for Amazon to replicate. “Not only is the company safe from Amazon fever, it is currently in a down cycle, offering longer-term investors an opportunity to invest at an attractive entry point,” says Putnam. You get a 4.3% dividend yield while you wait for the business to improve. If you buy this name, you’ll be in a stock alongside another investor great, besides Putnam. That’s Carl Icahn, who holds a 62% stake. Trinity Industries 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                            
                                    TRN, +0.43% Here’s another company that Putnam likes that sells railroad cars, including hoppers, tankers and box cars. Last year Trinity supplied 42% of the rail cars sold in North America, or 27,240 of them. Amazon is never going to cut into this business. Also:  Amazon isn’t keeping U.S. inflation low — or putting Janet Yellen’s Fed in a pickle Trinity’s other divisions are also unlikely to get Amazon-ed. It sells river barges, guardrails, large storage tanks and construction materials like gravel and sand. Demand for railcars and barges is currently weak. But that will change at some point. Perhaps it will happen when shipments of oil and other raw materials increase as commodity prices rise due to a weakening dollar. And railroads ship a lot of coal. So to the extent that President Trump helps revive the coal sector, as he promised in his campaign, it will help the rail sector. CSX 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                            
                                    CSX, +0.92% Given all the advanced robotics that Amazon.com uses in its warehouses, the company will no doubt wow us with some pretty amazing drone-delivery systems at some point. But as good as they might be, they’ll never replace the delivery provided by the nation’s railroads. Even if Amazon founder Jeff Bezos wanted to enter this business, he’d face a tough challenge. Railroads have a natural barrier to entry. It would be nearly impossible for anyone to cobble together the land and rights of way required to build another railroad. So CSX, which has about 21,000 miles of track in 23 states in the eastern U.S., looks Amazon-proof, even if it’s ultimately in the same business as Bezos: delivering stuff. CSX stock looks attractive now. One of the most consistently successful insider-buy plays in my stock newsletter, Brush Up on Stocks, is when CEOs and other insiders are putting big money into their own turnarounds. That’s the case at CSX. CEO Hunter Harrison bought $15 million worth of stock back in April around current levels. He plans to streamline the company by reducing the number of yards and employees, and adjusting routes to speed up traffic. Harrison has turnaround experience at several railroads, including Canadian Pacific Railway

                                    FSTR, -0.38% Pittsburgh-based L.B. Foster is another attractive Amazon-proof play in railroads. It sells railroad track, spikes, bolts and angle bars. This business represents about 50% of sales. It also has a construction division that sells steel pilings, bridge parts and precast concrete (30% of sales). There’s also an energy-sector business that sells pipe coatings and inspection services to oil and natural gas producers (20%). I suggested this one in my stock letter back in March, under $14. It’s now up 35%, but it still has more to go because the company just went through a restructuring to bring down costs. Now, as energy and other commodity prices improve, profits will continue to amp up too. “With these significant restructuring actions behind us, the company is positioned to benefit from operating leverage as markets recover,” CEO Bob Bauer said in the company’s first-quarter conference call. The company also has significant exposure to Europe, where economies are picking up. L.B. Foster has about $30 million in deferred tax assets, which is a lot for a smallish company like this one. For context, it has never posted more than that amount in annual income in the past nine years. When the company turns profitable again, those tax write-offs will come in handy. I’m not sure when L.B. Foster will become profitable, but I’m pretty sure Amazon.com won’t be getting in the way. “Amazon certainly is impressive,” says Putnam, the value investor. “But, realistically, not every industry will be challenged by their profit-draining expansion. Nor will every product be sold at large discounts on Amazon.com.” If anything makes a company exempt, it’s selling the likes of railroad cars, track, steel pilings and precast concrete — or simply running a railroad. These companies look safe. At the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column. Brush has suggested CSX and FSTR in his stock newsletter, Brush Up on Stocks.

Devon Delfino,08312017,MarketWatch,08242017,"Published: Aug 28, 2017 11:22 a.m. ET There’s several ways to generate cash flow By This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. For many people, YouTube is a site where they can spend endless hours watching cat videos, product reviews or other people playing videogames. For others, it’s a way to make money. Becoming a professional YouTuber might sound like fun, but you’ll have to hustle to get started, and there’s no guarantee it will pay off. If you’re looking to make a quick buck, you might consider other options. However, if you’re already an avid video creator and are willing to put in the extra effort, you might be able to make money on YouTube. Here’s what you need to know. To earn directly through YouTube, you must partner with the site. Once you do, there are several ways to cash in, but to become a partner you must meet the requirements: Your videos must abide by the site’s advertising guidelines, and you need at least 10,000 channel views. The more videos you have, the easier it is to reach that 10,000-view threshold. Someone with 200 videos needs only 50 views per video to get there, whereas a person with 10 videos needs 1,000 views per video. High-quality, entertaining videos are more likely to get views, so it pays to put effort into planning and production. Once you’re approved as a partner, you can connect your channel to Google AdSense, the company’s advertising system. Advertisers use AdSense to bid for space on videos based on factors such as your audience, video topic and relevant keywords. In general, you’ll be paid based on the number of “impressions” your videos get; that’s when someone clicks on or watches an ad. Ads don’t display every time someone watches a video, though, so views don’t translate directly to money in the bank. Also, YouTube takes a cut of the ad revenue; it wouldn’t disclose that rate. You’ll get payments once your balance reaches $100, so if you have a small channel, you might get paid only every few months. You may want to set aside some of that cash for taxes because Google

                                   which issues AdSense payments, might not deduct your full tax obligation. AdSense isn’t the only way partners can make money on YouTube. You can also make videos available on YouTube Red, which is the site’s ad-free subscription service. And if you have more than 1,000 active subscribers, you can put videos behind a paywall and enable Super Chat, which lets viewers pay to have their messages highlighted during a live stream. To use that feature, partners have to be older than 18. AdSense, YouTube Red and Super Chat aren’t the only ways you can cash in on a YouTube channel, but making money through these other methods still depends largely on having a loyal, engaged audience. Here are a few options to consider. Use product placement and video sponsorship: Companies interested in your channel’s audience might sponsor your videos or offer you product placement deals in exchange for a shout out. You’ll likely receive payments on a per-sale basis or in commission tiers. Search on sites such as ShareASale, Clickbank and CJ Affiliate by Conversant for possible corporate partners — and be sure you’re willing to vouch for the company and products you’re selling before signing up. If you do have an endorsement or product placement in a video, you must notify YouTube by ticking the “paid promotion” box in the advanced settings tab of your video manager. Sell products or services to viewers: If you have merchandise or offer a service that’s relevant to your audience, let them know about it and provide links in your videos. For example, comedian Jenna Mourey, more commonly known by her YouTube name Jenna Marbles, sells T-shirts and posters featuring one of her dogs. Selling a physical product might require you to buy materials or find a manufacturer, but you can also sell downloadables such as e-books or art prints. Have a secure payment system in place before you advertise your goods. Meet up with fans in the real world: Meetups and similar events let YouTubers connect with viewers and sell merchandise. They’re usually best suited to those with active and engaged subscribers. Those with smaller audiences might want to skip ticketed events and bank on merchandise sales instead. Or if, for example, your videos teach viewers how to draw, you could set up a free class at a local park and sell your book of drawing techniques afterward. Turn to crowdfunding: There are two primary types of crowdfunding: recurring and project-based. Recurring crowdfunding lets contributors pay an amount they specify on a regular schedule. You’d want to maximize this type of funding to turn a channel into a substantial income stream. Incentives such as one-on-one video chats, private classes or merchandise can entice viewers to sign up. If you have an idea for a project that requires financial support, a project-based crowdfunding campaign is the way to go. Get started with sites such as Indiegogo, Kickstarter, GoFundMe or Patreon.

 ,08312017,MarketWatch,08242017,"Let the battle commence. Now that Amazon’s $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods has been green-lighted by federal regulators, the online giant has announced it will begin slashing prices starting on Monday. Shares of Kroger, Costco, and other grocery stores immediately fell after the news was released. As part of a joint vision to make Whole Foods’ “high-quality, natural and organic food affordable for everyone,” customers will immediately see “lower prices on a selection of best-selling grocery staples,” said Amazon in a press release Thursday afternoon, citing “organic bananas, responsibly farmed salmon, organic large brown eggs, and animal-welfare-rated 85 percent lean ground beef” as some of the lower-priced fare. Amazon also detailed some of its plans to integrate brick-and-mortar customers and online users: Certain Whole Foods stores will also have lockers where shoppers can pick up or return goods purchased on Amazon. “We can't wait to start showing customers what's possible when Whole Foods Market and Amazon innovate together,” said John Mackey, Whole Foods Market co-founder and CEO. Amazon — already by far the nation's biggest e-commerce company, with annual online sales more than 5½ times those of No. 2 Apple — stands to acquire Whole Foods' more than 460 brick-and-mortar stores, as well as priceless data about its shoppers. © 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL ",Amazon Just Announced It Is Slashing Prices at Whole Foods

MarketWatch,08312017,MarketWatch,08242017,"Published: Aug 28, 2017 2:09 p.m. ET New York Times publishes email from Sater to Cohen By A business associate of President Donald Trump promised in 2015 to arrange a real-estate deal with the help of Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he said would help Trump win the White House, according to a New York Times report Monday. Here’s what the associate, Felix Sater, reportedly wrote in one email to Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, in which he bragged about ties to Putin and predicted that building a Trump Tower in Moscow would be a boon to Trump’s candidacy: The Times story says there is no evidence Sater delivered on his promises. But emails from Sater show that, from the earliest months of Trump’s candidacy, some of his associates viewed close ties with Moscow as a political advantage. Those ties are under investigation by the Justice Department and several congressional committees, as the Times notes. In a statement, Cohen said Sater “has sometimes used colorful language and has been prone to ‘salesmanship.’ ” Cohen said he never agreed to make a trip to Russia. The Times report follows a Washington Post story published Sunday about Trump seeking a deal on a Trump Tower in Moscow while running for president. Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

,09072017,Reuters,08312017,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc has begun its holiday layaway program as it hopes to cash-in early on demand for gifts like toys, which saw slower sales growth industry-wide last December and has struggled to pick up so far this year. The world’s largest retailer started the layaway program on Sept. 1, a day before it did last year where customers can pay as little as $10 to hold items worth a minimum of $50. Layaway programs, which have made a comeback since the 2008 financial crisis as customers avoided using credit cards to make purchases, allow shoppers to put aside holiday merchandise like electronics and toys and make payments in installments until the full price has been paid. These plans tend to have a sizeable impact on sales and analyst estimates suggest the program accounts for as much as 15 percent of holiday revenues at Wal-Mart stores in poorer areas of the United States. Wal-Mart expects demand for toys to remain strong this year, despite worries about possible viewer fatigue after two strong years for the Star Wars franchise. “We think episode eight is going to be a strong movie, strong theatrical, the weekend was what we expected ... and what was going on in our stores and anticipate that will carry through,”  Anne Marie Kehoe, Wal-Mart’s vice president of toys, said on a conference call. The retailer released Star Wars products at its stores on Sept. 1. She said Wal-Mart has stocked a bigger assortment of Star Wars items at a variety of price points this year. According to data from The NPD Group, the U.S. toy industry grew 5.5 percent between January-November 2016 but in December sales grew 3 percent, bringing annual 2016 growth to about 5 percent at $20.4 billion. In 2015, sales grew 6.7 percent. Sales are also off to a slower start in 2017, the NPD group said in a note in July. Toy sales have been under pressure as they compete with videogames and YouTube videos. Toymakers like Lego A/S and Mattel Inc, who are seeing sales decline, have been attempting to modernize toys for the digital age. For the holiday season, Wal-Mart said it will have 300 toys exclusively available at its stores and on its website from 400 toys last year. It includes Frozen Sleigh and Monster Jam Grave Digger along with collectible items like Fingerlings, L.O.L. Surprise Fizz Factory and littleBits Star Wars Droid Inventor Kit, Kehoe said. ","

,09072017,Reuters,08312017,"(Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment climbed in August from July as consumers remained optimistic about their personal financial conditions, although confidence was not quite as strong as economists had estimated, a survey showed Friday. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index rose to 96.8 in August from a final reading of 93.4 the month before. The result fell short of expectations for a reading of 97.4, according to a Reuters poll, and also slipped from a preliminary reading of 97.6 two weeks earlier. “The Sentiment Index has been higher during the first eight months of 2017 than in any year since 2000, which was the peak year of the longest expansion in U.S. history,” said Richard Curtin, chief economist for the Surveys of Consumers. Curtin said respondents’ assessments of their personal financial circumstances are near record highs, fueled by low unemployment, inflation and interest rates, and gains in home prices and stock portfolios. Few consumers in the survey made reference to recent turbulent events, such as the violent protests last month in Charlottesville, Virginia, and continued political tensions with North Korea, Curtin said. Hurricane Harvey, which has ravaged the Houston area over the last week with record rainfall and flooding, occurred too late in the survey cycle to register a measurable effect on consumer attitudes.

,09072017,Reuters,08312017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Toys”R”Us Inc has hired law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP to help weigh restructuring options ranging from a bankruptcy filing to raising financing as bricks and mortar retail goes through a major downturn, according to a person familiar with the matter. The privately held toy retailer had previously said it was working with investment bank Lazard Ltd to help address its approximately $5 billion in debt, of which roughly $400 million comes due next year. The person could not be identified because the law firm’s hiring is not yet public. In a statement, the company said it would provide an update on how it planned to deal with its debt when it announced second quarter earnings on Sept 26. “As we previously discussed on our first quarter earnings call, Toys”R”Us is evaluating a range of alternatives to address our 2018 debt maturities, which may include the possibility of obtaining additional financing,” it said. CNBC first reported that Toys”R”Us had tapped Kirkland & Ellis for help addressing its maturities. A spokesman for Kirkland & Ellis declined to comment. More than a dozen retailers including children’s clothier The Gymboree Corporation and teen apparel seller Rue21 Inc have filed for bankruptcy this year as consumers shift their spending habits to e-commerce competitors. A large portion of Toys”R”Us’s debt is secured by real estate, which could help the company’s refinancing prospects, according to Fitch. The ratings agency said that real estate valuations have largely remained the same or improved since Toy”R”Us’s properties were appraised but cautioned that retail’s recent financial weakness could hurt those figures. Toys”R”Us is owned by buyout firms Bain Capital Private Equity L.P., KKR & Co L.P. and Vornado Realty Trust. ","

,09072017,Reuters,08312017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Candy manufacturer Mars Inc is aiming to cut greenhouse gas emissions and address other sustainability issues across its supply chain in a bid to help meet goals from the Paris climate agreement. Mars is one of a number of U.S. firms, including Walmart Stores Inc and Apple Inc, that have committed to curbing climate change even as sentiment on the issue shifts in Washington. U.S. corporations including Home Depot Inc and General Mills are now major users of renewable energy like solar and wind. The McLean, Virginia-based firm plans to spend $1 billion as it expands its sustainability goals beyond previously announced targets to cut its own greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020 from its level in 2007. “We expect to have a competitive advantage from a more resource efficient supply chain,” Mars Chief Executive Officer Grant F. Reid said in a statement. The company now said it will cut greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain by 67 percent by 2050. Some companies have reaffirmed their commitment to battle climate change in recent months, after President Donald Trump said in June the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. The move drew praise from fossil fuel groups but criticism from others. Mars has been sequencing genomes for crops like cocoa to make the plants more productive and has begun to have conversations with suppliers including mint oil manufacturers on potentially transitioning to renewable energy, said Andy Pharoah, Mars Vice President of Corporate Affairs. The company already uses renewable energy to power its operations in U.S. and U.K. markets. Mars is also targeting reducing poverty in the production of some of its core crops, namely cocoa, rice and mint, and addressing human rights violations in cocoa, palm oil, and fish. Exploitative labor and deforestation have been persistent issues for crops like cocoa and palm oil, two major ingredients for Mars’ candy bars. In addition to candies like M&M’s and Snickers, the company makes pet food and Uncle Ben’s rice. “Forced labor has no place in our supply chain, so we are very focused on making progress against that,” said Pharoah. “There’s a whole range of activities on that. That starts with being open and transparent and calling it out.” ","

Donna Fuscaldo,09072017,Investopedia,08312017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) may be spending a ton of money to position itself for future growth, but that isn’t worrying MKM Partners, which urged investors to buy the stock in a research report this week. With shares surging after the company closed on its purchase of Whole Foods Market, MKM Partners thinks there’s room for Amazon’s stock to climb higher. The firm has a $1,275 price target and buy rating on the online retailer. Even with shares up 1.1% or $10.78 to $978.38 a share Thursday, MKM thinks it can gain an additional 30%. Robert Sanderson, an analyst at MKM Partners wrote in a research report covered by the media that the Seattle-based e-commerce giant “has the largest and most tangible set of long-term growth opportunities of any company in the world.” Sanderson argued that while the value of a business lies on the cash earnings it can produce, it shouldn’t be the main focus for management or investors. Sanderson pointed to Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a company that could have used its cash for growth in the early days of the smartphone and digital media markets but chose not to. “Rather than acquiring emerging businesses or making large bets to expand its value-chain, Apple generated a huge amount of earnings, paid $110 billion in taxes, redistributed $215 billion of cash to shareholders and still has $260 billion on its balance sheet,” Sanderson wrote. (See also: Amazon Set for 'Spectacular Collapse.') In the future, growth for Amazon will come from its retail investments and Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing unit, said Sanderson, predicting that its position in 12 international markets will generate 40% of its commerce sales, and that excludes China. He sees the company’s growth internationally continuing over time. That’s not to say it won’t continue to kill it in the U.S. as well. With e-commerce only accounting for 9% of retail sales in the U.S., Sanderson said there’s a lot of room for growth. “While initial categories like books and electronics have already seen significant impact (R.I.P. Borders and Circuit City), growth in online sales is now pressuring incumbent business models across most categories of retail,” the analyst said in the research report. MKM's call comes at the same time that Moody’s Investors Service is warning that the perception that Amazon is outdoing all of its brick-and-mortar rivals may be overstated. In a research report, the firm argued that while Whole Foods is seen as the e-commerce giant's way to overtake the retail food market, online sales paint a different picture. ""Many see Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods as further evidence that the online giant is dominating US retail, and the company is likely to remain the preeminent player in online shopping,"" said Moody's Vice President Charlie O'Shea in a report. ""But online sales still account for only about 10% of overall US retail sales, with a much lower percentage in the grocery segment, leaving the big brick and mortar retailers, led by Walmart, still really formidable competitors in the industry.""

Lauren Thomas,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"Wal-Mart is gearing up for the holidays, beginning in the toy aisle. The big-box retailer on Wednesday released its list of what it believes will be the ""hottest"" toys on the market this year. It includes a much-anticipated release from Hatchimals, Fingerlings, a ""Star Wars"" Droid kit, a ""Frozen""-branded sleigh and a ""Paw Patrol"" lookout tower. Wal-Mart said it expects the top toy categories this year to be ones that include interactive elements or are collectible, those that make kids move, and items that bring characters from movies and TV shows to life. This year, about 25 percent of the toys on sale at Wal-Mart stores and on Walmart.com will be ""exclusive"" to the retailer, Anne Marie Kehoe, vice president of toys for Wal-Mart U.S., said on a call with members of the media. An exclusive item, like Wal-Mart's Radio Control DashCam, can't be purchased anywhere else. Promising exclusivity is a tactic used by retailers to help lure shoppers to stores with the promise of a unique offering. In total, Wal-Mart said it will offer more than 1,000 new toys, including more than 300 exclusives. Last year, retail rival Target unveiled 1,800 exclusive toys — up 15 percent from 2015, and the most it had ever had. Toys R Us and Kmart are also among the retailers best known for rolling out exclusive toy deals, and for their special layaway programs during the holiday shopping season. Starting on Sept. 1 — falling in line with the timing of last year — Wal-Mart launched its own layaway program, where shoppers can select items in stores, then pay for them over time and pick them up at a later date. Wal-Mart's layaway program will last until Dec. 11, and there's no fee required to participate. The only requirement is that individual items must be $10 or greater, and total purchases must be $50 or more, Kehoe explained. Retailers like Wal-Mart, Toys R Us, Kmart and TJX have found layaway is a useful way to get shoppers to lock in their holiday purchases early, and keep them coming back throughout the season, as they make payments on the items. Toys are a popular layaway item. Kehoe said the company expects just as many customers who used layaway to purchase toys last year, to do it again in 2017. Shoppers are also searching for toy deals earlier in the year this year, according to research from the National Retail Federation. This provides yet another reason for retailers to get a jump-start on marketing and promotions. Kehoe said the company is committed to staying in stock on popular toys throughout the holiday season.

Sarah Whitten,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"It's only just September, but toy retailers are already gearing up for their busiest time of year. This week brought the top toy lists from Wal-Mart, Target and Toys R Us — some of the biggest names in the business. With chatter building around the holidays, Amazon quietly posted in late August on its website a list of 100 toys for the season. Wal-Mart was the first to make an official announcement on Wednesday, also bringing news of the start of its layaway program. The big-box retailer has promised more than 1,000 new toys, which includes more than 300 exclusives. Wal-Mart said that about 25 percent of its toys will be exclusive to its stores. This year, smaller rival Target said it will sell more than 1,400 new and exclusive toys across its stores and online. Target rolled out 1,800 new and exclusive toys in 2016 — up 15 percent from 2015, and the most it had ever sold. Target's top items for 2017 include 11 toys that are exclusive to the retailer, the company said, such as a Shopkins mall, an exclusive Hatchimals egg and a Jetson-branded electric scooter. Instead of its typical ""Fab 15"" list, Toys R Us upped the ante with what it's calling ""Geoffrey's Top 20"" for toys. Like Wal-Mart, the retailer is offering a layaway service with no fee required, and Toys R Us is promising to match prices for all in-store purchases. If a customer is able to find a better deal elsewhere, Toys R Us said it will match prices from places like Wal-Mart, Target, Amazon and Best Buy. The ""hot"" lists, which arrived a touch earlier than usual this year, are a way for the retailers to get shoppers excited for the all-important holiday season. This year, retailers are under even more pressure as sales shift increasingly online. Toys are critical for luring in shoppers and winning business heading into the holidays. And for Toys R Us, a toy retailer, the holiday season is a make it or break time. This year all the more so, as it has recently hired Kirkland & Ellis to help it address roughly $400 million in debt due in 2018. Across the many hot toy lists, interactive toys, collectibles, puzzles, entertainment properties and tech-infused toys have been the most prominent. And that's no surprise. Strong sales from these categories helped the toy industry grow 5 percent, reaching $20.4 billion, last year, according to The NPD Group. Collectibles remain one of the strongest drivers of growth in the toy industry. In 2016, sales of collectibles grew 33 percent, or $432 million, to reach $1.8 billion, according to NPD data. Sales of blind packs — collectible items where buyers don't know what they are getting — alone grew 60 percent. These toys tend to be popular with parents because they are inexpensive, while kids enjoy the hunt as they try to ""collect them all."" Hot toys in this category include Spin Master's ""Colleggtibles,"" miniature versions of its fast-selling Hatchimal toys; Disney's Tsum Tsums, sold through retailers like Jakks Pacific; Funko's line of Pop! figures and Lego's traditional figures and buildable BrickHeadz characters. Interactive robots with personality have also flooded the market. Although a higher price point for consumers, with the majority selling for north of $100, these toys have been a hot commodity. Hasbro is selling Roarin' Tyler and Ivory, fluffy, plush tigers that respond to touch and have more than 100 motions and sounds, and a My Little Pony Magic Twilight Sparkle, an animatronic pink horse that has more than 90 unique phrases and also responds to touch. Spin Master's Zoomer line is also releasing a robotic horse toy, as is Hasbro's rival, Mattel, which is slated to debut a battery-operated Barbie's DreamHorse. While sales of entertainment properties have been sluggish in the first half of 2017, with Hasbro's lines of ""Despicable Me 3"" and ""Cars 3"" disappointing investors, the second half of the year could be saved by toys from ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" ""My Little Pony: The Movie"" and ""Justice League."" In the same vein as collectibles, these movie- and TV-inspired toys, gadgets and costumes conjure up imaginative, open-ended play and feature characters that are familiar to kids. After the release of ""The Force Awakens"" in 2015, ""Star Wars"" toy sales for Hasbro reached nearly $500 million. While sales from ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" were slightly lower than expected, the company has high hopes for toys from ""The Last Jedi."" These sales could be buoyed further after ""Force Friday,"" a massive Star Wars merchandising event, that has boosted buzz for the film due out in December. Another category that has been steadily growing is tech toys. Many of the hot toy lists include items that encourage kids to learn how to code or use technology. Hasbro has launched a Dance Code Belle doll that can be coded to perform different maneuvers and dances using an app. The company also has the FurReal Proto Max, an animatronic dog that users can code to move and make various facial expressions and sounds. Crayola's Fashion Superstar allows users to create their own masterpieces on paper and then transfer those designs into an app that places them on digital models. Users can then share their creations in-app like they would on Instagram. Similarly, Lego's Life app lets users construct digitally and take photos of their builds to share on a safe, digital platform. Of course, some shoppers are still pining after last years' biggest hits. ""The biggest thing we've noticed so far this year if the Hatchimals Surprise,"" Phillip Dengler, co-owner of the website BestBlackFriday.com, which monitors retailers' annual sales, told CNBC in an interview after surveying the toy lists. ""Last year they were sold out everywhere. It was a big disaster."" 2017 offers retailers a chance to sell to those shoppers what they ""missed"" last year, BestBlackFriday.com co-founder Eric Jones added. ""Kids that were excited about it last year are looking to get a different version this year."" Dengler and Jones both agree that toy shopping is shifting online, as evidenced by the latest news of Toys R Us exploring strategic alternatives. ""Amazon is a category killer no matter what category they go into,"" Jones said. ""They have the power to get exclusives, too.""

Alex Rosenberg,09072017,CNBC,08312017,"After eight solid months for the market, the odds are no longer in investors' favor, according to Doug Gordon, senior portfolio manager at Russell Investments. ""I think there's some asymmetry here,"" Gordon said Friday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""Certainly the upside isn't equal to the potential for downside, when we look at it in a multi-asset context."" This unfortunate asymmetry comes on the back of — and indeed, is somewhat the result of — a significant rally. ""Most investors are in a position now where it would be safe to give away some of the upside potential to protect against the downside,"" Gordon wrote in a recent note to clients. He pointed out that U.S. stock market valuations are high in a historical context and noted that bonds ""look awfully expensive as well."" Indeed, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield approaching 2017 lows even as the economy appears to be on solid footing, Gordon prefers American stocks to bonds. Yet ""inside equity, we'd like to be outside the U.S., with an appropriate stake inside the U.S. as well,"" he added. Specifically, he favors European stocks, which are generally lagging their U.S. counterparts. More generally, Gordon says that due to the relatively expensive state of markets, ""long-term returns are going to be somewhat challenged, compared to historic levels.""

Danny Vena,09072017,Fool,08312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There was a time, not too long ago, when Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) was the undisputed king of retail. However, e-commerce has changed the landscape, and over the last few years, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been taking an increasingly large slice of the retail pie. Wal-Mart has been playing catch-up in online sales, but now it seems the retail giant is ready to take the fight to Amazon, with a little help from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and artificial intelligence (AI). In a note to clients, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry revealed that Wal-Mart would be building huge data centers to house its cloud computing and make a sizable push into deep learning, a segment of artificial intelligence. Wal-Mart will build a ""GPU farm"" using graphics processing units (GPUs) from NVIDIA to power its cloud platform, which would be about 1/10th of the size of Amazon's massive cloud operations. NVIDIA Telsa V100 data center GPU will be coming to Wal-Mart's cloud. Amazon has made enormous investments in the AI discipline of deep learning, which uses a computer simulation of the human brain to recreate our capacity to learn. These sophisticated algorithms can recognize patterns and distinguish differences when fed reams of seemingly unrelated data. This has led to advances in image processing, voice recognition, and natural language processing. Amazon has used these developments to create Alexa, the virtual assistant behind its Echo family of smart speakers, as well as integrate these capabilities into its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing. It also allows the company to process its vast stores of consumer data to provide online shoppers with useful recommendations. Amazon's technology has put Wal-Mart at a decided disadvantage. Wal-Mart is a longtime user of AWS, but as tensions between the two have risen the company has been looking to break those ties and bring its data in-house, rather than enrich the coffers of its staunchest competitor. Wal-Mart's drive into deep learning would provide the retailer with a much needed technological boost as it moves to increase its digital presence and take the fight to Amazon's home turf. Wal-Mart has already made a number of high-profile acquisitions in the online space, adding Jet.com, Modcloth, and Bonobos to its stable. Chowdhry notes that in the next 6 months, ""Walmart is going full steam with [Deep Neural Networks] and will be creating its own NVIDIA GPU Clusters on Walmart Cloud."" NVIDIA's GPUs form the foundation of many of the advances in AI in recent years. Scientists found that the same processing power that allows GPUs to render images in video games is also ideal for the number-crunching required for deep learning. Hosting its own cloud replete with deep learning will allow Wal-Mart to benefit from its customer data without having to share that data with the very competitor it is trying to overcome. NVIDIA also stands to benefit from the move. Its stock has gained 165% in the last year, and much of that comes from the use of GPUs in deep learning applications. In its most recent quarter, data center revenue from AI soared 175% over the prior year quarter. Wal-Mart is taking the fight to Amazon.com. Image source: Wal-Mart. E-commerce has been claiming an increasing percentage of shopping dollars. During the second quarter 2017, online sales in the US grew to $111.5 billion, yet accounted for 8.9% of US retail sales. Wal-Mart doesn't want to cede these sales to Amazon, and recent moves show that the retailer is positioning itself to better compete in the digital realm. A move into deep learning will allow Wal-Mart to leverage the customer data from its various enterprises and put the company in a better position to compete with its formidable foe. While Wal-Mart may be playing catch-up online, Chowdhry advises that ""investors should not underestimate the Technology acumen of Walmart Software Developers."" With a history of disrupting the retail industry and creating innovations in inventory and logistics, that sounds like sage advice! ","

Daniel B. Kline,09072017,Fool,08312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Target (NYSE:TGT) has, in the short term, stabilized its business. The company has delivered a better-than-expected 2017 so far, reporting a comparable sales increase of 1.3% in Q2 and earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $1.22, a 14.2% year-over-year increase. Perhaps most importantly, the chain has advanced its turnaround plan, remodeling some stores, and working toward integrating its website with its brick-and-mortar stores. ""We continue to focus on our long-term strategy, as we work to transform every part of our business and build an even better Target that will thrive in this new era in retail,"" said CEO Brian Cornell in the Q2 earnings release. ""While our recent results are encouraging, we will continue to plan prudently as we invest in building our brands, our digital channel, the value we provide our guests, and elevating service levels in our stores."" The problem the chain faces --and it's a big one -- is that it competes with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Those two companies are engaged in a technology arms race, and it's going to be expensive for Target to keep up. Target has been working to improve its technology. Image source: Target. For years, Amazon has taken market share from traditional stores by working relentlessly to improve its delivery service and the shopping experience for its customers. This push has included making two-day delivery a standard while pushing to create even faster methods of getting products into consumers' hands. Amazon has set a standard of digital service, but it has not rested on those laurels. Wal-Mart was late in responding, but it recognized the threat to its survival when it spent $3.3 billion buying Jet.com, mostly to acquire Jet's leadership team, led by serial entrepreneur Marc Lore. That investment, however, was only the beginning, as it has moved quickly to further integrate its stores and digital operations. That includes testing automatic pickup towers in some stores, adding ""Easy Reorder"" on Walmart.com allowing customers to see in-store and online purchases they have bought most often, and upgrading the technology that supports their supply chain. ""We have tests going on with digital endless aisle shopping, robotics, and image analytics to scan aisles for outs and we're using machine learning to assist our merchants with pricing,"" said CEO Doug McMillon during the chain's August post-earnings release call. It's an arms race where price seems to matter little. Amazon is spending tens of millions -- maybe hundreds of millions -- pursuing drone delivery even though it may never be able to get it legalized for widespread use in the U.S. In fact, the online retailer has shown it will sacrifice margin and profit to build its business, and Wal-Mart has shown it will open its pockets to compete. Right now, Target's efforts on the technology side are to catch up to the current standard. The company understands that its stores give it an exploitable edge over pure-digital retailers, and it has been following Wal-Mart's lead in creating an omnichannel shopping experience. Target has also been following Amazon's lead in creating house brands to give consumers a distinct reason to come to its stores. That has been a strong part of the company's turnaround, and having exclusive product lines gives the chain some insurance against its rivals' ongoing technical advances. The challenge for Target is that it's not innovating in technology. So far it has survived, even slightly thrived, by following along, but its supply chain and delivery capabilities lag well behind Amazon's and somewhat behind Wal-Mart's. The chain has taken a step to correct that, buying Grand Junction, which it described as a ""transportation technology company"" in a press release. The acquisition will ""improve and expand Target's delivery capabilities ... [and] accelerate Target's investments and ongoing efforts to transform its supply chain,"" according to Target Chief Logistics Officer Arthur Valdez. Target may succeed by having good-enough technology with differentiated merchandise, and well-designed stores. It runs the risk, however, that Amazon and Wal-Mart will advance their technological edges in ways it can't quickly follow. That could be having Amazon's drones cut into people's trips to stores, or seeing Wal-Mart come up with its own near-instant-delivery method. It could also be an innovation that neither company has spoken about yet. Amazon and Wal-Mart are working to innovate, while Target is just keeping up. That creates risk for the company that it will either lose customers to an innovation it can't easily copy or that it will have to come up with significant, unexpected capital expenses to keep pace.

Anders Bylund,09072017,Fool,08312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Critics of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) often point out that the e-tailer's earnings are slim and unpredictable. Hence, Amazon's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios tend to sit in the nosebleed section and make it a no-go for value investors. But earnings can be deceptive. Have you seen the size of Amazon's cash flows lately? Let me show you how Amazon's free cash flows and EBITDA profits compare to a few more traditional retailers: Company Free Cash Flows (TTM) EBITDA Earnings (TTM) Revenue (TTM) Net Income (TTM) Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) $20.3 billion $32.9 billion $490 billion $14.2 billion Amazon.com $8.8 billion $12.3 billion $150 billion $1.9 billion Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) $6.6 billion $7.3 billion $117 billion $4.3 billion Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) $2.2 billion $5.2 billion $123 billion $2.6 billion Kroger (NYSE:KR) $1.1 billion $5.5 billion $117 billion $1.6 billion Data source: Morningstar. TTM = trailing twelve months. Over the last four quarters, Amazon generated just $1.9 billion on net income from a $150 billion top-line till. That works out to a net profit margin of just 1.3% -- below every other name on the list above. From this perspective, Walgreens rules the roost with a 3.7% net margin. But the picture changes when we move over to the more cash-intensive profit metrics. About 5.9% of Amazon's revenue trickles all the way down to the free cash flow line of its financial statements. That's ahead of Walgreens' 5.6% free cash flow margin, Wal-Mart's 4.1%, Costco at 1.8%, and Kroger's barely profitable 0.9% reading. If Amazon can maintain these top-notch cash flow margins while also matching Wal-Mart's industry-leading revenue volume, the company would generate something like $29 billion in annual free cash flows. The difference is even clearer in EBITDA terms. Amazon's EBITDA margin is a lofty 8.2%, far ahead of Wal-Mart's second-place 6.7% and Walgreens' 6.2% in third place. Matching Wal-Mart's revenue to Amazon's EBITDA margin, you'd get a hypothetical annual EBITDA profit of $40.2 billion. Image source: Amazon. You could see my hypothetical margin-plus-revenue combos as a measure of Amazon's mighty cash machine, or as an opportunity for other retailers to widen their margins. Either way, it's clear that Amazon is doing something very right here -- it just doesn't show up in ordinary headline fodder like bottom-line earnings and the related P/E ratio. I would argue that Amazon is doing an excellent job of limiting its tax bills while producing stupendous amounts of cash profits. Furthermore, Amazon is doing this while also producing some terrific top-line growth. And that's not a new phenomenon; Amazon's revenue growth has been outpacing the industry for years: AMZN Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. So what do you get when you pair industry-leading cash margins with equally fantastic sales growth? In my eyes, that combination builds a shareholder-friendly cash machine for the ages.

Matthew Cochrane,09072017,Fool,08312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The success of digital wallets varies greatly depending upon whom you ask. In early August, Goldman Sachs analysts proclaimed that digital wallet adoption had been ""underwhelming to date by nearly every objective standard."" The note stated that while Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay was the dominant leader in the space, accounting for 90% of all contactless payments originating from a smartphone in the U.S., it still was struggling to gain real traction. The report went on to say that only 27% of eligible American consumers had ever used Apple Pay, and only 8% used it every week. A recent survey from PYMNTS.com found similar results, concluding that consumers don't remember to use mobile wallets even when their phone has a mobile wallet on it that the store accepts. So, mobile wallets will never gain any traction, right? Not so fast! Other surveys insist these payment methods have a future of robust growth. A recent U.S. Bancorp study found consumer preference for paying via a digital app (47%) narrowly outweighed consumer preference for using cash (45%); a number that includes 49% of millennials who prefer paying via digital methods. A white paper from Juniper Research suggested that by 2022, 50% of all point-of-sale (POS) transactions will be facilitated via contactless payments, up from just 15% this year. So, what's the truth? Are digital wallets the wave of the future, or are they destined to fail? Let's take a closer look at why these payment methods are struggling to gain rapid adoption, and what the parent companies are doing to right the ship to see if we can come to a reasonable conclusion. PayPal believes it holds a winning hand in the mobile wallet race because it can be used across phone manufacturers, operating systems, and merchants. Image source: PayPal Holdings Inc. There does not seem to be a general consensus about what's holding mobile wallets back from increased user engagement. Instead, there seem to be myriad small reasons. These excuses range from consumers' old habits being hard to break to consumer ignorance on which retail locations accept which method of payment. Widespread merchant acceptance is the problem Apple seems primarily concerned with solving. Since the inception of Apple Pay, the company has focused on opening new markets and points of acceptance for the payment method. In the company's third-quarter conference call, CFO Luca Maestri reported that Apple Pay launched in Italy this past May and will be introduced in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the United Arab Emirates by the end of the year. In its second-quarter conference call, Apple said Apple Pay was available in 4.5 million retail locations within the United States and 20 million across the globe. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android Pay attempted to solve the same problem by partnering with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and its 210 million active accounts. The deal allows Android Pay users to link PayPal to their accounts, and it makes PayPal a method of payment available on Google Play. Early results show that Walmart Pay might be growing faster than other mobile wallets. Image source: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) Walmart Pay has tried to simplify and expedite its checkout experience for users of its app. Walmart Pay allows customers to store coupons, rewards, gift card balances, and receipts within the app and begin the checkout process by scanning QR codes into their phones as they shop. Early results of these efforts should be encouraging for shareholders: In the PYMNTS.com survey, despite being the youngest of the mobile wallets included, Walmart Pay showed the fastest usage growth from March to June this year, and it has now been used at least once by over 19% of eligible customers. But mobile wallets face entrenched competition. Many consumers still prefer credit cards for the rewards they offer. In fact, 40% of respondents in a recent survey claimed rewards and cash-back benefits as the primary reasons they were enticed to open a new credit account. No mobile wallet has yet introduced any such benefits to American consumers. Another problem is that none of these wallets can ever be a universal payment method used across phones, stores, and operating systems. It's one of the primary reasons PayPal's management believes it is poised to win this battle. Another, unexpected, reason these mobile wallets have failed to catch on is because several digital payments have migrated to merchants' apps. Starbucks' investments in this area are especially noteworthy, and Domino's Pizza has delivered the gold standard in digital and mobile innovation in recent years. The payments landscape has changed dramatically over the past few years, and fintech start-ups, traditional payments players, and the world's largest retail and tech companies have all played a part. Of course, while all of these companies want to see change take place overnight or, a payment revolution, what we're actually seeing is more of an evolution. It is still far too early to say any of the above payment methods are doomed to fail. Of course, none of them are guaranteed to succeed, either. We are still in the early innings of mobile wallets and payments and, as the boundaries between point-of-sale and digital commerce become increasingly blurred, the only thing we can be sure of is who the ultimate winner will be in the race to make shopping a more seamless, less time-consuming experience: the consumer.

To be clear, if Square's application is approved, it won't technically be a bank; it will instead be an industrial-loan company. Image source: Square. From the perspective of the consumer, these two types of institutions are functionally equivalent, as they're both empowered to make loans and accept deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The biggest difference from Square's perspective, however, is that an industrial loan company can be owned and controlled by a corporation that does things other than banking. A traditional charter doesn't permit this. A decade ago, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) applied for the same type of charter, which would have allowed a subsidiary of the company to offer banking services to its customers. The retailer ultimately withdrew its application after confronting criticism from others in the bank industry as well as reluctance on the part of regulators to allow Wal-Mart to own and operate a bank. A second difference is that, unlike banks, industrial-loan companies don't subject their parent company to supervision by federal banking regulators, such as the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Regulators' jurisdiction would extend instead only to oversight of the banking subsidiary. ""It's good news for small businesses that Square is seeking a bank charter -- it will allow the company to continue to innovate inside the regulatory system,"" says Colin Walsh, co-founder and CEO of Varo Money, a provider of digital banking services that has applied for a national bank charter. Walsh continued: However, the choice of an industrial loan charter (ILC) over a full national bank license is likely to add fuel to the fire in a debate recently reignited by [online lender] SoFi. ILC charters are regulated by states and the FDIC but do not have to comply with the additional regulations of the Bank Holding Act and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, creating some controversy among community banks and community groups. Moreover, while this isn't as big of a deal for Square, which doesn't rely on physical locations, only roughly half a dozen states permit industrial-loan companies. Utah has the most, and that's where Square has submitted an application, but California and Colorado are among the states that allow them as well. The ability of a fintech company like Square to gain access to federally insured deposits would be viewed by many as a watershed moment for the bank industry. It would be seen as an opening for a company such as Square to siphon deposits away from traditional banks. Fintech companies are particularly well positioned to do this given their lean operating structures, Walsh noted in a recent conversation. Because fintech companies don't operate expensive branch networks, they can afford to pay higher interest rates on deposits than a typical bank can. The ability to attract deposits would give Square a stable and growing source of capital that could be used to expand its lending operations, through which it's already extended $1.8 billion worth of credit to small business clients of its payments services. This would ratchet up the competition against traditional banks on the asset side of the balance sheet as well as the liability side. It's unusual for a company that doesn't focus on core banking services to evolve into a large banking institution, but it isn't unheard of. Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) offers a case in point. Over the past quarter-century, the McLean, Va.-based company has transformed from a credit card issuer to a full-fledged regional bank. What does Square's move portend for the future of banks? Assuming its application is approved, it seems fair to assume that others will follow in the payment company's footsteps. The net result for banks will be increased competition from corners of the financial-services market that they have largely been shielded from in the past. ","

Chris Neiger,09072017,Fool,08312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Recently, analyst Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research wrote in an investor note that Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) will ramp up its focus on deep neural networks for its OneOps cloud business and that the retailer will tap NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs) to make this happen. Deep neural networks are used in artificial intelligence processing to allow computers to understand the relationships between pieces of information without having to be specifically programmed to understand that the information is related. Deep neural networks, and the broader deep learning segment, are part of a growing artificial intelligence market. Chowdhry thinks the ramp-up of Wal-Mart's cloud will happen over the next six months and will be ""incrementally positive"" to NVIDIA's GPU business. These rumors come after reports surfaced in June that Walmart was asking some of its technology customers to move off of Amazon's Web Service (AWS) cloud business. Chowdhry thinks the Wal-Mart cloud, running on NVIDIA's GPUs, will be one-tenth the size of AWS. If it pans out, this would be a significant move for the retail giant and could bring more GPU sales for NVIDIA. Image source: Getty Images. While investors will have to wait and see if a Wal-Mart partnership pans out, there's still plenty of opportunity for NVIDIA in the deep-learning space already. The company is specifically zeroing in on two segments of deep learning that will benefit from the company's GPUs: deep-learning training and deep-learning inference. NVIDIA says deep-learning training is when a computer learns a new capability from existing data, and deep-learning inference is when it can apply the capability it just learned to new data -- and both come with loads of potential for the company. Data source: NVIDIA. The company is doing more than just projecting lots of opportunity in the deep learning markets, though. It already has a leadership position in the deep-learning training market, and Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari believes the company's GPUs are used in 90% of artificial intelligence (AI) training systems right now. Additionally, NVIDIA said in its second-quarter fiscal 2018 report that it forged new partnerships with Microsoft, Google, Tencent, IBM, Baidu, and Facebook to help them bring new deep learning and artificial intelligence services online. It also announced plans to train 100,000 developers to use deep learning this year. Aside from NVIDIA's deep-learning total addressable market, adding more of these customers is important, because the company's data center revenue segment (which includes GPU sales for deep-learning technologies) is becoming a larger part of the business. In the second quarter, NVIDIA grew its data center revenue by 175% year over year to $416 million. The data center business segment now accounts for 18.6% of total revenue, up from 10.5% a year ago. Even if Wal-Mart doesn't tap NVIDIA's GPUs for its own deep-learning push, NVIDIA is still forging ahead in this space. I've said before that NVIDIA's data center segment is a growing opportunity for the company -- and its investors -- and that NVIDIA is continually delivering on this potential. I wouldn't be surprised to see Wal-Mart sign on with NVIDIA soon, but even if it doesn't, investors should still be very optimistic about the company's deep-learning opportunities going forward.

Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock recently dipped into negative territory for the year to put it well behind the broader market's 10% increase. At first blush, the sell-off looks like shortsightedness on the part of investors. After all, sales growth is ticking up even as the retailer introduces its plans for higher membership prices. Long-term shareholders shouldn't be rattled by a little volatility. However, with Costco shares barely keeping pace with the market over the last five years, it's worth looking at the prospect for a continuing disappointing stretch for the business. Image source: Getty Images. Sales growth is speeding up lately, with comparable-store sales improving to a 5.9% pace in August from 5.3% in the prior month. That's an encouraging sign for the business, especially as many retailers are enduring flat or slightly negative comps lately. Rival Kroger (NYSE:KR), for example, just saw its comps drop into negative territory after 12 consecutive years of increases. Costco's longer-term results show that it isn't immune to the competitive pressures hitting Kroger and its other retailing peers. The warehouse giant's comps gains hit a six-year low of 4% in fiscal 2016. They're running at about the same sluggish rate over the past 12 months, too. Comps excluding fuel sales and currency exchange shifts. Data source: Costco. Chart by author. Part of the reason why investors assign such a premium to Costco's stock is that the company consistently outgrows its rivals. If that gap shrinks -- or disappears -- it makes sense that the shares would command a lower valuation going forward. Many of Costco's key rivals are warning investors to brace for declining profits. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has seen its operating income slump as it pours resources into increasing its wages and spending on employee training and education. Kroger lowered its full-year earnings outlook as management promised to meet market-share competition with more cost cuts. ""Kroger has invested more than 3.8 billion to lower prices for our customers"" in the last 15 years, CEO Rodney McMullen said. ""We have no intention of giving up the momentum we've gained on low prices,"" he added. COST Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. Costco already invests heavily in its employees, and its above-average pay ensures some of the lowest turnover in the industry. The retailer's price-leadership strategy also leaves it well protected against peers aiming to sacrifice profits to steal market share. Still, these moves are likely to add pressure on Costco to invest more in retaining employees and in attracting customers through low prices. That could translate into reduced earning power over time. Costco's short-term profit outlook is positive, given that its membership fee increase will start lifting bottom-line results in fiscal 2018. Most of the retailer's earnings come from these annual club membership costs. And, even as comps can swing from year to year, the fees tend to climb steadily as more members get added to the pool. Subscriber income reached $2.6 billion last year, up from about $1.6 billion in 2010. Costco's growth plans include aggressively expanding is store base, especially in international markets. Its loyalty card switchover, meanwhile, appears to be delivering big gains to members and to the business, which implies increased customer satisfaction. As a result, while I'll be watching comps and profit trends, I wouldn't start worrying about my Costco investment unless the company starts losing ground with its members. The good news is subscriber renewal rates are above 90% and holding steady right now. I'd expect that rate to tick higher as the company recovers from the negative impact of last year's credit card switchover. And, as Costco has demonstrated in the past, a big base of happily renewing customers forms the foundation for market-beating sales and profit growth. ","

Once you let the idea sink in, organic Cheetos isn't as crazy as it seems. As Bloomberg reported last week, PepsiCo's (NASDAQ:PEP) Frito-Lay division has expanded a concept product line, known as ""Simply,"" which offers natural and organic versions of popular snack brands. Eleven core products will be manufactured without artificial ingredients under the ""Simply"" label. The company has essentially re-engineered extremely well-known items that some consumers consider guilty pleasures, in a bid to tap the ever-growing market for healthy snack foods. PepsiCo executive Jonathan McIntyre, a senior vice president in the company's global snack research and development (R&D) area, told Bloomberg that the new line meets the stringent requirements necessary to be sold in Whole Foods Market. You can now sample unlikely certified organic products, including Simply Doritos Organic White Cheddar Tortilla Chips and Simply Lay's Wavy Organic Potato Chips.  Do you love the taste of Cheetos but abstain for health reasons? You no longer have to. Cheetos Puffs White Cheddar with no artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors. Image source: PepsiCo, via Amazon.com product page. The Simply line is evidence of useful product innovation at Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), PepsiCo's most prominent snacking division. Increasingly, FLNA's destiny is PepsiCo's destiny. Despite being the company's second biggest segment out of six, it claimed the fastest revenue growth last year, expanding by 5.2% to $15.5 billion. This figure comprised 25% of PepsiCo's total top line. In comparison, North America Beverages (NAB), PepsiCo's largest segment, expanded revenue by 3.3% to $21.3 billion. The beverage business still struggles with declining soda volumes, which is offsetting growth in categories such as bottled tea, fruit juices, and enhanced water, and making FLNA's contributions to company growth all the more important. Developing the Simply line should turn out to be a no-lose proposition for PepsiCo. Even if it can't persuade Whole Foods to carry the new products, an evolution in consumer tastes -- which Whole Foods has played no small role in -- eases PepsiCo's task in marketing Simply to other food retailers. You'll see the Simply brand extensions hitting major grocers including Target, Costco, and Wal-Mart, where their conventional counterparts are already sold. And it's logical for Pepsi to push hard for more than a novelty amount of shelf space at a few grocery chains. For example, Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) has offered its response to Whole Foods' standards in the form of ""Free From 101 Ingredients"" products for several years. Thus, the Simply line should fit well within Kroger's higher-standard foods inventory, especially while Kroger is actively seeking ways to get its revenue back on track. Other Simply retail candidates include privately held Trader Joe's, which sells products with fewer harmful ingredients than conventional grocery stores offer, by excluding artificial colors and flavors, preservatives such as sodium benzoate and EDTA, and ingredients in general that don't make its ""clean list.""  Likewise, Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. (NASDAQ:SFM), which claims that 90% of its products are natural or organic, should be high on PepsiCo's calling list. PepsiCo's announced reformulation of classic snacks comes on the heels of Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Whole Foods acquisition. A few days before news of PepsiCo's Simply expansion broke, I suggested that PepsiCo would do well to try to manufacture private-label brands for Whole Foods. I think this is a more direct and bold plan, which speaks to the company's foresight in product planning. The move may also help PepsiCo battle channel disruption. In the article I wrote detailing my thoughts on PepsiCo and Whole Foods, I discussed how online shopping and delivery are quickly changing the ways in which consumer packaged-goods (CPG) companies such as PepsiCo must compete for customers' mind share and dollars. It's doubtful that PepsiCo executives envisioned an Amazon purchase of Whole Foods when they began tweaking core brand ingredients. But the foresight that it would be beneficial to sell within Whole Foods will pay off should Amazon's grocery arm welcome the Simply line. You can already buy a few Simply products by searching on Amazon's site. But once Amazon merges its Prime memberships with Whole Foods' loyalty program and brings Whole Foods' offerings to millions of new customers through virtual shelves and Prime delivery, CPGs that are expanding relationships with Whole Foods stand to gain significantly. Thus, through an impetus to innovate, PepsiCo stands to be in that mix. It just has to persuade Whole Foods to stock Simply labels. And of course, these healthier versions of favorite comfort foods will have to pass an all-important test: They'll have to remind customers of the original versions, while still remaining delicious.

Max A. Cherney,09072017,MarketWatch,08312017,"Published: Sept 5, 2017 6:58 a.m. ET Exclusive investor documents show complicated business of Eaze, the dominant weed-delivery offering in California By Cannabis delivery startup Eaze Solutions Inc. has a lofty goal: By fiscal year 2020, it expects to ship the rough equivalent of a 33-foot-cube of marijuana — nearly three joints for every registered voter in the U. S. — to weed fans in America’s legal markets. The goal of moving the equivalent of $1 billion in cannabis and related products in a year has led the company to burn about $1 million a month as it aggressively expands into markets that have, in some cases, proved costly, according to information provided to potential investors and exclusively obtained by MarketWatch. The documents render a snapshot of a company wrestling with complex, often difficult regulations, that’s pushing the boundaries of what’s legal in a market where the laws are changing rapidly and causing uncertainty about the potential for investments. When contacted about this story, Eaze Chief Marketing Officer Stephen Matt wrote in an emailed statement, “While we don’t disclose revenue or discuss future plans, the marijuana industry is incredibly promising, and presents an opportunity that innovators, investors and policy makers alike are excited about.” Born in 2014, Eaze’s origin sounds similar to startup success stories such as Airbnb and Uber, and like those two it also claims to only produce tech that connects people, rather than selling pot itself. Founder and former chief executive Keith McCarty used his own money to launch the company from his San Francisco apartment with four employees and the idea of promising delivery of medical marijuana within minutes. McCarty, an ex-Yammer employee who received a healthy payout when Microsoft Corp.

Since its humble beginnings, Eaze has developed an expansive delivery footprint in California that has given it a dominant position and attracted outside investment. It has banked $24.5 million in venture funding from investors including rapper and entrepreneur Snoop Dogg’s Casa Verde Capital LLC, as well as a number of well-known Silicon Valley venture-capital firms. It now seeks an additional $25 million in funding, according to the investor deck. Heralded by the tech trade press as the Uber of pot, Eaze has expanded alongside the legal market, which has reached $6 billion in annual sales across the country, according to a report from Cowen and Co. Marijuana continues to be classified by the federal government as a Schedule I drug, along with heroin, LSD and ecstasy. As a result, federal law requires banks to report any marijuana-related transactions as suspicious activity, which could open them up to seizure by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. . Despite federal prohibitions, Eaze now operates in more than 100 cities as executives leverage generous promotions, fierce expansion and, per several sources, hardhearted negotiation tactics. It also launched a line of vaporizers, is planning to create private-label cannabis brands, and offers low-cost marijuana recommendations under EazeMD. Don’t miss: Marijuana experts question how industry will mature as full legalization lags Yet on-demand pot delivery has not blossomed to the same extent as the total marijuana market. The practice is banned outright in some states where recreational pot sales are legal, such as Colorado and Washington. Where it is legal, such as in Eaze’s home state of California, delivery is something of a work in progress, with regulations resembling a motley patchwork ranging from pot-friendly to effective prohibition. Eaze claims in its pitch deck to potential investors that it will expand to one of the markets on the more negative side of that scale this year: Los Angeles, a city that has banned delivery outright. Los Angeles officials did not sit idly by as other delivery companies attempted to make bank on clandestine sales, squashing or muscling out several upstarts, and the pitch to investors did not give insight into how Eaze will avoid the same treatment. But Eaze’s forays into other areas in Southern California show that regulatory roadblocks may not be the only issue that keeps Eaze from succeeding. The massive costs of 20-minute delivery The promise of marijuana delivered within 20 minutes, while attractive to customers, has pushed per-delivery costs in Orange County to top out at $27, MarketWatch has learned. Delivery costs matter to Eaze. It does not charge for delivery but rather takes a cut from each sale that it looks to recognize in its financials as a technology fee, so large delivery fees on small purchases of pot can add up to big losses. “In some of these markets, it can be prohibitively expensive to be sending drivers out to only be doing one or two transactions in an hour,” said Morgan Pahxia, managing director at Poseidon Asset Management LLC, an asset-management company that focuses exclusively on the marijuana industry. “That’s just crazy. You have to be at such high velocity.” Orange County is something of an outlier, as per-market delivery costs can drop to as low as $6 in tightly-packed urban areas such as San Francisco — the second densest city in the U. S. — and the midrange for many markets Eaze operates sits between $8 and $12 per delivery, averaging about $9 to $10 across all its markets in the Golden State. Opinion: How investors can separate the winners from the losers in the marijuana industry Khaled Naim, CEO of Onfleet, a company that makes delivery-logistics software, says costs in the $6 to $12 range are not outrageous, likening pot to the economics of alcohol and pharmaceuticals delivery, both of which can be profitable with those delivery costs. “With a 30% margin, you can easily do a couple of deliveries in an hour in a big enough market with a good enough product.” Yet Eaze’s cost of revenue and operations dig deeply into its bottom line. According to the pitch deck, the company expects a $12 million loss before interest and taxes in fiscal year 2017, widening from $8 million in 2016. The costs, broadly, are broken into two segments: cost of revenue, which will grow to $16.8 million this fiscal year compared with $7.1 million in 2016, and operating expenses, which it expects to widen to $14 million from $9.5 million in 2016. While not as unmanageable as the Orange County costs, the money Eaze must spend to deliver marijuana in other cities will still make turning a profit difficult without immense expansion. “Delivery is a tough business, ask anyone even in mainstream industries. You have to be a large company, which can only be done at scale — which Eaze is trying to do,” said Ben Larson, co-founder of Gateway Incubator, a marijuana startup accelerator. “But this isn’t pizza delivery…[regulations] are going to drive up the cost of delivery. It’s going to be very slim margins, and so what I think it’s going to do is to drive the company to add other revenue models.” ‘It still kind of feels like a drug deal’ To some extent, Eaze looks to be moving toward alternative revenue streams. Its vaporizer cartridge line is one example, reaching $1 million in sales within four months of launch, according to the investor deck. It’s less clear what the potential returns for its coming private-label brand will be, but the deck says that it can “fill gaps in the market” and that because there are no marketing or distribution costs, Eaze will receive a higher retail margin and can scale quickly. What’s clear from the investor materials is that Eaze’s revenue has been climbing steadily: Executives forecast a 112% rise to $18 million in fiscal year 2017, from $8.5 million in 2016. Between 2015 and 2016, revenue rose 118%. See also: Marijuana industry could be worth $50 billion annually by 2026 Eaze’s expanding losses despite the revenue gains may be one of the reasons the company’s founding CEO, McCarty, ceded the top boss job to another ex-Yammer employee, Jim Patterson, in 2016. It also may be why the company is seeking new funding, as well as its expansion plans for Los Angeles and the rest of the state as California prepares for recreational legalization to take effect in 2018. But for pot businesses, regardless of the fact that Eaze says it’s a tech company, raising more cash is not a by-the-numbers operation as with other entirely legal startups. “One thing different for this industry, is that it’s very undercapitalized,” said Pahxia. “There’s no guarantee the next round of funding is there.” Even if it can get enough funding and avoid regulatory challenges to keep growing, Eaze will still have to overcome the economics of the industry to become profitable, investors say. As the industry matures and products and services become more alike, says Larson, the economics around marijuana farmers and retail operations, including Eaze, will tighten. “As the industry grows and becomes more efficient and things become commoditized, [pot growers and retail] will be the two endpoints that get pinched the most,” said Larson. “Dispensaries and grows are historically not just very scalable businesses, and if they are it’s at very low margins. And I think that’s where Eaze will find themselves, especially if they haven’t built a strong brand.” Read also: Pot paradise planned as cannabis company buys California town If Eaze is able to build a profitable business out of delivering marijuana, it could be in danger of larger, more established businesses butting in to the industry. At least in the near term, Eaze likely will not have to fight with existing delivery businesses such as GrubHub Inc.

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"(Reuters Health) - Many moisturizers promoted as remedies for skin problems like eczema and labeled as `fragrance-free’ or `hypoallergenic’ may still contain chemicals that can cause irritation, a recent U.S. study suggests. Researchers asked Amazon, Target and Walmart to name their top 100 best-selling whole-body moisturizers sold online. Then the researchers assessed how well these popular products moisturized the skin, whether or not their ingredients might trigger allergic reactions and how much they cost. Only 21, or 12 percent, of the 174 individual products tested were free of allergens, the study found. Many of the moisturizers contained fragrances and chemicals known as parabens and tocopherol, all of which can cause rashes and worsen skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis. This means patients can’t assume that moisturizers marketed as hypoallergenic, fragrance-free or even dermatologist-recommended will actually help skin conditions, said lead study author Dr. Steve Xu of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “Ultimately, there is no such thing as a zero-risk cosmetic product,” Xu said by email. “For moisturizers, white petroleum or pure shea butter are lower risk, but trusting the labels is not enough,” Xu added. “Making sure there are as few ingredients as possible is also a good thing to double check.” Moisturizers are a great solution for patients with skin disorders because they retain moisture in the skin, reduce inflammation, help prevent infection, are widely available and can be more affordable than prescription skin remedies. But the study found products marketed to appeal to people with skin problems like eczema and psoriasis tended to cost more, even though they didn’t necessarily avoid ingredients that could make these conditions worse. Half of the products labeled “dermatologist recommended” cost at least 79 cents an ounce, while moisturizers without that description were typically 59 cents an ounce, researchers report in JAMA Dermatology. When moisturizers claimed to be “phthalate free,” they tended to cost about $1.38 an ounce, compared to 59 cents an ounce without that distinction. At the same time, there wasn’t a statistically meaningful difference in pricing based on whether or not the moisturizers were free of known allergens identified by the North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG), which determines if a product contains typical skin allergens such as fragrance mix, parabens or tocopherol. The top three most affordable moisturizers in the study that were free of NACDG ingredients were Ivory raw unrefined shea butter, Vaseline original petroleum jelly and Smellgood African shea butter. The most popular moisturizers, according to the study, were lotions (59 percent), followed by creams (13 percent), oils (12 percent), butters (8 percent) and ointments (2 percent). Roughly 83 percent of moisturizers labeled “hypoallergenic” contained at least one ingredient believed to potentially cause allergic reactions, the study found. And 45 percent of products claiming to be “fragrance free” actually contained a fragrance or a botanical ingredient. The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how specific ingredients might exacerbate or relieve skin conditions. Prices found online when researchers did the study also might not reflect current or typical costs for moisturizers, the authors note. For people with sensitive skin or problems like eczema or psoriasis, however, the study confirms that reading labels may not necessarily guarantee a safe or effective product, said Dr. Matthew Zirwas, author of an accompanying editorial and member of NACDG. “We know that the only definite harm to consumers from personal care products is allergic reactions to ingredients such as fragrances, preservatives, etc.,” Zirwas said by email. “This study confirms for us that consumers can’t tell which products don’t have this risk by looking for terms like hypoallergenic or fragrance free.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2xYfXwd JAMA Dermatology, online September 6, 2017.

,09142017,Reuters,09072017,"BEIJING/CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Nations sanctions on North Korea’s important textiles industry are expected to disrupt a business largely based in China and pose compliance headaches for clothing retailers in the United States and around the world. The U.N. security Council imposed a ban on North Korea textile exports and a ceiling on the country’s imports of crude oil on Monday, ratcheting up sanctions designed to pressure North Korea into talks about its nuclear weapons and missile programs. Retailers in the United States and other countries have intentionally limited their exposure to North Korea in recent years, as tensions over the country’s nuclear program have increased. The industry has sought to strengthen control over its supply chain since a textile factory collapse in Bangladesh killed more than 1,100 people in 2013. “There are still hundreds and thousands of companies that are sourcing from overseas that don’t have the wherewithal or the resources or people or money to chase after these issues,” Wulfraat said. Textiles were North Korea’s second-biggest export after coal and other minerals in 2016, totaling $752 million, according to data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency. Nearly 80 percent went to China. Enforcement of the textile ban along North Korea’s 1,400-km (870-mile) border with China - where goods are sometimes smuggled across, often on boats at night - could be challenging, North Korea experts say. “In the past, we have seen shows of quite convincing enforcement in the major centers, such as at Dandong,” said Chris Green, a North Korea expert at Leiden University in the Netherlands, referring to the largest trading hub on the China-North Korea border. Goods still slip through in less visible areas, he said. Trade in non-banned goods, including food and other daily necessities, continues between China and North Korea. “Enforcement will depend a lot on China,” said Paul Tjia, an outsourcing specialist who regularly visits North Korea. “So far, a lot of the North Korean textiles trade to Europe and other places goes via China.” “It will be up to Chinese companies that deal in the North Korean textile trade to take action and up to the Chinese government to ensure the Chinese companies are taking action.” On a recent visit to the Chinese border with North Korea, several Chinese traders told Reuters the Chinese government is strictly enforcing U.N. sanctions to the point that some businesses that rely on trade with North Korea have already gone bankrupt or traders have had to start trading in non-sanctioned goods. Another challenge is that clothes can be partly made in China and partly in North Korea with a “Made in China” label attached to the finished product. “Even if a label says “Made in China,” some parts of the product are allowed to be made in North Korea and other places,” Tjia said. “For example, the buttons may come from Italy, the cotton may come from Australia or India, the labor may come from North Korea or China, the accessories may come from Bangladesh.” “We’re aware of the accusations and have clear guidelines and standards in place for our vendors and suppliers,” said spokeswoman Jenna Rack. “We don’t source any products from North Korea or any apparel products from Dandong.” North Korea does not release statistics on the number of people involved in the textiles industry, but experts estimate  at least 100,000 people are employed at North Korean textiles factories, producing goods both for export and the domestic market. Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea specialist at Beijing’s Renmin University, estimates the figure may be as high as 200,000 people. Wages at textiles factories grew tenfold around 2010 when North Korea was experimenting with economic reforms, according to Green, so people suddenly went from earning 30 North Korean won to 300 won. “They were suddenly getting a reasonable wage,” said Green. Supply chain consultant Tjia said North Korea textile workers will be hit by the trade ban. “If the goal of the sanctions is to create difficulties for ordinary workers and their ability to make a livelihood, then a ban on textiles will work,” he said.

Shoshanna Delventhal,09142017,Investopedia,09072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs As Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) fears dominate Wall Street sentiment with the e-commerce giant’s push into new markets such as brick-and-mortar grocery retail with its $13.7 billion buyout of Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM), one team of analysts sees the tech stock surging even higher. (See also: Amazon: Whole Foods Price Cuts to Boost Prime Subs.) Shares of the Seattle-based e-commerce and cloud computing giant have rallied nearly 30% year-to-date (YTD) versus the S&P 500’s 10% gain over the same period, reflected in a market capitalization of about $469 billion. Analysts at MKM Partners make the case for Amazon’s future $1.6 trillion valuation, beating out America’s leading retailer Wal-Mart Stories Inc. (WMT) as well as exceeding the market cap of both Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Oracle Corp. (ORCL) combined. MKM Partners’ Rob Sanderson sees the potential for a $3,400 share price in years to come, about 3.5 times AMZN’s trading price on Friday afternoon. Sanderson, who rates AMZN at buy with a $1,275 price target, is particularly upbeat on the online retailer’s third-party sellers, or “3P” business, as he sees it helping Amazon grab a larger share of the retail market. While 3P sales now make up a majority of AMZN’s retail merchandise sales, up from 30% in 2013, the analyst forecasts 70% of the company’s total value of retail goods transacted will be attributed to 3P in eight years. The analyst expects that both Amazon’s domestic and international retail segments will reach $500 million on their own by 2025, with cloud unit Amazon Web Services (AWS) hitting $600 billion over the same period. “We think the U.S. retail business can achieve 15.5% share by 2025, larger than Walmart’s 12.2% in 2016,” wrote Sanderson. ""We think AWS can grow at a 20% CAGR​ for the next 8 years and will become the world’s most valuable IT supplier.” (See also: Best Buy Has ‘No Reason to Exist’ in Amazon Age: Wedbush.)

Sarah Whitten,09142017,CNBC,09072017,"It's only just September, but toy retailers are already gearing up for their busiest time of year. This week brought the top toy lists from Wal-Mart, Target and Toys R Us — some of the biggest names in the business. With chatter building around the holidays, Amazon quietly posted in late August on its website a list of 100 toys for the season. Wal-Mart was the first to make an official announcement on Wednesday, also bringing news of the start of its layaway program. The big-box retailer has promised more than 1,000 new toys, which includes more than 300 exclusives. Wal-Mart said that about 25 percent of its toys will be exclusive to its stores. This year, smaller rival Target said it will sell more than 1,400 new and exclusive toys across its stores and online. Target rolled out 1,800 new and exclusive toys in 2016 — up 15 percent from 2015, and the most it had ever sold. Target's top items for 2017 include 11 toys that are exclusive to the retailer, the company said, such as a Shopkins mall, an exclusive Hatchimals egg and a Jetson-branded electric scooter. Instead of its typical ""Fab 15"" list, Toys R Us upped the ante with what it's calling ""Geoffrey's Top 20"" for toys. Like Wal-Mart, the retailer is offering a layaway service with no fee required, and Toys R Us is promising to match prices for all in-store purchases. If a customer is able to find a better deal elsewhere, Toys R Us said it will match prices from places like Wal-Mart, Target, Amazon and Best Buy. The ""hot"" lists, which arrived a touch earlier than usual this year, are a way for the retailers to get shoppers excited for the all-important holiday season. This year, retailers are under even more pressure as sales shift increasingly online. Toys are critical for luring in shoppers and winning business heading into the holidays. And for Toys R Us, a toy retailer, the holiday season is a make it or break time. This year all the more so, as it has recently hired Kirkland & Ellis to help it address roughly $400 million in debt due in 2018. Across the many hot toy lists, interactive toys, collectibles, puzzles, entertainment properties and tech-infused toys have been the most prominent. And that's no surprise. Strong sales from these categories helped the toy industry grow 5 percent, reaching $20.4 billion, last year, according to The NPD Group. Collectibles remain one of the strongest drivers of growth in the toy industry. In 2016, sales of collectibles grew 33 percent, or $432 million, to reach $1.8 billion, according to NPD data. Sales of blind packs — collectible items where buyers don't know what they are getting — alone grew 60 percent. These toys tend to be popular with parents because they are inexpensive, while kids enjoy the hunt as they try to ""collect them all."" Hot toys in this category include Spin Master's ""Colleggtibles,"" miniature versions of its fast-selling Hatchimal toys; Disney's Tsum Tsums, sold through retailers like Jakks Pacific; Funko's line of Pop! figures and Lego's traditional figures and buildable BrickHeadz characters. Interactive robots with personality have also flooded the market. Although a higher price point for consumers, with the majority selling for north of $100, these toys have been a hot commodity. Hasbro is selling Roarin' Tyler and Ivory, fluffy, plush tigers that respond to touch and have more than 100 motions and sounds, and a My Little Pony Magic Twilight Sparkle, an animatronic pink horse that has more than 90 unique phrases and also responds to touch. Spin Master's Zoomer line is also releasing a robotic horse toy, as is Hasbro's rival, Mattel, which is slated to debut a battery-operated Barbie's DreamHorse. While sales of entertainment properties have been sluggish in the first half of 2017, with Hasbro's lines of ""Despicable Me 3"" and ""Cars 3"" disappointing investors, the second half of the year could be saved by toys from ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" ""My Little Pony: The Movie"" and ""Justice League."" In the same vein as collectibles, these movie- and TV-inspired toys, gadgets and costumes conjure up imaginative, open-ended play and feature characters that are familiar to kids. After the release of ""The Force Awakens"" in 2015, ""Star Wars"" toy sales for Hasbro reached nearly $500 million. While sales from ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" were slightly lower than expected, the company has high hopes for toys from ""The Last Jedi."" These sales could be buoyed further after ""Force Friday,"" a massive Star Wars merchandising event, that has boosted buzz for the film due out in December. Another category that has been steadily growing is tech toys. Many of the hot toy lists include items that encourage kids to learn how to code or use technology. Hasbro has launched a Dance Code Belle doll that can be coded to perform different maneuvers and dances using an app. The company also has the FurReal Proto Max, an animatronic dog that users can code to move and make various facial expressions and sounds. Crayola's Fashion Superstar allows users to create their own masterpieces on paper and then transfer those designs into an app that places them on digital models. Users can then share their creations in-app like they would on Instagram. Similarly, Lego's Life app lets users construct digitally and take photos of their builds to share on a safe, digital platform. Of course, some shoppers are still pining after last years' biggest hits.

 ,09142017,CNBC,09072017,"U.S. consumer prices accelerated in August amid a jump in the cost of gasoline and rents, signs of firming inflation that could allow further monetary policy tightening from the Federal Reserve this year. The Labor Department said on Thursday its Consumer Price index rose 0.4 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in July. August's gain as the largest in seven months and lifted the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 1.9 percent from 1.7 percent in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI rising 0.3 percent in August and climbing 1.8 percent year-on-year. Gasoline prices surged 6.3 percent, the biggest gain since January, after being unchanged in July. Further increases are likely in September after Hurricane Harvey forced temporary closures of refineries. Labor Department officials said it was difficult to say whether Harvey, which slammed Texas towards the end of August, impacted on gasoline prices last month. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, consumer prices increased 0.2 percent in August. That followed four straight monthly increases of 0.1 percent. In the 12 months through August, the so-called core CPI increased 1.7 percent. The year-on-year core CPI has now increased by the same margin for four straight months. While Federal Reserve officials are likely to treat the gasoline-driven rise in the CPI as temporary, they could take comfort in the nearly broad gains in the monthly core CPI. The Fed's preferred inflation measure is the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy. The annual increase in the core PCE has consistently undershot the central bank's 2 percent inflation target since mid-2012. The core PCE rose 1.4 percent in July, the smallest year-on-year increase since December 2015. Economists expect the Fed will announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting. Low inflation, despite the labor market being near full employment, is seen causing the Fed to delay raising rates for a third time this year until December. Last month, food prices rose 0.1 percent after rising 0.2 percent in July. The cost of rental accommodation surged 0.4 percent in August. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.3 percent after advancing by the same margin in July. There were also increases in the cost of doctor and hospital visits. Prices for apparel rose last month as did the cost of household furnishings. But the cost of mobile phone services continued to fall as did prices for used cars and trucks.

"Andy Noronha, director in the Cisco Digitization Office",09142017,CNBC,09072017,"The specter of digital disruption has quickly become one of the most concerning issues for business leaders around the world. In 2015, less than one percent of executives believed digital disruption could have a transformative impact on their industry. Now, Airbnb is more valuable than Hilton, Tesla is more valuable than Ford, General Motors and BMW, and Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods just put tremendous pressure on competing grocery chains' stocks. These tangible examples have moved digital disruption from a secondary concern to a top-of-mind issue at the board level. According to new research from the Global Center for Digital Business Transformation, a joint IMD and Cisco initiative, more than three-quarters of executives now believe the impact of disruption on their industries will be ""major"" or ""transformative."" What a difference two years can make. Which industries are most vulnerable? Executives who thought – or still think – they are safe from disruption will face a rude awakening. No industry is safe. The media and entertainment industry is seeing the greatest disruption as the level of competition among industry incumbents intensifies thanks to inroads from Amazon, Facebook, Snapchat and Netflix. Only slightly behind media are technology products and services, retail, financial services and telecommunications. The businesses in these markets share several characteristics that make them particularly exposed to digital disruption. For one, their core products and services are highly information-centric and can be readily digitized. How can companies respond to the forces of disruption? When faced with a disruptive competitive threat, it can be hard to know what to do because you are on unfamiliar terrain. However, four distinct strategies can provide a framework to conceptualize your options. 1. Harvest This is a defensive strategy designed to maximize gains from a declining business or market. Domino's has been employing this tactic by driving greater efficiencies through digital technologies. Despite strong performance through the 1990s, Domino's struggled in the early to mid 2000s. However, the company's leadership determined an online presence that was both user friendly and efficient could improve the customer experience and yield more sales. By 2015,  the company was processing approximately half of all orders online, sales were 30 percent more than in store purchases, and labor costs decreased due to efficiencies created by the technology. 2. Retreat The Harvest strategy is about maximizing value in threatened segments. However, when the costs of maintaining a business clearly outstrip the benefits, companies should focus on strategic retreat. This strategy emphasizes withdrawal into a market niche that serves a small subset of existing customers with specialized needs. For example, when General Electric faced intense competition in its consumer appliances business,  it shed GE Capital's assets and sold its appliances division – exiting a business that brought in $19.6 billion in 2015, or nearly 17 percent of GE's total revenue. GE is now using the proceeds of these sales to focus on its  industrial internet strategy. 3. Disrupt While Harvest and Retreat are defensive strategies, incumbents can go on the offensive and become disruptors themselves. When a market opportunity that can be profitably exploited is detected, companies should focus on creating new value for customers using digital technologies and business models.  Look no further than Otto for an example of a disruptive strategy. The company, which was recently acquired by UBER, disrupts the freight industry by automating trucking. Currently, labor represents 40 - 75 percent of operational costs for the industry. If Otto can completely automate its trucks, it will be able to offer its services at a drastically reduced price and cut out the competition. 4. Occupy Although the disrupt strategy represents catalytic activities that introduce market disruption, the Occupy strategy focuses on sustaining the competitive gains associated with that disruption. Occupy rejects the ""build it and they will come"" approach, and is premised on the reality that the company that introduces a disruption may not end up winning in the end.  Walmart has employed this strategy to succeed in retail. Over the past few years, Walmart has invested billions in multi-channel capabilities to combat ecommerce competitors like Amazon. In executing this strategy, Walmart's stores become a key asset as nearly ninety percent of Americans live within ten miles of one. ","When Amazon disrupts, how companies can fight back-commentary"

Daniel B. Kline,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Target (NYSE:TGT) has, in the short term, stabilized its business. The company has delivered a better-than-expected 2017 so far, reporting a comparable sales increase of 1.3% in Q2 and earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $1.22, a 14.2% year-over-year increase. Perhaps most importantly, the chain has advanced its turnaround plan, remodeling some stores, and working toward integrating its website with its brick-and-mortar stores. ""We continue to focus on our long-term strategy, as we work to transform every part of our business and build an even better Target that will thrive in this new era in retail,"" said CEO Brian Cornell in the Q2 earnings release. ""While our recent results are encouraging, we will continue to plan prudently as we invest in building our brands, our digital channel, the value we provide our guests, and elevating service levels in our stores."" The problem the chain faces --and it's a big one -- is that it competes with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Those two companies are engaged in a technology arms race, and it's going to be expensive for Target to keep up. Target has been working to improve its technology. Image source: Target. For years, Amazon has taken market share from traditional stores by working relentlessly to improve its delivery service and the shopping experience for its customers. This push has included making two-day delivery a standard while pushing to create even faster methods of getting products into consumers' hands. Amazon has set a standard of digital service, but it has not rested on those laurels. Wal-Mart was late in responding, but it recognized the threat to its survival when it spent $3.3 billion buying Jet.com, mostly to acquire Jet's leadership team, led by serial entrepreneur Marc Lore. That investment, however, was only the beginning, as it has moved quickly to further integrate its stores and digital operations. That includes testing automatic pickup towers in some stores, adding ""Easy Reorder"" on Walmart.com allowing customers to see in-store and online purchases they have bought most often, and upgrading the technology that supports their supply chain. ""We have tests going on with digital endless aisle shopping, robotics, and image analytics to scan aisles for outs and we're using machine learning to assist our merchants with pricing,"" said CEO Doug McMillon during the chain's August post-earnings release call. It's an arms race where price seems to matter little. Amazon is spending tens of millions -- maybe hundreds of millions -- pursuing drone delivery even though it may never be able to get it legalized for widespread use in the U.S. In fact, the online retailer has shown it will sacrifice margin and profit to build its business, and Wal-Mart has shown it will open its pockets to compete. Right now, Target's efforts on the technology side are to catch up to the current standard. The company understands that its stores give it an exploitable edge over pure-digital retailers, and it has been following Wal-Mart's lead in creating an omnichannel shopping experience. Target has also been following Amazon's lead in creating house brands to give consumers a distinct reason to come to its stores. That has been a strong part of the company's turnaround, and having exclusive product lines gives the chain some insurance against its rivals' ongoing technical advances. The challenge for Target is that it's not innovating in technology. So far it has survived, even slightly thrived, by following along, but its supply chain and delivery capabilities lag well behind Amazon's and somewhat behind Wal-Mart's. The chain has taken a step to correct that, buying Grand Junction, which it described as a ""transportation technology company"" in a press release. The acquisition will ""improve and expand Target's delivery capabilities ... [and] accelerate Target's investments and ongoing efforts to transform its supply chain,"" according to Target Chief Logistics Officer Arthur Valdez. Target may succeed by having good-enough technology with differentiated merchandise, and well-designed stores. It runs the risk, however, that Amazon and Wal-Mart will advance their technological edges in ways it can't quickly follow. That could be having Amazon's drones cut into people's trips to stores, or seeing Wal-Mart come up with its own near-instant-delivery method. It could also be an innovation that neither company has spoken about yet. Amazon and Wal-Mart are working to innovate, while Target is just keeping up. That creates risk for the company that it will either lose customers to an innovation it can't easily copy or that it will have to come up with significant, unexpected capital expenses to keep pace.

John Maxfield,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. To be clear, if Square's application is approved, it won't technically be a bank; it will instead be an industrial-loan company. Image source: Square. From the perspective of the consumer, these two types of institutions are functionally equivalent, as they're both empowered to make loans and accept deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The biggest difference from Square's perspective, however, is that an industrial loan company can be owned and controlled by a corporation that does things other than banking. A traditional charter doesn't permit this. A decade ago, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) applied for the same type of charter, which would have allowed a subsidiary of the company to offer banking services to its customers. The retailer ultimately withdrew its application after confronting criticism from others in the bank industry as well as reluctance on the part of regulators to allow Wal-Mart to own and operate a bank. A second difference is that, unlike banks, industrial-loan companies don't subject their parent company to supervision by federal banking regulators, such as the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Regulators' jurisdiction would extend instead only to oversight of the banking subsidiary. ""It's good news for small businesses that Square is seeking a bank charter -- it will allow the company to continue to innovate inside the regulatory system,"" says Colin Walsh, co-founder and CEO of Varo Money, a provider of digital banking services that has applied for a national bank charter. Walsh continued: However, the choice of an industrial loan charter (ILC) over a full national bank license is likely to add fuel to the fire in a debate recently reignited by [online lender] SoFi. ILC charters are regulated by states and the FDIC but do not have to comply with the additional regulations of the Bank Holding Act and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, creating some controversy among community banks and community groups. Moreover, while this isn't as big of a deal for Square, which doesn't rely on physical locations, only roughly half a dozen states permit industrial-loan companies. Utah has the most, and that's where Square has submitted an application, but California and Colorado are among the states that allow them as well. The ability of a fintech company like Square to gain access to federally insured deposits would be viewed by many as a watershed moment for the bank industry. It would be seen as an opening for a company such as Square to siphon deposits away from traditional banks. Fintech companies are particularly well positioned to do this given their lean operating structures, Walsh noted in a recent conversation. Because fintech companies don't operate expensive branch networks, they can afford to pay higher interest rates on deposits than a typical bank can. The ability to attract deposits would give Square a stable and growing source of capital that could be used to expand its lending operations, through which it's already extended $1.8 billion worth of credit to small business clients of its payments services. This would ratchet up the competition against traditional banks on the asset side of the balance sheet as well as the liability side. It's unusual for a company that doesn't focus on core banking services to evolve into a large banking institution, but it isn't unheard of. Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) offers a case in point. Over the past quarter-century, the McLean, Va.-based company has transformed from a credit card issuer to a full-fledged regional bank. What does Square's move portend for the future of banks? Assuming its application is approved, it seems fair to assume that others will follow in the payment company's footsteps. The net result for banks will be increased competition from corners of the financial-services market that they have largely been shielded from in the past. ","

Leo Sun,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of Target (NYSE:TGT) shares have fallen 20% this year due to the retailer's sluggish sales growth, tough competition from e-commerce rivals, and concerns about its turnaround plans. But Target still looks intriguing at its current price, so let's take a moment to examine three reasons to buy and three reasons to sell the stock. First, Target is very cheap relative to its industry peers. It trades at just 12 times trailing earnings, which is much lower than the industry average of 19 for discount stores. Its forward P/E of 13, while indicative of a future decline in earnings, also looks cheap. Source: Target. Second, Target pays a forward dividend yield of 4.3%, and it's raised that payout annually for 49 straight years. Target spent 48% of its earnings and 28% of its free cash flow on those dividends over the past 12 months, so it has plenty of room for future hikes. Target's free cash flow growth is somewhat volatile, but remains in an uptrend over the past several years. Source: YCharts Lastly, Target has plans to boost its growth again. It's renovating its stores, increasing the number of small-format stores in denser neighborhoods, and investing more heavily in digital channels. Target's digital sales rose 32% annually last quarter, compared to 16% growth in the prior year quarter. It also slashed prices on thousands of items to counter Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Those efforts lifted Target's revenue by 1.6% annually last quarter -- breaking a six-quarter streak of top line declines. Analysts expect that momentum to continue with 1.8% sales growth this year. Target's first big weakness is its grocery department. Last quarter, Target's positive comps growth in apparel, home, essentials, and hardline products (electronics, music, movies, books, software, sporting goods, and toys) was partly offset by flat growth in food and beverages. Food and beverage revenues generated 21% of Target's revenues during the first half of 2017, which remains unchanged from the previous year. This leaves Target heavily exposed to Amazon's game-changing acquisition of Whole Foods, which immediately reduced prices at the premium grocer while integrating its stores into Amazon's Prime ecosystem. This means Target's grocery comps could slide a lot more in the future. Source: Pixabay. Another major challenge is that Wal-Mart has about 2.5 times as many stores as Target in the US. That superior scale makes it easier for Wal-Mart to charge lower prices and fulfill more online orders via deliveries and in-store pickups. Target is investing heavily in its digital channels to keep pace, but those expenses -- along with the price reductions on its products -- are weighing down its margins. That's why analysts expect its earnings to fall 10% this year. Target's third weakness is its fragile reputation among shoppers, particularly in conservative areas. The company's decision to welcome transgender shoppers to use the bathroom of their choice -- which was originally posted on the company blog without the approval of CEO Brian Cornell -- sparked a fierce boycott which caused its store traffic and comps growth to slide. Cornell subsequently defended the idea and the controversy faded, but the risk of Target stepping on another political landmine remains high. Target's low valuation and high yield look tempting, but I think it's positioned poorly in today's rapidly evolving retail sector. On the superstore front, Wal-Mart could overwhelm it with its superior scale and more evolved e-commerce initiatives. On the grocery and e-commerce fronts, it faces the combined wrath of Amazon and Whole Foods. Target's positive sales growth is encouraging, but we should really be watching its bottom line -- and those numbers won't improve anytime soon. Therefore, I believe investors should stick with either Wal-Mart or Amazon, and see if Target can withstand the incoming headwinds before buying any shares. ","
      
    Target: 3 Reasons to Buy, 3 Reasons to Sell -- The Motley Fool

Joe Tenebruso,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. No discussion of e-commerce can take place without mentioning the mighty Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company dominates online retail -- and, increasingly -- retail as a whole. Yet there are other businesses with exciting e-commerce growth prospects that you may be less familiar with. Read on to learn about three of the best available in the market today. Wal-Mart has stepped into the e-commerce ring to battle Amazon head on -- and it doesn't plan on backing down. Image source: Getty Images. It's not often that Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) finds itself in the position of underdog, but that's exactly what it is when it comes to competing against Amazon in e-commerce. Recently, however, the retail behemoth has made some aggressive moves to close the gap. Wal-Mart purchased e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion in August 2016. It then quickly moved to install Jet.com CEO Marc Lore as head of its U.S. e-commerce operations. Since that time, Wal-Mart has scooped up several smaller online retailers, including ShoeBuy.com, outdoor gear retailer Moosejaw, women's apparel seller ModCloth, and most notably, upscale men's clothing brand Bonobos. Yet, importantly, the majority of Wal-Mart's growth is coming organically through Walmart.com. Earlier this year, it began offering free shipping on orders over $35, which forced Amazon to lower its free-shipping threshold. Wal-Mart is also aggressively courting online merchants in an attempt to weaken Amazon's network of third-party sellers while fortifying its own. These efforts are already paying hefty dividends: Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales surged 63% in the first quarter and 60% in the second. If Wal-Mart can maintain anything close to this rate of growth in the coming years, it could become a legitimate competitor to Amazon in the e-commerce arena -- and generate handsome profits for investors along the way. Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is another company that's making its mark on e-commerce. But it's not an online retailer; instead, the Canadian software maker excels at helping smaller merchants compete more effectively with their larger rivals. Shopify provides cloud-based solutions to more than 500,000 small and medium-sized businesses. It helps users sell their goods across multiple channels, including: Additionally, Shopify performs vital back-office services such as inventory management, sales tracking, and payment processing. It's a comprehensive commerce platform that, along with a growing list of integrated third-party apps, provides users pretty much everything they need to run their business. Growth investors will also like that Shopify is just scratching the surface of the massive market it serves. In its IPO filing, the company noted that approximately 10 million merchants with fewer than 500 employees operate in its key geographies, with 46 million such merchants worldwide. Thus, Shopify currently has only 5% penetration in its core markets and about 1% of its total addressable market. With so much growth still to come, Shopify offers investors the prospect of exponential growth in the years ahead. One company that has a leg up on Amazon in many foreign markets is MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI). It's the leading e-commerce platform in Latin America, and its MercadoPago subsidiary is the No. 1 online payment service in the region. MercadoLibre's growth has recently outpaced Amazon's, despite serious economic turmoil in several of its major markets. Its second-quarter revenue soared 59% to $317 million (65% on a currency-neutral basis). Helping to drive this impressive growth was a 23% jump in unique buyers and a 41% surge in items sold. Moreover, payment volume rocketed higher by 74%. More people conducting more transactions on its network -- that's a powerful trend that should continue to drive MercadoLibre's results for many years to come. Only about 62% of the more than 605 million people in Latin America are currently connected to the internet. That's up from approximately 50% in 2013, but still far below the nearly 90% internet penetration rates seen in North America. Moreover, less than 3% of total retail sales in Latin America were conducted online in 2016, compared to more than 8% in the U.S. So, like Shopify, MercadoLibre has a long runway for growth still ahead. As such, investors who buy shares in 2017 could see strong gains in the decade to come. ","
      
    3 Top E-Commerce Companies to Buy in 2017 -- The Motley Fool

Jeremy Bowman,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's been two weeks since Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) took over Whole Foods, and there are already several signs of progress. As widely expected, Amazon has lowered prices, targeting staples such as milk, bananas, and avocados.  However, some customers didn't even notice the price cuts or said they weren't lower enough to make a difference, as they seemed to be focused on specific items rather than being implemented across the board. Still, the news attracted an increase in customers, as JPMorgan Chase analysts said traffic trends at stores they studied were the best in three years. Foursquare found that traffic jumped 25% in the first two days, though much of that boost is likely to be related to the hype around the takeover. Amazon said it will continue to lower prices at Whole Foods, but improving performance at the organic grocery chain is only a small part of Amazon's ambitions in the supermarket industry. Image source: Whole Foods. Grocery sales in the U.S. total around $800 billion, but Whole Foods brought in just $15.7 billion last year, or only about 2% of nationwide grocery revenue. In other words, despite its well-known brand name, the company is dwarfed by industry leaders Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Kroger (NYSE:KR), and Costco Wholesale, which control more than half of the market. That means the threat from the Whole Foods stores themselves to larger competitors is probably less than Wall Street has feared. Kroger shares, for example, fell by double digits when Amazon announced it would acquire Whole Foods, but the company has more than six times as many locations as Whole Foods. Sixty percent of Whole Foods stores are located within 10 miles of a Kroger market, but that means only about 10% of Kroger stores compete directly with Whole Foods. For Wal-Mart, which dominates rural America, the overlap is even smaller. For the Whole Foods acquisition to be truly successful for Amazon, it needs to find a way to take grocery e-commerce mainstream as it's done with so many other categories, from books to electronics to the odds and ends that make up the tens of millions of items available on its website. Amazon's inability to break into that market on its own seemed to be the impetus for the Whole Foods takeover, but there are signs that the deal is boosting its online sales as well. Following the closing, Amazon immediately put 2,000 Whole Foods 365 items on its website, such as canned beans and tomato paste, and sold out of many of them.   Research firm One Click Retail estimated that Web sales of Whole Foods items totaled $500,000 in the first week. While those are positive signs, the biggest opportunity for Amazon may be in using Whole Foods locations as staging areas for grocery deliveries, or as pick-up locations. Since many of the stores are located in high-income neighborhoods in large cities, the demographic that is mostly likely to be an Amazon Fresh customer, the stores could also help make delivery more efficient. It's clear that the supermarket industry is moving away from the traditional brick-and-mortar model. Wal-Mart has scaled back on new store openings and is instead investing in improvements such as grocery pick-up kiosks, which are now available at 1,000 stores.  The service allows customers to place orders online and pick them up at a time of their choosing without their car for no extra cost. The program appears to be popular based Wal-Mart's recent U.S. e-commerce revenue growth at 63% and the speed with which it's expanding it. Kroger has over 500 of its own pickup locations, though it charges $5 for the service. The hybrid pickup model appears to be the most efficient way to use the internet to sell groceries, but there's no question that delivery would be more convenient. Wal-Mart has a store within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population. Kroger has nearly 3,000 locations across the country. Even with Whole Foods under its umbrella, Amazon will never match the brick-and-mortar presence of its top rivals. For the company to disrupt the grocery market, it has to do so online, by making grocery delivery as normal as any other kind of online shopping. That remains its biggest challenge as it experiments with its new shiny toy. ","
      
    What Amazon Needs Most From Whole Foods -- The Motley Fool

John Maxfield,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The payments company Square (NYSE:SQ) is looking to disrupt more than just the payments space. On Thursday, it submitted an application with bank regulators to obtain a charter for an industrial loan company, which is essentially a bank that's owned by a nonbank company. The move raises a host of questions for banks, which have long been insulated from outside competition by the chartering process. Assuming Square's charter is granted, the move seems to portend an acceleration in the pace of disruption that the financial services industry is already experiencing. To get a better sense of the role that charters play in the minds of fintech leaders, I spoke with Colin Walsh, co-founder and CEO of Varo Money, a mobile banking company that applied for a bank charter in July. What follows are portions of our conversation, edited for organization and flow. Colin Walsh, co-founder and CEO of Varo Money. Image source: Varo Money. The Motley Fool: What's the benefit to a fintech company of obtaining a charter, be it for a traditional bank or an industrial loan company? Colin Walsh: We've applied for a full national bank charter. We've gone right to the federal regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and said we want to be the first in the United States to get a charter for a bank that's designed for people who bank on their smartphones. We currently have a partner bank that we work with to collect deposits. And on the lending side, we're a nonbank state-licensed lender, so we go state by state to get our licenses. We then wire everything together on the front end for the customers. It's not the most efficient model. Becoming a national bank will allow us to offer products on a nationwide basis. We'll also be able to introduce a broader array of products. That will enable us to go beyond the core direct deposit account and basic savings account, to offering a range of savings products, including CDs and IRAs, as well as a broader range of lending products, including credit cards and home equity loans. TMF: Why did Varo Money apply for a traditional bank charter, not an industrial loan company charter like Square? Walsh: Our principal business is banking. We see ourselves as a bank. We see ourselves as helping to create what banking will look like in the future. For Square and SoFi, they have other business interests, but they want to be in banking as well. So an industrial loan company charter makes more sense for them, because it allows for nonbank companies to own a bank. Also, getting a bank charter is less controversial than getting a charter for an industrial loan company. When Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) tried to open an industrial loan company in 2005, 2006, and 2007, for instance, it met a lot of resistance. It's not a bank, and its application was opposed by community groups and community banks. More recently, SoFi has stirred that pot up when it applied for an industrial loan company charter earlier this year. An iPhone displaying Varo Money's user interface. Image source: Varo Money. Square and SoFi are going to meet some of the same resistance Wal-Mart did. That being said, I think it's a great thing for both Square and SoFi because collectively this is about the future of what banking is going to be, which is companies using technology to deliver lower cost solutions to consumers or small businesses in a way that helps their end customers better solve financial problems. So for us, applying for a traditional bank charter was a simple decision. Because we want to be a bank, we can avoid this resistance by just going right into it; that's our core business. TMF: How will the granting of charters to fintech companies change the bank industry? Walsh: It helps level the playing field in terms of access to secure capital, which has been problematic for fintech companies in the past. The real innovation and disruption will then come when companies entering the space combine technology and access to a secure source of capital to radically transform the experience for consumers. We've seen this in other industries, where suddenly it's easy to get the answers that you want, it just requires a few clicks on your phone. Whether you're dealing with a cash flow issue or savings or borrowing, technology helps all of these come together quickly, which disrupts the existing model. Why would I pay more for a worse experience at an incumbent player when a new player can give it to me in a cheaper and more seamless way? All that being said, I don't think there's going to be a flood of fintech companies applying for charters. I think there will be a handful of them. They require a lot of capital and a huge amount of expertise, not only in terms of how to manufacture financial products and comply with complex regulatory regimes, but also how to use consumer technology in a way that can deliver this type of transformation. TMF: How important is access to FDIC insured deposits for a fintech company? Walsh: From a funding perspective, a charter and FDIC insured deposits will allow fintech companies to offer more affordable solutions to their target customers. And then you combine that with a better experience, and that's a classic disruption story. How did Amazon succeed? It offered more affordable prices and a better customer experience. To the extent that fintech companies use that to create more affordable solutions for customers, that's going to be challenging for banks to compete against. Banks have a lot of overhead; a lot of fixed expenses. Between legacy technology and physical distribution, the costs at these incumbent institutions are really high. TMF: Have regulators been receptive thus far to Varo's application? Walsh: Absolutely. They've been clear that they're not compromising any of their standards. It's a high bar we have to clear. But they recognize the fact that our mission revolves around helping customers improve their financial situation. I think the regulators recognize that we have deep experience in financial services, both at the executive team and board levels at Varo. And they see that we have access to a lot of capital resources. We're backed by Warburg Pincus and we've got a number of other investors. All of that puts us in a good place with regulators.

    5 Questions for Colin Walsh, CEO of Varo Money -- The Motley Fool

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Kroger (NYSE:KR) recently announced earnings results for its fiscal second quarter. The nation's biggest grocery store chain showed a slight improvement in operating results. But its pricing battle with rival retailers is heating up and will push profits lower for the full year. More on that earnings outlook in a moment. First, here's how the headline results stacked up against the prior-year period: Metric Q2 2017 Q2 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $27.6 billion $26.6 billion 3.9% Net income $353 million $383 million (7.8%) EPS $0.39 $0.40 (2.5%) Data source: Kroger financial filings. Kroger's sales growth pace improved for the second straight quarter, yet remained far below the 5% or better that shareholders enjoyed as recently as 2015. Chart by the author. Data source: Kroger filings. Here are some other highlights from the quarter: CEO Rodney McMullen focused his comments on Kroger's improving operating trends. ""We returned to positive [comps] growth in the second quarter,"" he said in a press release. ""We had strong growth in both loyal and total households,"" McMullen continued. Image source: Getty Images. Executives highlighted the direct connection they saw between low prices and rising sales volumes. ""Traffic is up, unit movement is up, market share is up, and our customers' price perception is excellent and continues to improve,"" McMullen explained. That price leadership is proving expensive to the business, with operating margin declining by half of a percentage point over the trailing 12 months. Investors shouldn't expect a quick rebound, either. Executives have expressed their determination to win any pricing war, whether it comes from comparable peers like Wal-Mart or from Internet-based challengers. Kroger has spent billions on lowering prices over the past decade, McMullen said in June, and the management team has ""no intention of giving up the momentum we've gained on low prices."" The good news for the business is that the strategy is delivering results in the form of rising customer traffic and sales volumes. And a lost customer is much more expensive to the business than reduced prices, over the long term. This competitive approach assures that earnings will fall significantly this year, though. Kroger's confirmed outlook calls for adjusted profit of between $2 per share and $2.05 per share. That would mark a decline from last year's $2.12 per share result. Given the intense pricing pressure in the grocery industry, it's not clear when Kroger will be able to return to its long-term target of improving annual earnings by between 8% and 11%. ","

Brian Stoffel,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. I used to be one of the biggest fans of organic food companies here at The Motley Fool. For the past seven years I've spent over half of my time living and working on an organic coffee farm in Costa Rica; from the tours we give, I've seen firsthand the excitement everyday Americans have about reconnecting with their food. SFM data by YCharts And this is even ignoring the fact that the 800-pound gorilla in the room -- Whole Foods -- was down 50% from its 2013 high before it got bought out by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Behind this belief are are two very simple premises: As cynical as it might be to say, these two factors alone mean that investing in companies that are focused on organic goods -- like Natural Grocers, Sprouts, Hain Celestial, or United Natural Foods -- will likely be a money-losing proposition. As my grandma says, ""It's funny people focus so much on 'organic' food these days. When I was a kid, we just called it 'food'."" For the most part, she's right. While some elements of chemical farming were well underway back when she was growing up, it was nowhere near the level it reached just 10 years ago. That's why, in hindsight, it's absolutely laughable that the Federal Trade Commission almost blocked the merger of Whole Foods and Wild Oats. Seriously, were we so far removed from naturally grown food that we were worried a small grocer could corner the market? It just goes to show you why Whole Foods did so well for so long before it absolutely caved in: it pursued a niche that few were paying attention to, giving it the whole sandbox to work in. But as soon as competition caught on, the market responded by giving incentives to farmers to grow more organic produce, and voila, Costco, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Kroger (NYSE:KR) all had their own private-label organic brands that were selling like hotcakes at lower prices. That underscores the fact that for consumers only worried about the ""organic"" label, there's going to be a race to the bottom in terms of pricing. Amazon's entry into the fold will only accelerate that transition. And while that's bad for publicly traded organic companies, it's net-net positive for us: food is being grown in a slightly more healthy manner, and it's more affordable than it was before. But my time on the farm in Costa Rica has taught me another thing: even the high-end customers who go the extra mile to make sure they know where their food is coming from will eventually shy away from Whole Foods and its ilk. The reason: the organic movement has effectively been compromised. Could this be where the high-end niche is filled? Image source: Getty Images By that I mean we have scores of factory farms that are following the letter of the organic law, but certainly not the spirit of it. We know of several coffee farms in Costa Rica that still use ""organic"" pesticides and herbicides and maintain a strict monoculture but get to sell their beans for the same elevated price as those that don't. And that's just coffee; the examples in other areas are legion. Taken to the extreme, [farmers' markets, community supported agriculture, and the locavore movement] could mean the end of investing in food companies altogether as it would be the independent, local farmer providing the vast majority of food for consumption. While I still believe the ""vast majority of food for consumption"" will fall outside this circle, I'm starting to believe that the high-end niche will not be satisfied by those wearing suits claiming organic superiority, but by those wearing overalls and suspenders who are actually doing the hard work of organic farming -- and inviting their customers to come see for themselves. Pinched from both sides, I don't think investing your money with organic companies is a good use of capital moving forward. ","
      
    Organic Food Companies: Should You Invest In the Growing Health Trend? -- The Motley Fool

"Jason Hall, Chuck Saletta, and Reuben Gregg Brewer",09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When you think of stocks and innovation, most of the time a technology company comes to mind. However, almost every successful company has to prove that it has the ability to innovate at some point, often in surprising and unexpected ways. That can be just as true of a century-old food company as of a Silicon Valley start-up. We asked three of our contributing investors to offer up a company that they think could make for a solid investment right now that's also showing its innovation chops. They gave us two that may surprise you -- 125-year-old food purveyor Hormel Foods Corp (NYSE:HRL) and low-cost retail behemoth Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) -- and one that's more of a typical innovator in First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR). Innovation can come from surprising places. Image source: Getty Images. Ready to add some innovation to your portfolio? Keep reading to learn what makes these three stocks innovative leaders and more importantly, why they're worth investing in today. For example, after Hormel bought the boring old Skippy peanut butter brand, it launched P.B. Bites. That shifted peanut butter from a spread to a snack that you can carry around with you. After buying Wholly Guacamole, it expanded the line with layered dips. It's also created an entire line of foods, called Vital Cuisine, to help patients dealing with serious medical issues meet their unique nutrition needs. Those are just a few recent examples. Innovation is actually a stated corporate goal and one piece of the equation that's allowed Hormel to increase its dividend annually for an incredible five decades. HRL Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts. That dividend, meanwhile, is part of the reason why now is a good time to look at Hormel. The food industry is under pressure today from changing consumer tastes, and that's pushed Hormel's shares down to the point where they yield around 2% -- toward the high end of its yield range over the past 15 years. It's a nice yield and a fair price for those looking to find innovation outside of the technology space. Chuck Saletta (Wal-Mart): Retailing giant Wal-Mart may not be the first company that comes to mind when you think of innovation, but right now it's giving you good reason to consider it. The world's largest retailer is clearly flexing its innovative muscle as it creates a commanding omni-channel shopping experience. Last month, Wal-Mart reported strong earnings and raised its guidance, thanks to the enhanced integration of its stores with its online presence. Image source: Getty Images. A key driver of that current strength and the optimism for the future is the way Wal-Mart is leveraging its recent acquisition of online retailer Jet.com to enhance its online presence. The company is now piloting things like employee delivery of online purchases and same-day pickup in store, which helped boost online sales by 60% compared to last year. Much of that online growth is incremental compared to its physical store results, which is helping fuel more effective use of Wal-Mart's physical presence. Wal-Mart is delivering end-to-end profitable growth by leveraging both its physical stores and its online marketplace. It is showcasing the potential that a strong omni-channel retail strategy can have to enable physical retailers to not only survive but also thrive in today's era of digitized shopping. That ability to profitably innovate for growth, combined with Wal-Mart's still reasonable price of around 17 times expected earnings, makes it worth considering owning today. Jason Hall (First Solar, Inc.): Solar panel manufacturers have made huge leaps forward over the past decade. Panels are cheaper and more efficient today than they've ever been, helping make solar more cost-competitive with traditional power sources like coal and natural gas. And panel makers continue to push the limits, squeezing more and more efficiency, even as costs fall. Image source: Getty Images. One of the leaders is First Solar, with its thin-film technology that operates more efficiently in extreme environments that reduce the output from their silicon brethren, making it the preferred product for utility-scale projects. The company isn't resting on its laurels, with plans to bring its latest Series 6 panels to market by mid-2018. First Solar has earmarked over $500 million in spending to bring Series 6 to market -- after having already spent about the same amount in development. The company has a history of innovation, and the odds are good that it will be able to eke out even more efficiency from its technology, helping maintain its edge. But this isn't a risk-free proposition. Investors should acknowledge that Series 6 is still nearly a year from full-scale production, and as my colleague Travis Hoium wrote, ""It's the biggest transition in the company's history."" So while 2018 could be a choppy year as First Solar transitions to Series 6, it should help the company remain the leader in utility-scale solar. If First Solar's big bet on Series 6 pays off, the company will remain well-positioned for many more years of dominance in the solar industry, right when global growth is really taking off.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,09142017,Fool,09072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock recently dipped into negative territory for the year to put it well behind the broader market's 10% increase. At first blush, the sell-off looks like shortsightedness on the part of investors. After all, sales growth is ticking up even as the retailer introduces its plans for higher membership prices. Long-term shareholders shouldn't be rattled by a little volatility. However, with Costco shares barely keeping pace with the market over the last five years, it's worth looking at the prospect for a continuing disappointing stretch for the business. Image source: Getty Images. Sales growth is speeding up lately, with comparable-store sales improving to a 5.9% pace in August from 5.3% in the prior month. That's an encouraging sign for the business, especially as many retailers are enduring flat or slightly negative comps lately. Rival Kroger (NYSE:KR), for example, just saw its comps drop into negative territory after 12 consecutive years of increases. Costco's longer-term results show that it isn't immune to the competitive pressures hitting Kroger and its other retailing peers. The warehouse giant's comps gains hit a six-year low of 4% in fiscal 2016. They're running at about the same sluggish rate over the past 12 months, too. Comps excluding fuel sales and currency exchange shifts. Data source: Costco. Chart by author. Part of the reason why investors assign such a premium to Costco's stock is that the company consistently outgrows its rivals. If that gap shrinks -- or disappears -- it makes sense that the shares would command a lower valuation going forward. Many of Costco's key rivals are warning investors to brace for declining profits. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has seen its operating income slump as it pours resources into increasing its wages and spending on employee training and education. Kroger lowered its full-year earnings outlook as management promised to meet market-share competition with more cost cuts. ""Kroger has invested more than 3.8 billion to lower prices for our customers"" in the last 15 years, CEO Rodney McMullen said. ""We have no intention of giving up the momentum we've gained on low prices,"" he added. COST Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. Costco already invests heavily in its employees, and its above-average pay ensures some of the lowest turnover in the industry. The retailer's price-leadership strategy also leaves it well protected against peers aiming to sacrifice profits to steal market share. Still, these moves are likely to add pressure on Costco to invest more in retaining employees and in attracting customers through low prices. That could translate into reduced earning power over time. Costco's short-term profit outlook is positive, given that its membership fee increase will start lifting bottom-line results in fiscal 2018. Most of the retailer's earnings come from these annual club membership costs. And, even as comps can swing from year to year, the fees tend to climb steadily as more members get added to the pool. Subscriber income reached $2.6 billion last year, up from about $1.6 billion in 2010. Costco's growth plans include aggressively expanding is store base, especially in international markets. Its loyalty card switchover, meanwhile, appears to be delivering big gains to members and to the business, which implies increased customer satisfaction. As a result, while I'll be watching comps and profit trends, I wouldn't start worrying about my Costco investment unless the company starts losing ground with its members. The good news is subscriber renewal rates are above 90% and holding steady right now. I'd expect that rate to tick higher as the company recovers from the negative impact of last year's credit card switchover. And, as Costco has demonstrated in the past, a big base of happily renewing customers forms the foundation for market-beating sales and profit growth. ","

Francine McKenna,09142017,MarketWatch,09072017,"Published: Sept 13, 2017 9:17 a.m. ET Questions asked about Marketplace and non-GAAP accounting By Wal-Mart Stores’ e-commerce site and its inconsistent disclosures related to overseas divestitures triggered interest from the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to correspondence released by the regulator. E-commerce sales at Wal-Mart U.S., where the company is competing directly with Amazon, grew 60% in the most recent quarter. Wal-Mart has already increased the number of products offered on Marketplace to 67 million items, supplemented by items from third-party sellers like Toms and Vans shoes. According to comment letters from the SEC recently made public, the regulator wrote Wal-Mart

                                    CFO M. Brett Biggs in May and asked how the company earns and accounts for revenues from these third-party sales. Wal-Mart had never disclosed to investors how it was accounting for this revenue or where to find it on the income statement. The SEC also asked who owns the inventory—the third-party sellers or Wal-Mart—and what services, if any, Wal-Mart provides sellers. The largest retailers, including Wal-Mart are still evaluating the impact of the new Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, revenue-recognition rule called ASC 606, which Wal-Mart said in its most recent quarterly filing it would adopt in February 2018. One significant change for Wal-Mart may come when it evaluates its contracts with vendors like those it supports on Marketplace to determine how, and where, it should account for the revenue. Its current assumption, stated in its response to the SEC, is that the third-party vendor is the principal in the transaction and Wal-Mart is only the agent, which requires Wal-Mart to present the revenue on a net basis under current rules. Wal-Mart could boost its top line, and its cost of sales, if it determines some third-party sales should be presented on a gross basis instead under the new revenue recognition rules effective in 2018. Another significant impact of the new revenue rules will be faster recognition of income from the unredeemed portion of Wal-Mart’s own gift cards, called breakage revenue. Read:  An obscure accounting change could boost Amazon, Starbucks, Wal-Mart profits by hundreds of millions of dollars Wal-Mart wrote back to the SEC in June that in addition to providing the Marketplace platform to third-party sellers, it also helps collect payments on their behalf. Wal-Mart told the SEC that the independent vendors establish their own prices and are responsible for both product fulfillment and returns. Wal-Mart earns “referral fees” for these transactions on a net commission basis, and includes the amounts in net sales. “As these referral fees have been less than 0.5% of net sales for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we concluded they are not material and therefore have not disclosed our related accounting policy,” Biggs told the SEC in the letter. The SEC also asked in June about a non-GAAP metric called “eCommerce Gross Merchandise Value” or GMV in its press release. Wal-Mart told the SEC in July it defines GMV as “the total US dollar volume of merchandise sold or services rendered for all transactions, including marketplace transactions, that are generally initiated through our eCommerce platforms or include our owned inventory sold on other third party platforms. It also incorporates discounts, estimates for returns, shipping fees and referral fees.” Although Wal-Mart believes its definition of GMV is fairly consistent with other companies and, as such, has not historically disclosed it, it agreed to include a definition in future earnings releases. A Wal-Mart spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The SEC also showed it’s now focusing on the substance of non-GAAP reporting over its form as it continues to pursue companies over their use, and in some cases abuse, of the non-standard accounting metrics. See MarketWatch’s special report from March: The SEC is cracking down on made-up earnings numbers. In the same letter sent in May, the SEC also noted the disclosure of an adjusted earnings per share in its press release for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017. The SEC said that Wal-Mart’s adjustments to EPS for divestitures have not been consistent year to year. The adjustments included one for the gain on the sale of Yihaodian in China but not one for a $194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile. See also: The company that makes Jack Daniel’s is skirting accounting rules, experts say This question took two letters to answer. In June Wal-Mart responded to the SEC that it really doesn’t like to report adjusted EPS and has not reported an adjusted EPS in 9 of the past 13 quarters. But its sale of Yihaodian in China had a more significant impact on EPS in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, $0.14, that was “not indicative of our normal business operations and also represented a strategic shift in the e-commerce strategy within our China operations.” On the other hand, the gains from the sale of shopping malls in Chile “had a much smaller impact on EPS of $0.02 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and another $0.02 impact for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.” For that reason,Wal-Mart decided not to report adjusted EPS for those gains, but still provided information for investors to understand the impact on its financial statements. The SEC wrote back in July that Wal-Mart had adjusted EPS for U.S. discontinued real estate projects, closure of stores globally and the accounting for certain leases in 2017 and 2016. “The nature of these adjustments, including Yihaodian, appears similar in that they are not indicative of your normal revenue generating operations. We view these adjustments as being similar to the $194M gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile,” the SEC wrote. Wal-Mart got the message and responded it would consider adjusting EPS “for items similar to the shopping mall gains which do not have a significant impact in an individual quarter but have a larger total impact across multiple quarters. We will also consider providing additional discussion as to our reasons for not adjusting EPS in accordance with the updated Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations issued on May 17, 2016.” Wal-Mart reported second-quarter net income of $2.90 billion, or 96 cents per share, in mid- August, down from $3.78 billion, or $1.21 per share, for the same period last year.

And both have 7% of their stores in the metropolitan areas threatened by Irma. “For perspective, [Superstorm] Sandy increased Home Depot’s sales by about $500 million for four quarters after the event,” analysts wrote. “Based on these data points, we think it’s reasonable to expect home improvement comps to be boosted by 50-to-100 basis points for the next few quarters.” Grocers like Kroger Co.

                                   issued a profit warning on Wednesday after its corporate headquarters, distribution center and other facilities were hit by Harvey. As of Tuesday, September 5, the company said that all but one of 40 stores in the region as well as its corporate facilities were back in operation. Six of the company’s boutiques have suffered “real damage,” said Chief Executive Steven Lawrence, but even they are in “good enough shape to be operational.” Still, Francesca’s expects same-store sales to decline in the mid-to-high teens for the third quarter because it will take a couple of weeks for the supply chain to get back to normal. Read:  Francesca’s shares sink after profit warning, says corporate headquarters and more impacted by Harvey “[A]s most of our workforce were stranded in their homes for a week or more, we’re unable to either receive new goods at our distribution center or send merchandise out to our boutiques,” said Lawrence, a circumstance with “meaningful impact” to all of its stores. Francesca’s shares closed down 2% on Wednesday.

The company lowered its full-year EPS guidance to $2.95 to $3.05 from $3.00 to $3.20. Shares are down 4% in Wednesday trading. Newell isn’t the only company with a potential plastic resin problem.

Hurricane Irma, which is already a Category 5 storm and the second strongest on record in the Atlantic, has the potential to cost the consumer and retail sector $1.45 billion in lost sales, according to data from Planalytics, a weather analytics company. “While Harvey was a major (Category 4) hurricane, the impacts were primarily driven by flooding as some locations in Houston received upwards of 50 inches of rain,” the Planalytics report said. “Irma is a larger storm in size as well as a stronger storm, meaning that damages will be driven by high winds and storm surge.” Planalytics says the population in Irma’s path is three times that impacted by Harvey, including not just Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Tampa, in Florida, but also Columbia and Charleston, SC and Charlotte, NC.

Even with the severity of these storms, Instinet analysts led by Simeon Siegel caution against retailers using these hurricanes as a “good excuse” for fourth-quarter earnings misses. “We believe that fears around holiday spending within impacted areas (Harvey and the pending landfall of Irma) appear fair, but we highlight (and apologize for the callousness) that blaming hurricanes for a weaker fourth quarter may end up proving a ‘convenient’ excuse for companies that had risk to their hockey-sticked guide anyway,” Instinet said.

Alessandra Malito,09142017,MarketWatch,09072017,"Published: Sept 11, 2017 9:11 a.m. ET Everything from apparel to furniture and jewelry is less expensive online By The purchasing power of one dollar is worth more online, according to software company Adobe’s Digital Price Index, which looked at online and offline spending. If consumers had shifted all of their offline spending last year to online, that difference would have meant saving about $2.2 billion, it estimated. Apparel, furniture and jewelry are all experiencing deflation faster online than offline, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index. That trend is expected to continue as the holidays get closer, said Taylor Schreiner, director of Adobe Digital Insights. See:  8 online shopping hacks everyone should know Of course, online prices aren’t always better than those in brick-and-mortar stores. Alberto Cavallo, an associate professor of applied economics in the Sloan School of Management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, conducted a comparison of prices from retailers with an online and offline presence in 10 countries, using crowdsourcing platforms and data scraping. He concluded that online and offline prices were the same 72% of the time, especially in apparel and electronics. (They were the same 69% of the time in the U.S.) The study didn’t include online-only retailers like Amazon and eBay,

                                   — consumers shouldn’t worry too much about a big price difference online versus offline. See also: This is how savings experts do their holiday shopping But an increase in purchasing power online is driven by more frequent online sales that can respond quicker to supply and demand — especially around electronics and toys — the ability for consumers to comparison shop online, as well as increasing competition among increasing number of online vendors, Schreiner said. “Online prices tend to drop even faster than offline tend to around the holiday season,” he added. Still, more shoppers are moving online. During the 2016 holiday season, online sales rose 11% year-on-year to nearly $92 billion, according to Adobe, and Black Friday and Thanksgiving online shopping passed offline shopping for the first time last year (by $5 billion). And more shoppers (82%) expect to buy gifts online this year than in physical stores (76%), according to an August survey of more than 1,000 American adult internet users by Fung Global Retail Technology.

Nathan Allen,09142017,MarketWatch,09072017,"Published: Sept 12, 2017 4:34 a.m. ET By French banking group Credit Agricole SA (ACA.FR) said Tuesday it will sell a 16.2% stake in Banque Saudi Fransi (1050.SA) to Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holding Company (4280.SA). Kingdom Holding Company will pay 5.8 billion Saudi riyals ($1.55 billion) for the stake, equivalent to SAR29.50 per share. Credit Agricole will retain a 14.9% sharehold in Banque Saudi Fransi, or BSF, but said it was open to selling a further 5% as long as the deal was on ""equally favorable terms."" The French bank expects to complete the transaction in the second half of the year and is committed to maintaining a 9.9% stake in BSF for one year after the deal is closed. Credit Agricole has been active in Saudi Arabia since 1949 and associated with BSF since its formation in 1977. The BSF deal aligns with Credit Agricole's strategy of reducing its non-controlling interests in companies and will strengthen its fully-loaded Common Equity Tier 1 ratio--a measure of financial strength--by around 20 basis points, the company said.

Jeffry Bartash,09142017,MarketWatch,09072017,"Published: Sept 14, 2017 12:09 p.m. ET Suspicion of elites fuels opposition among swing voters By Democrats seeking a chink in President Donald Trump’s armor have floated the idea of “free” college to attract support outside their liberal base, but apparently the idea has fallen flat with swing voters. A polling firm hired by Democrats to survey voters in swing states has advised candidates to forget talk of free college. They should focus instead on job training, helping graduates reduce debt or making college more affordable, according to an article in Politico. The pollsters found that many swing voters did not believe college could be free. The lack of support was especially acute among working-class voters who resented what they saw as an elitist proposal whose costs would ultimately be passed onto them. Opinion: The myths of recovery: Why American households aren’t better off Most voters believe they’d end up paying for their own education in some form or another such as higher fees or taxes. Or worse, they’d end up paying for others to get their own degree for free. They were also suspicious of expanding Medicare for all Americans as well as another Democratic rallying cry to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Both ideas were viewed as unrealistic. Also Read: Growing number of Democrats join Bernie Sanders’ single-payer health-care push No proposal is really free, of course. The government has to either increase taxes on some Americans to pay for new benefits or shift money from other programs. Either that, or further increase U.S. deficits that have topped $400 billion in every year since 2008. Also Read: Here’s how much college tuition costs have soared in each state The skepticism among working-class Americans points to a pressing problem for Democrats that could impair their effort to outflank Trump or win control of Congress. A group that used to strongly lean Democrat appears to have become more conservative in their voting habits, especially in Midwestern states that used to be party strongholds. The 2016 election bears witness to these shifts. Trump was backed by 51% of voters without a college degree to 44% for Clinton, exit polls show. He also narrowly won Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin with the help of working-class voters, handing him the White House. These voters are not permanently lost, however. Barack Obama actually won a majority of voters without college degrees in both 2012 and 2008. In both cases there are important caveats, though. Obama’s first victory was fueled by a devastating recession and dissatisfaction over the Iraq war that turned most voting blocs against Republicans. And in 2012, he faced off against Mitt Romney, a wealthy Mormon businessman who failed to connect with working-class voters in swing states. The loss of Clinton 2016, Romney in 2012 and Democrat John Kerry in 2004 illustrates a hardening trend in presidential elections: working-class voters are less apt to support candidates they view as elitist regardless of party. Candidates ignore these voters at their own peril — as Clinton found out. A record one-third of Americans now hold a bachelor’s degree, U.S. Census data show, but two-thirds still do not. College-educated voters did account in 2016 for half of the overall vote for the very first time, but historically those without college degrees account for the majority of the vote. Nor can Democrats be assured of winning the college vote in every election. Republicans have won the college vote in three of the past five elections (2012, 2004, 2000).

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"Deloitte said on Wednesday that it expects sales of $1.04 to $1.05 trillion between November and January, with e-commerce sales jumping 18 percent to 21 percent. Wal-Mart said it would increase the number of what it called “holiday helpers” in stores this season to enhance customer service by getting shoppers checked out faster, having more registers available and adding another layer of shopping support for customers in lines that may have forgotten items. The “holiday helpers” are part of its regular workforce, the company said. Wal-Mart said the extra hours offered will help staff traditional roles such as cashiers and shelf stockers, and personal shoppers and new jobs like pick up associates for its online operations.[Bwbbsp5sa] “This is the same approach we took last year, and we heard great feedback from our customers and associates,” said Walmart U.S. Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna. Several analysts expect holiday hiring for stores to rise this year as retailers try to make up for a drop in service quality. Last week, Target said it would hire 100,000 temporary holiday workers, up from the 70,000 it has hired in each of the last four years. Macy’s said it would employ more workers at its distribution centers and warehouses to support its online business, while reducing overall seasonal hiring as it has fewer stores this year. Wal-Mart, the largest retail employer in the United States, did not disclose its hiring for fulfillment centers but said those centers are currently staffed by thousands of more employees than last year to meet increasing demand.

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp and PepsiCo Inc on Wednesday joined an expanded group of nearly 800 companies calling in a letter for U.S. legislation to protect immigrants brought into the country illegally by their parents from deportation, according to organizer FWD.us. The retailers and other companies asking Congress to pass a permanent replacement for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, reflect broadening pressure on political leaders to find a solution for the roughly 800,000 immigrants known as “Dreamers”. A group of businesses less than half the size and weighted toward technology companies sent a similar letter in August, before President Donald Trump said he would end the program. The new letter reflects Trump’s decision and asks for a permanent solution to let DACA recipients remain in the United States. Trump said that DACA immigrants who have work permits that expire before March can apply to renew them for another two years, if they do so before Oct. 5. Both letters were spearheaded by FWD.us, a pro-immigration group co-founded by Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg. The very first incarnation of the letter included signatories from major technology companies such as Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com and Alphabet Inc’s Google. But over the course of several days, a much broader swath of the U.S. economy, from media firm Viacom to private equity firm TPG signed on. The newer letter adds firms like biotech firm Becton, Dickinson and Co, according to a copy of the letter and signatures seen by Reuters. “That you see business leaders from every major sector of the economy come out and ask Congress to pass a permanent fix for DACA right away shows that this is a bipartisan issue that has strong support,” Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, told Reuters. The new letter calls on Congress to “immediately pass the bipartisan DREAM Act - or similar legislation - that gives Dreamers the permanent legislative solution they deserve.” The DREAM Act, first introduced in Congress in 2001, would provide Dreamers with a way to become U.S. citizens after first becoming permanent residents. DACA, a set of executive actions introduced by President Barack Obama in 2012, didn’t include a pathway to citizenship, which would require an act of Congress. Some conservatives in particular object to offering  citizenship to DACA recipients. Activists including United We Dream also are encouraging DACA recipients and companies they work for to be public about their situation. Enrique Ramirez was brought to the United States from Mexico when he was two years old. He graduated from Harvard University and is now attending law school at the University of Texas at Austin. “There’s been so much money invested in me by this country, wouldn’t even a conservative person want me to contribute to my community here?” Ramirez said. DACA shields recipients from deportation and allowed them to work and attend school legally if certain requirements were met. Speaking on ABC television on Sept. 19, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was “encouraged” that leading Democrats and Republican President Trump have said they are near a deal on DACA legislation. Apple has said it has 250 DACA beneficiaries among its ranks. “We think it’s essential that we not only let them stay in this country, but welcome them,” Cook said of DACA recipients. “I am encouraged that Congress will pass a law to make this permanent.” Other tech companies are looking to pair with local groups to help DACA recipients. Ride-haling firm Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] said that is holding a series of town-hall meetings in 10 cities to answer drivers’ questions about DACA changes, and that it plans to donate $500,000 to local groups that can help drivers with issues like paperwork and application fees.

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"More than a third of migrant fishermen in Thailand clearly were victims of trafficking over the past five years, and even more workers in the industry were possibly trafficked as well, according to a report published Thursday. Routinely underpaid and physically abused, three-quarters of migrants working on Thai fishing vessels have been in debt bondage, working to pay off an obligation, said the study by the anti-trafficking group International Justice Mission (IJM). Thailand's multibillion-dollar seafood sector came under fire in recent years after investigations showed widespread slavery, trafficking and violence on fishing boats and in onshore food-processing factories. The politically unstable country, which is under military rule, has vowed to crack down on trafficking and recently introduced reforms to its fisheries law. The IJM study of 260 fishermen from Myanmar and Cambodia found 38 percent were clearly trafficked and another 49 percent possibly trafficked. Only 13 percent reported fair labor conditions at sea and no exploitative recruitment, it said. Three-quarters reported working at least 16 hours a day, and only 11 percent said they were paid more than 9,000 Baht ($272 U.S.) per month, the legal monthly minimum wage in Thailand. One fisherman was quoted in the report as saying he was held in debt bondage, owing 20,000 Baht ($604) to his brother, who worked as a supervisor overseeing fishermen. In debt to brother ""I fear for my life as he has killed in front of me before,"" he was quoted as saying. ""I don't dare to run. He would kill my children."" Field researchers surveyed the 260 fishermen in 20 Thai fishing localities in 2016, collecting information on fishing jobs they had held in the previous five years. Thailand, the world's third-largest seafood exporter, had more than 42,000 active fishing vessels as of 2014, and more than 172,000 people were employed as fishermen, the study said. The study was funded by the Walmart Foundation, the charitable arm of giant U.S. retailer Walmart. With release of the study, the foundation announced a grant to help the IJM improve law enforcement efforts against human trafficking in the Thai fishing industry. Neither Walmart nor the charity would specify the value of the grant.

,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. bribery investigation at ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] will likely go on for a year or more and could lead to snowballing legal and compliance costs if lawyers find systemic problems. Uber, which is the subject of a U.S. probe into whether it paid bribes oversees, has started a review of its Asia operations and notified U.S. authorities about payments made by staff to police officers in Indonesia, a person familiar with the matter has told Reuters. The following explains the possible fallout for the company. What is under investigation? Uber said in August that it was cooperating with a preliminary investigation led by the U.S. Department of Justice into whether its managers violated a 1977 anti-bribery law, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The law bars U.S. companies and some other entities from paying bribes to foreign government officials to obtain business. The bulk of the investigative work may be handled by O’Melveny & Myers, a large law firm that represents Uber and is conducting an internal probe. The law firm is expected to turn over its findings to the Justice Department, which would then weigh charges or a settlement with Uber. How much money is at stake? There is a wide range for the potential financial impact on Uber. The company will have to pay O’Melveny & Myers and any other lawyers it hires. It may need to increase its spending on compliance training for employees. Companies often sign agreements and pay penalties to the Justice Department or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to close investigations. How long does it take? A company might wrap up an FCPA investigation within a year if the matter is confined to one country or is otherwise an isolated example of wrongdoing. What non-monetary penalties are involved? The FCPA is a criminal statute, meaning that individuals could be charged and, if they are found guilty, sent to prison for violations. That has been rare. In cases of significant wrongdoing, U.S. authorities generally seek the appointment of a monitor - a person from outside the company, often a lawyer, who serves as a watchdog to prevent recidivism. The monitor may be given wide access to employees and documents and the authority to issue recommendations, which the business has to accept unless it is able to persuade the government otherwise. How much of a distraction can it be? This depends on the scope of the investigation, but an FCPA probe can cause turmoil within companies. Lawyers will seek interviews with employees and pore over documents such as expense reports. Memos may go out company-wide telling people to preserve records. Companies also must assess risk differently and be more careful, knowing they will face scrutiny from U.S. authorities for any further potential wrongdoing. They may be more cautious, for example, when entering a risky local market where bribery is common - a serious consideration for a company like Uber that wants to expand aggressively abroad. ","

 ,09212017,Reuters,09142017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Toys “R” Us Inc will shrink its stores and revamp its bigger outlets through its bankruptcy process, which may end with the company’s return to the public markets, Chief Executive David Brandon said on Wednesday. Toys “R” Us, the largest specialty U.S. toy seller, filed for bankruptcy on Monday after some of its vendors stopped shipping to them. They were concerned the company would not pay them because of its financial distress, but those worries were put to rest once Toys “R” Us secured bankruptcy financing on Tuesday. Brandon, in detailing Toys “R” Us’ turnaround, dubbed “Project Sunrise” by the company, said the chain will integrate its online and in-store shopping experiences, adding faster shipping and better technology and customer service. He said the chain’s 64,000 workers would see wage increases too. Brandon described the plans at Toys “R” Us’ pop-up store in Times Square, a temporary space decorated with New York City-style subway logos and featuring an associate dressed up as the store’s giraffe mascot, Geoffrey. “I’m getting ideas for Christmas,” said shopper Katie Reed of Jackson, New Jersey, adding that she was surprised the retailer filed for bankruptcy. “The selection at Walmart and Target is not as big.” But the space pales in comparison to Toys “R” Us’ former Times Square location, which offered shoppers a Ferris wheel and roaring T-rex. The retailer hopes to return to its more experiential roots after it slashes its $5.2 billion debt pile and frees up cash through the bankruptcy process. Private equity firms Bain Capital and KKR & Co LP and real estate investor Vornado Realty Trust now own the toy seller, but the retailer will have new owners once it emerges, Brandon said. The company could exit bankruptcy through a public offering of its shares or by a traditional reorganization in which creditors convert their debt to equity, he said. He did not rule out a sale, explaining that the company and its creditors had not yet made any decisions. Toys “R” Us withdrew its plans to go public about four years ago. Before its $6.6 billion buyout in 2005, the chain had been publicly traded. The chain’s older suburban big-box shops will also be overhauled to give kids a chance to try out toys in the store. “[We want] toys out of the box and into the hands of kids,” Brandon said. “We know we need to do it. We haven’t had the capital to do it.” The older shops need new floor and lighting patterns and furniture to accommodate more play zones such as target ranges for Nerf, a line of foam projectile toys. Toys “R” Us already offers some activities, such as birthday parties, at its stores. The company does not plan to close a “disproportionate” number of its more than 1,600 stores across the country and aims to add smaller shops in urban areas including Washington, D.C., Boston and Detroit, Brandon said. But stores that lose money could be at risk of closing, he said. Retailers have several months to figure out whether to keep or reject leases in bankruptcy. Toys “R” Us will also offer shoppers more stores that combine its flagship brand for kids of all ages with the infant- and toddler-focused Babies “R” Us, Brandon said. ","

              SOUNDBITE British Fashion Council CEO Caroline Rush saying:
              ""Of course we don't know exactly what's going to come from these negotiations, what it is about is being ready and making sure that we have the case studies, the information, the evidence to back up why we feel as an industry we are pushing for talent, for visas and for, of course, the tariff free access and the frictionless borders.'

(AMZN) may be the king of e-commerce, but when it comes to the best prices and the speediest shipping, it's Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) that takes the crown. That’s according to BMO Capital Markets, which did a deep dive into pricing and shipping costs at Amazon, Costco and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and found that in the 16 categories analyst Kelly Bania and her team studied, the warehouse retailer had prices 7% lower than on Amazon's website. Shipping took an average of 4.5 days per each item compared to 5.5 at Amazon. Wal-Mart and its Jet.com owned e-commerce website had prices that were 18% higher than Amazon's and took a lot longer to ship with the average being 9.8 days. When taking into account Amazon’s Prime membership program that offers discounts and free two-day shipping, BMO Capital Markets found Amazon prices were 4% lower than Wal-Mart when shipping wasn’t included and 10% cheaper when all of the fees were factored in, reported Barron’s, which covered the research report. (See also: Why Amazon Is Losing to JD.com and Wal-Mart.) “With Costco generally beating Amazon in both price and shipping, it’s a reminder that Amazon has strong competition for all those musing about antitrust concerns, especially ones with a strong membership program like Costco's. And with Walmart investing heavily in eCommerce, we think it remains a vital competitor to watch, especially on price,” wrote Bania. “With that said, Amazon offers a wider set of SKUs​ than Costco does, and Prime has other benefits (video, music, etc.) that create differentiation.” The analyst reiterated her outperform rating on Amazon and her $1,200 price target. The analyst rates Wal-Mart and Costco at market perform with price targets of $80 and $170, respectively. “Despite Costco's price gap to Amazon we believe near-term sentiment and fear of the long-term impact of Amazon on Costco's business (whether or not justified by near-term fundamentals) could continue to create an overhang on COST shares and limit valuation upside,” she wrote in the research note. (See also: Six Retail Stocks That Still Rule: Morgan Stanley.) Aiming to remain relevant and lure customers its way, Wal-Mart has been making Amazon-esque moves lately.

Lauren Hirsch,09212017,CNBC,09142017,"Walmart is giving its employees the opportunity to work extra hours during this holiday season, rather than offering those hours to seasonal workers, the company said Wednesday. ""These extra hours will help staff traditional roles like cashier and stocker, and newly created technology-empowered positions such as personal shoppers and Pickup associates,"" Judith McKenna, Walmart's chief operating officer, said in a statement. Retailers have traditionally bulked up their hiring of temporary employees for the holidays to help prepare for the shopping rush. That policy earned pushback, though, with full-time employees frustrated at the lack of opportunity for more hours and pay. Walmart has also over the years raised its workers' salaries amid criticisms it was underpaying employees. It has been tough to be a retail employee in 2017, as over-stored retailers have been forced to shutter their facilities and layoff workers ""Our associates make the holidays come to life in our stores, and we are thankful for everything they do to help our customers have the best possible shopping experience,"" McKenna said. ","Walmart will rely on permanent workers, not seasonal employees, for holidays"
 ,09212017,CNBC,09142017,"U.S. consumer prices accelerated in August amid a jump in the cost of gasoline and rents, signs of firming inflation that could allow further monetary policy tightening from the Federal Reserve this year. The Labor Department said on Thursday its Consumer Price index rose 0.4 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in July. August's gain as the largest in seven months and lifted the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 1.9 percent from 1.7 percent in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI rising 0.3 percent in August and climbing 1.8 percent year-on-year. Gasoline prices surged 6.3 percent, the biggest gain since January, after being unchanged in July. Further increases are likely in September after Hurricane Harvey forced temporary closures of refineries. Labor Department officials said it was difficult to say whether Harvey, which slammed Texas towards the end of August, impacted on gasoline prices last month. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, consumer prices increased 0.2 percent in August. That followed four straight monthly increases of 0.1 percent. In the 12 months through August, the so-called core CPI increased 1.7 percent. The year-on-year core CPI has now increased by the same margin for four straight months. While Federal Reserve officials are likely to treat the gasoline-driven rise in the CPI as temporary, they could take comfort in the nearly broad gains in the monthly core CPI. The Fed's preferred inflation measure is the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy. The annual increase in the core PCE has consistently undershot the central bank's 2 percent inflation target since mid-2012. The core PCE rose 1.4 percent in July, the smallest year-on-year increase since December 2015. Economists expect the Fed will announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting. Low inflation, despite the labor market being near full employment, is seen causing the Fed to delay raising rates for a third time this year until December. Last month, food prices rose 0.1 percent after rising 0.2 percent in July. The cost of rental accommodation surged 0.4 percent in August. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.3 percent after advancing by the same margin in July. There were also increases in the cost of doctor and hospital visits. Prices for apparel rose last month as did the cost of household furnishings. But the cost of mobile phone services continued to fall as did prices for used cars and trucks.

Lauren Thomas,09212017,CNBC,09142017,"FedEx: FedEx has lowered its 2018 earnings guidance to account for the impact of a cyberattack. The shipping company also said on Tuesday that Hurricane Harvey impacted its fiscal first-quarter results. FedEx now expects earnings of between $11.05 and $11.85 per share, below its previous projection for earnings of between $12 and $12.80 per share. Adobe: Adobe Systems reported third-quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday that topped Wall Street estimates. However, the marketing software firm delivered a mixed outlook, causing shares to dip after hours. Bed Bath & Beyond:  Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond fell more than 14 percent in premarket trading, as the home goods retailer slashed its full year outlook on Tuesday and missed earnings estimates for the second quarter. Same-store sales — a metric closely watched by Wall Street for retail stocks — also came in lower than expected. Wal-Mart: The big-box retailer announced that this year it will be giving its existing employees the opportunity to work extra hours during the holiday season, rather than offering those hours to seasonal workers. ""These extra hours will help staff traditional roles like cashier and stocker, and newly created technology-empowered positions such as personal shoppers and Pickup associates,"" said Judith McKenna, Walmart's chief operating officer.

The device would be capable of interacting with Amazon's Alexa, the report said, citing people familiar with the company's plans. L Brands: L Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret, was downgraded by Cowen & Co., which cited ""fundamental new competition in the sport bra market,"" among other obstacles in retail. Cowen analyst Oliver Chen said the company must add more digital components to its brick-and-mortar locations in order to ""stimulate demand to drive store traffic."" Pfizer: Pfizer was upgraded to ""overweight"" from ""equal-weight"" at Morgan Stanley. The firm cited investors underappreciating the global prospects for Pfizer's ""No. 1 growth driver,"" as it relates to breast cancer, and ""M&A optionality."" The prospect of U.S. tax reform offers additional optionality, Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger said. Mattel: The toymaker's stock is beginning to rebound after investors traded off shares ahead of Toys R Us — one of its biggest retail partners — filing for bankruptcy. Hasbro and Jakks Pacific are among some of the other vendors for Toys R Us that have watched their stocks tumble over the past few weeks. Now, though, with more certainty about Toys R Us' plans ahead of the holidays, toy manufacturers have less to worry about, analysts are saying.

"Scott Brown, CEO, New Energy Capital Partners",09212017,CNBC,09142017,"The Trump administration appears to be no friend of clean energy. The administration just reiterated its intent to withdraw from the Paris Accord on climate change after sending mixed signals ahead of the UN General Assembly in New York. In other unfavorable moves over the past eight months, the administration has modified or rescinded multiple regulations that affect renewables. In March, President Trump signed an executive order which suspended the  Clean Power Plan, disbanded the  Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon, lifted  a moratorium on leasing federal lands for coal mining, directed the Department of Interior to review regulations restricting oil and gas exploration on federal lands, and directed all agencies to review regulations that might burden the production of oil, natural gas, coal and nuclear energy. Separately, the head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, suspended a rule requiring the oil and gas industry to reduce methane leaks, though that has been blocked by courts since July, and Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy, ordered a study of the electrical grid  to examine whether reliability concerns should justify support for baseload power, including coal, gas, and nuclear. Clearly, policy changes throughout the U.S. energy industry are well underway. Even so, the actions taken by the Trump Administration have so far had a limited impact on prospects for renewable energy investment. In fact, within the past three months, both  Bloomberg and Goldman Sachs have increased their expected penetration of renewable energy in the U.S. relative to their forecasts prior to the U.S. elections. Indeed, clean energy has been on a roll. In 2016, the electricity sector accounted for approximately  60 percent of all infrastructure investment in North America, and 65 percent of that investment was allocated to renewable energy projects. Worldwide, Bloomberg estimates that more than 70 percent of new power generation investment will be directed to wind and solar generation capacity over the next 20 years, averaging more than $20 billion per year. Meanwhile, a September 2017 Preqin report indicated that  96 percent of institutional investors surveyed expected to increase their allocation to infrastructure investments over the long term. With that many investors looking to infrastructure as an opportunity, and with North American renewables being such a large portion of the infrastructure market, the current U.S. political landscape has to be a significant factor in the minds of investors. Here are three reasons I remain bullish on the investment landscape for renewable energy. Although the new U.S. administration has pulled back on some of the Obama-era supports for the clean energy industry, these changes have not altered the fundamental growth of the industry. The U.S. renewable energy market remains a highly attractive and rapidly growing opportunity for infrastructure investing. ",Trump's 'no friend' of clean energy. It's still a buy-commentary
Nick Wells,09212017,CNBC,09142017,"Hurricanes Harvey and Irma may have faded from the sky, but you can count on them coming up again, this time in company conference calls. All the big hurricanes live again in the quarters following their landfall in the U.S., according to a CNBC analysis of earnings calls transcripts over the past 12 years. Corporate executives blame the storms for lower-than-expected results, express support for those on the ground and cautiously report the pick-up in spending thanks to relief efforts. For the analysis, we focused on companies valued at $5 billion and more. Generally, the costlier the hurricane, the more it's mentioned in subsequent calls. Hurricane Katrina, which devastated Louisiana in 2005, caused an estimated $133 billion in damages and was mentioned nearly 500 times in the ensuing quarters. Hurricane Sandy, which struck New York City in 2012 and caused major infrastructure damage across the Northeast, caused about $75 billion in damage and was mentioned over 400 times. Harvey alone may have caused up to $108 billion in damages, according to initial estimates from Moody's Analytics. There have been just over 30 hurricane landfalls in the U.S. in the past 50 years, according to a research note from JPMorgan. Not including Harvey and Irma, those storms have caused about $520 billion in damage, with numbers adjusted to 2017 dollars. Of those, only five have caused damage in excess of $25 billion. Market watchers disagree on hurricanes' impact on company earnings and the economy. One common refrain is that companies like Home Depot and Caterpillar benefit from the increased spending during the relief effort and the uptick in spending helps make up for some of the damage to the economy. But companies also say the damage to property and temporary productivity slow-downs are economic curses, even before considering the loss of life. A major factor in hurricanes' effect on business: simple shutdowns and changes in habit as people evacuate or hunker down to ride out the storm. ""Results in the quarter include unfavorable impacts totaling about $70 million due to Hurricane Matthew,"" Disney CFO Christine McCarthy told investors in February, four months after that storm. ""[Matthew] disrupted operations at Walt Disney World and resulted in the closure of our parks for about a day and a half."" Comcast CFO Mike Cavanagh also blamed Matthew for closing the company's Orlando amusement park for two days. A number of retail stores blamed reduced revenue or increased expense ratios on Katrina in their December 2005 calls. The CEO of pharmacy Rite Aid said four stores were destroyed in the storm, and 13 remained closed, but much of the pharmacy business had moved to other locations in the same area. Other retailers said consumers had stocked up on emergency kits and storm-related gear. In October 2008, Tractor Supply Company reported quarterly sales growth of 17 percent and earnings per share of 21 percent, thanks in part to emergency preparation demand driven by Hurricane Ike. Then-Home Depot EVP Craig Menear said that in just one week, the company saw a $70 million jump in sales including storm-related goods like batteries and generators as the country prepared for Sandy. ""Looking ahead it's difficult for us to forecast the magnitude of ongoing cleanup sales in the affected areas,"" he said in November 2012. One feature of hurricanes, as opposed to earthquakes for example, is that there's usually a few days' warning. That allows people and companies to do what they can to prepare. DuPont has a number of times had to shut plants down in the Gulf of Mexico in advance of a storm. In 2008, the company shut down a plant in Orange, Texas, before being struck by Hurricane Ike. The company blamed the shutdown and storm damage for part of a 36 percent drop in earnings for the quarter. Even for companies whose facilities aren't directly affected, there can be a ripple effect. Michael Stores CFO Jeff Boyer told analysts as much in March 2006, after Katrina disrupted shipping and consumers' travel. ""While it didn't impact us from a store-base standpoint, it impacted us from a gas price,"" he said. ""We saw a real reduction in traffic for a while coming out of that."" ""Q1 was impacted greatly by Hurricane Katrina and the craziness of gas prices in September,"" Costco CFO Richard Galanti told analysts in March 2006. Then-Southwest Airlines CFO Laura Wright said in October 2005 that the company lost between $15 million and $20 million due to the travel shutdowns following Katrina and Rita. Still, the year-over-year figures were not impacted ""due to a similar impact from the four hurricanes we had in the third quarter of last year,"" she said. Jay Benet, CFO of Travelers Insurance, blamed Matthew and Tennessee wildfires for $137 million in pretax catastrophic losses during a January call with analysts. Still, the company had an operating income of $919 million for the quarter, up 4 percent from a year prior. The sheer size of Katrina caused Allstate to delay its standard catastrophe loss estimate in 2005, CFO Dan Hale told analysts on a call later that year. The company relied on historical trends and aerial photographs to estimate losses in some areas. After-tax catastrophe losses amounted to $3.06 billion for the third quarter that year, the company said. That was $1.95 billion more than the previous year's third quarter. Hale on that same call said the company purchased reinsurance for its exposure in Florida, Texas, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and the Carolinas. This year, analysts at a reinsurance roundtable in Monte Carlo on Sept. 10 said they expected Harvey to wipe out the catastrophe budgets for many reinsurers for the rest of the year. David Flandro, head of global analytics at JLT Re, said Harvey's unusual path would make the reinsurance industry rethink its ability to correctly predict the paths of future storms. Many of the mentions are simply company executives offering thoughts and well wishes for their employees and customers affected by the storms. That's particularly true when a storm is happening during the earnings call, but can also happen years later. In August 2015, Wal-Mart President and CEO Doug McMillon reflected on the decade since Katrina crashed into the Gulf Coast. ""Throughout the devastation that the residents of this region faced, Walmart Associates demonstrated extraordinary courage and passion for these communities,"" he told analysts. ""I often think how simple acts of kindness can have a dramatic impact."" Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.

Rebecca Ungarino,09212017,CNBC,09142017,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was hovering near a one-month high on Wednesday, at 2.24 percent, ahead of the Federal Reserve's afternoon decision on its federal funds rate and subsequent remarks on the state of monetary policy. Some strategists believe a hawkish tone will emerge from the meeting that will boost the 10-year Treasury yield and perhaps turn around a multiyear downtrend for what many consider to be a gauge of economic health. Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray, said the technical picture is supportive of further upside for the yield on the 10-year note, pointing to key levels in a two-year chart. ""We're coming right up to the downtrend resistance line"" at roughly 2.5 percent that was last seen in March, Johnson said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""

The Wharton School's Jeremy Siegel believes it'll have a lot to do with President Donald Trump's intention to get business-friendly reforms passed on Capitol Hill — not the latest Federal Reserve decision on interest rates or better-than-expected economic growth figures. ""I would say corporate tax reform could add another 10 percent to the market even this year,"" Siegel said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" A deal ""looks very likely to get done."" It's the second time in less than 12 months that Siegel, a longtime bull, has made a bold market call. And it came on a day when the Dow and S&P 500 closed at record highs. In the final weeks of 2016, Siegel argued that the blue chip stock index was very close to hitting the 20,000 milestone. It broke through that key psychological level on Jan. 25 and since then has soared more than 10 percent. If Siegel is right this time, too, a 10 percent jump would put the Dow around 24,650 and the S&P 500 at 2,760 based on Wednesday's closes. ""There's new hope that taxes really have a chance to be done. I remained steadfast throughout some of the bleak days in the last few months when no one thought anything could be done,"" Siegel added. ""There's a little bit more optimism now. I think a corporate tax deal will be done, and I think that will be positive for the equity market,"" he said. Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.

"Travis Hoium, Jeremy Bowman, and Demitrios Kalogeropoulos",09212017,Fool,09142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Investment goals can change over the course of a lifetime. In your 20s, you may look for growth stocks to power your portfolio, while later in life, you are likely to find stability and dividends are more your focus. We asked three of our investors for their favorite rock-solid dividend stocks for your golden years, and according to them, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), and 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) have the qualities older investors should be looking for. Image source: Getty Images. Jeremy Bowman (Johnson & Johnson): If you're looking for a top-notch retirement stock, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has pretty much everything you could ask for. The healthcare conglomerate has been around for more than 130 years and is a Dividend Aristocrat, having increased its dividend payout for 55 years. Only a handful of companies can make that claim. J&J is also only one of two companies, along with Microsoft, to hold an AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor's. That's a testament to the strength of its balance sheet and its history. While the Tylenol-maker has a pharmaceutical division, its diversification makes it less risky than pure-play pharma companies, which often rely on one or two blockbuster drugs and can see their profits fall when they go over patent cliffs. The company's three principal business segments are pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer products, and with growth in the healthcare industry expected to be strong, Johnson & Johnson should continue to benefit. The company offers a solid yield of 2.5% and trades at a reasonable P/E of 23. Being a dividend payer in the inelastic healthcare industry, it should protect investors in a market downturn. Recent dividend increases have ranged from 5-7%, and the dividend payout has doubled in the past decade. With a payout ratio of 55%, there's plenty of room to keep up those increases even if profit growth lags. With an impeccable track record and promising growth in healthcare to come, there's no reason why Johnson & Johnson shouldn't be part of your dividend retirement portfolio. Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Wal-Mart): You're already retired, and so your portfolio is likely set up to prioritize income that increases -- or at least doesn't decrease -- under a wide range of market conditions. If rock-solid dependability is your goal, consider investing in Wal-Mart. The world's biggest retailer sports a 2.6% yield today and hasn't missed an annual payout increase in 44 years. Its latest operating results include steady, if unspectacular, gains. Sales growth was nearly 2% in the fiscal second quarter thanks to a healthy mix of rising customer traffic and higher spending per visit. At the same time, Wal-Mart's aggressive investments in the e-commerce channel are extending its market dominance into that realm. Digital sales spiked 60% and were responsible for a growing proportion of the retailer's comps growth. Wal-Mart is paying a price for its recent growth in the form of increased spending in areas like wages and e-commerce infrastructure. As a result, profits are falling this year and could be weak into 2018. However, the $6 billion of net income it has generated over the last six months was still more than twice its dividend commitment. Thus, this market-leading retailer has plenty of room for additional increases in coming years, even if its industry takes another surprising turn lower. Travis Hoium (3M): In your golden years, investing isn't about finding the next hot tech stock or betting on a high-growth market -- it's about stability. And no company is more stable than 3M. The company makes everything from office products to films that go in high-end smartphones. It's one of the most diverse companies in the world, with thousands of products and manufacturing plants. 3M isn't a big growth company, essentially stagnating over the last five years, but it's been able to grow earnings and free cash flow over that period of time. MMM Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Stability and cash flow have driven 3M's dividend, which currently yields 2.2%. The dividend has been paid for 100 straight years, increasing for 59 straight years, among the longest streaks on the market. With a business that's diverse and focused on cash generation, this is a great company to own for your golden years. ","
      
    3 Dividend Stocks Ideal for Your Golden Years -- The Motley Fool

Leo Sun,09212017,Fool,09142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Income investors love dividend aristocrats, those elite companies that have hiked their dividends annually for over 25 years. But with the market near all-time highs, many dividend aristocrats are trading at high valuations with historically low yields. However, two stocks with high yields and low valuations stand out: Target (NYSE:TGT), which has raised its dividends annually for 49 straight years, and Tanger Factory Outlets (NYSE:SKT), which could become a dividend aristocrat next year with its 25th straight dividend hike. Source: Getty Images. Shares of Target and Tanger respectively fell about 20% and 30% this year, compared to the S&P 500's 11% growth. Those declines were mainly attributed to competition from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and sluggish brick-and-mortar traffic wreaking havoc across the retail sector. Target has 1,816 stores and 39 distribution centers in the US, making it the second largest discount retailer in the country after Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). While Wal-Mart relies on an ""everyday low prices"" strategy, Target focuses on younger shoppers with more furniture, clothes, and exclusive designer merchandise. Target's retail formats include the discount store Target, the hypermarket SuperTarget, and other ""flexible format"" Target stores. Tanger Factory Outlets owns 43 outlet shopping centers across the United States and Canada. These properties are leased to over 3,100 stores operated by over 500 different brand name companies. Its outlets attract over 188 million shoppers annually. Tanger is an REIT (real estate investment trust), which must pay out at least 90% of its taxable income (not to be confused with earnings per share) as dividends to qualify for favorable tax rates. Target posted 1.6% annual sales growth last quarter, which finally broke a six-quarter streak of consecutive declines. Target attributed that improvement to positive comps growth at its apparel, home, essentials, and hardline (electronics, music, movies, books, software, sporting goods, and toys) departments. Source: Target. However, those gains were partly offset by flat comps growth at its food and beverages department, which faces tough competition from supermarkets, Wal-Mart, and Costco. Amazon's recent purchase of Whole Foods Market could exacerbate that pain, since grocery sales accounted for 21% of its revenue during the first half of the year. On the bottom line, Target's adjusted earnings rose just 0.1% during the quarter, as it relied more on promotions to drive its top line growth. Analysts expect Target's revenue to rise 1.8% this year, but for its earnings to fall 10%. Unlike Target, Tanger hasn't posted a quarter of negative sales growth in recent years. Its revenue rose 7.4% annually last quarter, and analysts expect 4% sales growth this year. Tanger's growth doesn't depend on product sales -- it merely needs to collect the rent and make sure that occupancy rates remain high. Tanger's blended average base rental rates -- excluding eight leases undergoing remerchandising projects -- rose 11.7% annually last quarter. With the inclusion of those eight leases, its rental rates rose 7.9%. Its consolidated occupancy rate was at 96.1% at the end of the quarter. Tanger also hiked the average base rent by 10.1% on renewed leases in the first six months of the year -- indicating that it can still raise the rent while keeping occupancy rates well above 95%. Source: Tanger Factory Outlets. However, the bears will note that Tanger's occupancy rate actually dipped from 96.2% in the first quarter and 96.9% in the prior year quarter -- indicating that Tanger isn't as immune to the retail downturn as some bulls believe. Moreover, increased costs of remerchandising and building new centers are expected to cause its earnings to fall 13% this year before rebounding next year. Target currently pays a forward yield of 4.3%. It spent just 48% of its earnings and 28% of its free cash flow on those payments over the past 12 months, so it has plenty of room for future hikes. Tanger pays a forward yield of 5.7%, which used up 88% of its earnings and 213% of its free cash flow over the past 12 months. Those ratios seem high, but we should remember that REITs are required to pay out most of their earnings as dividends. Target currently trades at 12 times earnings, which is lower than the industry average of 19 for discount stores. Tanger has a slightly higher P/E of 16, but that's also well below the average P/E of 35 for retail REITs. Target looks cheap, but Tanger's business of renting out stores in its outlet centers -- a niche market which is hard for Amazon to touch -- is more dependable than Target's superstore model. Tanger could be hit by lower occupancy rates, but Target could be squeezed by Wal-Mart and Amazon on the superstore, e-commerce, and grocery fronts -- which makes the former a much safer income play than the latter.

    Better Dividend Stock: Target vs. Tanger Factory Outlets -- The Motley Fool

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,09212017,Fool,09142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Many investors are avoiding the retailing industry as if it were an out-of-favor strip mall. Wall Street is worried that the latest shopper traffic slowdown is just the beginning of a long, painful period of adjustment while physical stores lose relevance amid a surging digital sales channel. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock hasn't been caught up in that pessimism. Yes, shares are just barely in positive territory this year, compared to an 11% gain for the broader market. But the warehouse retailer enjoys a large and, in my view, justified premium over its peers. Image source: Getty Images. Costco is valued at 28 times the past year of earnings. That's well above the broader market's P/E of 24, and its also more expensive than the valuation of Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT), or Kroger (NYSE:KR). The same trend is true with respect to sales. Investors are paying 0.59 times revenue for Costco, compared to about 0.5 times for Wal-Mart and Target and less than 0.2 times for Kroger: Company Price/Earnings Price/Sales Costco 28 0.59 Wal-Mart 19 0.5 Target 13 0.48 Kroger 12 0.17 Data source: YCharts. Investors are forking over extra money for this business in part because it is growing so quickly. Comparable-store sales were up 5% in its most recent quarter, while Wal-Mart and Target were stuck at below 2% and Kroger just barely achieved any comps gain. That performance gap at existing locations also translates into a brighter picture for the store base. Whereas many retailers are looking at closing underperforming locations, Costco launched 29 new warehouses over the past year. Its subscription-based business model is another factor that supports Costco's premium valuation. Most of the retailer's earnings are generated through membership sales, not product sales. And because an overwhelming portion of members renew each year, that revenue stream leaves the company far less exposed to shifts in shopping behavior. A growing member base helped fee income cross $2.6 billion last year, up from $1.6 billion in 2010. That stability helps explain why Costco's earnings continue trending higher even as peers suffer through wide swings and generally weaker growth. COST Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts. Finally, Costco's premium reflects the substantial dividends that the company has paid out. Sure, the stated 1.2% annual yield is far below the 4% you could get with a Target investment or the over 2% paid by Kroger or Wal-Mart. Costco pays far higher dividends than its quoted yield implies, though. It recently issued a $7-per-share special dividend, which by itself equated to an almost 4% return. And while management calls these events ""special"" dividends, they happen with some regularity. The warehouse giant issued a $5-per-share bonus to investors two years ago and another $7-per-share dividend in 2012. Altogether, it has sent over $8 billion to its shareholders in special dividends in the past five years. These operating and financial advantages make Costco a less risky investment than many of its retailing peers, but the retailer still faces threats, including from e-commerce specialists. The good news for investors is that, because subscription fees allow it to keep its gross profit margin consistently low, there's less concern over a pricing war driving profitability far lower. Instead, the biggest risk to Costco's business is that shoppers will begin concluding that the membership just isn't worth the annual fee. With subscriber rates ticking up to a stellar 90% this past quarter, there's no evidence of that happening today. ","

Joe Tenebruso,09212017,Fool,09142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. No discussion of e-commerce can take place without mentioning the mighty Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company dominates online retail -- and, increasingly -- retail as a whole. Yet there are other businesses with exciting e-commerce growth prospects that you may be less familiar with. Read on to learn about three of the best available in the market today. Wal-Mart has stepped into the e-commerce ring to battle Amazon head on -- and it doesn't plan on backing down. Image source: Getty Images. It's not often that Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) finds itself in the position of underdog, but that's exactly what it is when it comes to competing against Amazon in e-commerce. Recently, however, the retail behemoth has made some aggressive moves to close the gap. Wal-Mart purchased e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion in August 2016. It then quickly moved to install Jet.com CEO Marc Lore as head of its U.S. e-commerce operations. Since that time, Wal-Mart has scooped up several smaller online retailers, including ShoeBuy.com, outdoor gear retailer Moosejaw, women's apparel seller ModCloth, and most notably, upscale men's clothing brand Bonobos. Yet, importantly, the majority of Wal-Mart's growth is coming organically through Walmart.com. Earlier this year, it began offering free shipping on orders over $35, which forced Amazon to lower its free-shipping threshold. Wal-Mart is also aggressively courting online merchants in an attempt to weaken Amazon's network of third-party sellers while fortifying its own. These efforts are already paying hefty dividends: Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales surged 63% in the first quarter and 60% in the second. If Wal-Mart can maintain anything close to this rate of growth in the coming years, it could become a legitimate competitor to Amazon in the e-commerce arena -- and generate handsome profits for investors along the way. Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is another company that's making its mark on e-commerce. But it's not an online retailer; instead, the Canadian software maker excels at helping smaller merchants compete more effectively with their larger rivals. Shopify provides cloud-based solutions to more than 500,000 small and medium-sized businesses. It helps users sell their goods across multiple channels, including: Additionally, Shopify performs vital back-office services such as inventory management, sales tracking, and payment processing. It's a comprehensive commerce platform that, along with a growing list of integrated third-party apps, provides users pretty much everything they need to run their business. Growth investors will also like that Shopify is just scratching the surface of the massive market it serves. In its IPO filing, the company noted that approximately 10 million merchants with fewer than 500 employees operate in its key geographies, with 46 million such merchants worldwide. Thus, Shopify currently has only 5% penetration in its core markets and about 1% of its total addressable market. With so much growth still to come, Shopify offers investors the prospect of exponential growth in the years ahead. One company that has a leg up on Amazon in many foreign markets is MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI). It's the leading e-commerce platform in Latin America, and its MercadoPago subsidiary is the No. 1 online payment service in the region. MercadoLibre's growth has recently outpaced Amazon's, despite serious economic turmoil in several of its major markets. Its second-quarter revenue soared 59% to $317 million (65% on a currency-neutral basis). Helping to drive this impressive growth was a 23% jump in unique buyers and a 41% surge in items sold. Moreover, payment volume rocketed higher by 74%. More people conducting more transactions on its network -- that's a powerful trend that should continue to drive MercadoLibre's results for many years to come. Only about 62% of the more than 605 million people in Latin America are currently connected to the internet. That's up from approximately 50% in 2013, but still far below the nearly 90% internet penetration rates seen in North America. Moreover, less than 3% of total retail sales in Latin America were conducted online in 2016, compared to more than 8% in the U.S. So, like Shopify, MercadoLibre has a long runway for growth still ahead. As such, investors who buy shares in 2017 could see strong gains in the decade to come. ","

Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) has been a hot stock on the market for nearly four years, but it has never quite lived up to investors' lofty expectations. Revenue growth has been easy to come by as big customers like Walmart and Amazon find value in the company's products. But Plug Power hasn't turned those deals into profits and is giving away shares to its customers to get a deal done, which will end up reducing current investors' upside if the agreements are successful. If you like Plug Power for its fuel cell potential, Ballard Power Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:BLDP) may actually be a better play. It has much better financials and some of the same end markets as Plug Power. And it isn't giving the company away to make sales. Image source: Ballard Power Systems. The biggest flaw at Plug Power over the past four years has been its enormous cash burn. The company has lost tens of millions of dollars on its operations, and net losses can be counted in the hundreds of millions. You can see below that Ballard Power Systems isn't making money, but it's in a much better financial position. And it has grown more as well. PLUG Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. For years, Plug Power has teased investors with huge contracts to sell its products, and for years, its financials have lagged Ballard Power Systems. Plug Power needs to prove it can make money to get my investment dollars. So far, it hasn't. Ballard Power Systems has sales and partnerships with companies who make buses, trains, trucks, forklifts, drone makers, and even major automakers. It has a diverse pipeline of products as a result, despite the fact that over half of its revenue last year came from just three customers. Plug Power's business is becoming increasingly reliant on Walmart, which accounted for 34.1% of its business in 2016. As the Amazon deal ramps, the two retailers will likely account for well over half of Plug Power's revenue. That's not a diverse customer base, and since forklifts are the main product being served, it's not a diverse set of products Plug Power is supplying. If Plug Power is losing money constantly, how does it manage to stay in business? It keeps going to investors with its pockets turned out. You can see below that in the last five years, the number of shares outstanding has gone up nearly 6 times. Ballard's share count is up as well, but the dilution investors will see is far smaller because the company is closer to profitability. PLUG Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Investors interested in getting into the fuel cell business should really look at Ballard Power Systems over Plug Power. It doesn't get as much attention, but it has far superior financials and a diverse pipeline of products in development. If fuel cells take off, I think Ballard is set to profit handsomely.

"Jason Hall, Chuck Saletta, and Reuben Gregg Brewer",09212017,Fool,09142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When you think of stocks and innovation, most of the time a technology company comes to mind. However, almost every successful company has to prove that it has the ability to innovate at some point, often in surprising and unexpected ways. That can be just as true of a century-old food company as of a Silicon Valley start-up. We asked three of our contributing investors to offer up a company that they think could make for a solid investment right now that's also showing its innovation chops. They gave us two that may surprise you -- 125-year-old food purveyor Hormel Foods Corp (NYSE:HRL) and low-cost retail behemoth Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) -- and one that's more of a typical innovator in First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR). Innovation can come from surprising places. Image source: Getty Images. Ready to add some innovation to your portfolio? Keep reading to learn what makes these three stocks innovative leaders and more importantly, why they're worth investing in today. For example, after Hormel bought the boring old Skippy peanut butter brand, it launched P.B. Bites. That shifted peanut butter from a spread to a snack that you can carry around with you. After buying Wholly Guacamole, it expanded the line with layered dips. It's also created an entire line of foods, called Vital Cuisine, to help patients dealing with serious medical issues meet their unique nutrition needs. Those are just a few recent examples. Innovation is actually a stated corporate goal and one piece of the equation that's allowed Hormel to increase its dividend annually for an incredible five decades. HRL Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts. That dividend, meanwhile, is part of the reason why now is a good time to look at Hormel. The food industry is under pressure today from changing consumer tastes, and that's pushed Hormel's shares down to the point where they yield around 2% -- toward the high end of its yield range over the past 15 years. It's a nice yield and a fair price for those looking to find innovation outside of the technology space. Chuck Saletta (Wal-Mart): Retailing giant Wal-Mart may not be the first company that comes to mind when you think of innovation, but right now it's giving you good reason to consider it. The world's largest retailer is clearly flexing its innovative muscle as it creates a commanding omni-channel shopping experience. Last month, Wal-Mart reported strong earnings and raised its guidance, thanks to the enhanced integration of its stores with its online presence. Image source: Getty Images. A key driver of that current strength and the optimism for the future is the way Wal-Mart is leveraging its recent acquisition of online retailer Jet.com to enhance its online presence. The company is now piloting things like employee delivery of online purchases and same-day pickup in store, which helped boost online sales by 60% compared to last year. Much of that online growth is incremental compared to its physical store results, which is helping fuel more effective use of Wal-Mart's physical presence. Wal-Mart is delivering end-to-end profitable growth by leveraging both its physical stores and its online marketplace. It is showcasing the potential that a strong omni-channel retail strategy can have to enable physical retailers to not only survive but also thrive in today's era of digitized shopping. That ability to profitably innovate for growth, combined with Wal-Mart's still reasonable price of around 17 times expected earnings, makes it worth considering owning today. Jason Hall (First Solar, Inc.): Solar panel manufacturers have made huge leaps forward over the past decade. Panels are cheaper and more efficient today than they've ever been, helping make solar more cost-competitive with traditional power sources like coal and natural gas. And panel makers continue to push the limits, squeezing more and more efficiency, even as costs fall. Image source: Getty Images. One of the leaders is First Solar, with its thin-film technology that operates more efficiently in extreme environments that reduce the output from their silicon brethren, making it the preferred product for utility-scale projects. The company isn't resting on its laurels, with plans to bring its latest Series 6 panels to market by mid-2018. First Solar has earmarked over $500 million in spending to bring Series 6 to market -- after having already spent about the same amount in development. The company has a history of innovation, and the odds are good that it will be able to eke out even more efficiency from its technology, helping maintain its edge. But this isn't a risk-free proposition. Investors should acknowledge that Series 6 is still nearly a year from full-scale production, and as my colleague Travis Hoium wrote, ""It's the biggest transition in the company's history."" So while 2018 could be a choppy year as First Solar transitions to Series 6, it should help the company remain the leader in utility-scale solar. If First Solar's big bet on Series 6 pays off, the company will remain well-positioned for many more years of dominance in the solar industry, right when global growth is really taking off.

    3 Innovative Stocks for September -- The Motley Fool

Jeremy Bowman,09212017,Fool,09142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is no friend to brick-and-mortar retailers. The e-commerce giant's breakneck growth and speedy delivery has put dozens of traditional retailers out of business and is squeezing even more. Amazon is the biggest reason for the ""retail apocalypse"" that is causing nearly 10,000 stores across the country to close this year, a new record. That's why it was surprising when department store chain Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) said it would start carrying Amazon products in 10 of its stores earlier this month. Kohl's said it would launch a new ""Amazon smart home"" experience at 10 of its locations in Los Angeles and Chicago areas where customers can learn about and test devices like the Amazon Echo and Fire TV. The store-in-store spaces will also be staffed by Amazon sales associates. Shares rose 5% the day the news came out. The partnership between the two retailers strengthened this week when Kohl's said it would accept returns on Amazon products in 82 of its stores, again in the Los Angeles and Chicago areas, a move that investors again cheered sending the stock up 2% at time of writing. Image source: Kohl's. Kohl's said it would pack and ship all Amazon returns at no charge to customers, essentially accepting them as if they were Kohl's items. It's unclear if Amazon is paying Kohl's for this service, or what Kohl's strategic incentive is here as it's extremely unusual for a retailer to accept a competitor's returns. Richard Schepp, Kohl's chief administrative officer, said, ""This is a great example of how Kohl's and Amazon are leveraging each other's strengths -- the power of Kohl's store portfolio and omnichannel capabilities combined with the power of Amazon's reach and loyal customer base."" Kohl's shares appear to be rising as some suspect that Amazon will make a play to acquire it, but unless that's the retailer's goal, these moves seem incredibly odd, especially as there's no strength of Amazon's that Kohl's is benefiting from by allowing its returns. Plenty of retailers in the past have teamed up with Amazon only to regret it later. Toys R Us declared bankruptcy this week, putting its 1,600 stores and 64,000 employees. While some see a debt hangover from a 2005 leveraged buyout is the primary reason for the company's misfortune, a deal with Amazon in 2000 may have sealed its fate. The toy giant signed a 10-year agreement with Amazon that year, stocking its goods on Amazon and becoming Amazon's exclusive toy seller. Toys R Us also agreed to give up its own website, as ToysRUs.com redirected to Amazon. Toys R Us sued Amazon in 2004 after Amazon began hosting other toy sellers. Toys R Us won and eventually got $51 million from Amazon and the right to terminate the deal, but it had lost valuable time in building its own online business by then. Similarly, Borders, which declared bankruptcy in 2011, made the foolish decision to give its online business over to Amazon, and Target (NYSE:TGT) has feuded with Amazon repeatedly over the years after making the mistake of putting Amazon in charge of its e-commerce site for a decade until 2011. In 2012, Target said it would stop selling Amazon's products like Kindles, and just weeks ago said it would move away from Amazon Web Services after Amazon took over Whole Foods. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) never teamed up with Amazon in any capacity, but the world's largest retailer is doing everything to slow its rival's momentum. It's partnered with Google Express on deliveries, NVIDIA on AI, and called on its tech suppliers to ditch AWS. If even Wal-Mart is sounding the alarm on Amazon, it seems like all of brick-and-mortar retail should be doing the same. Sears Holdings (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ) made a similar decision to Kohl's this summer when it said it would begin selling its Kenmore appliances on Amazon, but that was widely seen as a desperate move. Fresh off its acquisition of Whole Foods, it would be surprising for Amazon to make another blockbuster retail buyout so soon. However, Amazon has a history of moving quickly on new opportunities, and has shown increasing interest in brick-and-mortar with its expansion of its Amazon Books stores, in addition to the Whole Foods deal. Still, Kohl's is not Whole Foods, which gave Amazon several things it badly wanted. Most importantly, Amazon gained a significant presence and a profitable piece of the $800 billion grocery industry that it had been unable to gain itself after a decade of trying. Amazon also got a well-respected brand in organic food and 450 supermarkets across the country, many of which are in high-income neighborhoods where Amazon's best customers live. Kohl's offers none of those things. Instead, its 1,100 stores sell mostly the type of merchandise that is already available on Amazon. So an all-out acquisition would make little sense for Amazon, but a strategic partnership that allows it to sell its gadgets and for customers to make returns would be in its interest. For Kohl's, questions remain about why it would give up its own retail space to its fiercest and fastest-growing competitor. Investors may be cheering the move now, but as the examples above illustrate, they may eventually regret sleeping with the enemy. ","

Motley Fool Staff,09212017,Fool,09142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Their aim was to educate, amuse, and enrich individual investors, and to show how anyone can take control of their own finances. Over 20 years later, their mission remains the same and they've updated the book to reflect what they've learned in the years since, offer up new examples, and add a new chapter on options investing. David and Tom sat down with Motley Fool Chief Investment Officer Andy Cross for a behind-the-scenes talk about the book and the Fool's investment ideology. Check out the video and transcript below to enjoy that conversation. If you want to buy a copy of the book, click here. Transcript ANDY CROSS: TOM GARDNER: Bravo! ANDY CROSS: DAVID GARDNER: I think first of all we were writing for anybody who has some money. Has some capital. The biggest challenge for most Americans and, in fact, most people around the world is just to have some capital, to have some savings. And you want to figure out what you should do with it. ANDY CROSS: Tom? TOM GARDNER: I like that answer. ANDY CROSS: Nothing to add? TOM GARDNER: I think that's a great answer. DAVID GARDNER: TOM GARDNER: I think there are a lot of great investment books out there, and there are a lot of great business books out there. Not so many of them are actually built around two things. Long-term thinking. That's what The Motley Fool is all about. We're not interested in what's going to happen in the next three months to the stock market. We don't talk about it. If we do, it's just a sideline comment to answer in an interview. Somebody's urgent need to know what the S&P 500 will do in a short-term period of time. It's just not interesting to us. So we're always looking at businesses and we think the subject is tremendously fun and interesting. I mean, here we are on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). It's been an unbelievable investment. It sits in front of the faces of billions of people who are using this service and it's been an incredible investment. In fact, I think it will continue to be an incredible investment, but that's just an example of how we think Foolishly, which is that so many of the greatest investments are right in front of us. They're our monitor away from us, now, as the world gets even more convenient. As everything gets delivered into our house for free, we're getting a showcase of great companies coming into our house on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. And if we take our savings and invest in them, and do a little bit of business research with The Motley Fool to get it done, I think the long-term results are very pleasing. Much better than sitting your cash in the bank. ANDY CROSS: DAVID GARDNER: Yes, and in 20 years Mark Zuckerberg will be Jeff Bezos's age. ANDY CROSS: Isn't that amazing? TOM GARDNER: DAVID GARDNER: I'm not sure we have the still image that would prove that, but I believe that spiritually or directionally... TOM GARDNER: Through the miracle of modern technology, I believe we can produce that photo. ANDY CROSS: DAVID GARDNER: First of all, I think the access to information is much better than ever before. I mean, 20 years ago was far better than 20 years before that, but it was a much different world back then. I remember, for example, Starbucks would not allow investors to listen in on its quarterly conference calls. And for stock market investors, you know this, and if you're not one yet, we hope you read the book and become one. You'll discover that you can actually listen in on the conference calls of every single public company and hear the CEO answer questions on a quarterly basis. Companies report their earnings four times a year. You can listen to it. But 20 years ago you couldn't. Even though technically and importantly for us, you're a part owner of the company when you buy the stock, you were not allowed ... you were barred ... from listening to conference calls. [It's] shocking to think that that was true 20 years ago. But now things are much better and that's a quick example of how much better the information is. I mean, these days you can find CEO interviews with almost any CEO of any company in America probably taped within the last year for free on YouTube. TOM GARDNER: Twenty years ago you were going to the card catalog at your university or local library. The other thing that's happened is costs have come way down. Transactions at the discount brokers (the few that existed 20 years ago) ran $50 or more per transaction and oftentimes it was actually just related to how many shares you bought, so the price went even higher. And so those costs — the cost of information. David mentioned how much information there is. Just what you would have to pay to get the S&P stock guide. That cost a lot of money and it came once a month. Now it's free and updated in real time. Most of this is very good. A tremendous amount of information and very inexpensive access to the markets is 95% good. It's 5% bad if somebody is using that information and those low-cost transactions to day trade. To get frenetic with their approach. Those people end up with a really difficult time with their tax accountants at the end of each year and also subpar returns. ANDY CROSS: So for someone who might be relatively new to investing [and just starting out], is it much different than [it was] 20 years ago? Just the act of starting out? How do I think about starting to invest? I maybe have some capital, David, in my account. I want to start saving and investing the Motley Fool way. How do I...? DAVID GARDNER: Yeah, it's so simple. TOM GARDNER: Come on, Andy! Come on! You can do this. DAVID GARDNER: You have started, right, as our chief investment officer? ANDY CROSS: My kids are just starting right now... TOM GARDNER: OK, that's awesome. How old are your children? ANDY CROSS: And by the way, we have two-and-a-half and six. I said five the other day. TOM GARDNER: What is the two-and-a-half-year-old doing? ANDY CROSS: By the way, I said five the other day on another Live Chat and I got... TOM GARDNER: And you got in trouble at home. I heard that. But what is the two-and-a-half-year-old doing to advance their investment portfolio? ANDY CROSS: They are helping me identify shows on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). TOM GARDNER: Awesome! That's so good. That's so good. ANDY CROSS: A lot of toy research. There's a lot of educational toy research. TOM GARDNER: You know, so much of Netflix is kids watching, and if parents watch their kids, they can find some great stocks, and there you go. Sorry. David G, how do you get started? ANDY CROSS: Like just starting out. Is it much different than it was 20 years ago? Easier? Tom mentioned just like... DAVID GARDNER: Yes. What you want to do is you want to open up an account, and put some money in the account, and then figure out what stock or stocks you want to buy first and then start. ANDY CROSS: What about someone who doesn't know anything about investing? Like they have money. Maybe they have some index funds. Maybe they have a 401(k) that's invested in index funds, but they want to do better. If they're scared, how do we talk to them? TOM GARDNER: I would say the first thing to do is to take the amount of money you have and type that into a calculator or an Excel spreadsheet and just run that forward growing 2% a year or growing 8% a year. ANDY CROSS: And 2% is barely what cash gets nowadays. TOM GARDNER: Yeah. And you're not really getting that, even, today. But just run it forward at 2%. Run it forward at 8%. That's scenario one. Scenario two would be now just add a little bit of money each year. That's going to have to take you to an Excel spreadsheet. It's going to take a little bit of time, but what you're going to see is, ""Oh my gosh, I'm leaving so much savings, so much capital on the table by not investing."" And those who begin investing early on are the people at the age of 40 who are really choosing their career. Because they have this savings to be able to make the tough choices. If they don't enjoy their job. If they want to go start a company. If they want to go back to school. All those options are open if you get started [investing early], and I think the simplest, first step is just to run compounding on a calculator. If that sounds odd and you don't know what to do just Google it, and you can figure out exactly how to run forward your savings and see what happens. And you're going to see the curve begin to go like this in your investment portfolio, and it's just going like this if you leave it in savings. ANDY CROSS: So thinking about that, Tom, there are lots of ways to be able to do that. Why is it we think investing it in public companies gives the investor the best opportunity to hit that hockey stick curve over the long term? Over 20 years? TOM GARDNER: It's easy to get worried about where the market's going and what's happening without even understanding what the market is. The market is a reflection of all of these businesses, in the U.S. and around the world, trying to serve customers something better at a lower price or at a reasonable price. An attractive price. DAVID GARDNER: Motorola (NYSE:MSI). TOM GARDNER: Motorola. And what was happening on your Motorola flip phone? Could you text? DAVID GARDNER: No. It was just a phone. TOM GARDNER: Yeah, it was just a phone. DAVID GARDNER: I was a big Palm fan. ANDY CROSS: Yup. DAVID GARDNER: The Palm Pilot. Loved my Palm Pilots for about 10 years, but yeah. Things are so much better. TOM GARDNER: And so what you're looking for, and what David has done so well in his investment approach is finding these emerging companies that have the potential to change the way we live, and to invest in them, and not worry about what's going to happen in the next six months or even a year and a half. Just put your money in as if you're putting it into a bank. David's cost basis in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is $3.21 a share. The stock is at $950. So what happens when you do that again and again, and is it really obscure, difficult, complex, Greek, alphanumerics trying to figure this all out? No. It's looking at Amazon and saying, ""I believe in their future. I'm going to get a diversified portfolio and I'm just going to let that business go."" ANDY CROSS: DAVID GARDNER: I developed my own style called Rule Breaker Investing. We now have the new version of the book updated with some more information about that, and I have a podcast called Rule Breaker Investing. But I didn't know all that. That wasn't in my head, necessarily, back when we first wrote the book. And just to be quick about it, I would say that I'm looking specifically for companies that are disrupting industries. Making new products and services possible that weren't before. That serve the world better. Something like Netflix which wasn't around 20 years ago. It was close. Somewhere around there. Something like Priceline (NASDAQ:BKNG) which has been a tremendous stock. Name Your Own Price is how it started, but just the whole idea of e-commerce, frankly. That you could book tickets or buy stuff on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Those things were barely coming into existence when we first wrote. But as Tom and I, and many others here at the Fool (you, as well, Andy) certainly we've all kind of gotten more and more aware of finding world-beating companies. I think we were probably much more about math back then and not thinking as much about what companies do or who is running them. ANDY CROSS: Right. DAVID GARDNER: And today it's so important to all three of us that we be invested in companies that we admire. That we think do good things and that are run by excellent people. ANDY CROSS: Tom, let's double-click a little bit on that. I mean, not physically double-click but just talk about it. Who runs the businesses? One change we made in the book is we talk a little bit more about culture and the people who run the [companies]. How has that shaped so much of your investing thinking, specifically around cultures of organizations and leadership teams over the last few years? TOM GARDNER: It's another example of why there's so much more information today, because of a service like Glassdoor, where you can go and read what anonymous past and present employees think of the organization that they're working for or worked for. And of course every company is going to have some negative reviews that are out there, but you're going to get a really good read on how that business is run. So almost if you get a little bit beyond the rating and just read what people are identifying as the problems, you get a well-rounded view of that business. What their external challenges are and how they're facing them as a team. So I think it starts for us with the CEO and with the board, and the founders, and how much stock they own. Because if they own very little stock, maybe they're not as aligned with our long-term interests. If they have a lot of stock holdings in that business, they're like us. They're long-term shareholders and they want to see that business succeed. So we start with looking at the insider ownership of the business. Study who the CEO is. Look at what the culture looks like. Those are the engines, often, of long-term growth. You can have a great product or a great competitive advantage for a two-year period, but you need to have a culture of innovation that's going to drive change over the next 20 years to win big. DAVID GARDNER: And we're speaking to people who today have tapped into Facebook Live. Hi there! And it's ironic, perhaps, that one of our best stocks has been... Tom, one of your best picks in the last 10 years has been Facebook, and so what you just said about finding great people that own a lot of stock, we happen to be using a service right now to reach people through one of your best stock picks, and one that really explains how we think about investing at The Motley Fool. ANDY CROSS: We are so focused on understanding the businesses that we're investing in. Investing in these for many years. Not trading [them around]. We talk a lot about this in the book — the power of buying and holding. David, you go from Amazon at a cost basis of $3.21... TOM GARDNER: Down to the penny. ANDY CROSS: ...to where it is today. You only get that by holding. Just talk a little bit about that. That's been such a big part of our investing style. And Tom, [you], as well, too. Just the discipline of buying and holding these positions and why that's so important. DAVID GARDNER: TOM GARDNER: A pretty good year. DAVID GARDNER: Yeah. It tripled. It was the number one stock on the S&P 500 and then a lot of people thought, ""Well, it tripled last year so clearly it can't keep this up."" And the stock is up another 60% on top of that this year. So from 2005 to 2017, we've held it 12 years so far. We continue to hold. It's been an absolutely outstanding company. Forget about investment. But the investment, itself, is up 25x in value, but you had to go from $6 to $40 to $5. Sit there at $28 for five years. That's a great example of what we're talking about. TOM GARDNER: Would you buy NVIDIA now? DAVID GARDNER: Of course. ANDY CROSS: Tom? TOM GARDNER: Absolutely. Artificial intelligence. I mean, here's the beauty of the great businesses and something that I've learned from David over the years, and that is that the way to really look at the market is oftentimes the great businesses are just going to get better as years pass. You get too obsessed with what's happening with the stock price, naturally, because that's the easy score to see. It's harder to see how the business is doing if you haven't learned how to read financial statements. But if we can train ourselves to look and say, ""Gosh, I still believe in this company. The stock may go down 30% next year. Who cares? I'm looking five and 10 years forward."" Unfortunately you don't get 25-baggers as David did with NVIDIA in a year, or in two years. In fact, you get a 25-bagger over 12 years and you have multiple times where either you're down, or it's flat for long periods of time. And that patience across a diversified portfolio is going to give you enough of those huge winners that you're going to crush what it gets you to leave your money in the bank, or buying bonds, or buying real estate. You're going to crush those returns with the stock market over a 10, 20, or 30-year period. ANDY CROSS: TOM GARDNER: The stock was down 85% in 2008 and 2009. ANDY CROSS: And you only get the returns if... DAVID GARDNER: And I think the key to that is just that Starbucks as an actual business... If you were to look at its numbers year by year (the growth in sales, the growth in profits), it's been pretty steady. It's been remarkably strong... TOM GARDNER: Incredible. DAVID GARDNER: Although, then looking back 10, 20 years you look back at this and you're like, ""Wow. It kind of looked like that."" Things smooth out over time and if you find great companies it does go like that. And when you're tied to that and making money with it, you have a better life. TOM GARDNER: Let's do a little math now and let's put it in the context of what really happens in investing. Let's say you have 30-stock portfolio. You're going to have five, six, or seven of those investments that fail. You're going to [think], ""I thought Fitbit was going to be successful and it's down 40% for me."" So let's just take Fitbit and say it's down 40% from the beginning to the life of the investment. Now let's take a 25-bagger. What's the percentage gain of a 25-bagger versus a 40% loss? What is the percentage return of a 25-bagger? DAVID GARDNER: Twenty-four hundred percent. TOM GARDNER: Twenty-four hundred percent. So how much does that negative 40% really impact your overall accumulation of wealth? It's meaningless. Your losers become less relevant every year that they fail. That's the reward for you. But we're not here — The Motley Fool's never going to say that you're going to put together a 20 to 35-stock portfolio and you're just going to have a collection of Starbucks, Facebook, Priceline, and NVIDIA, and it's going to be incredible. No. You're going to have losers in there, as well, but the losers are going to be so small relative to the winners if you have that long-term perspective and you're focused on finding great businesses. Fools around the world have been benefiting together. David and I have learned more than anyone else in our community, or as much as anyone else, from being able to read the work of so many investors around the world. But you get into the community with us and your returns are so superior to the other alternatives. ANDY CROSS: TOM GARDNER: I love it. A few years ago. I love it. Time just flies. I think it was 13 years ago. ANDY CROSS: Exactly. And we have a chapter in the book on small companies. Talk a little bit about the benefit of small companies versus large companies. We talked about wonderful businesses (Facebook, NVIDIA, and Starbucks). But small companies also give an investor an edge that [investors in] larger institutions can't necessarily get. TOM GARDNER: Sure, and David and I both love small companies. I'll just say that the failure rate when you're investing in small companies is higher. You're going to have more companies that don't succeed out of a group of 30. DAVID GARDNER: By the way, I want to just make sure that people know. You've said ""failure"" a couple of times. And from our standpoint we're like, ""We failed. The stock went down."" But I think some people might hear that as like, ""These companies are completely going out of business. Or out of 30 you'll have five or six failures."" But the truth is I don't think we've ever picked a stock that's actually... Well, I've gotten close. TOM GARDNER: Yeah. DAVID GARDNER: I've gotten close. But when we say failures, we often mean that you've lost money. TOM GARDNER: It's rare. DAVID GARDNER: And that for us is a failure. TOM GARDNER: I totally agree. Thank you for clarifying that. But even in the mathematical context (and this will be very unusual to think and hear this), if a stock is down 40% or down 99% for you, if you've got a good, well-rounded portfolio, it's basically the same. It's just a meaningless small amount of money once it's down at that level and stays down. But yes, failure is about losing money when you make an investment. None of us want to see that happen. But if we get way too cautious and don't take any risk in our lives, we stick our money under the bed or we put it in a bank, and that bank is returning us nothing relative to inflation. And we don't get any of the compounding power of investing in entrepreneurship. So when you're thinking about making the best long-term investments you could, you should open some of your portfolio up to smaller companies. And these companies are usually not as well known. And you have to have a team, I think, to do that research. An investment club. Be online with us at The Motley Fool. Be a subscriber of some of our small-cap services. When David mentions NVIDIA, or even when he mentions Priceline, in the very early days of these companies the average person had no idea what they were. They were not relevant businesses. But these are the acorns that can grow into giant oak trees. Starbucks has compounded north of 20% a year since it came public in 1992. It wasn't that well known in 1992 and now everyone knows it. So that's what we're out there looking for, is those great compounding machines that are well run businesses that are just under the radar. I mean, here's one as an example that's a little bit above the radar, now, but I still think (and I think David does as well) it's something David recommended first, and it's a company called iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT). Right now they're [focused on producing vacuum cleaners], but home automation is going to be such a major trend, and if you can get onboard with a great investment and hold it for 10, 15, or 20 years like that... DAVID GARDNER: TOM GARDNER: Still. Incredible. DAVID GARDNER: I'm springing this on you guys, so I wouldn't expect that you would know it, but part of the reason I'm asking this is because I think it's kind of cool to know. There's a public company that not that many people know about that has the No. 1 app that's a stock pick I made about a year ago. I like it just as much today. It's up about 40%. It's been a market beater. The company is Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH). The ticker symbol is MTCH. And the No. 1 grossing app in America today is Tinder. A lot of people don't know that. A lot of people don't know Match Group. I'm not necessarily talking about the stock, but you can be a part owner of it, and darn it (not me) but a lot of you are spending quite a bit of money on Tinder, so you might want to consider Match Group. ANDY CROSS: Thank you for your questions. We have a few coming in. We'll go right to the Facebook Live questions. [Karl] comments, ""Howdy. I ordered it last night."" [Karl], thank you very much. Talking about the book, by the way. Book.Fool.com. You can find more information on the book there. That's Book.Fool.com. Michael asks, ""What's your long-term outlook for big-box retailers like Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), etc.?"" There's a lot of disruption going on in the retail space. Tom, thoughts on the big-box retailers? TOM GARDNER: I have a pretty dim view of the opportunity for those businesses. Again, those locations (and I'll separate Home Depot, actually, out of them). But those businesses were located based on foot traffic, or driving and parking to buy. Now the momentum toward the vast majority of those purchases is to have them mailed directly to the home. And Amazon has built its locations up around distribution. They've built the warehouses out there so that they can get things to residential areas as quickly as possible. It's very difficult for Wal-Mart or Target to effectively compete with Amazon at this point to get stuff into your home at anywhere near the prices that Amazon can. With anywhere near the number of ratings that Amazon customers are putting in. And Amazon Prime is such a powerful subscription feature for them. So that's difficult. Home Depot is a little bit different. This is the way I would think about it if you're thinking about investing in these companies. What do I want to drive out for? And what do I think other people really want to drive out for? Like getting something from Home Depot ordered in? Maybe furniture. I don't know. Wayfair (NYSE:W) is a good competitor to furniture companies, but overall, they're in a very difficult position going forward. I would not be allocating much money there, at all. David G.? ANDY CROSS: David, do you have any response? DAVID GARDNER: I don't have a lot. I like what Tom said. ANDY CROSS: Thank you for that question, by the way, Michael. DAVID GARDNER: I mean, some are different. Not all are the same. Tom gave a good example. What would you drive out for? I would say that Tiffany (NYSE:TIF), which I guess you could say is a retailer. It's definitely a box. I don't know if it's a big box, but I think that's an example of a store that's pretty well defended against the internet. Or Best Buy, surprisingly, has been a very strong company in the last few years. I wouldn't have expected that. In fact, I recommended it some years ago and then sold it disconsolately, and I think it's probably above where I was. So everything is different. It's sometimes good, as Tom said, to getting to know these different ones. I don't necessarily love the general category of things to comment on big-box retailers, per se, because I think every company is a unique situation. But I thought that was an excellent response. I don't think I have many recommendations in so-called big-box retailers. TOM GARDNER: Yeah. DAVID GARDNER: I think my wife owns some Lowe's. It's been a good stock over the years, but that's kind of like Home Depot, the store we'll go out for. ANDY CROSS: Well, the underlying technology behind the e-commerce explosion [brings] a lot of investment opportunities. B2B, business-to-business opportunities there that we're looking at. There's lots of ways in new retail to look at those investment opportunities. TOM GARDNER: The nice thing is that rarely in a case like a Wal-Mart or a Target (NYSE:TGT), in that zone, do things fall apart so quickly. So you do get a long time to look. Institutions own a lot of those businesses. So it's not like everyone's going to run away from them overnight. [And] this is another David point over the years, is you really want to invest in what you think is going to be relevant in the future. Like where is the tide going? So when it comes to retail, I know both of us also love this company, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), that's helping more than a half-million merchants around the world create their online store with a tremendous amount of data analytics. A lot of features that Shopify has put into that. And that feels much more like the future of retail to me than that I'm going to get in my car, drive out to Target, roll a cart around aisle-to-aisle, purchase certain items, stand in line, and then drive home. ANDY CROSS: We just touched a little on this. Doug asks, ""What new technologies are you guys excited about?"" Doug, thank you for the question. DAVID GARDNER: I would say that technology is what's driving business today. It's almost innovation that I'm looking for in every company and every industry. And it takes so many forms it's hard for me to say. I don't want to say something like, ""Artificial intelligence!"" I mean, it's true that artificial intelligence is going to be really important, and so are about 53 other technologies. [Doug, you asked a good question]. I guess if I were just to throw one thing out, it may be a lame answer so far. CAR-T biotechnology answers to cancer. I mean, that's a very profound thing that's happening right now, which is that we're starting to figure out that by taking some blood out of your body, tweaking what goes on there, and putting it back into your body, we can remit cancer. Huge potential there. So companies that are doing that. One was purchased for $11 billion last week by Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD). I have to be fascinated. I think we all are — should be — in the medical gains that are occurring right in front of our very eyes. TOM GARDNER: I'm going to throw one in which is automation. It's so profound. If you see how automobiles are built by Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) versus what we associate with seeing [in] a manufacturing facility for automobiles. Watching the nightly news 15 years ago and what it looked like when they would course through Detroit and show you. What does an Amazon warehouse look like? How are those items picked up, packaged, and mailed out? The level of automation at the enterprise and the commercial side of business is incredible. The level of automation coming into the home for a tiny company like Control4 (NASDAQ: CTRL) that's helping higher-end residential areas to get automated and that's going to roll down. Prices are going to come down rapidly. So I'm not going to be surprised if, I'll say, 10 to 15 years from now you are having meals of Michelin chef quality prepared in your house by a robotic arms that hang over your stove, cook the meal, take all the dishes down to the sink, clean all the dishes for you, and all the IP for that meal was provided by a Michelin star chef and all the food arrived in a box from Amazon Whole Foods or other providers, and it made it very simple to eat in a Michelin star restaurant at home every single night at much less expense than it takes to go out and much more convenient. DAVID GARDNER: Effectively free. Let's just go for it there. Man is only free... TOM GARDNER: You know that's Larry Page. This is Larry Page. Do you want to hear free? This is kind of an interesting one. I don't know to what extent this is actually happening... DAVID GARDNER: I had a different point I was going to make. OK, keep going. TOM GARDNER: No, no. Keep going. DAVID GARDNER: No, no. Keep going. No, no. TOM GARDNER: Sorry. DAVID GARDNER: No, go Larry Page. TOM GARDNER: I know that Google [Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL)] has said one of their aims is to make life free. As free and as inexpensive as possible. So think about this, and I don't know if this has advanced. I just read this like a year or two ago, so I haven't updated [it]. But the idea of a very high-end refrigerator that's free. Because it's just able to read what products you have in your fridge, and need, and it auto-orders them for you. So it's basically that your home refrigerator becomes like an advertising play where they can pop in different products for you that you can try out and they send you the fridge for free. All of a sudden you're getting like a sub-zero fridge for free. I think a lot of these innovations are coming to make our life less expensive, more convenient, and cooler. A lot cooler. ANDY CROSS: And it's also not just the one Michelin chef. Maybe they crowdsource a whole bunch of chefs and put that into the IP. You get a lot of different opinions... TOM GARDNER: All on one plate. ANDY CROSS: All on one plate you basically get your... TOM GARDNER: Yes, I agree. DAVID GARDNER: I just wanted to point out. I agree with Tom's point about automation, and for those who have stayed with us this long on Facebook Live... By the way, lunch hour is probably ending soon, but this is pretty awesome. I think this is about 15 minutes longer than I thought it was going to be but you're going to really appreciate automation because this is not actually Andy Cross. TOM GARDNER: ANDY CROSS: He is the chief investment officer and always will be, but this is an automated version of him that we've been... TOM GARDNER: We actually don't know which version. DAVID GARDNER: And this has been awesome. It's the blue shirt version. TOM GARDNER: No, but it's doing so well, it's getting confusing to me. DAVID GARDNER: This is the power of automation. TOM GARDNER: This may be the first time the Turing test has been passed. Right here. And we're all witnessing it together. ANDY CROSS: Twenty years. DAVID GARDNER: Thank you, Andy bot. ANDY CROSS: I joined a few months after the publication of the book. It's been 20 years and this is what it comes to. DAVID GARDNER: Save us Andy bot. You're our only hope. ANDY CROSS: Right here. [Bryan] comments, ""I still tell everyone afraid of the stock market to check out The Motley Fool. You guys are the best."" [Bryan], awesome. Thank you so much for the vote of confidence and for the accolade. TOM GARDNER: One thing I'll say about [Bryan's] note there. DAVID GARDNER: It was positive. TOM GARDNER: Yeah, Uncle [Bryan]? Is that what Uncle [Bryan] had to say to us there? DAVID GARDNER: Our estranged Uncle [Bryan]. TOM GARDNER: I mean, what...? DAVID GARDNER: It's a beautiful way to raise your hand. TOM GARDNER: Occasionally we have to remind ourselves of this, but if you've never been to our site or used our services or invested before, just think about our name. What we're attempting to communicate to you. In other ways. Other topics, as well. What we're attempting to communicate is nobody learned this in school. Nobody learned it at a university. There's a whole industry in the financial services category that historically has taken a little bit of advantage, or a lot of advantage of the fact that we didn't learn this subject. So come hang out with Fools. There's no question that you shouldn't ask. We have a wide-open community. And come out and start learning this subject. Fantasy football. Rotisserie baseball. All these things — they're all awesome. They've very fun for people who love those games. This is an incredible game that pays you, and it's not just like one-off. I won my season one year. This pays you year in, year out, compounded returns and it's a game that we're all getting to play. ANDY CROSS: I'll get to one final question and then we'll wrap it up. [Steven] asks, ""Other than The Motley Fool (or maybe part of The Motley Fool that we may not know about), what are some of the sites that you all use for research?"" Tom, you mentioned Glassdoor, which is a wonderful site that helps collect ratings from employees and past employees to catalog that into a score. Some insights that we didn't have 20 years ago and didn't even have five years ago. That's been wonderful. [What are some] other resources that we use, maybe internally and externally for The Motley Fool that we didn't have? I know there's one that we didn't have before. David? DAVID GARDNER: The second one — this kind of reveals how old school I am. But when I want to look up and see how a stock has done, I use BigCharts. I think MarketWatch bought BigCharts. We met the BigCharts founder. TOM GARDNER: I didn't know you were still hanging out on BigCharts. DAVID GARDNER: Absolutely. TOM GARDNER: I didn't know that. DAVID GARDNER: I mean, it's a good, simple site to see how a stock's done over the last 15 years. And when people ask me, ""What was your cost basis on NVIDIA,"" I'm like, ""OK, there it is right there."" And that's the graph. The reason I say it's old school is because I don't even think MarketWatch cares very much about BigCharts anymore. It's still kind of an older interface, but it does what I want it to do. TOM GARDNER: I love it. I'm just going to add one more. It's a site that some people have heard of, but everyone should hear it. DAVID GARDNER: TomGardner.com. TOM GARDNER: It's called Google. It's a real clean site. ANDY CROSS: I'm going to write that one down. TOM GARDNER: When you think about this, it is unbelievable. This is a company worth north of $500 billion. Like $650 billion maybe? Around there? $600 billion? Its main page is just a single entry field. It's unbelievable to think about all the effort that so many people are putting into design sites and I think Google has just that very simple approach. And the reason I mention it is any company you invest in you should Google their CEO. Any mutual fund that you're invested in; you should Google and read about that firm. Any financial advisor you're talking to you should Google and read about that person's firm. You should Google and read what the problems are you could run into with a financial advisor. Unfortunately we still live in a world today where financial advisors are charging fees that aren't transparent; and so anyone, any family member who's working with any financial advisor anywhere, you need to Google and read about that and ask those questions. That could be the biggest capital gain you could get from spending this time with us on Facebook Live right now. So Google is allowing me to learn about every single company I invest in. And I watch on YouTube interviews of almost every CEO of every company that I've recommended and that's alive right now. [It's] something north of 80 companies [and] a video that I can watch and that was never available. ANDY CROSS: TOM GARDNER: Absolutely. ANDY CROSS: David, I'll be remiss because we didn't mention CAPS. We didn't have CAPS.Fool.com 20 years ago. TOM GARDNER: That's not a site. You don't believe in those guys over at CAPS? DAVID GARDNER: I use it all the time. TOM GARDNER: Wait! BigCharts or CAPS? DAVID GARDNER: I didn't want to just [crosstalk]. TOM GARDNER: [Crosstalk] ANDY CROSS: Quick. Thirty seconds. TOM GARDNER: I'm not knocking BigCharts. ANDY CROSS: We didn't have CAPS 20 years ago and I think it's a pretty powerful tool for investors. DAVID GARDNER: I appreciate that. CAPS.Fool.com is an opportunity for you to get started acting on your hunches and understanding what you think about companies. Did you like some of what Tom and Dave talked about? If you like that company you thumb it up. If you don't like the company, thumb it down. You're talking about the stock price. How you think it's doing going forward? You can then see other people. Did they thumb that up or thumb that down? Oh, did the people who thumbed it up, are they consistently right? Kind of like baseball if you're a baseball fan. You get to see the statistics of all the players out there in the field and you can follow the ones that have very high batting averages. TOM GARDNER: It's true merit-based wisdom of the crowd. DAVID GARDNER: So it's an awesome community platform. It's a little bit old school in its design like I guess the other site, MarketWatch I mentioned. We'll be refreshing it, but yeah, I just didn't want to talk about our stuff too much, although Book.Fool.com. I think I need to say that because that's kind of what inspired this event. ANDY CROSS: Tom? TOM GARDNER: I think the books are flying off the shelf. I don't know. Maybe it's showed up as out of stock, even, right now, because there's so many buyers. DAVID GARDNER: Keep talking, Tom. TOM GARDNER: You know, that is a serious upgrade. Or even just this. ANDY CROSS: Exactly. DAVID GARDNER: No, not you. For the last 30 seconds, if you speak you get handed the book and you're talking behind the book. TOM GARDNER: Love it. DAVID GARDNER: So did you want to start closing us, Andy? TOM GARDNER: Full stop. ANDY CROSS: I just want to have one final question if anybody can hear this. It's in my microphone here. TOM GARDNER: This is good. This is good. ANDY CROSS: One final question. ""You guys have been doing this for well more than 20 years. What drives...?"" DAVID GARDNER: Don't make it sound like too big a deal. ANDY CROSS: Sorry, but it's, ""What..."" TOM GARDNER: Start over. ANDY CROSS: ""What do you find the most rewarding about investing that you want to share and [impart] to our viewers?"" DAVID GARDNER: I mean, there are a lot of benefits to investing, including most profoundly, I think, the benefit to your family and yourself. I think I'll just say making money. Making money. I mean, at the heart of it, that's why we're spending this time writing this book and talking about this over the last hour or so. It's because I think a lot of us are here to make some money. Maybe you can give a more inspired answer than I did. TOM GARDNER: No, I liked your answer. ANDY CROSS: Hey, making money... DAVID GARDNER: I want to make sure that people don't forget that that is what we're talking about. ANDY CROSS: That's the game. TOM GARDNER: The best thing about it, for me... Two things. Number one, the people that you meet along the way. We've hung with each other. So maybe that's been OK. But we've met all the people that work at The Motley Fool. So many of our members around the world. The Motley Fool is in so many different countries... DAVID GARDNER: This is such a better answer. TOM GARDNER: ...where we're learning, ""Gosh, I didn't know. In Singapore they don't have capital gains taxes or taxes on dividends."" Wow, that's unbelievable. So the opportunity to meet amazing people and right alongside that the ability to learn about the world that we live in. It's actually a little bit sad, to me, when I see some of the debate that goes on in the world that shows a lack of understanding about innovation. Entrepreneurship. I think there should be much more celebration, not just in the U.S. but around the world, for small business entrepreneurs. That's where most of the job creation is happening. DAVID GARDNER: This is one of the most emotional things I've ever heard a book say. TOM GARDNER: What if I listed...? DAVID GARDNER: I'm sorry. TOM GARDNER: What if I drop the book? DAVID GARDNER: I'm getting emotional myself right now. TOM GARDNER: What if I dropped the book right now below my chin and I was crying? DAVID GARDNER: [Laughs] TOM GARDNER: The reality is... DAVID GARDNER: You are! TOM GARDNER: ...this is completely sincere. The people who are starting businesses. In college. Out of college. The people who are going after some passion that they have and they create jobs and create new solutions. It's an amazing thing that we get to experience in the world and that's what The Motley Fool as a business is about. As a service is about. And that's what we're trying to do in evaluating all the companies that we do around the world. DAVID GARDNER: I agree, and one of the things I've said to that point is there are no great stocks without great companies, so at the heart of any good company... You've heard us mention in the last hour there was somebody who started it. TOM GARDNER: ANDY CROSS: The movie? TOM GARDNER: DAVID GARDNER: The book is talking. ANDY CROSS: I'll pull out one of your little hairs. Well you can't pull out that hair. DAVID GARDNER: All right. All right. Enough. ANDY CROSS: Book.Fool.com. Thank you so much, Tom and David. For those of you who are still around watching this, it's been great. It's a third edition. TOM GARDNER: Don't talk us down like that! It's been a great book! Is it still around? Well, actually you're not talking us down. You're talking down yourself. You're talking to people that are still watching. Like those of us who are still here. ANDY CROSS: Thank you. It's brilliant, yeah. TOM GARDNER: Like lunch hour is over. DAVID GARDNER: We need to tweak Andy bot. We can do better. TOM GARDNER: Which style are you going to tweak? DAVID GARDNER: Just cut this off. TOM GARDNER: Belief in others. I want to modify his belief in other's style. ANDY CROSS: Belief in others? Why so you...? TOM GARDNER: Well, I think the viewers are making a good decision by hanging with us right now. DAVID GARDNER: I thought we were supposed to do outtakes before outtakes? Not during the intakes. ANDY CROSS: Book.Fool.com. Thank you all for watching. We're The Motley Fool. Fool on! TOM GARDNER: Fool on! [End] {%sfr} ","

Tonya Garcia,09212017,MarketWatch,09142017,"Published: Sept 20, 2017 9:45 a.m. ET Timing of toy retailers bankruptcy filing suggests concerns over ‘subdued’ holiday season By Amazon.com Inc., of course, shares some of the blame for Toys ‘R’ Us Inc.’s bankruptcy filing. However, experts say there are a number of reasons why the toy retailer filed chapter 11, some that go back for years indicating the company was in trouble for quite some time. “Certain larger retailers that filed for bankruptcy had burdensome levels of debt resulting from their private equity owners’ uses of financing in acquiring the companies,” tax and advisory firm BDO wrote in a September report. In addition, UBS analysts led by Arpine Kocharyan wrote in a Monday note that a “chapter 11 filing heading into Q4 may be indicative of a subdued holiday outlook by Toys ‘R’ Us.” The toy retailer’s bankruptcy filing was triggered by stricter terms from vendors and suppliers ahead of the holidays, The Wall Street Journal reports. The filing was expected, and comes as all of retail is undergoing a shift to e-commerce and heightened competition from a variety of sources. Toys ‘R’ Us operates about 1,600 stores around the world, and said business would proceed as usual for customers, though some bankruptcy experts warn there could be noticeable changes, like difficulty finding popular toys. Toys ‘R’ Us plans to use the bankruptcy to restructure $5 billion in debt and create “a sustainable capital structure.” The debt, $444 million of which was due next year, stems largely from a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout, led by Bain Capital, KKR & Co.

Read:  Retailers have robust seasonal hiring plans for the holidays despite store closures “Fixed interest and lease payments proved too onerous for these leveraged retailers as sales and margins deteriorated. Other failing retailers will likely opt for leveraged buyouts in the second half of 2017 as private equity-backed retailers struggle to restructure their high levels of debt,” BDO wrote. Toys ‘R’ Us says it has received a $3 billion debtor-in-possession loan that allows it to keep operating. See: Amazon is actually the weakest of the big U.S. retailers On Tuesday, UBS reiterated the impact that holiday season dependency has had on the toy retailer. “Increasing reliance on holiday sales, with profitability tied to successful inventory management, shifting of shopping patterns closer to holiday season and pricing pressures of more diversified discount retailers have made it particularly challenging for traditional specialized retail outlets to do well over time,” the Tuesday UBS note said. UBS says other retailer restructurings or bankruptcies, like that from Sears Holding Corp.

However, Toys ‘R’ Us was slow to go digital. “The fact that Toys ‘R’ Us ceded control of its own online offering to Amazon during a period where e-commerce began to really take off meant that the retailer was always playing catch up with its online competitors,” said Jon Copestake, chief retail and consumer goods analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. “Alarm bells will have been ringing for some time but it took until May this year for an online store revamp to take effect and it is difficult to see how Toys ‘R’ Us could address the structural challenges it faced without reducing its store footprint and significantly changing its proposition,” Copestake said. Other experts note changes in the “economics of toy store retailing” despite far less change in price.

He emphasizes that the interest in electronics isn’t new, but it was once complementary to the toy store buy rather than a replacement for it, like a smartphone or tablet.

This is negative. • RSI (relative strength index) shows that Amazon is overbought and vulnerable. • The chart shows that the current leg up has made a 200% move. Market-leading stocks often trace symmetry in their charts. If such symmetry were to occur in Amazon’s stock, the next major leg up has a shot at being up 200% again. This computes to a target of $3,000 for Amazon stock. A part of the rise in Amazon stock is due to the popularity of FAANG stocks.

Fundamentals of Amazon’s stock Here are the key fundamentals that deserve investors’ attention: • Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a big source of profits for Amazon. Competition is increasing. It is only a matter of time before investors start paying attention to increasing competition. • Amazon is leading its competitors by a wide margin in artificial intelligence. That is the catalyst that may sustain the next leg up in the stock to $3,000. • Revenues of Amazon have the potential to triple before fast growth ends. Revenues of Amazon currently stand at $150.1 billion. A tripling would be $450 billion. Note the revenues of Wal-Mart

                                   stand at $490.01 billion. Can Amazon’s stock price also triple if revenues triple? • Amazon trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 3.16. Wal-Mart, 0.49. Key pointers to help Here are a few pointers to help. • The most important concept to grasp is Arora’s Second Law of Investing: “No one knows with certainty what is going to happen next.” Just think about the emails we are getting from such intelligent investors — they range from very bearish to very bullish on Amazon. • If some gurus tell you he knows what is going to happen with a stock with 100% certainty, consider running away from him as far and as fast as you can. • The second most important concept is to think in terms of probabilities. According to models at The Arora Report, there is about 15% probability that in 10 years Amazon will be a $3,000 stock. There is a 25% probability that in 10 years Amazon will be a $400 stock. If we start calculating probabilities at closer numbers and less duration, probabilities go higher. There is a 35% probability of Amazon hitting $1,300 over the next year. There is a 45% probability of Amazon hitting $700 over the next year. • The third most important concept to grasp is that you do not need to make a binary decision of either selling your position or buying a new position. Whatever you want to do, consider scaling in or scaling out. This simple technique is commonly used by sophisticated investors and is a part of the trade-management guidelines of the ZYX Change Method of Trading and Investing. • In the very short term, Amazon has relieved its overbought condition and is technically poised to go higher. • From a medium- to long-term perspective, Amazon stock is very overbought. Stocks that are overbought tend to be vulnerable to the downside. • Money flows from the momo (momentum) crowd are very positive. • Money flows from the smart money are mild negative at this time. • From a fundamental perspective, Amazon stock is vulnerable and very expensive. What to do now The foregoing should help to guide investors regarding Amazon stock based on their own personal preference, as each investor is different. Here are two common-sense guidelines. • If you are holding Amazon stock, consider taking profits on 10%-20% of your position. Nobody ever went broke by taking profits, whereas unrealized profits can quickly disappear. • If you are not holding Amazon stock, there is simply too much risk in buying it now. If you respect risk, you will miss out on some opportunities, but in the long run you will definitely come out ahead. Consider being patient and wait for a pullback. Of course, we will provide a buy zone and specific instructions on scaling in to our subscribers to buy Amazon stock when it pulls back. We may also provide specific signals when it is time to take more profits. In the future, Amazon stock may become very volatile and investors will need to be nimble.

But the experimentation component is what’s most worthwhile for similar stores to consider—analyzing customer behavior and preferences at a smaller scale to determine what tactics can be scaled up.” Certainly, Nordstrom isn’t the first retailer to come up with the idea of shrinking the size of their stores.

Because people are “overwhelmed with stuff,” she adds, more people “want help choosing things.” Nordstrom shares closed up 6% on Wednesday after reports that it was taking steps to go private. Ed Yruma, managing director of KeyBanc Capital Markets, says this is completely independent of anything to do with Nordstrom Local, though there is one connecting thread. The shares pulled back 2.3% in afternoon trade on Thursday. “What’s clear is that retail is changing and it takes investment and forward thinking to be successful in this new environment,” he said. “Smaller locations offer convenience.” See: Retailers like Wal-Mart and Best Buy are coming up with new strategies to top two-day delivery Cost savings shouldn’t be diminished either, says Greg Portell, lead partner in the retail practice at A.T. Kearney, a strategy and management consulting firm. In addition, smaller spaces allow retailers to squeeze into real estate that’s well-positioned to serve the needs of key demographics. “It’s like finding little cracks in consumer buying habits,” he said. “If you can get yourself into that location, you’re likely to have an upside benefit.” Going forward, more retailers are going to have to think in these terms; not just across platforms like online and bricks-and-mortar, but small, large and everything in between. Technology that can be used for greater personalization in an environment that’s welcoming and overflowing with good customer service is where we’re heading, according to Dominik Prinz, partner at management consultancy cg42. “Digital empathy,” the use of technology to provide the desired level of customized service, is where retail is headed. “Sometimes you want to go to those local stores, sometimes you’re in the city, sometimes you want to go to the superstore. It’s not an either-or decision,” he said. “Retailers are trying to find a way back into the physical space and cure the frustrations that drove people out of the stores in the first place.” The SPDR S&P Retail ETF

Problem was, many of the recipients weren’t expecting babies, much less have baby registries. Hey @amazon Pretty sure you got the wrong gal here since I don't have a baby registry. Or a baby for that matter. pic.twitter.com/o42X88rfap “It better be wine cause I’m definitely not pregnant,” one woman posted on Twitter. “Apparently I’m pregnant because Amazon told me someone bought me something from my baby registry. Who knew,” tweeted another. While some feared the email was a phishing scam, others clicked the alert only to be taken to a broken webpage. Others who actually did have baby registries discovered that, in fact, no items had been purchased from them. Turns out, the confusion was all due to a “glitch” on Amazon’s part. “A technical glitch caused us to inadvertently send a gift alert e-mail earlier today,” Amazon said in a statement. “We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.” While many customers found humor in the situation... Wait. Did other women also get an Amazon email saying that something had been purchased from their baby registry? My ""baby"" is 9 years old!

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc is testing a service to stock groceries directly to customers’ refrigerators as it seeks to take on e-commerce giant Amazon.com. The delivery of groceries and meal kits is emerging as the next frontier of competition among retailers. The world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer said on Friday it is partnering with August Home, a provider of smart locks and  home accessories, to test the service with certain customers in the Silicon Valley. (bit.ly/2ffqqvT) The grocery business is set to be upended through Amazon’s acquisition of upmarket grocer Whole Foods last month and the online retailer is also entrenching itself more deeply in the restaurants business. Amazon Restaurants on Friday teamed up with online food ordering company Olo whose network of restaurants includes Applebee’s and Chipotle. The partnership will help Olo’s restaurant customers connect with Amazon’s delivery services. The competition in the meal-kits business is also heating up. Supermarket operator Albertsons Cos Inc said it would buy meal-kit delivery service Plated while rival Kroger-owned Ralphs started selling meal kits in stores this week. ONE-TIME PASSCODE DELIVERY As part of the test, Wal-Mart delivery persons gain access to a customer’s house using a pre-authorized one-time passcode and put away groceries in the fridge and other items in the foyer. Homeowners would receive notifications when the delivery is in progress and could also watch the real-time process from their home security cameras through the August Home app. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has been exploring new methods of delivery and in June said it was testing using its own store employees to deliver packages ordered online.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Maria has devastated the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, another blow to its already precarious economic situation. Puerto Rico’s government owes $72 billion to bondholders, and an additional $50 billion in pension obligations to teachers and almost all other government employees. In May, it filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. The following are responses from multinational companies on how they are dealing with the aftermath of Maria: WAL-MART STORES INC Phillip Keene, Wal-Mart’s director of corporate communications, said, “Like many businesses, we are working to assess any damage to our facilities as we are safely able to access them and working to connect with our associates to assess what their needs are so we can support as appropriate. We are planning to open facilities very thoughtfully, starting with limited hours at our Sam’s Club near San Juan, perhaps as soon as Sunday. One of our Amigo stores has already reopened under limited hours on the south side of San Juan as of this morning. “Walmart operates 48 retail facilities, a distribution center and a satellite headquarters in Puerto Rico, supported by more than 14,700 associates across the Island. At this time, we are trying to best understand the impacts of Hurricane Maria to Puerto Rico, but it’s been a slow process due to widespread power outages and communication issues. We have activated the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the Walmart Home Office in Bentonville, Arkansas, to support our associates in Puerto Rico. The EOC is Walmart’s centralized platform for crisis coordination. In the EOC, we work directly with logistics, store operations and other teams within the business to ensure we’re aligned on our support plans. “We have been in contact with leaders on the Island and continue to be in regular contact with FEMA and the American Red Cross. Our first priority is, and continues to be, the safety of our associates - taking care of them and their families. We are working rapidly to account for our associates, through store and HR leadership as well as social media, local radio and other channels. These efforts will continue. “Although our normal assessment process has been impeded a bit by road conditions and flooding, we are currently working to identify the status of our facilities on the Island. Our Merchandising, Replenishment, Supply Chain and Logistics teams are working to ensure we have critical supplies and product headed to the island via shipping vessels that are slated to depart as soon as Friday (Sept. 22). This is in addition to the shipment of water that was sent toward the island earlier this week, which is currently staged at sea awaiting clearance to safely enter port. We will continue to assess the right flow and mix of merchandise and supplies to send to Puerto Rico in the coming days and weeks.” Tammy Hull, communications manager at Eli Lilly, said: “Lilly has two manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico as well as an affiliate office and sales team. Safety of our employees is our primary concern. The small team of employees who stayed onsite during the storm are safe. We are still accounting for all employees, which is a slow process due to power and communications loss on the island. We are currently assessing our facilities to determine if any damage occurred. Lilly follows emergency procedures that enable us to maintain adequate inventory at our manufacturing sites around the world to ensure a reliable supply of medicine for patients.” Kristen Davis, senior manager of corporate communications at Amgen, said: “Our first priority is the safety of our colleagues and their families. The vast majority of staff at our Amgen Manufacturing Limited (AML) site in Juncos were sent home prior to Maria making landfall, with only a limited number of colleagues remaining on site to monitor operations. At the moment, we are still working to determine the safety of our people and are hopeful that all will be well. At the same time, we are executing on a comprehensive and well-rehearsed business continuity plan for the site itself. Based on what we know at the moment, we are confident there will be no product supply disruptions for patients around the world. Of course, we will work diligently to ensure drug supply for patients in Puerto Rico and to return our operations in Puerto Rico to normal as quickly as possible.” Michele Meixell, head of external communications and affairs at AstraZeneca, said: “Given the early nature of the disaster, we are still in the process of gathering more information, but I can tell you what we know so far. Our Puerto Rico employee base consists of approximately 250 colleagues. This represents both field-based employees as well as those working in our manufacturing facility located in Canovanas. “Right now our number one priority remains the safety and health of our employees and their families. At this point, it’s still early to understand the full impact to our site, but we have started the process to assess our facility. The site does have backup power capabilities and we have a storm crew in limited operation right now until employees are able to safely return to work. In advance of the storm, the facility took appropriate precautions and we have business continuity plans in place to ensure our medicines continue in production. “We do not anticipate interruption in supply at this time. I also want to point out that while our Puerto Rico site is of critical importance to our organization, we have manufacturing facilities all over the globe producing medicines, so in terms of overall business impact, this is important to clarify. “Regarding the safety of our employees, all non-essential employees had been sent home prior to the storm earlier this week. This is a critical time for our employees to be safe and with their families and we will stay in touch with them in various ways that work best for them in this time of need. We stand behind those impacted by Hurricane Maria and AstraZeneca is committed to helping the people and employees affected by all of these recent natural disasters. We will continue to assess the needs of both our employees and those impacted by the storm and once we have more clarity on their needs, provide support and aid however we can.” Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion said, “We’re continuing to assess the situation in Puerto Rico.” ","

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"More than a third of migrant fishermen in Thailand clearly were victims of trafficking over the past five years, and even more workers in the industry were possibly trafficked as well, according to a report published Thursday. Routinely underpaid and physically abused, three-quarters of migrants working on Thai fishing vessels have been in debt bondage, working to pay off an obligation, said the study by the anti-trafficking group International Justice Mission (IJM). Thailand's multibillion-dollar seafood sector came under fire in recent years after investigations showed widespread slavery, trafficking and violence on fishing boats and in onshore food-processing factories. The politically unstable country, which is under military rule, has vowed to crack down on trafficking and recently introduced reforms to its fisheries law. The IJM study of 260 fishermen from Myanmar and Cambodia found 38 percent were clearly trafficked and another 49 percent possibly trafficked. Only 13 percent reported fair labor conditions at sea and no exploitative recruitment, it said. Three-quarters reported working at least 16 hours a day, and only 11 percent said they were paid more than 9,000 Baht ($272 U.S.) per month, the legal monthly minimum wage in Thailand. One fisherman was quoted in the report as saying he was held in debt bondage, owing 20,000 Baht ($604) to his brother, who worked as a supervisor overseeing fishermen. In debt to brother ""I fear for my life as he has killed in front of me before,"" he was quoted as saying. ""I don't dare to run. He would kill my children."" Field researchers surveyed the 260 fishermen in 20 Thai fishing localities in 2016, collecting information on fishing jobs they had held in the previous five years. Thailand, the world's third-largest seafood exporter, had more than 42,000 active fishing vessels as of 2014, and more than 172,000 people were employed as fishermen, the study said. The study was funded by the Walmart Foundation, the charitable arm of giant U.S. retailer Walmart. With release of the study, the foundation announced a grant to help the IJM improve law enforcement efforts against human trafficking in the Thai fishing industry. Neither Walmart nor the charity would specify the value of the grant.

(AMZN) may be the king of e-commerce, but when it comes to the best prices and the speediest shipping, it's Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) that takes the crown. That’s according to BMO Capital Markets, which did a deep dive into pricing and shipping costs at Amazon, Costco and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and found that in the 16 categories analyst Kelly Bania and her team studied, the warehouse retailer had prices 7% lower than on Amazon's website. Shipping took an average of 4.5 days per each item compared to 5.5 at Amazon. Wal-Mart and its Jet.com owned e-commerce website had prices that were 18% higher than Amazon's and took a lot longer to ship with the average being 9.8 days. When taking into account Amazon’s Prime membership program that offers discounts and free two-day shipping, BMO Capital Markets found Amazon prices were 4% lower than Wal-Mart when shipping wasn’t included and 10% cheaper when all of the fees were factored in, reported Barron’s, which covered the research report. (See also: Why Amazon Is Losing to JD.com and Wal-Mart.) “With Costco generally beating Amazon in both price and shipping, it’s a reminder that Amazon has strong competition for all those musing about antitrust concerns, especially ones with a strong membership program like Costco's. And with Walmart investing heavily in eCommerce, we think it remains a vital competitor to watch, especially on price,” wrote Bania. “With that said, Amazon offers a wider set of SKUs​ than Costco does, and Prime has other benefits (video, music, etc.) that create differentiation.” The analyst reiterated her outperform rating on Amazon and her $1,200 price target. The analyst rates Wal-Mart and Costco at market perform with price targets of $80 and $170, respectively. “Despite Costco's price gap to Amazon we believe near-term sentiment and fear of the long-term impact of Amazon on Costco's business (whether or not justified by near-term fundamentals) could continue to create an overhang on COST shares and limit valuation upside,” she wrote in the research note.

Marguerite Ward,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"The approaching holiday season means more shopping, and as a result, more jobs in retail. For some retail employees, it will also mean higher wages. Target announced today that it would raise its minimum wage above $10 beginning in October, eventually reaching $11 per hour for all U.S. stores. The retailer has already promised to add 100,000 jobs in the coming months and has committed to raising minimum wage to $15 by 2020. Though many of these jobs may be temporary, they provide experience as well as a source of income, and knowing how major stores compare in terms of hourly pay could help you if you're in the market for a job. Using  Fortune's list of the 20 retailers with the greatest number of employees in the U.S., CNBC Make It looked at average hourly wages for the position of ""sales associate"" —  a common consumer-facing, non-managerial role — at each company. Wages were determined using data submitted by employees to jobs and salary platform Glassdoor. Each company on the list was also contacted to provide information or comment. Here's how the country's 20 biggest retail employers rank in terms of pay: Average hourly wage for sales associates: $7.87Number of employees: 121,000 Average hourly wage for sales associates:  $8.17 to  $8.26Number of employees: 116,050 After five months, some Dollar Tree employees can earn $9 per hour, The Wall Street Journal reports. Average hourly wage for sales associates:  $8.54Number of employees: 140,000 Average hourly wage for sales associates: $8.57 Number of employees: 78,600 Business Insider reports that Ross Stores leadership announced in 2015 it would raise starting wages to $9. Average hourly wage for sales associates:  $8.71Number of employees: 85,000 Average hourly wage for sales associates: $8.75, as determined by averaging Glassdoor data for TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods.

There are many who argue that big retailers could afford to increase wages. Some retail employees say they struggle to make ends meet and many have joined the ""Fight for 15"" protests, which call for a minimum wage of $15 per hour and have gained traction in many major cities. Jiyoung Hwang, assistant professor of marketing at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro's Bryan School of Business and Economics, says there are a few factors at play. Chief among them are the minimum wage in each state, which she says retailers often use a benchmark, the level of skill each employee has and the company's emphasis on corporate social responsibility (CSR.) ""Costco is well-known for its CSR while Wal-Mart is quite lower in that reputation,"" Hwang says. Pressure to offer customers low prices, long operating hours and the importance of competing with other retailers also play a big role, she adds. In addition, company sales, the cost of living in an area and a worker's responsibilities contribute to wage decisions, according to Ana Serafin Smith, senior director of media relations at the National Retail Federation (NRF). Still, Smith says that those who earn minimum wage from major retailers may not have to do so for long. ""A majority of those hired in an entry-level position,"" Smith says, citing NRF research, ""reported earning a promotion within a year of employment.""

"Paul Sonn, general counsel, National Employment Law Project",09282017,CNBC,09212017,"With the holiday season approaching, this week Target became the first low-wage chain to announce it will raise pay to $15 an hour. Chief executive Brian Cornell said the decision to raise wages to $15 by 2020 will help Target attract and retain talent as the hyper-competitive retail sector enters its busiest quarter. It also shows the growing impact of the Fight for $15–and puts pressure on other major players like Amazon, Walmart and McDonalds to follow suit. Since striking fast-food workers launched the Fight for $15 in 2012, states and cities comprising more than 18 percent of the U.S. workforce—including Target's home city of Minneapolis—have approved $15 minimum wages. And scores of companies have raised pay to $15, including insurance giants Aetna and Allstate, major hospital chains across the country, and tech leader Facebook for its contracted bus drivers, janitors and security guards. But Target's role as an industry leader in retail—which together with restaurants employs the largest share of workers paid less than $15–illustrates what business strategists have long argued: historically low-paying sectors can make the shift to significantly higher pay. MIT business professor Zeynep Ton has shown how industry leaders like Costco and Trader Joe's provide a roadmap for how investing in retail workers with good wages and benefits goes hand-in-hand with strong growth and productivity. Target's move blows up the claims of corporate lobbyists who argue it's simply not possible for industries like retail and restaurants to pay a $15 minimum wage. In fact,  growing numbers of business owners and economists confirm that a phased-in $15 minimum wage is realistic for employers and will help boost the consumer spending that ultimately drives job growth. But ultimately the imperative to pay a living wage is about our nation's values. As La Colombe CEO Todd Carmichael  argued last week, ""unless you pay your employees a nonpredatory living wage that keeps people and their families above the poverty line, you don't deserve to be in business."" Part of what's driving employers like Target to pay $15 an hour is the simple fact that,  everywhere in America—not just on the coasts-- a single worker will soon need to earn at least that much just to afford the basics. And workers on the coasts or supporting kids will need even more. Yet more than 43 percent of America's workers struggle on less than $15 an hour. Far from teenagers, the median age of the millions of  workers earning less than $15 an hour in the U.S. is 32. They include hospital workers and preschool teachers, auto-parts workers and waitresses. In other words, many of the front line jobs in which U.S. workers today spend their careers pay less than $15 an hour. And we all end up subsidizing those low wages. Low pay by corporations like McDonald's and Walmart cost taxpayers  a whopping $153 billion a year in public assistance to working families, according to a recent study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. A key issue when employers like Target raise pay is what happens to the growing numbers of employees who don't work for them directly but instead through staffing agencies or service contractors. In the Twin Cities, Target has already been a leader in tackling this issue,  agreeing last year to support the efforts of its contracted janitors to unionize and raise their pay substantially. Ensuring that more employers raise standards for contracted and direct employees alike is essential  in our increasingly ""fissured"" workplaces. Low pay is hurting America's working families and holding back our economy, which depends on a thriving consumer class to drive growth. Target's plan to raise pay to $15 an hour over the next 30 months is smart business strategy, and what our nation's workforce and economy need. There's now a bullseye on the back of employers like Amazon, Walmart and McDonalds. They should follow Target's lead. ",Target's $15 an hour move 'blows up' minimum wage myths-commentary

The Wharton School's Jeremy Siegel believes it'll have a lot to do with President Donald Trump's intention to get business-friendly reforms passed on Capitol Hill — not the latest Federal Reserve decision on interest rates or better-than-expected economic growth figures. ""I would say corporate tax reform could add another 10 percent to the market even this year,"" Siegel said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" A deal ""looks very likely to get done."" It's the second time in less than 12 months that Siegel, a longtime bull, has made a bold market call. And it came on a day when the Dow and S&P 500 closed at record highs. In the final weeks of 2016, Siegel argued that the blue chip stock index was very close to hitting the 20,000 milestone. It broke through that key psychological level on Jan. 25 and since then has soared more than 10 percent. If Siegel is right this time, too, a 10 percent jump would put the Dow around 24,650 and the S&P 500 at 2,760 based on Wednesday's closes. ""There's new hope that taxes really have a chance to be done. I remained steadfast throughout some of the bleak days in the last few months when no one thought anything could be done,"" Siegel added. ""There's a little bit more optimism now.

Over the past year, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has been stocking up on online retail outlets. It closed its acquisition of Jet.com about a year ago, and it's since bought four other small online retailers. Wal-Mart's efforts have resulted in huge online sales growth, but its acquisition strategy may be somewhat flawed. Wal-Mart has put the former CEO of Jet.com, Marc Lore, in charge of its online operations in the United States. He recently spoke at a conference, and when asked what Wal-Mart does better than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), he said Wal-Mart's unique assets separate it from the competition. Image source: Wal-Mart Lore pointed specifically to the ""4,600"" stores Wal-Mart operates in the United States as a unique advantage over Amazon. Lore may have been using an old store count, because Wal-Mart says it has 4,741 stores in the U.S. That number is somehow getting larger every year. Roughly 90% of the U.S. population is within 10 miles of a Walmart store. That means Wal-Mart has a big advantage in in-store pickup and online grocery ordering, and has the infrastructure to succeed in shipping items to customers' homes. Indeed, Wal-Mart was able to launch free two-day shipping on its online orders over $35 earlier this year thanks in part to its network of stores. ""We can do 2-hour delivery cheaper than anybody else because of the assets we have,"" Lore said. After purchasing Whole Foods Market, Amazon's physical storefronts still only amount to about 10% of Wal-Mart's. Even with its  network of fulfillment centers, just 44% of the population lived within 20 miles of Amazon's network as of a year ago. Those fulfillment centers naturally have a lot of overlap with Whole Foods locations as they both target high-population areas. Wal-Mart is the nation's largest private employer with 1.5 million employees in the U.S. Lore cites this as an asset, although the larger overhead has been more of a drag for Wal-Mart. Amazon generates twice as much revenue per employee compared to Wal-Mart. Lore has been creative in finding ways to make employees more efficient as Wal-Mart boosts online sales. Not only does the large number of employees allow Wal-Mart to quickly ramp up services like fulfilling online grocery orders in its stores, Lore tested using employees to deliver online orders the last mile to customers' doorsteps. Physical retail necessitates more employees compared to online-only operations like Amazon. Workers need to stock shelves, assist customers in stores, and work the checkout lines. Investors should expect Amazon's revenue-per-employee number to fall after incorporating Whole Foods' numbers into the mix. But those extra employees offer an opportunity to expand a retailer's capabilities. Wal-Mart's biggest success, so far, has been online grocery ordering and pickup. Lore will continue to search for opportunities like that. Lore wasn't afraid to admit where Amazon has Wal-Mart beat -- that's the overall shopping experience on Amazon compared to Walmart. He said it's easier to find the product you want on Amazon, the competitor often has a greater assortment of goods, and the delivery experience is often superior. It's simple to hire a bunch of engineers to hack away at Walmart.com's search and recommendation algorithms to find the products people really want. It's a lot tougher for Wal-Mart to convince certain brands to sell their goods at its stores. Wal-Mart's reputation for low quality keeps it from attracting more high-end brands. That's part of the idea of buying up smaller online outlets like Bonobos and ShoeBuy. It's also made an effort to attract more third-party merchants to its online marketplace. A quality shopping experience is the biggest hurdle for Wal-Mart to really take on Amazon. And as Amazon moves into brick-and-mortar retail, Wal-Mart may start to feel a bit more pressure to get it right. ","

"Timothy Green, Danny Vena, and Keith Speights",09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. To be a successful long-term investor, you need to make sure your portfolio won't implode on the first sign of a rainy day. What seems like a great idea during the best of times will only reveal its true nature during the worst of times. Sticking with companies that can perform well regardless of economic conditions is an effective way to harden your portfolio. Here's why three of our Foolish investors think Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are some of the best rainy-day stocks. Image source: Getty Images. Danny Vena (Wal-Mart): Investors planning for a rainy day should fortify their portfolio with companies that can perform well during periods of economic instability, which is when consumers tend to spend carefully, forgoing their usual shopping habits and opting for lower prices. During the depths of the Great Recession, many shoppers turned to Wal-Mart's ""Always low prices"" to help make ends meet. As the largest retailer in the world, Wal-Mart has unmatched economies of scale. For its fiscal year ended January 2017, it produced revenue of $485.9 billion and operating income of $22.8 billion. Its operating cash flow totaled $31.5 billion, and it returned $8.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchases. Wal-Mart is also a Dividend Aristocrat, having paid a dividend every year since 1974 and boasting 44 years of consecutive increases. It has a dividend that currently yields 2.5% and a healthy payout ratio of 48%, leaving room for future increases. While the company was initially slow to embrace e-commerce, it corrected that last year with its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, as well as a number of other smaller specialty clothiers. As a result, in its most recent quarter the company posted impressive increases in e-commerce sales, which grew 60% over the prior-year quarter, with gross merchandise volume increasing 67% year over year. If you're looking for a stock for a rainy day, consider this: During the bear market that began Oct. 9, 2007, and ended March 9, 2009, while the broader S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) fell 56%, Wal-Mart stock gained 10%. Data by YCharts. Keith Speights (Facebook): What do people do on a rainy day? They stay inside. While inside, there's a pretty good chance that they'll look at social media. And the undisputed king of social media is Facebook. I suspect that the executives at Facebook like it when people stay inside on rainy days, because it increases the amount of time they spend catching up on friends' posts -- and looking at ads. Ads generate 98% of Facebook's revenue. And that revenue is growing, with the company reporting a 47% year-over-year jump in advertising revenue in the second quarter of 2017. This growth stems from two factors. First, Facebook charged 24% more per ad in the last quarter. It can get away with that kind of price boost because it reaches more than 2 billion monthly active users. Second, the company is also increasing the number of ads displayed. More volume at higher prices is a surefire way to make more money. But can buying Facebook stock make you plenty of money? I think so. Wall Street projects that Facebook will achieve average annual earnings growth over the next five years of nearly 27%. That's a drop from the heady growth of past years, but it's still an impressive level. That growth makes Facebook's valuation look pretty reasonable as well. Facebook isn't just a leader in social media. It's also a leader in artificial intelligence and augmented reality, two of the hottest trends in technology today. Buying Facebook stock is a way of investing in these two trends. That's a pretty smart way, in my view, to use time on a rainy day so that your financial future isn't stormy. Tim Green (Microsoft): Software giant Microsoft has changed quite a bit over the past few years. It's embraced cloud computing, building its Azure cloud platform into a strong No. 2 player. It's dropped its Windows-centric position, building first-class apps for Android and iOS. And it's building an increasing amount of hardware, from its Surface tablets and laptop to its HoloLens augmented reality headset. But what hasn't changed about Microsoft is its dominant position in the productivity software market. Businesses depend on Office, Outlook, and other Microsoft products, and that's likely to remain true regardless of the state of the economy. Office is still the company's cash cow, despite serious competition from Alphabet's Google. While Microsoft is heavily investing in growth businesses like cloud computing, the company is still producing impressive profits. During fiscal 2017, Microsoft generated $21.2 billion of net income on $90.0 billion of revenue. Meanwhile, Azure revenue is doubling year over year, and Office 365 commercial, the subscription version of Office, is growing by more than 40% annually. Microsoft is in an enviable position, with dominant businesses like Office throwing off cash, allowing the company to invest in newer businesses that will act as its growth engine for years to come. Through the good times and the bad, Microsoft should continue to produce exceptional results. ","

Target (NYSE:TGT) made news earlier this week by making public plans to increase its minimum hourly wage for all employees to $11 in October. The chain also pledged to increase wages to a $15-per-hour minimum by 2020. The company said in a press release that a ""significant investment in its team will allow Target to continue to recruit and retain strong team members."" It comes at a time when unemployment sits near historic lows and the idea of a $15-an-hour minimum wage has become a huge topic of national debate. Target's move follows its previous wage hike to a $10 an hour minimum in 2016. It also follows efforts from its chief rival, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), to raise wages. In February 2016 the company pledged to pay any employees hired before Jan. 1, 2016 at $10 an hour and that any workers hired after that would receive at least $9 an hour, with their rate increasing to at least $10 upon completion of a training program. Target has increased the minimum hourly wage for its employees. Image source: Target. Only two states -- Massachusetts and Washington -- have $11-an-hour minimum wages. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia, however, have a minimum wage that exceeds the federal standard of $7.25. In his remarks in the press release Target's CEO Brian Cornell framed the move as being about making life better for his chain's workers. Target has always offered market competitive wages to our team members. With this latest commitment, we'll be providing even more meaningful pay, as well as the tools, training and support our team needs to build their skills, develop professionally and offer the service and expertise that set Target apart. That's, of course, a piece of it, but the reality is that changing market conditions dictate the increase. With unemployment standing at 4.4% in August, near historic lows, the reality is Target needs to pay more to attract workers. An employee who makes $11 an hour for a 40-hour week would earn $22,800 a year. That's less than the average annual wages for cashiers ($27,701) and warehouse associates ($40,784), according to GlassDoor's most-recent Local Pay Reports. Of course, those reports offer the average of all workers in those positions, not the minimum hourly starting wage. Target's starting pay will also be less than the $14.21 an hour the average Costco cashier makes and less than the $12.42 an Amazon fulfillment associate earns per hour, according to GlassDoor salary reviews. That data is based on 158 Costco employees reporting their earnings to the jobs data website and 683 Amazon warehouse workers doing the same. The new rate, however, is very competitive in other areas of the market. Starting workers at $11 an hour does put Target well ahead of the $8.41 to $8.61 an hour the average McDonald's crew member or cashier makes. Target's starting salary will also be more than the average Starbucks barista makes ($9.55 to $9.57), and more than Sears ($8.37 to $8.54) and J.C. Penney ($9.04 to $9.07) associates and cashiers, according to what was reported to GlassDoor. In the retail world, especially when it comes to entry-level positions, small differences in salary can be the difference between someone taking a job or electing to go elsewhere. Competitive pay can also help a company retain employees, lowering its long-term training costs while also improving customer service. Heading into a time when it and many of its rivals are hiring for the holidays, Target has given itself a leg up on the competition. By paying more than the competition, the retailer should have an easier time hiring and holding onto the employees it needs. That should improve the in-store experience for customers and help the company meet its Q4 goals. The company's long-range wage increases will help it build an ongoing foundation of well-trained, experienced employees. ","

In the 1980s and even the 1990s, Toys R Us was a place children begged their parents to take them. The chain had a selection of toys that dwarfed what was sold at now-defunct department store chains like Ames, Caldor, and Bradlees. Even its Sunday newspaper inserts were an event, and its holiday season ""toy book"" was much perused by children in order to pick out what gifts they planned to ask for. Toys R Us' slow path to bankruptcy, which it filed on Sept. 18, did not begin with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). It started with chains like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) creating toy departments that not only pushed prices (and margins) lower, but also made it so a visit to Toys R Us was no longer unique. Wal-Mart and Target made Toys R Us less of a destination and gave parents a way to placate their kids while also doing their own shopping. Toys R Us has filed for bankruptcy. Image source: Getty Images. For two years, I ran the largest toy and hobby store in New England. We had a Toys R Us, a Target, and a Wal-Mart within a couple of miles of us. We were also in a relatively remote location while our toy-selling rivals were closer to the highway and near a major mall. Despite those deficits and the fact that we were generally more expensive than the chains we competed with, we thrived. The mistake Toys R Us has made is that it has done very little to differentiate itself from its department store rivals. My former toy store, which is doing well to this day, did much more than sell toys, hobby items, model trains, and more. It actively gave customers a reason to visit. We hosted gaming events, tournaments, and learn-to-play classes for everything from the easiest children's games to the most complicated collectible offerings. We also had multiple huge model train sets that were shown off for free twice a month, and every Sunday during the holiday season. Those trains were maintained and built by clubs that met in the store. During weekdays, we had story time for children, and on holidays, we barbecued, made cotton candy, or handed out special treats to our customers. Even when nothing was happening, we had play areas for little kids, model-building areas for all ages, and a near-endless supply of curios we picked up in theory to sell, but just as much to give customers something to look at. We also had a customer-first attitude where we welcomed everyone warmly, treated regulars like family, and accepted that sometimes we were going to teach a customer about a product only for them to buy it cheaper on Amazon. Our store also had merchandise that wouldn't be found at a Toys R Us or a department store, as well as staff that was passionate about what they sold. Toys R Us had the tools and the space to be all of those things, but either arrogance or complacency stopped it from evolving. Once simply having toys stopped making it a destination for kids and toy lovers, the chain needed to do more. CEO David Brandon acknowledged that in the bankruptcy filing, explaining how the company would change its stores. ""Once these initiatives are implemented, Toys R Us stores will be interactive spaces with rooms to use for parties, live product demonstrations put on by trained employees, and the freedom for employees to remove product from boxes to let kids play with the latest toys,"" he said. That's the model that would have worked all along. It's a game Target and Wal-Mart are unlikely to play, and one that Amazon, for obvious reasons, can't. Bankruptcy may clear some debt and let the company shed some leases, but it needs to change in order to avoid slowly falling right back into the same hole. Toys R Us has to go from being a place that sells toys and games to one that's full of activities, experiences, and discoveries for kids and adults alike. The chain needs to transform from store to destination -- if it does that, then sales will follow. ","

It wasn't so long ago that investors couldn't buy enough of Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR): Between 2013 and 2015, the stock rose an astonishing 217%. Yet since January 2016, Kroger's shares have lost 50% of their value. Over the last 18 months, Kroger's comparable quarterly sales, excluding fuel sales, have shifted from healthy growth in the mid-single digits to a complete standstill. In the final quarter of 2016, the company saw its 13-year streak of comparable sales growth snap, as comps declined for the first time in 53 quarters. Kroger is cuing up a comps revival, but for now, progress is wan. Management projects just a slight expansion in this metric of 0.5% to 1% for the second half of the current fiscal year. The culprit, of course, is fierce competition among grocers for customers. And it will only intensify: 2018 promises to ring in a battle royale within the grocery industry. Whole Foods Market will present a distinct online retailing challenge once new owner Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) integrates the organic chain's loyalty program with its Amazon Prime service. As for brick-and-mortar developments, privately held German discount grocers Aldi and Lidl will open 500 new stores in the U.S. between them by the end of 2018 alone, as Aldi seeks to expand and Lidl builds on its 2017 entry on the east coast. In a pre-emptive response to the European invasion, Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) -- never an easy grocer to undercut -- is already allowing its gross margin to slip in 2017 in order to ""invest in price."" These pitched battles, both online and in midsized and major metropolitan areas, are occurring just as shopping habits undergo significant change. The Food Marketing Institute has been tracking grocery industry trends for decades. Last year, its ""U.S. Grocery Shopper Report"" confirmed what many of us have experienced personally: Shoppers are splitting their grocery buys over a number of different store types and channels. In fact, the report showed that in each of the preceding three years, a ""significant"" number of shoppers (between 7% and 9%) no longer claimed loyalty to a primary grocery store. That's a problem for Kroger, which operates as a conventional grocer in an increasingly specialized world. It's not a premium grocer like Whole Foods, nor a deep-discounter like Aldi or Lidl. The company instead has existed as a traditional supermarket which uses high customer engagement and sheer proximity to customers (with approximately 2,800 stores spread across 35 states) to drive traffic. Image source: Getty Images. To keep comps from treading water, which won't be kind to its stock price, Kroger has a complex task ahead. The company will have to stay focused, avoid overreaching for desperate solutions, and double down on its very formidable core strengths. Read through a recent earnings call transcript, or browse the company's quarterly earnings reports, and you'll be reminded of the slate of advantages that propelled Kroger, not many quarters ago, to brisk comps growth. I'll summarize them briefly as follows: Think of the advantages above as a sort of body armor Kroger constructed over the last few years as competitors refined their individual niches and prepared to attack on price and differentiation. Now's the time to wear that armor in the battle to protect market share and build comps. This month, CEO Rodney McMullen said emphatically in an earnings conference call that the grocer is ""not going to lose on price."" Cutting prices is simple, but retaining customers on price alone is not. A more sustainable strategy is to shift more resources away from price investment, and toward the manufacturing, brand, and technology investments which boost inherent advantages. To stabilize in this environment and grow again, Kroger needs to push its Simple Truth line. It should expand private-label brands that contribute to higher profits. It should continue to embrace online shopping, and dial up the use of analytics to retain customers and incentivize shopping frequency. In reaffirming its strengths, Kroger will reaffirm its identity to its customers.

The fourth quarter has become a sort of retail free-for-all where stores try increasingly desperate tactics to lure in customers. From opening on Thanksgiving Day to heavy discounts and aggressive promotions, retailers pull out all the stops. That makes sense because the importance of the period seems to grow each year. In 2017, early predictions from Deloitte show that total holiday sales, excluding automobiles and gasoline, will reach $1.04 trillion to $1.05 trillion between November and January, up from $1 trillion last year. And while the digital portion of overall sales has grown, e-commerce sales will only account for $111 billion to $114 billion of that total -- an 18%-21% increase over $93.8 billion in 2016. Servicing all of those sales requires workers. In Q4, really toward the end of Q3 in September, many retail and retail-adjacent companies have traditionally hired a lot of people. This list will expand as the season gets closer, but there are a lot of jobs out there in a market that's already near historically high employment rates. Unlike last year, these jobs may not be easy to fill, a fact that has already caused Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) to decide against hiring temporary workers. Instead, the retailer will fill its need by offering overtime to existing employees. Some of the companies on this list may end up following Wal-Mart's lead if they can't find enough qualified applicants, but for now, here's the list of companies that are hiring and how many people they need. Retailers will be hiring tens of thousands of workers for the holiday season. Image source: Target. Even though Wal-Mart has elected to sit out the hiring season, most of its rivals have different plans. There will literally be hundreds of thousands of openings in everything from front-end, consumer-facing positions, to backroom warehouse jobs, and digital fulfillment positions: These are not the only retailers with holiday hiring plans, just the ones that have come forward so far. Kohl's, Nordstrom, and many other chains are planning to add workers. In many ways, it's a job-seeker's market, with applicants being able to weigh things like pay and benefits against the possibility of becoming a permanent hire when deciding where to apply. The rise of digital sales has put tremendous pressure on the companies that deliver online orders. The United States Postal Service (USPS) has posted job listings in a number of markets looking for both seasonal and permanent workers. The number of openings varies based on the market, but the overall job count seems significant. Not to be outdone by the government, both United Parcel Service and FedEx plan to hire. UPS plans to add about 95,000 seasonal workers, while its rival hopes to hire 50,000 while also offering more overtime for existing employees. In many cases seasonal jobs go to college kids, people working a second gig, or those not looking to enter the workforce full-time. For those seeking permanent employment, however, a seasonal job can be a way to get your foot in the door at a company you want to work at. Every company on this list has both full and seasonal openings, but if your goal is a permanent job, it may be best to take seasonal work at a thriving company. Amazon, for example, is likely to keep more temporary workers than Toys R Us or Macy's simply given the trajectory of their businesses. Still, a chain like Target may be facing challenges, but it's doing well enough that exceptional seasonal workers can probably find a full-time, permanent job after the holiday season. ","

Like solar and wind power, many alternative energy advocates have touted the potential of hydrogen power for years. Investors in fuel cell companies like Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) are still waiting, however, for the inflection point that marks the company's transition to sustained profitability. Perhaps in 2017, though, that time has come. Rising 128% in 2017 as of this writing, Plug Power has delighted the market -- unlike in 2016 -- with several announcements, suggesting that the tide has turned. Thanks in part to a deal with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), fuel cell fever is working its way through Wall Street. Indicating a bullish outlook on the stock, analysts at FBR Capital and Cowen have each identified a $3 price target on the stock. Moreover, an analyst at the investment bank Rodman and Renshaw issued a $4 price target. But Wall Street's enthusiasm doesn't necessarily mean investors should start powering their portfolios with this fuel cell industry leader. Image source: Getty Images. To say that news of the company's deal with Amazon was well received would be a gross understatement. Shares soared more than 60% in April -- the month in which the announcement was made -- and the stock hasn't looked back, continuing to climb ever since. What fed the fervor? For one, Plug Power's management expects the deal to add $70 million to the company's top line in 2017. This is no small sum considering the company reported $86 million in revenue in the prior year. Besides the deal with Amazon, Plug Power pleased investors with its second-quarter earnings report. Management announced a new agreement with long-term partner Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), with an estimated the contract value to be $70 million. And speaking to its fiscal 2017 finances, it was quite optimistic, estimating negative free cash flow of $25 million to $35 million. Additionally, the company expects further progress in its pursuit of profitability, and is forecasting an expansion in its fiscal 2017 gross margin (excluding the impact of warrants issued to Amazon and Wal-Mart) to 8% to 12%; the fiscal 2016 gross margin was only 4.6%. In terms of the stock, because it's unprofitable, we can't use the traditional price-to-earnings metric to value shares, so let's consider the price-to-sales ratio. Shares are trading around 5.4 times sales, slightly higher than the stock's 5.2 average, but those who are optimistic about the company's future could certainly shrug off this seemingly high price tag. Despite the deal with Amazon and an improvement in some areas of its financials, the bear argument for Plug Power remains strong. Image source: Getty Images For one, management's forecast for its fiscal 2017 performance must be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism since it doesn't have a great track record of meeting its guidance. In 2013, it estimated Plug Power would break even on an EBITDA basis by the second or third quarter of 2014. Slightly off, the company reported an EBITDA loss of $84 million in 2014 according to Morningstar. Last year, during its Q1 2016 presentation, it announced a gross margin goal exceeding 12% for fiscal 2016. The company instead reported a gross margin of 4.6%, thereby coming up quite short. Management, furthermore, set an operating cash flow target of negative $20 million. Again missing the target, it reported negative $30 million in operating cash flow in fiscal 2016. PLUG R&D to Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Accounting for 28% of revenue in the trailing 12 months, revenue earmarked for R&D will likely remain a large obstacle on the road to profitability as the company pursues development of its ProGen prototypes for both the domestic and Chinese markets. Predicated on a future where hydrogen has supplanted traditional fuels, picking up shares of Plug Power at this point remains too risky. As one who's been enthusiastic about alternative power for years, I'd be more than happy to add Plug Power to my portfolio. Unfortunately, trust issues regarding its management team still persist, and the failure to translate top-line growth to the bottom line remains a concern. Unless the stock nosedives and reaches rock-bottom prices or the company remedies its issues, I'll be rooting for Plug Power from the sidelines. ","

In the past three years, iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) has pulled off a truly impressive feat. During that time, the maker of home robotics has increased its revenue by nearly 40% while simultaneously reducing its revenue sources. Specifically, the company eliminated $55 million in revenue and pulled out its very roots by divesting its military segment in 2016 and recently discontinued one of its four product lines in the home robotics category, a gutter cleaning line called the Looj. IRBT Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. How then, has the company been able to increase revenue at such a rapid pace? By absolutely dominating in its top product category, that's how! In 2002, iRobot essentially invented the robotic vacuum cleaning market with the launch of the first Roomba. For a decade and a half, Roomba has been the king of robotic vacuum cleaners, especially in the United States, where it holds a jaw-dropping 88% market share. However, it is no longer the only game in town. Let's take a look at the evidence and decide whether there are any companies ready to challenge iRobot's leadership in the fast-growing robotic vacuum cleaner market. It is hard to fathom that any competitor would be able to overtake iRobot in global market share in the near future. iRobot's current position compared to that of its closest rival is simply too dominant: Data source: iRobot. Chart by author. However, just because a competitor can't take the No. 1 spot doesn't mean it can't meaningfully affect iRobot's top and bottom lines, and by extension, its stock price. Let's look further at two companies that might have the potential to do just that. Image source: Ecovacs SharkNinja: SharkNinja is a newcomer to the robotic floor-cleaning market, but it is certainly no stranger to consumers. The company's Ninja Blender has been ranked the No. 1 blender three years in a row in the U.S.,and its upright vacuum cleaners have claimed the No. 1 spot in U.S. market share. Earlier this month, SharkNinja began selling the Shark ION Robot 750. While it's too early to know for sure how big of a splash SharkNinja will make in the market, it's likely the company has big plans. With iRobot's stock dropping 15% after a short-seller said the competitor's entrance to the market posed ""a credible threat,"" it's safe to say shareholders agree. Only time will tell if iRobot will be able to continue growing revenue and earnings at a rapid clip with increasing competition trying to get a bigger share of the pie. We do know that iRobot's management believes its patent portfolio is a huge part of its competitive moat. The other safeguard iRobot may have is a fast-growing market. At a recent investor conference, management stated that the immediately addressable market for robotic vacuums is two to three times the currently installed base and that 700% market growth is expected over the long term. If the market for robotic floor cleaners grows fast enough, it is possible iRobot could lose market share and still grow revenue and profits significantly. At the same time, competition is increasing as we speak. Robotic vacuum cleaners at lower price points have essentially become commoditized home appliances. Amazon's ""robotic vacuums"" product selection numbers in the hundreds, and iRobot estimates that 20% of all vacuums worldwide are robotic -- and more than 30% of those are made by its competitors. With that level of competition already existing for lower-end products, if Ecovacs or Shark Ninja can chip away at market share on the premium lines (which management defines as vacuums costing $200 or above), it's only a matter of time before iRobot's absolute dominance comes to an end.

A full transcript follows the video. Mac Greer: Let's begin with, frankly, a retailer that I have pretty much forgotten is still around -- Bed Bath & Beyond. Wow, Bed Bath & Beyond taking a bath on Wednesday. Shares down more than 14% after the company lowered its earnings outlook and reported weaker-than-expected earnings. David Kretzmann, I go to you. Is Bed Bath & Beyond beyond repair? Is there anything you can do to save this? David Kretzmann: What hurts here is, the stores aren't performing that well, but on the financial side of things, management has done more to add gasoline to that bad fire overall. If you go back to 2014, from a financial perspective, the company looked like it was in decent shape. It was producing over $1 billion in free cash flow annually, had $850 million in net cash on the balance sheet, so they had cash in the bank, they were producing a lot more cash to add to that tally. But that year, they decided to issue $1.5 billion in new debt just to buy back stock. They essentially went into more debt, bought back a lot of stock, and now a few years later the company has over $1 billion in net debt, and their free cash flow production has almost been cut in half to about $570 million. So that's a bleak direction to be going within just a few years. They've really been focusing on buying back stock, they haven't done a whole lot to improve the actual in-store experience, and what they have done has been very slow. They are making some progress with their digital sales, which now make up about 15% of total revenue. They say that their ""differentiated products,"" which they consider their exclusive products, personalizable products, makes up about half of sales, so I think that's probably an area where they really need to double down and find some way to differentiate what they're offering and how they offer it from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other retailers that are still out there. They've also made some acquisitions into new brick-and-mortar retail concepts. They bought a website, personalizationmall.com, late last year, where you can buy and personalize a lot of different items. Going that route makes the most sense to me. It's not a stock I would buy, even though it looks very cheap-looking at these trailing metrics. But I think management has made some very poor cash management decisions over the past few years, and in the meantime, the actual performance of the stores leaves a lot to be desired. Aaron Bush: Yeah, one tidbit that I keep on coming back to for Bed Bath & Beyond and for other struggling retailers is, when a brick-and-mortar store tries to add a quality e-commerce operation, not only does it tend to cause its physical stores to struggle more, but it makes the company increasingly expensive to run, because they have to duplicate the cost just to serve that same customer. So you do see them making really dumb decisions with debt, and adding new retail concepts, which feels more like a distraction than anything. But just the fundamental structure of how the economics work, and managing an in-store presence and an online presence isn't very friendly. And they've been really slow to do this. But now that they are invested in it, it's another reason that's adding a margin drag and keeping earnings lower. Greer: Do you think, in terms of those traditional retailers adding that online piece, I see why you would want to do it. Everyone's trying to fend off Amazon. You have to try anything. So you have Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) with the Jet acquisition. Do you think that's going to work for Wal-Mart? Or, to take your logic even further, if you're Wal-Mart, do you stick to your knitting, which is just bread-and-butter traditional retailers? Bush: I think for Wal-Mart and Jet, I think it was smart to acquire Jet, not for Jet itself, but more for the talent that is in that management team. And I know, I'm blanking on his name ... Marc Lore, who was the head of Jet, now runs Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations. So I think that was smart. What Wal-Mart really needs to do is continue to acquire things and really build up a big suite of an online presence. When it comes to e-commerce, aggregation is increasingly important, so you either have to dominate a niche, or you have to be someone that you can go to for anything and everything. So it's tough. Wal-Mart might be able to pull it off, Amazon is definitely pulling it off, but for someone like Bed Bath & Beyond it's a hard spot. Kretzmann: I think what Aaron mentioned highlights why it's so difficult for these brick-and-mortar retailers to pivot more to online or omnichannel sales because it tends to be more expensive to operate both rather than one or the other. But there is some value to the omnichannel experience. You see Amazon clearly showing a lot of interest in opening up their own brick-and-mortar stores, acquiring Whole Foods. So there is value there. But for a lot of these companies, I think it will be a short-term ding, but it's probably what they need to do to stay relevant and figure out some way to hopefully improve the economics over time, one way or another, whether it's offering more personalized services or some sort of consultation. We're going to talk about Best Buy today. They're trying to do something along those lines. But in the short term, the company needs to stomach those short-term dings if they want to stay relevant with competitors like Amazon. Greer: So, Bed Bath & Beyond shares a lot cheaper today than they were yesterday, but you're still not interested? Kretzmann: Based on management's track record, both managing the stores and how they've been trying to pivot those stores, I think they've been lackluster there. And they've also really jeopardized the company's financial position, because you're not going to go bankrupt if you don't have debt, and they completely pivoted the whole balance sheet a few years ago to buy back stock, which, in hindsight, looks like a very dumb move. Shares have continued dropping since then, so that was a poor investment, and a very poor reason to go into debt. So, from a financial position now, the company's future is in a lot more jeopardy now. So I would stay on the sidelines here. Greer: So, five years from now, are they still a going concern? Are they still around? Kretzmann: I think they're still around but they're probably getting pretty close to bankruptcy, at the rate they're going now. ","

Parent's Choice began 20 years ago with just baby formula and will grow to 275 items. Key to the line will be a premium diaper, available in select stores and on online, and a line of bedding including 53 pieces. The bedding collection will all be priced $40 or less, with many items less than $13. Baby is a category of focus for rival Target Corp.

                                   climbed by 0.9%. “The backdrop for gold today is as bullish as it has been in a long time,” said Mark O’Byrne, research director at GoldCore in Dublin. He expects gold prices to reach $1,400 before the end of the year. With President Donald Trump “in the White House and the political situation in the U.S. and globally more uncertain than it has been in many years, gold will almost certainly continue to see robust safe-haven demand,” he said. “This should push gold higher in the coming months.” Recent military tensions between North Korea and the U.S. and its allies has helped to underpin gold’s haven status as a hedge against a sudden escalation in geopolitical tension. According to media reports Monday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told reporters that Trump’s tweet that leader Kim Jong Un “won’t be around much longer” was a declaration of war, and Japanese leader Shinzo Abe on Monday called a snap general election in a bid to consolidate power in the midst of a diplomatic crisis with North Korea. Read: These are the next risk events for investors now Gold is “coming out of a bear market, and “the technical position looks better and better after gold bottomed in December 2015,” said O’Byrne. “Since then, we have seen a series of higher lows and higher highs.” “Global demand remains robust with strong demand being seen in many sectors—especially in the ETFs and also in Chinese demand, he said. Gold is also considered a counter to what some market participants have described as lofty levels for U.S. equities potentially ripening for a correction.

The two markets often move inversely as a weaker dollar can make commodities pegged to the currency, including most of the world’s gold, more appealing to buyers using weaker monetary units. The dollar strengthened against the euro, which was under pressure after a heavy drop in support for mainstream parties in Germany’s general election on Sunday left the way forward in doubt for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative alliance.

Passive products allow investors to hold all the components of an index like the Russell 2000

That’s in contrast to actively managed funds, where the securities are individually selected by a portfolio manager. The shift away from active and into passive has been dramatic, driven by both the lower cost and historically better performance of passive funds. According to Morningstar, passive funds attracted inflows of $428.7 billion over 2016, while actively managed funds saw outflows of $285.2 billion, a trend that has occurred for nearly 10 years.

Vanguard alone has at least a 5% stake in 468 components of the S&P 500, according to a June report in The Wall Street Journal, up from just three components in 2005.

Passive’s decision to buy or sell stocks is often directed by broader fund flows and larger rebalances and not typically company specific fundamentals.” The investment bank calculated that for the average S&P 500 company, the share of its stock that might trade on fundamental views has dropped to 77% compared with 95% a decade ago. Those figures are based on a measure Goldman calls “passive-adjusted float,” or the number of shares outstanding minus both restricted holdings and passive holdings. “The impact on portfolio construction, alpha and trading are not fully appreciated by investors,” Fogertey wrote. Alpha refers to outperformance over a benchmark. Earlier this month, UBS analysts wrote that worries over the impact passive investing and ETFs would have on price discovery and liquidity were “misguided.” The firm noted that while passive funds comprise 46% of total ETF and mutual fund assets, they only accounted for 8% of the overall global equity market value. “If the investment landscape were limited to ETFs and mutual funds, it may warrant the current level of attention,” they wrote. “However, the investment landscape is far more expansive than just ETFs and mutual funds. There are hedge funds, separately managed accounts, and equities managed by other institutional investors and households that should factor into the analysis.” Read more: Relax, Wall Street: ETFs aren’t the root of all evil Related: Don’t blame ETFs or passive investors for high valuations Nonetheless, the impact of this factor depends on the specific security, as “passive ownership varies in both size and scope even within sectors.” Roughly 30% of the float of energy firm ONEOK

Jeffry Bartash,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 25, 2017 1:00 p.m. ET Economists see small Trump boost, still-low inflation, NABE says By The U.S. economy these days is like an old and reliable car. It’s not going to set any speed records but it’s also not going to break down and leave people stranded. That sums up the latest quarterly outlook by the nation’s most prominent business economists. They predict the U.S. will only grow a touch faster in 2018 — around 2.4% compared to an estimated 2.2% this year. Part of the fuel for faster growth in 2018 are expected tax reductions and spending increases by the Trump White House, according to the National Association of Business Economists. Yet economists also believe there’s just a one-in-four chance of a recession in the next two years, “A large majority of the panel views a near-term recession as highly unlikely,” said Kevin Swift, vice president elect of the NABE. The largely worry-free view of the economy stems from it’s mild rate of growth. The U.S. historically has grown more than 3% a year and at times even faster, but in the absence of such high rates of growth, dangerous imbalances apparently have failed to materialize. The slower rate of growth since the end of the 2007-2009 recession — the U.S. has expanded around 2% a year — also means the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates as high as it normally does. Past recessions have often been caused in part by the central bank raising the cost of borrowing quickly or aggressively. The Fed’s benchmark short-term interest rate, known as fed funds, now ranges from 1% to 1.25%. The NABE predicts the fed funds rate will rise to 2.125% by the end of 2018, but that’s still quite low by historical standards. The more immediate threats to the economy, NABE respondents said, could come from: • A war over free trade that leads to sharp restrictions: • A big reversal in surging U.S. stock markets; • Or tight immigration rules that limit the supply of labor in a time of growing manpower shortages. Inflation is not much of a danger, the NABE said. Economist predict annual prices increases will top out at no more than 1.9% in 2018, using the Fed’s preferred PCE inflation gauge. Also Read: Watch this inflation number to see where interest rates go next The now familiar constraints on the economy’s pace of growth are unlikely to ease much, the NABE said. Worker pay, business investment and productivity should all rise in 2018, but not at a rate strong enough to push U.S. growth above 3%. A lift could come from White House plans to cut taxes and improve public works . But economists are skeptical it will add a big boost — no more than 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points. The last time the U.S. grew at least 3% was in 2005. The current 12-year stretch of sub-3% growth is the longest on record. The flip side is, a recovery now nine years old could end up becoming the longest on record if the economy avoids a downturn in the next two years. The current expansion will turn 99 months old at the end of September. The record is 120 months from 1991 to 2001. ",U.S. economy likely to speed up in 2018 but not shatter any records - MarketWatch
Claudia Assis,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 28, 2017 7:27 a.m. ET Analysts take a deep dive in Tesla’s cash burn By Investors have given Tesla Inc. a vote of confidence despite the Silicon Valley’s car maker billion-dollar cash burn, but a botched Model 3 roll-out could trigger a “moment of panic” in the market, leading to a possible share-price plunge and drying-up of liquidity. That’s from analysts at Bernstein, who took a deep dive into Tesla’s cash burn, which they estimate will have reached a cumulative $10.6 billion by the end of the year. “Bears argue that this level of capital spending is unprecedented and that Tesla will inevitably run out of cash. Meanwhile, bulls argue that Tesla’s spending is par for course among high-growth companies,” the Bernstein analysts said.

Read more: Tesla car population will explode within a few years, Morgan Stanley says They kept the equivalent of a neutral rating on Tesla, with a target price of $265, which would represent a downside around 23% from Wednesday prices. For Tesla, it will all come down to how well the company rolls out the Model 3, the electric sedan the company unveiled in late July. Model 3 deliveries are expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter. Tesla’s $60 billion valuation can be interpreted as a “vote of confidence from the market,” as long as Tesla’s near-team growth stays intact and investors believe profits will follow, the Bernstein analysts said. Investors “will continue to supply liquidity and overlook Tesla’s cash burn, just as they historically did” with Wal-Mart and Home Depot, they said. Related: Tesla will be a money-losing business until 2020, analyst says “However, even if we can disregard Tesla’s cash burn, we continue to worry about the company’s ability to deliver upon its long-term vision of profitability.

That means launching the sedan with good gross margins, good quality, and on time, with gross margins a key element as they set the baseline for Tesla’s future profitability, they said.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc is testing a service to stock groceries directly to customers’ refrigerators as it seeks to take on e-commerce giant Amazon.com. The delivery of groceries and meal kits is emerging as the next frontier of competition among retailers. The world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer said on Friday it is partnering with August Home, a provider of smart locks and  home accessories, to test the service with certain customers in the Silicon Valley. (bit.ly/2ffqqvT) The grocery business is set to be upended through Amazon’s acquisition of upmarket grocer Whole Foods last month and the online retailer is also entrenching itself more deeply in the restaurants business. Amazon Restaurants on Friday teamed up with online food ordering company Olo whose network of restaurants includes Applebee’s and Chipotle. The partnership will help Olo’s restaurant customers connect with Amazon’s delivery services. The competition in the meal-kits business is also heating up. Supermarket operator Albertsons Cos Inc said it would buy meal-kit delivery service Plated while rival Kroger-owned Ralphs started selling meal kits in stores this week. ONE-TIME PASSCODE DELIVERY As part of the test, Wal-Mart delivery persons gain access to a customer’s house using a pre-authorized one-time passcode and put away groceries in the fridge and other items in the foyer. Homeowners would receive notifications when the delivery is in progress and could also watch the real-time process from their home security cameras through the August Home app. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has been exploring new methods of delivery and in June said it was testing using its own store employees to deliver packages ordered online.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Maria has devastated the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, another blow to its already precarious economic situation. Puerto Rico’s government owes $72 billion to bondholders, and an additional $50 billion in pension obligations to teachers and almost all other government employees. In May, it filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. The following are responses from multinational companies on how they are dealing with the aftermath of Maria: WAL-MART STORES INC Phillip Keene, Wal-Mart’s director of corporate communications, said, “Like many businesses, we are working to assess any damage to our facilities as we are safely able to access them and working to connect with our associates to assess what their needs are so we can support as appropriate. We are planning to open facilities very thoughtfully, starting with limited hours at our Sam’s Club near San Juan, perhaps as soon as Sunday. One of our Amigo stores has already reopened under limited hours on the south side of San Juan as of this morning. “Walmart operates 48 retail facilities, a distribution center and a satellite headquarters in Puerto Rico, supported by more than 14,700 associates across the Island. At this time, we are trying to best understand the impacts of Hurricane Maria to Puerto Rico, but it’s been a slow process due to widespread power outages and communication issues. We have activated the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the Walmart Home Office in Bentonville, Arkansas, to support our associates in Puerto Rico. The EOC is Walmart’s centralized platform for crisis coordination. In the EOC, we work directly with logistics, store operations and other teams within the business to ensure we’re aligned on our support plans. “We have been in contact with leaders on the Island and continue to be in regular contact with FEMA and the American Red Cross. Our first priority is, and continues to be, the safety of our associates - taking care of them and their families. We are working rapidly to account for our associates, through store and HR leadership as well as social media, local radio and other channels. These efforts will continue. “Although our normal assessment process has been impeded a bit by road conditions and flooding, we are currently working to identify the status of our facilities on the Island. Our Merchandising, Replenishment, Supply Chain and Logistics teams are working to ensure we have critical supplies and product headed to the island via shipping vessels that are slated to depart as soon as Friday (Sept. 22). This is in addition to the shipment of water that was sent toward the island earlier this week, which is currently staged at sea awaiting clearance to safely enter port. We will continue to assess the right flow and mix of merchandise and supplies to send to Puerto Rico in the coming days and weeks.” Tammy Hull, communications manager at Eli Lilly, said: “Lilly has two manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico as well as an affiliate office and sales team. Safety of our employees is our primary concern. The small team of employees who stayed onsite during the storm are safe. We are still accounting for all employees, which is a slow process due to power and communications loss on the island. We are currently assessing our facilities to determine if any damage occurred. Lilly follows emergency procedures that enable us to maintain adequate inventory at our manufacturing sites around the world to ensure a reliable supply of medicine for patients.” Kristen Davis, senior manager of corporate communications at Amgen, said: “Our first priority is the safety of our colleagues and their families. The vast majority of staff at our Amgen Manufacturing Limited (AML) site in Juncos were sent home prior to Maria making landfall, with only a limited number of colleagues remaining on site to monitor operations. At the moment, we are still working to determine the safety of our people and are hopeful that all will be well. At the same time, we are executing on a comprehensive and well-rehearsed business continuity plan for the site itself. Based on what we know at the moment, we are confident there will be no product supply disruptions for patients around the world. Of course, we will work diligently to ensure drug supply for patients in Puerto Rico and to return our operations in Puerto Rico to normal as quickly as possible.” Michele Meixell, head of external communications and affairs at AstraZeneca, said: “Given the early nature of the disaster, we are still in the process of gathering more information, but I can tell you what we know so far. Our Puerto Rico employee base consists of approximately 250 colleagues. This represents both field-based employees as well as those working in our manufacturing facility located in Canovanas. “Right now our number one priority remains the safety and health of our employees and their families. At this point, it’s still early to understand the full impact to our site, but we have started the process to assess our facility. The site does have backup power capabilities and we have a storm crew in limited operation right now until employees are able to safely return to work. In advance of the storm, the facility took appropriate precautions and we have business continuity plans in place to ensure our medicines continue in production. “We do not anticipate interruption in supply at this time. I also want to point out that while our Puerto Rico site is of critical importance to our organization, we have manufacturing facilities all over the globe producing medicines, so in terms of overall business impact, this is important to clarify. “Regarding the safety of our employees, all non-essential employees had been sent home prior to the storm earlier this week. This is a critical time for our employees to be safe and with their families and we will stay in touch with them in various ways that work best for them in this time of need. We stand behind those impacted by Hurricane Maria and AstraZeneca is committed to helping the people and employees affected by all of these recent natural disasters. We will continue to assess the needs of both our employees and those impacted by the storm and once we have more clarity on their needs, provide support and aid however we can.” Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion said, “We’re continuing to assess the situation in Puerto Rico.” ","

(AMZN) may be the king of e-commerce, but when it comes to the best prices and the speediest shipping, it's Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) that takes the crown. That’s according to BMO Capital Markets, which did a deep dive into pricing and shipping costs at Amazon, Costco and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and found that in the 16 categories analyst Kelly Bania and her team studied, the warehouse retailer had prices 7% lower than on Amazon's website. Shipping took an average of 4.5 days per each item compared to 5.5 at Amazon. Wal-Mart and its Jet.com owned e-commerce website had prices that were 18% higher than Amazon's and took a lot longer to ship with the average being 9.8 days. When taking into account Amazon’s Prime membership program that offers discounts and free two-day shipping, BMO Capital Markets found Amazon prices were 4% lower than Wal-Mart when shipping wasn’t included and 10% cheaper when all of the fees were factored in, reported Barron’s, which covered the research report. (See also: Why Amazon Is Losing to JD.com and Wal-Mart.) “With Costco generally beating Amazon in both price and shipping, it’s a reminder that Amazon has strong competition for all those musing about antitrust concerns, especially ones with a strong membership program like Costco's. And with Walmart investing heavily in eCommerce, we think it remains a vital competitor to watch, especially on price,” wrote Bania. “With that said, Amazon offers a wider set of SKUs​ than Costco does, and Prime has other benefits (video, music, etc.) that create differentiation.” The analyst reiterated her outperform rating on Amazon and her $1,200 price target. The analyst rates Wal-Mart and Costco at market perform with price targets of $80 and $170, respectively. “Despite Costco's price gap to Amazon we believe near-term sentiment and fear of the long-term impact of Amazon on Costco's business (whether or not justified by near-term fundamentals) could continue to create an overhang on COST shares and limit valuation upside,” she wrote in the research note.

Marguerite Ward,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"The approaching holiday season means more shopping, and as a result, more jobs in retail. For some retail employees, it will also mean higher wages. Target announced today that it would raise its minimum wage above $10 beginning in October, eventually reaching $11 per hour for all U.S. stores. The retailer has already promised to add 100,000 jobs in the coming months and has committed to raising minimum wage to $15 by 2020. Though many of these jobs may be temporary, they provide experience as well as a source of income, and knowing how major stores compare in terms of hourly pay could help you if you're in the market for a job. Using  Fortune's list of the 20 retailers with the greatest number of employees in the U.S., CNBC Make It looked at average hourly wages for the position of ""sales associate"" —  a common consumer-facing, non-managerial role — at each company. Wages were determined using data submitted by employees to jobs and salary platform Glassdoor. Each company on the list was also contacted to provide information or comment. Here's how the country's 20 biggest retail employers rank in terms of pay: Average hourly wage for sales associates: $7.87Number of employees: 121,000 Average hourly wage for sales associates:  $8.17 to  $8.26Number of employees: 116,050 After five months, some Dollar Tree employees can earn $9 per hour, The Wall Street Journal reports.

Average hourly wage for sales associates:  $8.71Number of employees: 85,000 Average hourly wage for sales associates: $8.75, as determined by averaging Glassdoor data for TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods. (Too few Glassdoor salary reports were available to determine wages for Sierra Trading Post.)Number of employees: 235,000 A company representative tells CNBC Make It that all sales associates now make a starting wage of at least $9 per hour, and at least $10 per hour after six months.

There are many who argue that big retailers could afford to increase wages. Some retail employees say they struggle to make ends meet and many have joined the ""Fight for 15"" protests, which call for a minimum wage of $15 per hour and have gained traction in many major cities. Jiyoung Hwang, assistant professor of marketing at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro's Bryan School of Business and Economics, says there are a few factors at play. Chief among them are the minimum wage in each state, which she says retailers often use a benchmark, the level of skill each employee has and the company's emphasis on corporate social responsibility (CSR.) ""Costco is well-known for its CSR while Wal-Mart is quite lower in that reputation,"" Hwang says. Pressure to offer customers low prices, long operating hours and the importance of competing with other retailers also play a big role, she adds. In addition, company sales, the cost of living in an area and a worker's responsibilities contribute to wage decisions, according to Ana Serafin Smith, senior director of media relations at the National Retail Federation (NRF). Still, Smith says that those who earn minimum wage from major retailers may not have to do so for long. ""A majority of those hired in an entry-level position,"" Smith says, citing NRF research, ""reported earning a promotion within a year of employment.""

"Paul Sonn, general counsel, National Employment Law Project",09282017,CNBC,09212017,"With the holiday season approaching, this week Target became the first low-wage chain to announce it will raise pay to $15 an hour. Chief executive Brian Cornell said the decision to raise wages to $15 by 2020 will help Target attract and retain talent as the hyper-competitive retail sector enters its busiest quarter. It also shows the growing impact of the Fight for $15–and puts pressure on other major players like Amazon, Walmart and McDonalds to follow suit. Since striking fast-food workers launched the Fight for $15 in 2012, states and cities comprising more than 18 percent of the U.S. workforce—including Target's home city of Minneapolis—have approved $15 minimum wages. And scores of companies have raised pay to $15, including insurance giants Aetna and Allstate, major hospital chains across the country, and tech leader Facebook for its contracted bus drivers, janitors and security guards. But Target's role as an industry leader in retail—which together with restaurants employs the largest share of workers paid less than $15–illustrates what business strategists have long argued: historically low-paying sectors can make the shift to significantly higher pay. MIT business professor Zeynep Ton has shown how industry leaders like Costco and Trader Joe's provide a roadmap for how investing in retail workers with good wages and benefits goes hand-in-hand with strong growth and productivity. Target's move blows up the claims of corporate lobbyists who argue it's simply not possible for industries like retail and restaurants to pay a $15 minimum wage. In fact,  growing numbers of business owners and economists confirm that a phased-in $15 minimum wage is realistic for employers and will help boost the consumer spending that ultimately drives job growth. But ultimately the imperative to pay a living wage is about our nation's values. As La Colombe CEO Todd Carmichael  argued last week, ""unless you pay your employees a nonpredatory living wage that keeps people and their families above the poverty line, you don't deserve to be in business."" Part of what's driving employers like Target to pay $15 an hour is the simple fact that,  everywhere in America—not just on the coasts-- a single worker will soon need to earn at least that much just to afford the basics. And workers on the coasts or supporting kids will need even more. Yet more than 43 percent of America's workers struggle on less than $15 an hour. Far from teenagers, the median age of the millions of  workers earning less than $15 an hour in the U.S. is 32. They include hospital workers and preschool teachers, auto-parts workers and waitresses. In other words, many of the front line jobs in which U.S. workers today spend their careers pay less than $15 an hour. And we all end up subsidizing those low wages. Low pay by corporations like McDonald's and Walmart cost taxpayers  a whopping $153 billion a year in public assistance to working families, according to a recent study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. A key issue when employers like Target raise pay is what happens to the growing numbers of employees who don't work for them directly but instead through staffing agencies or service contractors. In the Twin Cities, Target has already been a leader in tackling this issue,  agreeing last year to support the efforts of its contracted janitors to unionize and raise their pay substantially. Ensuring that more employers raise standards for contracted and direct employees alike is essential  in our increasingly ""fissured"" workplaces. Low pay is hurting America's working families and holding back our economy, which depends on a thriving consumer class to drive growth. Target's plan to raise pay to $15 an hour over the next 30 months is smart business strategy, and what our nation's workforce and economy need. There's now a bullseye on the back of employers like Amazon, Walmart and McDonalds. They should follow Target's lead. ",Target's $15 an hour move 'blows up' minimum wage myths-commentary

In the final weeks of 2016, Siegel argued that the blue chip stock index was very close to hitting the 20,000 milestone. It broke through that key psychological level on Jan. 25 and since then has soared more than 10 percent. If Siegel is right this time, too, a 10 percent jump would put the Dow around 24,650 and the S&P 500 at 2,760 based on Wednesday's closes. ""There's new hope that taxes really have a chance to be done. I remained steadfast throughout some of the bleak days in the last few months when no one thought anything could be done,"" Siegel added. ""There's a little bit more optimism now. I think a corporate tax deal will be done, and I think that will be positive for the equity market,"" he said. Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.

After founding Playboy magazine in 1953, ""Hef"" built a publishing empire that spanned more than 60 years by featuring photos of nude women, in-depth interviews and the writings of literary luminaries, all instrumental in promoting the sexual revolution. Beyond the magazine, Hefner had an eclectic career that included a chain of Playboy nightclubs across the United States and abroad, a television show called ""Playboy After Dark"" and countless cameos in feature films and television. The following are some of the photos that captured the life and times of the quintessential bachelor who lived in the ultimate bachelor pad known as the Playboy Mansion.

Over the past year, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has been stocking up on online retail outlets. It closed its acquisition of Jet.com about a year ago, and it's since bought four other small online retailers. Wal-Mart's efforts have resulted in huge online sales growth, but its acquisition strategy may be somewhat flawed. Wal-Mart has put the former CEO of Jet.com, Marc Lore, in charge of its online operations in the United States. He recently spoke at a conference, and when asked what Wal-Mart does better than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), he said Wal-Mart's unique assets separate it from the competition. Image source: Wal-Mart Lore pointed specifically to the ""4,600"" stores Wal-Mart operates in the United States as a unique advantage over Amazon. Lore may have been using an old store count, because Wal-Mart says it has 4,741 stores in the U.S. That number is somehow getting larger every year. Roughly 90% of the U.S. population is within 10 miles of a Walmart store. That means Wal-Mart has a big advantage in in-store pickup and online grocery ordering, and has the infrastructure to succeed in shipping items to customers' homes. Indeed, Wal-Mart was able to launch free two-day shipping on its online orders over $35 earlier this year thanks in part to its network of stores. ""We can do 2-hour delivery cheaper than anybody else because of the assets we have,"" Lore said. After purchasing Whole Foods Market, Amazon's physical storefronts still only amount to about 10% of Wal-Mart's. Even with its  network of fulfillment centers, just 44% of the population lived within 20 miles of Amazon's network as of a year ago. Those fulfillment centers naturally have a lot of overlap with Whole Foods locations as they both target high-population areas. Wal-Mart is the nation's largest private employer with 1.5 million employees in the U.S. Lore cites this as an asset, although the larger overhead has been more of a drag for Wal-Mart. Amazon generates twice as much revenue per employee compared to Wal-Mart. Lore has been creative in finding ways to make employees more efficient as Wal-Mart boosts online sales. Not only does the large number of employees allow Wal-Mart to quickly ramp up services like fulfilling online grocery orders in its stores, Lore tested using employees to deliver online orders the last mile to customers' doorsteps. Physical retail necessitates more employees compared to online-only operations like Amazon. Workers need to stock shelves, assist customers in stores, and work the checkout lines. Investors should expect Amazon's revenue-per-employee number to fall after incorporating Whole Foods' numbers into the mix. But those extra employees offer an opportunity to expand a retailer's capabilities. Wal-Mart's biggest success, so far, has been online grocery ordering and pickup. Lore will continue to search for opportunities like that. Lore wasn't afraid to admit where Amazon has Wal-Mart beat -- that's the overall shopping experience on Amazon compared to Walmart. He said it's easier to find the product you want on Amazon, the competitor often has a greater assortment of goods, and the delivery experience is often superior. It's simple to hire a bunch of engineers to hack away at Walmart.com's search and recommendation algorithms to find the products people really want. It's a lot tougher for Wal-Mart to convince certain brands to sell their goods at its stores. Wal-Mart's reputation for low quality keeps it from attracting more high-end brands. That's part of the idea of buying up smaller online outlets like Bonobos and ShoeBuy. It's also made an effort to attract more third-party merchants to its online marketplace. A quality shopping experience is the biggest hurdle for Wal-Mart to really take on Amazon. And as Amazon moves into brick-and-mortar retail, Wal-Mart may start to feel a bit more pressure to get it right. ","

"Timothy Green, Danny Vena, and Keith Speights",09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. To be a successful long-term investor, you need to make sure your portfolio won't implode on the first sign of a rainy day. What seems like a great idea during the best of times will only reveal its true nature during the worst of times. Sticking with companies that can perform well regardless of economic conditions is an effective way to harden your portfolio. Here's why three of our Foolish investors think Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are some of the best rainy-day stocks. Image source: Getty Images. Danny Vena (Wal-Mart): Investors planning for a rainy day should fortify their portfolio with companies that can perform well during periods of economic instability, which is when consumers tend to spend carefully, forgoing their usual shopping habits and opting for lower prices. During the depths of the Great Recession, many shoppers turned to Wal-Mart's ""Always low prices"" to help make ends meet. As the largest retailer in the world, Wal-Mart has unmatched economies of scale. For its fiscal year ended January 2017, it produced revenue of $485.9 billion and operating income of $22.8 billion. Its operating cash flow totaled $31.5 billion, and it returned $8.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchases. Wal-Mart is also a Dividend Aristocrat, having paid a dividend every year since 1974 and boasting 44 years of consecutive increases. It has a dividend that currently yields 2.5% and a healthy payout ratio of 48%, leaving room for future increases. While the company was initially slow to embrace e-commerce, it corrected that last year with its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, as well as a number of other smaller specialty clothiers. As a result, in its most recent quarter the company posted impressive increases in e-commerce sales, which grew 60% over the prior-year quarter, with gross merchandise volume increasing 67% year over year. If you're looking for a stock for a rainy day, consider this: During the bear market that began Oct. 9, 2007, and ended March 9, 2009, while the broader S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) fell 56%, Wal-Mart stock gained 10%. Data by YCharts. Keith Speights (Facebook): What do people do on a rainy day? They stay inside. While inside, there's a pretty good chance that they'll look at social media. And the undisputed king of social media is Facebook. I suspect that the executives at Facebook like it when people stay inside on rainy days, because it increases the amount of time they spend catching up on friends' posts -- and looking at ads. Ads generate 98% of Facebook's revenue. And that revenue is growing, with the company reporting a 47% year-over-year jump in advertising revenue in the second quarter of 2017. This growth stems from two factors. First, Facebook charged 24% more per ad in the last quarter. It can get away with that kind of price boost because it reaches more than 2 billion monthly active users. Second, the company is also increasing the number of ads displayed. More volume at higher prices is a surefire way to make more money. But can buying Facebook stock make you plenty of money? I think so. Wall Street projects that Facebook will achieve average annual earnings growth over the next five years of nearly 27%. That's a drop from the heady growth of past years, but it's still an impressive level. That growth makes Facebook's valuation look pretty reasonable as well. Facebook isn't just a leader in social media. It's also a leader in artificial intelligence and augmented reality, two of the hottest trends in technology today. Buying Facebook stock is a way of investing in these two trends. That's a pretty smart way, in my view, to use time on a rainy day so that your financial future isn't stormy. Tim Green (Microsoft): Software giant Microsoft has changed quite a bit over the past few years. It's embraced cloud computing, building its Azure cloud platform into a strong No. 2 player. It's dropped its Windows-centric position, building first-class apps for Android and iOS. And it's building an increasing amount of hardware, from its Surface tablets and laptop to its HoloLens augmented reality headset. But what hasn't changed about Microsoft is its dominant position in the productivity software market. Businesses depend on Office, Outlook, and other Microsoft products, and that's likely to remain true regardless of the state of the economy. Office is still the company's cash cow, despite serious competition from Alphabet's Google. While Microsoft is heavily investing in growth businesses like cloud computing, the company is still producing impressive profits. During fiscal 2017, Microsoft generated $21.2 billion of net income on $90.0 billion of revenue. Meanwhile, Azure revenue is doubling year over year, and Office 365 commercial, the subscription version of Office, is growing by more than 40% annually. Microsoft is in an enviable position, with dominant businesses like Office throwing off cash, allowing the company to invest in newer businesses that will act as its growth engine for years to come. Through the good times and the bad, Microsoft should continue to produce exceptional results. ","

Target (NYSE:TGT) made news earlier this week by making public plans to increase its minimum hourly wage for all employees to $11 in October. The chain also pledged to increase wages to a $15-per-hour minimum by 2020. The company said in a press release that a ""significant investment in its team will allow Target to continue to recruit and retain strong team members."" It comes at a time when unemployment sits near historic lows and the idea of a $15-an-hour minimum wage has become a huge topic of national debate. Target's move follows its previous wage hike to a $10 an hour minimum in 2016. It also follows efforts from its chief rival, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), to raise wages. In February 2016 the company pledged to pay any employees hired before Jan. 1, 2016 at $10 an hour and that any workers hired after that would receive at least $9 an hour, with their rate increasing to at least $10 upon completion of a training program. Target has increased the minimum hourly wage for its employees. Image source: Target. Only two states -- Massachusetts and Washington -- have $11-an-hour minimum wages. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia, however, have a minimum wage that exceeds the federal standard of $7.25. In his remarks in the press release Target's CEO Brian Cornell framed the move as being about making life better for his chain's workers. Target has always offered market competitive wages to our team members. With this latest commitment, we'll be providing even more meaningful pay, as well as the tools, training and support our team needs to build their skills, develop professionally and offer the service and expertise that set Target apart. That's, of course, a piece of it, but the reality is that changing market conditions dictate the increase. With unemployment standing at 4.4% in August, near historic lows, the reality is Target needs to pay more to attract workers. An employee who makes $11 an hour for a 40-hour week would earn $22,800 a year. That's less than the average annual wages for cashiers ($27,701) and warehouse associates ($40,784), according to GlassDoor's most-recent Local Pay Reports. Of course, those reports offer the average of all workers in those positions, not the minimum hourly starting wage. Target's starting pay will also be less than the $14.21 an hour the average Costco cashier makes and less than the $12.42 an Amazon fulfillment associate earns per hour, according to GlassDoor salary reviews. That data is based on 158 Costco employees reporting their earnings to the jobs data website and 683 Amazon warehouse workers doing the same. The new rate, however, is very competitive in other areas of the market. Starting workers at $11 an hour does put Target well ahead of the $8.41 to $8.61 an hour the average McDonald's crew member or cashier makes. Target's starting salary will also be more than the average Starbucks barista makes ($9.55 to $9.57), and more than Sears ($8.37 to $8.54) and J.C. Penney ($9.04 to $9.07) associates and cashiers, according to what was reported to GlassDoor. In the retail world, especially when it comes to entry-level positions, small differences in salary can be the difference between someone taking a job or electing to go elsewhere. Competitive pay can also help a company retain employees, lowering its long-term training costs while also improving customer service. Heading into a time when it and many of its rivals are hiring for the holidays, Target has given itself a leg up on the competition. By paying more than the competition, the retailer should have an easier time hiring and holding onto the employees it needs. That should improve the in-store experience for customers and help the company meet its Q4 goals. The company's long-range wage increases will help it build an ongoing foundation of well-trained, experienced employees. ","
      
    How Much Do Retailers Actually Pay Hourly Workers? -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In the 1980s and even the 1990s, Toys R Us was a place children begged their parents to take them. The chain had a selection of toys that dwarfed what was sold at now-defunct department store chains like Ames, Caldor, and Bradlees. Even its Sunday newspaper inserts were an event, and its holiday season ""toy book"" was much perused by children in order to pick out what gifts they planned to ask for. Toys R Us' slow path to bankruptcy, which it filed on Sept. 18, did not begin with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). It started with chains like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) creating toy departments that not only pushed prices (and margins) lower, but also made it so a visit to Toys R Us was no longer unique. Wal-Mart and Target made Toys R Us less of a destination and gave parents a way to placate their kids while also doing their own shopping. Toys R Us has filed for bankruptcy. Image source: Getty Images. For two years, I ran the largest toy and hobby store in New England. We had a Toys R Us, a Target, and a Wal-Mart within a couple of miles of us. We were also in a relatively remote location while our toy-selling rivals were closer to the highway and near a major mall. Despite those deficits and the fact that we were generally more expensive than the chains we competed with, we thrived. The mistake Toys R Us has made is that it has done very little to differentiate itself from its department store rivals. My former toy store, which is doing well to this day, did much more than sell toys, hobby items, model trains, and more. It actively gave customers a reason to visit. We hosted gaming events, tournaments, and learn-to-play classes for everything from the easiest children's games to the most complicated collectible offerings. We also had multiple huge model train sets that were shown off for free twice a month, and every Sunday during the holiday season. Those trains were maintained and built by clubs that met in the store. During weekdays, we had story time for children, and on holidays, we barbecued, made cotton candy, or handed out special treats to our customers. Even when nothing was happening, we had play areas for little kids, model-building areas for all ages, and a near-endless supply of curios we picked up in theory to sell, but just as much to give customers something to look at. We also had a customer-first attitude where we welcomed everyone warmly, treated regulars like family, and accepted that sometimes we were going to teach a customer about a product only for them to buy it cheaper on Amazon. Our store also had merchandise that wouldn't be found at a Toys R Us or a department store, as well as staff that was passionate about what they sold. Toys R Us had the tools and the space to be all of those things, but either arrogance or complacency stopped it from evolving. Once simply having toys stopped making it a destination for kids and toy lovers, the chain needed to do more. CEO David Brandon acknowledged that in the bankruptcy filing, explaining how the company would change its stores. ""Once these initiatives are implemented, Toys R Us stores will be interactive spaces with rooms to use for parties, live product demonstrations put on by trained employees, and the freedom for employees to remove product from boxes to let kids play with the latest toys,"" he said. That's the model that would have worked all along. It's a game Target and Wal-Mart are unlikely to play, and one that Amazon, for obvious reasons, can't. Bankruptcy may clear some debt and let the company shed some leases, but it needs to change in order to avoid slowly falling right back into the same hole. Toys R Us has to go from being a place that sells toys and games to one that's full of activities, experiences, and discoveries for kids and adults alike. The chain needs to transform from store to destination -- if it does that, then sales will follow. ","

It wasn't so long ago that investors couldn't buy enough of Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR): Between 2013 and 2015, the stock rose an astonishing 217%. Yet since January 2016, Kroger's shares have lost 50% of their value. Over the last 18 months, Kroger's comparable quarterly sales, excluding fuel sales, have shifted from healthy growth in the mid-single digits to a complete standstill. In the final quarter of 2016, the company saw its 13-year streak of comparable sales growth snap, as comps declined for the first time in 53 quarters. Kroger is cuing up a comps revival, but for now, progress is wan. Management projects just a slight expansion in this metric of 0.5% to 1% for the second half of the current fiscal year. The culprit, of course, is fierce competition among grocers for customers. And it will only intensify: 2018 promises to ring in a battle royale within the grocery industry. Whole Foods Market will present a distinct online retailing challenge once new owner Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) integrates the organic chain's loyalty program with its Amazon Prime service. As for brick-and-mortar developments, privately held German discount grocers Aldi and Lidl will open 500 new stores in the U.S. between them by the end of 2018 alone, as Aldi seeks to expand and Lidl builds on its 2017 entry on the east coast. In a pre-emptive response to the European invasion, Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) -- never an easy grocer to undercut -- is already allowing its gross margin to slip in 2017 in order to ""invest in price."" These pitched battles, both online and in midsized and major metropolitan areas, are occurring just as shopping habits undergo significant change. The Food Marketing Institute has been tracking grocery industry trends for decades. Last year, its ""U.S. Grocery Shopper Report"" confirmed what many of us have experienced personally: Shoppers are splitting their grocery buys over a number of different store types and channels. In fact, the report showed that in each of the preceding three years, a ""significant"" number of shoppers (between 7% and 9%) no longer claimed loyalty to a primary grocery store. That's a problem for Kroger, which operates as a conventional grocer in an increasingly specialized world. It's not a premium grocer like Whole Foods, nor a deep-discounter like Aldi or Lidl. The company instead has existed as a traditional supermarket which uses high customer engagement and sheer proximity to customers (with approximately 2,800 stores spread across 35 states) to drive traffic. Image source: Getty Images. To keep comps from treading water, which won't be kind to its stock price, Kroger has a complex task ahead. The company will have to stay focused, avoid overreaching for desperate solutions, and double down on its very formidable core strengths. Read through a recent earnings call transcript, or browse the company's quarterly earnings reports, and you'll be reminded of the slate of advantages that propelled Kroger, not many quarters ago, to brisk comps growth. I'll summarize them briefly as follows: Think of the advantages above as a sort of body armor Kroger constructed over the last few years as competitors refined their individual niches and prepared to attack on price and differentiation. Now's the time to wear that armor in the battle to protect market share and build comps. This month, CEO Rodney McMullen said emphatically in an earnings conference call that the grocer is ""not going to lose on price."" Cutting prices is simple, but retaining customers on price alone is not. A more sustainable strategy is to shift more resources away from price investment, and toward the manufacturing, brand, and technology investments which boost inherent advantages. To stabilize in this environment and grow again, Kroger needs to push its Simple Truth line. It should expand private-label brands that contribute to higher profits. It should continue to embrace online shopping, and dial up the use of analytics to retain customers and incentivize shopping frequency. In reaffirming its strengths, Kroger will reaffirm its identity to its customers.

The fourth quarter has become a sort of retail free-for-all where stores try increasingly desperate tactics to lure in customers. From opening on Thanksgiving Day to heavy discounts and aggressive promotions, retailers pull out all the stops. That makes sense because the importance of the period seems to grow each year. In 2017, early predictions from Deloitte show that total holiday sales, excluding automobiles and gasoline, will reach $1.04 trillion to $1.05 trillion between November and January, up from $1 trillion last year. And while the digital portion of overall sales has grown, e-commerce sales will only account for $111 billion to $114 billion of that total -- an 18%-21% increase over $93.8 billion in 2016. Servicing all of those sales requires workers. In Q4, really toward the end of Q3 in September, many retail and retail-adjacent companies have traditionally hired a lot of people. This list will expand as the season gets closer, but there are a lot of jobs out there in a market that's already near historically high employment rates. Unlike last year, these jobs may not be easy to fill, a fact that has already caused Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) to decide against hiring temporary workers. Instead, the retailer will fill its need by offering overtime to existing employees. Some of the companies on this list may end up following Wal-Mart's lead if they can't find enough qualified applicants, but for now, here's the list of companies that are hiring and how many people they need. Retailers will be hiring tens of thousands of workers for the holiday season. Image source: Target. Even though Wal-Mart has elected to sit out the hiring season, most of its rivals have different plans. There will literally be hundreds of thousands of openings in everything from front-end, consumer-facing positions, to backroom warehouse jobs, and digital fulfillment positions: These are not the only retailers with holiday hiring plans, just the ones that have come forward so far. Kohl's, Nordstrom, and many other chains are planning to add workers. In many ways, it's a job-seeker's market, with applicants being able to weigh things like pay and benefits against the possibility of becoming a permanent hire when deciding where to apply. The rise of digital sales has put tremendous pressure on the companies that deliver online orders. The United States Postal Service (USPS) has posted job listings in a number of markets looking for both seasonal and permanent workers. The number of openings varies based on the market, but the overall job count seems significant. Not to be outdone by the government, both United Parcel Service and FedEx plan to hire. UPS plans to add about 95,000 seasonal workers, while its rival hopes to hire 50,000 while also offering more overtime for existing employees. In many cases seasonal jobs go to college kids, people working a second gig, or those not looking to enter the workforce full-time. For those seeking permanent employment, however, a seasonal job can be a way to get your foot in the door at a company you want to work at. Every company on this list has both full and seasonal openings, but if your goal is a permanent job, it may be best to take seasonal work at a thriving company. Amazon, for example, is likely to keep more temporary workers than Toys R Us or Macy's simply given the trajectory of their businesses. Still, a chain like Target may be facing challenges, but it's doing well enough that exceptional seasonal workers can probably find a full-time, permanent job after the holiday season. ","

Like solar and wind power, many alternative energy advocates have touted the potential of hydrogen power for years. Investors in fuel cell companies like Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) are still waiting, however, for the inflection point that marks the company's transition to sustained profitability. Perhaps in 2017, though, that time has come. Rising 128% in 2017 as of this writing, Plug Power has delighted the market -- unlike in 2016 -- with several announcements, suggesting that the tide has turned. Thanks in part to a deal with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), fuel cell fever is working its way through Wall Street. Indicating a bullish outlook on the stock, analysts at FBR Capital and Cowen have each identified a $3 price target on the stock. Moreover, an analyst at the investment bank Rodman and Renshaw issued a $4 price target. But Wall Street's enthusiasm doesn't necessarily mean investors should start powering their portfolios with this fuel cell industry leader. Image source: Getty Images. To say that news of the company's deal with Amazon was well received would be a gross understatement. Shares soared more than 60% in April -- the month in which the announcement was made -- and the stock hasn't looked back, continuing to climb ever since. What fed the fervor? For one, Plug Power's management expects the deal to add $70 million to the company's top line in 2017. This is no small sum considering the company reported $86 million in revenue in the prior year. Besides the deal with Amazon, Plug Power pleased investors with its second-quarter earnings report. Management announced a new agreement with long-term partner Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), with an estimated the contract value to be $70 million. And speaking to its fiscal 2017 finances, it was quite optimistic, estimating negative free cash flow of $25 million to $35 million. Additionally, the company expects further progress in its pursuit of profitability, and is forecasting an expansion in its fiscal 2017 gross margin (excluding the impact of warrants issued to Amazon and Wal-Mart) to 8% to 12%; the fiscal 2016 gross margin was only 4.6%. In terms of the stock, because it's unprofitable, we can't use the traditional price-to-earnings metric to value shares, so let's consider the price-to-sales ratio. Shares are trading around 5.4 times sales, slightly higher than the stock's 5.2 average, but those who are optimistic about the company's future could certainly shrug off this seemingly high price tag. Despite the deal with Amazon and an improvement in some areas of its financials, the bear argument for Plug Power remains strong. Image source: Getty Images For one, management's forecast for its fiscal 2017 performance must be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism since it doesn't have a great track record of meeting its guidance. In 2013, it estimated Plug Power would break even on an EBITDA basis by the second or third quarter of 2014. Slightly off, the company reported an EBITDA loss of $84 million in 2014 according to Morningstar. Last year, during its Q1 2016 presentation, it announced a gross margin goal exceeding 12% for fiscal 2016. The company instead reported a gross margin of 4.6%, thereby coming up quite short. Management, furthermore, set an operating cash flow target of negative $20 million. Again missing the target, it reported negative $30 million in operating cash flow in fiscal 2016. PLUG R&D to Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Accounting for 28% of revenue in the trailing 12 months, revenue earmarked for R&D will likely remain a large obstacle on the road to profitability as the company pursues development of its ProGen prototypes for both the domestic and Chinese markets. Predicated on a future where hydrogen has supplanted traditional fuels, picking up shares of Plug Power at this point remains too risky. As one who's been enthusiastic about alternative power for years, I'd be more than happy to add Plug Power to my portfolio. Unfortunately, trust issues regarding its management team still persist, and the failure to translate top-line growth to the bottom line remains a concern. Unless the stock nosedives and reaches rock-bottom prices or the company remedies its issues, I'll be rooting for Plug Power from the sidelines. ","

Jeff Vande Hey,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In the past three years, iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) has pulled off a truly impressive feat. During that time, the maker of home robotics has increased its revenue by nearly 40% while simultaneously reducing its revenue sources. Specifically, the company eliminated $55 million in revenue and pulled out its very roots by divesting its military segment in 2016 and recently discontinued one of its four product lines in the home robotics category, a gutter cleaning line called the Looj. IRBT Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. How then, has the company been able to increase revenue at such a rapid pace? By absolutely dominating in its top product category, that's how! In 2002, iRobot essentially invented the robotic vacuum cleaning market with the launch of the first Roomba. For a decade and a half, Roomba has been the king of robotic vacuum cleaners, especially in the United States, where it holds a jaw-dropping 88% market share. However, it is no longer the only game in town. Let's take a look at the evidence and decide whether there are any companies ready to challenge iRobot's leadership in the fast-growing robotic vacuum cleaner market. It is hard to fathom that any competitor would be able to overtake iRobot in global market share in the near future. iRobot's current position compared to that of its closest rival is simply too dominant: Data source: iRobot. Chart by author. However, just because a competitor can't take the No. 1 spot doesn't mean it can't meaningfully affect iRobot's top and bottom lines, and by extension, its stock price. Let's look further at two companies that might have the potential to do just that. Image source: Ecovacs SharkNinja: SharkNinja is a newcomer to the robotic floor-cleaning market, but it is certainly no stranger to consumers. The company's Ninja Blender has been ranked the No. 1 blender three years in a row in the U.S.,and its upright vacuum cleaners have claimed the No. 1 spot in U.S. market share. Earlier this month, SharkNinja began selling the Shark ION Robot 750. While it's too early to know for sure how big of a splash SharkNinja will make in the market, it's likely the company has big plans. With iRobot's stock dropping 15% after a short-seller said the competitor's entrance to the market posed ""a credible threat,"" it's safe to say shareholders agree. Only time will tell if iRobot will be able to continue growing revenue and earnings at a rapid clip with increasing competition trying to get a bigger share of the pie. We do know that iRobot's management believes its patent portfolio is a huge part of its competitive moat. The other safeguard iRobot may have is a fast-growing market. At a recent investor conference, management stated that the immediately addressable market for robotic vacuums is two to three times the currently installed base and that 700% market growth is expected over the long term. If the market for robotic floor cleaners grows fast enough, it is possible iRobot could lose market share and still grow revenue and profits significantly. At the same time, competition is increasing as we speak. Robotic vacuum cleaners at lower price points have essentially become commoditized home appliances. Amazon's ""robotic vacuums"" product selection numbers in the hundreds, and iRobot estimates that 20% of all vacuums worldwide are robotic -- and more than 30% of those are made by its competitors. With that level of competition already existing for lower-end products, if Ecovacs or Shark Ninja can chip away at market share on the premium lines (which management defines as vacuums costing $200 or above), it's only a matter of time before iRobot's absolute dominance comes to an end.

Motley Fool Staff,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A full transcript follows the video. Mac Greer: Let's begin with, frankly, a retailer that I have pretty much forgotten is still around -- Bed Bath & Beyond. Wow, Bed Bath & Beyond taking a bath on Wednesday. Shares down more than 14% after the company lowered its earnings outlook and reported weaker-than-expected earnings. David Kretzmann, I go to you. Is Bed Bath & Beyond beyond repair? Is there anything you can do to save this? David Kretzmann: What hurts here is, the stores aren't performing that well, but on the financial side of things, management has done more to add gasoline to that bad fire overall. If you go back to 2014, from a financial perspective, the company looked like it was in decent shape. It was producing over $1 billion in free cash flow annually, had $850 million in net cash on the balance sheet, so they had cash in the bank, they were producing a lot more cash to add to that tally. But that year, they decided to issue $1.5 billion in new debt just to buy back stock. They essentially went into more debt, bought back a lot of stock, and now a few years later the company has over $1 billion in net debt, and their free cash flow production has almost been cut in half to about $570 million. So that's a bleak direction to be going within just a few years. They've really been focusing on buying back stock, they haven't done a whole lot to improve the actual in-store experience, and what they have done has been very slow. They are making some progress with their digital sales, which now make up about 15% of total revenue. They say that their ""differentiated products,"" which they consider their exclusive products, personalizable products, makes up about half of sales, so I think that's probably an area where they really need to double down and find some way to differentiate what they're offering and how they offer it from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other retailers that are still out there. They've also made some acquisitions into new brick-and-mortar retail concepts. They bought a website, personalizationmall.com, late last year, where you can buy and personalize a lot of different items. Going that route makes the most sense to me. It's not a stock I would buy, even though it looks very cheap-looking at these trailing metrics. But I think management has made some very poor cash management decisions over the past few years, and in the meantime, the actual performance of the stores leaves a lot to be desired. Aaron Bush: Yeah, one tidbit that I keep on coming back to for Bed Bath & Beyond and for other struggling retailers is, when a brick-and-mortar store tries to add a quality e-commerce operation, not only does it tend to cause its physical stores to struggle more, but it makes the company increasingly expensive to run, because they have to duplicate the cost just to serve that same customer. So you do see them making really dumb decisions with debt, and adding new retail concepts, which feels more like a distraction than anything. But just the fundamental structure of how the economics work, and managing an in-store presence and an online presence isn't very friendly. And they've been really slow to do this. But now that they are invested in it, it's another reason that's adding a margin drag and keeping earnings lower. Greer: Do you think, in terms of those traditional retailers adding that online piece, I see why you would want to do it. Everyone's trying to fend off Amazon. You have to try anything. So you have Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) with the Jet acquisition. Do you think that's going to work for Wal-Mart? Or, to take your logic even further, if you're Wal-Mart, do you stick to your knitting, which is just bread-and-butter traditional retailers? Bush: I think for Wal-Mart and Jet, I think it was smart to acquire Jet, not for Jet itself, but more for the talent that is in that management team. And I know, I'm blanking on his name ... Marc Lore, who was the head of Jet, now runs Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations. So I think that was smart. What Wal-Mart really needs to do is continue to acquire things and really build up a big suite of an online presence. When it comes to e-commerce, aggregation is increasingly important, so you either have to dominate a niche, or you have to be someone that you can go to for anything and everything. So it's tough. Wal-Mart might be able to pull it off, Amazon is definitely pulling it off, but for someone like Bed Bath & Beyond it's a hard spot. Kretzmann: I think what Aaron mentioned highlights why it's so difficult for these brick-and-mortar retailers to pivot more to online or omnichannel sales because it tends to be more expensive to operate both rather than one or the other. But there is some value to the omnichannel experience. You see Amazon clearly showing a lot of interest in opening up their own brick-and-mortar stores, acquiring Whole Foods. So there is value there. But for a lot of these companies, I think it will be a short-term ding, but it's probably what they need to do to stay relevant and figure out some way to hopefully improve the economics over time, one way or another, whether it's offering more personalized services or some sort of consultation. We're going to talk about Best Buy today. They're trying to do something along those lines. But in the short term, the company needs to stomach those short-term dings if they want to stay relevant with competitors like Amazon. Greer: So, Bed Bath & Beyond shares a lot cheaper today than they were yesterday, but you're still not interested? Kretzmann: Based on management's track record, both managing the stores and how they've been trying to pivot those stores, I think they've been lackluster there. And they've also really jeopardized the company's financial position, because you're not going to go bankrupt if you don't have debt, and they completely pivoted the whole balance sheet a few years ago to buy back stock, which, in hindsight, looks like a very dumb move. Shares have continued dropping since then, so that was a poor investment, and a very poor reason to go into debt. So, from a financial position now, the company's future is in a lot more jeopardy now. So I would stay on the sidelines here. Greer: So, five years from now, are they still a going concern? Are they still around? Kretzmann: I think they're still around but they're probably getting pretty close to bankruptcy, at the rate they're going now. ","

He expects gold prices to reach $1,400 before the end of the year. With President Donald Trump “in the White House and the political situation in the U.S. and globally more uncertain than it has been in many years, gold will almost certainly continue to see robust safe-haven demand,” he said. “This should push gold higher in the coming months.” Recent military tensions between North Korea and the U.S. and its allies has helped to underpin gold’s haven status as a hedge against a sudden escalation in geopolitical tension. According to media reports Monday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told reporters that Trump’s tweet that leader Kim Jong Un “won’t be around much longer” was a declaration of war, and Japanese leader Shinzo Abe on Monday called a snap general election in a bid to consolidate power in the midst of a diplomatic crisis with North Korea.

The two markets often move inversely as a weaker dollar can make commodities pegged to the currency, including most of the world’s gold, more appealing to buyers using weaker monetary units. The dollar strengthened against the euro, which was under pressure after a heavy drop in support for mainstream parties in Germany’s general election on Sunday left the way forward in doubt for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative alliance.

Higher rates not only boost the dollar but can dull the appeal of nonyielding bullion.

Ryan Vlastelica,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 27, 2017 11:12 a.m. ET Only 77% of the average S&P 500 component’s shares trade on fundamentals now, compared with 95% a decade ago By The massive adoption of passive products, particularly exchange-traded funds, is having a pronounced impact on the stock market, but in ways that may not be apparent to the average investor, according to Goldman Sachs. “One unintended consequence from the relentless inflow of passive is the liquidity profiles of stocks—even those with related fundamentals—now look vastly different,” wrote Goldman analysts led by options strategist Katherine Fogertey, in a note to clients. Passive products allow investors to hold all the components of an index like the Russell 2000

That’s in contrast to actively managed funds, where the securities are individually selected by a portfolio manager. The shift away from active and into passive has been dramatic, driven by both the lower cost and historically better performance of passive funds. According to Morningstar, passive funds attracted inflows of $428.7 billion over 2016, while actively managed funds saw outflows of $285.2 billion, a trend that has occurred for nearly 10 years.

                                   products have been in particular demand. According to FactSet, fully one-seventh of the nearly $4.2 trillion in global ETF assets are in funds tracking the benchmark U.S. equity index. The result of that is that passive funds now own an average of 17% of each component of the S&P 500, per Goldman’s data (the range is as little as 10%, and as much as 35%), whereas passive ownership was “a rounding error” a decade ago. Vanguard alone has at least a 5% stake in 468 components of the S&P 500, according to a June report in The Wall Street Journal, up from just three components in 2005. Read more: Investors flock to Vanguard funds, dump Goldman, Wells Fargo, and others Also: Vanguard calls for more diverse corporate boards, better climate-change disclosures As buying and selling index-funds essentially means buying and selling every component of the underlying index, “less trading is stemming from views on company fundamentals,” Goldman wrote. “Passive holders trade stock for different reasons than active managers, and at different frequencies. Passive’s decision to buy or sell stocks is often directed by broader fund flows and larger rebalances and not typically company specific fundamentals.” The investment bank calculated that for the average S&P 500 company, the share of its stock that might trade on fundamental views has dropped to 77% compared with 95% a decade ago. Those figures are based on a measure Goldman calls “passive-adjusted float,” or the number of shares outstanding minus both restricted holdings and passive holdings. “The impact on portfolio construction, alpha and trading are not fully appreciated by investors,” Fogertey wrote. Alpha refers to outperformance over a benchmark. Earlier this month, UBS analysts wrote that worries over the impact passive investing and ETFs would have on price discovery and liquidity were “misguided.” The firm noted that while passive funds comprise 46% of total ETF and mutual fund assets, they only accounted for 8% of the overall global equity market value. “If the investment landscape were limited to ETFs and mutual funds, it may warrant the current level of attention,” they wrote. “However, the investment landscape is far more expansive than just ETFs and mutual funds. There are hedge funds, separately managed accounts, and equities managed by other institutional investors and households that should factor into the analysis.” Read more: Relax, Wall Street: ETFs aren’t the root of all evil Related: Don’t blame ETFs or passive investors for high valuations Nonetheless, the impact of this factor depends on the specific security, as “passive ownership varies in both size and scope even within sectors.” Roughly 30% of the float of energy firm ONEOK

Jeffry Bartash,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 25, 2017 1:00 p.m. ET Economists see small Trump boost, still-low inflation, NABE says By The U.S. economy these days is like an old and reliable car. It’s not going to set any speed records but it’s also not going to break down and leave people stranded. That sums up the latest quarterly outlook by the nation’s most prominent business economists. They predict the U.S. will only grow a touch faster in 2018 — around 2.4% compared to an estimated 2.2% this year. Part of the fuel for faster growth in 2018 are expected tax reductions and spending increases by the Trump White House, according to the National Association of Business Economists. Yet economists also believe there’s just a one-in-four chance of a recession in the next two years, “A large majority of the panel views a near-term recession as highly unlikely,” said Kevin Swift, vice president elect of the NABE. The largely worry-free view of the economy stems from it’s mild rate of growth. The U.S. historically has grown more than 3% a year and at times even faster, but in the absence of such high rates of growth, dangerous imbalances apparently have failed to materialize. The slower rate of growth since the end of the 2007-2009 recession — the U.S. has expanded around 2% a year — also means the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates as high as it normally does. Past recessions have often been caused in part by the central bank raising the cost of borrowing quickly or aggressively. The Fed’s benchmark short-term interest rate, known as fed funds, now ranges from 1% to 1.25%. The NABE predicts the fed funds rate will rise to 2.125% by the end of 2018, but that’s still quite low by historical standards. The more immediate threats to the economy, NABE respondents said, could come from: • A war over free trade that leads to sharp restrictions: • A big reversal in surging U.S. stock markets; • Or tight immigration rules that limit the supply of labor in a time of growing manpower shortages. Inflation is not much of a danger, the NABE said. Economist predict annual prices increases will top out at no more than 1.9% in 2018, using the Fed’s preferred PCE inflation gauge. Also Read: Watch this inflation number to see where interest rates go next The now familiar constraints on the economy’s pace of growth are unlikely to ease much, the NABE said. Worker pay, business investment and productivity should all rise in 2018, but not at a rate strong enough to push U.S. growth above 3%. A lift could come from White House plans to cut taxes and improve public works . But economists are skeptical it will add a big boost — no more than 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points. The last time the U.S. grew at least 3% was in 2005. The current 12-year stretch of sub-3% growth is the longest on record. The flip side is, a recovery now nine years old could end up becoming the longest on record if the economy avoids a downturn in the next two years. The current expansion will turn 99 months old at the end of September. The record is 120 months from 1991 to 2001. ",U.S. economy likely to speed up in 2018 but not shatter any records - MarketWatch
Claudia Assis,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 28, 2017 7:27 a.m. ET Analysts take a deep dive in Tesla’s cash burn By Investors have given Tesla Inc. a vote of confidence despite the Silicon Valley’s car maker billion-dollar cash burn, but a botched Model 3 roll-out could trigger a “moment of panic” in the market, leading to a possible share-price plunge and drying-up of liquidity. That’s from analysts at Bernstein, who took a deep dive into Tesla’s cash burn, which they estimate will have reached a cumulative $10.6 billion by the end of the year. “Bears argue that this level of capital spending is unprecedented and that Tesla will inevitably run out of cash. Meanwhile, bulls argue that Tesla’s spending is par for course among high-growth companies,” the Bernstein analysts said.

Read more: Tesla car population will explode within a few years, Morgan Stanley says They kept the equivalent of a neutral rating on Tesla, with a target price of $265, which would represent a downside around 23% from Wednesday prices. For Tesla, it will all come down to how well the company rolls out the Model 3, the electric sedan the company unveiled in late July. Model 3 deliveries are expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter. Tesla’s $60 billion valuation can be interpreted as a “vote of confidence from the market,” as long as Tesla’s near-team growth stays intact and investors believe profits will follow, the Bernstein analysts said. Investors “will continue to supply liquidity and overlook Tesla’s cash burn, just as they historically did” with Wal-Mart and Home Depot, they said. Related: Tesla will be a money-losing business until 2020, analyst says “However, even if we can disregard Tesla’s cash burn, we continue to worry about the company’s ability to deliver upon its long-term vision of profitability. Specifically, we worry about whether Tesla can successfully build the mass-market Model 3,” the analysts said. That means launching the sedan with good gross margins, good quality, and on time, with gross margins a key element as they set the baseline for Tesla’s future profitability, they said.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc is testing a service to stock groceries directly to customers’ refrigerators as it seeks to take on e-commerce giant Amazon.com. The delivery of groceries and meal kits is emerging as the next frontier of competition among retailers. The world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer said on Friday it is partnering with August Home, a provider of smart locks and  home accessories, to test the service with certain customers in the Silicon Valley. (bit.ly/2ffqqvT) The grocery business is set to be upended through Amazon’s acquisition of upmarket grocer Whole Foods last month and the online retailer is also entrenching itself more deeply in the restaurants business. Amazon Restaurants on Friday teamed up with online food ordering company Olo whose network of restaurants includes Applebee’s and Chipotle. The partnership will help Olo’s restaurant customers connect with Amazon’s delivery services. The competition in the meal-kits business is also heating up. Supermarket operator Albertsons Cos Inc said it would buy meal-kit delivery service Plated while rival Kroger-owned Ralphs started selling meal kits in stores this week. ONE-TIME PASSCODE DELIVERY As part of the test, Wal-Mart delivery persons gain access to a customer’s house using a pre-authorized one-time passcode and put away groceries in the fridge and other items in the foyer. Homeowners would receive notifications when the delivery is in progress and could also watch the real-time process from their home security cameras through the August Home app. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has been exploring new methods of delivery and in June said it was testing using its own store employees to deliver packages ordered online.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Maria has devastated the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, another blow to its already precarious economic situation. Puerto Rico’s government owes $72 billion to bondholders, and an additional $50 billion in pension obligations to teachers and almost all other government employees. In May, it filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. The following are responses from multinational companies on how they are dealing with the aftermath of Maria: WAL-MART STORES INC Phillip Keene, Wal-Mart’s director of corporate communications, said, “Like many businesses, we are working to assess any damage to our facilities as we are safely able to access them and working to connect with our associates to assess what their needs are so we can support as appropriate. We are planning to open facilities very thoughtfully, starting with limited hours at our Sam’s Club near San Juan, perhaps as soon as Sunday. One of our Amigo stores has already reopened under limited hours on the south side of San Juan as of this morning. “Walmart operates 48 retail facilities, a distribution center and a satellite headquarters in Puerto Rico, supported by more than 14,700 associates across the Island. At this time, we are trying to best understand the impacts of Hurricane Maria to Puerto Rico, but it’s been a slow process due to widespread power outages and communication issues. We have activated the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the Walmart Home Office in Bentonville, Arkansas, to support our associates in Puerto Rico. The EOC is Walmart’s centralized platform for crisis coordination. In the EOC, we work directly with logistics, store operations and other teams within the business to ensure we’re aligned on our support plans. “We have been in contact with leaders on the Island and continue to be in regular contact with FEMA and the American Red Cross. Our first priority is, and continues to be, the safety of our associates - taking care of them and their families. We are working rapidly to account for our associates, through store and HR leadership as well as social media, local radio and other channels. These efforts will continue. “Although our normal assessment process has been impeded a bit by road conditions and flooding, we are currently working to identify the status of our facilities on the Island. Our Merchandising, Replenishment, Supply Chain and Logistics teams are working to ensure we have critical supplies and product headed to the island via shipping vessels that are slated to depart as soon as Friday (Sept. 22). This is in addition to the shipment of water that was sent toward the island earlier this week, which is currently staged at sea awaiting clearance to safely enter port. We will continue to assess the right flow and mix of merchandise and supplies to send to Puerto Rico in the coming days and weeks.” Tammy Hull, communications manager at Eli Lilly, said: “Lilly has two manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico as well as an affiliate office and sales team. Safety of our employees is our primary concern. The small team of employees who stayed onsite during the storm are safe. We are still accounting for all employees, which is a slow process due to power and communications loss on the island. We are currently assessing our facilities to determine if any damage occurred. Lilly follows emergency procedures that enable us to maintain adequate inventory at our manufacturing sites around the world to ensure a reliable supply of medicine for patients.” Kristen Davis, senior manager of corporate communications at Amgen, said: “Our first priority is the safety of our colleagues and their families. The vast majority of staff at our Amgen Manufacturing Limited (AML) site in Juncos were sent home prior to Maria making landfall, with only a limited number of colleagues remaining on site to monitor operations. At the moment, we are still working to determine the safety of our people and are hopeful that all will be well. At the same time, we are executing on a comprehensive and well-rehearsed business continuity plan for the site itself. Based on what we know at the moment, we are confident there will be no product supply disruptions for patients around the world. Of course, we will work diligently to ensure drug supply for patients in Puerto Rico and to return our operations in Puerto Rico to normal as quickly as possible.” Michele Meixell, head of external communications and affairs at AstraZeneca, said: “Given the early nature of the disaster, we are still in the process of gathering more information, but I can tell you what we know so far. Our Puerto Rico employee base consists of approximately 250 colleagues. This represents both field-based employees as well as those working in our manufacturing facility located in Canovanas. “Right now our number one priority remains the safety and health of our employees and their families. At this point, it’s still early to understand the full impact to our site, but we have started the process to assess our facility. The site does have backup power capabilities and we have a storm crew in limited operation right now until employees are able to safely return to work. In advance of the storm, the facility took appropriate precautions and we have business continuity plans in place to ensure our medicines continue in production. “We do not anticipate interruption in supply at this time. I also want to point out that while our Puerto Rico site is of critical importance to our organization, we have manufacturing facilities all over the globe producing medicines, so in terms of overall business impact, this is important to clarify. “Regarding the safety of our employees, all non-essential employees had been sent home prior to the storm earlier this week. This is a critical time for our employees to be safe and with their families and we will stay in touch with them in various ways that work best for them in this time of need. We stand behind those impacted by Hurricane Maria and AstraZeneca is committed to helping the people and employees affected by all of these recent natural disasters. We will continue to assess the needs of both our employees and those impacted by the storm and once we have more clarity on their needs, provide support and aid however we can.” Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion said, “We’re continuing to assess the situation in Puerto Rico.” ","

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"More than a third of migrant fishermen in Thailand clearly were victims of trafficking over the past five years, and even more workers in the industry were possibly trafficked as well, according to a report published Thursday. Routinely underpaid and physically abused, three-quarters of migrants working on Thai fishing vessels have been in debt bondage, working to pay off an obligation, said the study by the anti-trafficking group International Justice Mission (IJM). Thailand's multibillion-dollar seafood sector came under fire in recent years after investigations showed widespread slavery, trafficking and violence on fishing boats and in onshore food-processing factories. The politically unstable country, which is under military rule, has vowed to crack down on trafficking and recently introduced reforms to its fisheries law. The IJM study of 260 fishermen from Myanmar and Cambodia found 38 percent were clearly trafficked and another 49 percent possibly trafficked. Only 13 percent reported fair labor conditions at sea and no exploitative recruitment, it said. Three-quarters reported working at least 16 hours a day, and only 11 percent said they were paid more than 9,000 Baht ($272 U.S.) per month, the legal monthly minimum wage in Thailand. One fisherman was quoted in the report as saying he was held in debt bondage, owing 20,000 Baht ($604) to his brother, who worked as a supervisor overseeing fishermen. In debt to brother ""I fear for my life as he has killed in front of me before,"" he was quoted as saying. ""I don't dare to run. He would kill my children."" Field researchers surveyed the 260 fishermen in 20 Thai fishing localities in 2016, collecting information on fishing jobs they had held in the previous five years. Thailand, the world's third-largest seafood exporter, had more than 42,000 active fishing vessels as of 2014, and more than 172,000 people were employed as fishermen, the study said.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - More than a third of migrant fishermen in Thailand clearly were victims of trafficking over the past five years and even more workers in the industry were possibly trafficked as well, according to a report published on Thursday. Routinely underpaid and physically abused, three-quarters of migrants working on Thai fishing vessels have been in debt bondage, working to pay off an obligation, said the study by the anti-trafficking group International Justice Mission (IJM). Thailand’s multibillion-dollar seafood sector came under fire in recent years after investigations showed widespread slavery, trafficking and violence on fishing boats and in onshore food processing factories. The politically unstable country, which is under military rule, has vowed to crack down on trafficking and recently introduced reforms to its fisheries law. The IJM study of 260 fishermen from Myanmar and Cambodia  found 38 percent were clearly trafficked and another 49 percent possibly trafficked. Only 13 percent reported fair labor conditions at sea and no exploitative recruitment, it said. Three-quarters reported working at least 16 hours a day, and only 11 percent said they were paid more than 9,000 Baht ($272 U.S.) per month, the legal monthly minimum wage in Thailand. One fisherman was quoted in the report as saying he was held in debt bondage, owing 20,000 Baht ($604) to his brother, who worked as a supervisor overseeing fishermen. “I fear for my life as he has killed in front of me before,” he was quoted as saying. “I don’t dare to run. He would kill my children. Field researchers surveyed the 260 fishermen in 20 Thai fishing localities in 2016, collecting information on fishing jobs they had held in the previous five years. Thailand, the world’s third-largest seafood exporter, had more than 42,000 active fishing vessels as of 2014 and more than 172,000 people were employed as fishermen, the study said. The study was funded by the Walmart Foundation, the charitable arm of giant U.S. retailer Wal-mart Stores Inc. With release of the study, the Walmart Foundation announced a grant to help the IJM improve law enforcement efforts against human trafficking in the Thai fishing industry.

(AMZN) may be the king of e-commerce, but when it comes to the best prices and the speediest shipping, it's Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) that takes the crown. That’s according to BMO Capital Markets, which did a deep dive into pricing and shipping costs at Amazon, Costco and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and found that in the 16 categories analyst Kelly Bania and her team studied, the warehouse retailer had prices 7% lower than on Amazon's website. Shipping took an average of 4.5 days per each item compared to 5.5 at Amazon. Wal-Mart and its Jet.com owned e-commerce website had prices that were 18% higher than Amazon's and took a lot longer to ship with the average being 9.8 days. When taking into account Amazon’s Prime membership program that offers discounts and free two-day shipping, BMO Capital Markets found Amazon prices were 4% lower than Wal-Mart when shipping wasn’t included and 10% cheaper when all of the fees were factored in, reported Barron’s, which covered the research report. (See also: Why Amazon Is Losing to JD.com and Wal-Mart.) “With Costco generally beating Amazon in both price and shipping, it’s a reminder that Amazon has strong competition for all those musing about antitrust concerns, especially ones with a strong membership program like Costco's. And with Walmart investing heavily in eCommerce, we think it remains a vital competitor to watch, especially on price,” wrote Bania. “With that said, Amazon offers a wider set of SKUs​ than Costco does, and Prime has other benefits (video, music, etc.) that create differentiation.” The analyst reiterated her outperform rating on Amazon and her $1,200 price target. The analyst rates Wal-Mart and Costco at market perform with price targets of $80 and $170, respectively. “Despite Costco's price gap to Amazon we believe near-term sentiment and fear of the long-term impact of Amazon on Costco's business (whether or not justified by near-term fundamentals) could continue to create an overhang on COST shares and limit valuation upside,” she wrote in the research note.

Marguerite Ward,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"The approaching holiday season means more shopping, and as a result, more jobs in retail. For some retail employees, it will also mean higher wages. Target announced today that it would raise its minimum wage above $10 beginning in October, eventually reaching $11 per hour for all U.S. stores. The retailer has already promised to add 100,000 jobs in the coming months and has committed to raising minimum wage to $15 by 2020. Though many of these jobs may be temporary, they provide experience as well as a source of income, and knowing how major stores compare in terms of hourly pay could help you if you're in the market for a job. Using  Fortune's list of the 20 retailers with the greatest number of employees in the U.S., CNBC Make It looked at average hourly wages for the position of ""sales associate"" —  a common consumer-facing, non-managerial role — at each company. Wages were determined using data submitted by employees to jobs and salary platform Glassdoor. Each company on the list was also contacted to provide information or comment. Here's how the country's 20 biggest retail employers rank in terms of pay: Average hourly wage for sales associates: $7.87Number of employees: 121,000 Average hourly wage for sales associates:  $8.17 to  $8.26Number of employees: 116,050 After five months, some Dollar Tree employees can earn $9 per hour, The Wall Street Journal reports.

There are many who argue that big retailers could afford to increase wages. Some retail employees say they struggle to make ends meet and many have joined the ""Fight for 15"" protests, which call for a minimum wage of $15 per hour and have gained traction in many major cities. Jiyoung Hwang, assistant professor of marketing at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro's Bryan School of Business and Economics, says there are a few factors at play. Chief among them are the minimum wage in each state, which she says retailers often use a benchmark, the level of skill each employee has and the company's emphasis on corporate social responsibility (CSR.) ""Costco is well-known for its CSR while Wal-Mart is quite lower in that reputation,"" Hwang says. Pressure to offer customers low prices, long operating hours and the importance of competing with other retailers also play a big role, she adds. In addition, company sales, the cost of living in an area and a worker's responsibilities contribute to wage decisions, according to Ana Serafin Smith, senior director of media relations at the National Retail Federation (NRF). Still, Smith says that those who earn minimum wage from major retailers may not have to do so for long. ""A majority of those hired in an entry-level position,"" Smith says, citing NRF research, ""reported earning a promotion within a year of employment.""

"Paul Sonn, general counsel, National Employment Law Project",09282017,CNBC,09212017,"With the holiday season approaching, this week Target became the first low-wage chain to announce it will raise pay to $15 an hour. Chief executive Brian Cornell said the decision to raise wages to $15 by 2020 will help Target attract and retain talent as the hyper-competitive retail sector enters its busiest quarter. It also shows the growing impact of the Fight for $15–and puts pressure on other major players like Amazon, Walmart and McDonalds to follow suit. Since striking fast-food workers launched the Fight for $15 in 2012, states and cities comprising more than 18 percent of the U.S. workforce—including Target's home city of Minneapolis—have approved $15 minimum wages. And scores of companies have raised pay to $15, including insurance giants Aetna and Allstate, major hospital chains across the country, and tech leader Facebook for its contracted bus drivers, janitors and security guards. But Target's role as an industry leader in retail—which together with restaurants employs the largest share of workers paid less than $15–illustrates what business strategists have long argued: historically low-paying sectors can make the shift to significantly higher pay. MIT business professor Zeynep Ton has shown how industry leaders like Costco and Trader Joe's provide a roadmap for how investing in retail workers with good wages and benefits goes hand-in-hand with strong growth and productivity. Target's move blows up the claims of corporate lobbyists who argue it's simply not possible for industries like retail and restaurants to pay a $15 minimum wage. In fact,  growing numbers of business owners and economists confirm that a phased-in $15 minimum wage is realistic for employers and will help boost the consumer spending that ultimately drives job growth. But ultimately the imperative to pay a living wage is about our nation's values. As La Colombe CEO Todd Carmichael  argued last week, ""unless you pay your employees a nonpredatory living wage that keeps people and their families above the poverty line, you don't deserve to be in business."" Part of what's driving employers like Target to pay $15 an hour is the simple fact that,  everywhere in America—not just on the coasts-- a single worker will soon need to earn at least that much just to afford the basics. And workers on the coasts or supporting kids will need even more. Yet more than 43 percent of America's workers struggle on less than $15 an hour. Far from teenagers, the median age of the millions of  workers earning less than $15 an hour in the U.S. is 32. They include hospital workers and preschool teachers, auto-parts workers and waitresses. In other words, many of the front line jobs in which U.S. workers today spend their careers pay less than $15 an hour. And we all end up subsidizing those low wages. Low pay by corporations like McDonald's and Walmart cost taxpayers  a whopping $153 billion a year in public assistance to working families, according to a recent study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. A key issue when employers like Target raise pay is what happens to the growing numbers of employees who don't work for them directly but instead through staffing agencies or service contractors. In the Twin Cities, Target has already been a leader in tackling this issue,  agreeing last year to support the efforts of its contracted janitors to unionize and raise their pay substantially. Ensuring that more employers raise standards for contracted and direct employees alike is essential  in our increasingly ""fissured"" workplaces. Low pay is hurting America's working families and holding back our economy, which depends on a thriving consumer class to drive growth. Target's plan to raise pay to $15 an hour over the next 30 months is smart business strategy, and what our nation's workforce and economy need. There's now a bullseye on the back of employers like Amazon, Walmart and McDonalds. They should follow Target's lead. ",Target's $15 an hour move 'blows up' minimum wage myths-commentary

The Wharton School's Jeremy Siegel believes it'll have a lot to do with President Donald Trump's intention to get business-friendly reforms passed on Capitol Hill — not the latest Federal Reserve decision on interest rates or better-than-expected economic growth figures. ""I would say corporate tax reform could add another 10 percent to the market even this year,"" Siegel said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" A deal ""looks very likely to get done."" It's the second time in less than 12 months that Siegel, a longtime bull, has made a bold market call. And it came on a day when the Dow and S&P 500 closed at record highs. In the final weeks of 2016, Siegel argued that the blue chip stock index was very close to hitting the 20,000 milestone. It broke through that key psychological level on Jan. 25 and since then has soared more than 10 percent. If Siegel is right this time, too, a 10 percent jump would put the Dow around 24,650 and the S&P 500 at 2,760 based on Wednesday's closes. ""There's new hope that taxes really have a chance to be done. I remained steadfast throughout some of the bleak days in the last few months when no one thought anything could be done,"" Siegel added. ""There's a little bit more optimism now. I think a corporate tax deal will be done, and I think that will be positive for the equity market,"" he said. Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.

Over the past year, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has been stocking up on online retail outlets. It closed its acquisition of Jet.com about a year ago, and it's since bought four other small online retailers. Wal-Mart's efforts have resulted in huge online sales growth, but its acquisition strategy may be somewhat flawed. Wal-Mart has put the former CEO of Jet.com, Marc Lore, in charge of its online operations in the United States. He recently spoke at a conference, and when asked what Wal-Mart does better than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), he said Wal-Mart's unique assets separate it from the competition. Image source: Wal-Mart Lore pointed specifically to the ""4,600"" stores Wal-Mart operates in the United States as a unique advantage over Amazon. Lore may have been using an old store count, because Wal-Mart says it has 4,741 stores in the U.S. That number is somehow getting larger every year. Roughly 90% of the U.S. population is within 10 miles of a Walmart store. That means Wal-Mart has a big advantage in in-store pickup and online grocery ordering, and has the infrastructure to succeed in shipping items to customers' homes. Indeed, Wal-Mart was able to launch free two-day shipping on its online orders over $35 earlier this year thanks in part to its network of stores. ""We can do 2-hour delivery cheaper than anybody else because of the assets we have,"" Lore said. After purchasing Whole Foods Market, Amazon's physical storefronts still only amount to about 10% of Wal-Mart's. Even with its  network of fulfillment centers, just 44% of the population lived within 20 miles of Amazon's network as of a year ago. Those fulfillment centers naturally have a lot of overlap with Whole Foods locations as they both target high-population areas. Wal-Mart is the nation's largest private employer with 1.5 million employees in the U.S. Lore cites this as an asset, although the larger overhead has been more of a drag for Wal-Mart. Amazon generates twice as much revenue per employee compared to Wal-Mart. Lore has been creative in finding ways to make employees more efficient as Wal-Mart boosts online sales. Not only does the large number of employees allow Wal-Mart to quickly ramp up services like fulfilling online grocery orders in its stores, Lore tested using employees to deliver online orders the last mile to customers' doorsteps. Physical retail necessitates more employees compared to online-only operations like Amazon. Workers need to stock shelves, assist customers in stores, and work the checkout lines. Investors should expect Amazon's revenue-per-employee number to fall after incorporating Whole Foods' numbers into the mix. But those extra employees offer an opportunity to expand a retailer's capabilities. Wal-Mart's biggest success, so far, has been online grocery ordering and pickup. Lore will continue to search for opportunities like that. Lore wasn't afraid to admit where Amazon has Wal-Mart beat -- that's the overall shopping experience on Amazon compared to Walmart. He said it's easier to find the product you want on Amazon, the competitor often has a greater assortment of goods, and the delivery experience is often superior. It's simple to hire a bunch of engineers to hack away at Walmart.com's search and recommendation algorithms to find the products people really want. It's a lot tougher for Wal-Mart to convince certain brands to sell their goods at its stores. Wal-Mart's reputation for low quality keeps it from attracting more high-end brands. That's part of the idea of buying up smaller online outlets like Bonobos and ShoeBuy. It's also made an effort to attract more third-party merchants to its online marketplace. A quality shopping experience is the biggest hurdle for Wal-Mart to really take on Amazon. And as Amazon moves into brick-and-mortar retail, Wal-Mart may start to feel a bit more pressure to get it right. ","

Danny Vena (Wal-Mart): Investors planning for a rainy day should fortify their portfolio with companies that can perform well during periods of economic instability, which is when consumers tend to spend carefully, forgoing their usual shopping habits and opting for lower prices. During the depths of the Great Recession, many shoppers turned to Wal-Mart's ""Always low prices"" to help make ends meet. As the largest retailer in the world, Wal-Mart has unmatched economies of scale. For its fiscal year ended January 2017, it produced revenue of $485.9 billion and operating income of $22.8 billion. Its operating cash flow totaled $31.5 billion, and it returned $8.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchases. Wal-Mart is also a Dividend Aristocrat, having paid a dividend every year since 1974 and boasting 44 years of consecutive increases. It has a dividend that currently yields 2.5% and a healthy payout ratio of 48%, leaving room for future increases. While the company was initially slow to embrace e-commerce, it corrected that last year with its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, as well as a number of other smaller specialty clothiers. As a result, in its most recent quarter the company posted impressive increases in e-commerce sales, which grew 60% over the prior-year quarter, with gross merchandise volume increasing 67% year over year. If you're looking for a stock for a rainy day, consider this: During the bear market that began Oct. 9, 2007, and ended March 9, 2009, while the broader S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) fell 56%, Wal-Mart stock gained 10%. Data by YCharts. Keith Speights (Facebook): What do people do on a rainy day? They stay inside. While inside, there's a pretty good chance that they'll look at social media. And the undisputed king of social media is Facebook. I suspect that the executives at Facebook like it when people stay inside on rainy days, because it increases the amount of time they spend catching up on friends' posts -- and looking at ads. Ads generate 98% of Facebook's revenue. And that revenue is growing, with the company reporting a 47% year-over-year jump in advertising revenue in the second quarter of 2017. This growth stems from two factors. First, Facebook charged 24% more per ad in the last quarter. It can get away with that kind of price boost because it reaches more than 2 billion monthly active users. Second, the company is also increasing the number of ads displayed. More volume at higher prices is a surefire way to make more money. But can buying Facebook stock make you plenty of money? I think so. Wall Street projects that Facebook will achieve average annual earnings growth over the next five years of nearly 27%. That's a drop from the heady growth of past years, but it's still an impressive level. That growth makes Facebook's valuation look pretty reasonable as well. Facebook isn't just a leader in social media. It's also a leader in artificial intelligence and augmented reality, two of the hottest trends in technology today. Buying Facebook stock is a way of investing in these two trends. That's a pretty smart way, in my view, to use time on a rainy day so that your financial future isn't stormy. Tim Green (Microsoft): Software giant Microsoft has changed quite a bit over the past few years. It's embraced cloud computing, building its Azure cloud platform into a strong No. 2 player. It's dropped its Windows-centric position, building first-class apps for Android and iOS. And it's building an increasing amount of hardware, from its Surface tablets and laptop to its HoloLens augmented reality headset. But what hasn't changed about Microsoft is its dominant position in the productivity software market. Businesses depend on Office, Outlook, and other Microsoft products, and that's likely to remain true regardless of the state of the economy. Office is still the company's cash cow, despite serious competition from Alphabet's Google. While Microsoft is heavily investing in growth businesses like cloud computing, the company is still producing impressive profits. During fiscal 2017, Microsoft generated $21.2 billion of net income on $90.0 billion of revenue. Meanwhile, Azure revenue is doubling year over year, and Office 365 commercial, the subscription version of Office, is growing by more than 40% annually. Microsoft is in an enviable position, with dominant businesses like Office throwing off cash, allowing the company to invest in newer businesses that will act as its growth engine for years to come. Through the good times and the bad, Microsoft should continue to produce exceptional results. ","

Target (NYSE:TGT) made news earlier this week by making public plans to increase its minimum hourly wage for all employees to $11 in October. The chain also pledged to increase wages to a $15-per-hour minimum by 2020. The company said in a press release that a ""significant investment in its team will allow Target to continue to recruit and retain strong team members."" It comes at a time when unemployment sits near historic lows and the idea of a $15-an-hour minimum wage has become a huge topic of national debate. Target's move follows its previous wage hike to a $10 an hour minimum in 2016. It also follows efforts from its chief rival, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), to raise wages. In February 2016 the company pledged to pay any employees hired before Jan. 1, 2016 at $10 an hour and that any workers hired after that would receive at least $9 an hour, with their rate increasing to at least $10 upon completion of a training program. Target has increased the minimum hourly wage for its employees. Image source: Target. Only two states -- Massachusetts and Washington -- have $11-an-hour minimum wages. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia, however, have a minimum wage that exceeds the federal standard of $7.25. In his remarks in the press release Target's CEO Brian Cornell framed the move as being about making life better for his chain's workers. Target has always offered market competitive wages to our team members. With this latest commitment, we'll be providing even more meaningful pay, as well as the tools, training and support our team needs to build their skills, develop professionally and offer the service and expertise that set Target apart. That's, of course, a piece of it, but the reality is that changing market conditions dictate the increase. With unemployment standing at 4.4% in August, near historic lows, the reality is Target needs to pay more to attract workers. An employee who makes $11 an hour for a 40-hour week would earn $22,800 a year. That's less than the average annual wages for cashiers ($27,701) and warehouse associates ($40,784), according to GlassDoor's most-recent Local Pay Reports. Of course, those reports offer the average of all workers in those positions, not the minimum hourly starting wage. Target's starting pay will also be less than the $14.21 an hour the average Costco cashier makes and less than the $12.42 an Amazon fulfillment associate earns per hour, according to GlassDoor salary reviews. That data is based on 158 Costco employees reporting their earnings to the jobs data website and 683 Amazon warehouse workers doing the same. The new rate, however, is very competitive in other areas of the market. Starting workers at $11 an hour does put Target well ahead of the $8.41 to $8.61 an hour the average McDonald's crew member or cashier makes. Target's starting salary will also be more than the average Starbucks barista makes ($9.55 to $9.57), and more than Sears ($8.37 to $8.54) and J.C. Penney ($9.04 to $9.07) associates and cashiers, according to what was reported to GlassDoor. In the retail world, especially when it comes to entry-level positions, small differences in salary can be the difference between someone taking a job or electing to go elsewhere. Competitive pay can also help a company retain employees, lowering its long-term training costs while also improving customer service. Heading into a time when it and many of its rivals are hiring for the holidays, Target has given itself a leg up on the competition. By paying more than the competition, the retailer should have an easier time hiring and holding onto the employees it needs. That should improve the in-store experience for customers and help the company meet its Q4 goals. The company's long-range wage increases will help it build an ongoing foundation of well-trained, experienced employees. ","

In the 1980s and even the 1990s, Toys R Us was a place children begged their parents to take them. The chain had a selection of toys that dwarfed what was sold at now-defunct department store chains like Ames, Caldor, and Bradlees. Even its Sunday newspaper inserts were an event, and its holiday season ""toy book"" was much perused by children in order to pick out what gifts they planned to ask for. Toys R Us' slow path to bankruptcy, which it filed on Sept. 18, did not begin with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). It started with chains like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) creating toy departments that not only pushed prices (and margins) lower, but also made it so a visit to Toys R Us was no longer unique. Wal-Mart and Target made Toys R Us less of a destination and gave parents a way to placate their kids while also doing their own shopping. Toys R Us has filed for bankruptcy. Image source: Getty Images. For two years, I ran the largest toy and hobby store in New England. We had a Toys R Us, a Target, and a Wal-Mart within a couple of miles of us. We were also in a relatively remote location while our toy-selling rivals were closer to the highway and near a major mall. Despite those deficits and the fact that we were generally more expensive than the chains we competed with, we thrived. The mistake Toys R Us has made is that it has done very little to differentiate itself from its department store rivals. My former toy store, which is doing well to this day, did much more than sell toys, hobby items, model trains, and more. It actively gave customers a reason to visit. We hosted gaming events, tournaments, and learn-to-play classes for everything from the easiest children's games to the most complicated collectible offerings. We also had multiple huge model train sets that were shown off for free twice a month, and every Sunday during the holiday season. Those trains were maintained and built by clubs that met in the store. During weekdays, we had story time for children, and on holidays, we barbecued, made cotton candy, or handed out special treats to our customers. Even when nothing was happening, we had play areas for little kids, model-building areas for all ages, and a near-endless supply of curios we picked up in theory to sell, but just as much to give customers something to look at. We also had a customer-first attitude where we welcomed everyone warmly, treated regulars like family, and accepted that sometimes we were going to teach a customer about a product only for them to buy it cheaper on Amazon. Our store also had merchandise that wouldn't be found at a Toys R Us or a department store, as well as staff that was passionate about what they sold. Toys R Us had the tools and the space to be all of those things, but either arrogance or complacency stopped it from evolving. Once simply having toys stopped making it a destination for kids and toy lovers, the chain needed to do more. CEO David Brandon acknowledged that in the bankruptcy filing, explaining how the company would change its stores. ""Once these initiatives are implemented, Toys R Us stores will be interactive spaces with rooms to use for parties, live product demonstrations put on by trained employees, and the freedom for employees to remove product from boxes to let kids play with the latest toys,"" he said. That's the model that would have worked all along. It's a game Target and Wal-Mart are unlikely to play, and one that Amazon, for obvious reasons, can't. Bankruptcy may clear some debt and let the company shed some leases, but it needs to change in order to avoid slowly falling right back into the same hole. Toys R Us has to go from being a place that sells toys and games to one that's full of activities, experiences, and discoveries for kids and adults alike. The chain needs to transform from store to destination -- if it does that, then sales will follow. ","

It wasn't so long ago that investors couldn't buy enough of Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR): Between 2013 and 2015, the stock rose an astonishing 217%. Yet since January 2016, Kroger's shares have lost 50% of their value. Over the last 18 months, Kroger's comparable quarterly sales, excluding fuel sales, have shifted from healthy growth in the mid-single digits to a complete standstill. In the final quarter of 2016, the company saw its 13-year streak of comparable sales growth snap, as comps declined for the first time in 53 quarters. Kroger is cuing up a comps revival, but for now, progress is wan. Management projects just a slight expansion in this metric of 0.5% to 1% for the second half of the current fiscal year. The culprit, of course, is fierce competition among grocers for customers. And it will only intensify: 2018 promises to ring in a battle royale within the grocery industry. Whole Foods Market will present a distinct online retailing challenge once new owner Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) integrates the organic chain's loyalty program with its Amazon Prime service. As for brick-and-mortar developments, privately held German discount grocers Aldi and Lidl will open 500 new stores in the U.S. between them by the end of 2018 alone, as Aldi seeks to expand and Lidl builds on its 2017 entry on the east coast. In a pre-emptive response to the European invasion, Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) -- never an easy grocer to undercut -- is already allowing its gross margin to slip in 2017 in order to ""invest in price."" These pitched battles, both online and in midsized and major metropolitan areas, are occurring just as shopping habits undergo significant change. The Food Marketing Institute has been tracking grocery industry trends for decades. Last year, its ""U.S. Grocery Shopper Report"" confirmed what many of us have experienced personally: Shoppers are splitting their grocery buys over a number of different store types and channels. In fact, the report showed that in each of the preceding three years, a ""significant"" number of shoppers (between 7% and 9%) no longer claimed loyalty to a primary grocery store. That's a problem for Kroger, which operates as a conventional grocer in an increasingly specialized world. It's not a premium grocer like Whole Foods, nor a deep-discounter like Aldi or Lidl. The company instead has existed as a traditional supermarket which uses high customer engagement and sheer proximity to customers (with approximately 2,800 stores spread across 35 states) to drive traffic. Image source: Getty Images. To keep comps from treading water, which won't be kind to its stock price, Kroger has a complex task ahead. The company will have to stay focused, avoid overreaching for desperate solutions, and double down on its very formidable core strengths. Read through a recent earnings call transcript, or browse the company's quarterly earnings reports, and you'll be reminded of the slate of advantages that propelled Kroger, not many quarters ago, to brisk comps growth. I'll summarize them briefly as follows: Think of the advantages above as a sort of body armor Kroger constructed over the last few years as competitors refined their individual niches and prepared to attack on price and differentiation. Now's the time to wear that armor in the battle to protect market share and build comps. This month, CEO Rodney McMullen said emphatically in an earnings conference call that the grocer is ""not going to lose on price."" Cutting prices is simple, but retaining customers on price alone is not. A more sustainable strategy is to shift more resources away from price investment, and toward the manufacturing, brand, and technology investments which boost inherent advantages. To stabilize in this environment and grow again, Kroger needs to push its Simple Truth line. It should expand private-label brands that contribute to higher profits. It should continue to embrace online shopping, and dial up the use of analytics to retain customers and incentivize shopping frequency. In reaffirming its strengths, Kroger will reaffirm its identity to its customers.

The fourth quarter has become a sort of retail free-for-all where stores try increasingly desperate tactics to lure in customers. From opening on Thanksgiving Day to heavy discounts and aggressive promotions, retailers pull out all the stops. That makes sense because the importance of the period seems to grow each year. In 2017, early predictions from Deloitte show that total holiday sales, excluding automobiles and gasoline, will reach $1.04 trillion to $1.05 trillion between November and January, up from $1 trillion last year. And while the digital portion of overall sales has grown, e-commerce sales will only account for $111 billion to $114 billion of that total -- an 18%-21% increase over $93.8 billion in 2016. Servicing all of those sales requires workers. In Q4, really toward the end of Q3 in September, many retail and retail-adjacent companies have traditionally hired a lot of people. This list will expand as the season gets closer, but there are a lot of jobs out there in a market that's already near historically high employment rates. Unlike last year, these jobs may not be easy to fill, a fact that has already caused Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) to decide against hiring temporary workers. Instead, the retailer will fill its need by offering overtime to existing employees. Some of the companies on this list may end up following Wal-Mart's lead if they can't find enough qualified applicants, but for now, here's the list of companies that are hiring and how many people they need. Retailers will be hiring tens of thousands of workers for the holiday season. Image source: Target. Even though Wal-Mart has elected to sit out the hiring season, most of its rivals have different plans. There will literally be hundreds of thousands of openings in everything from front-end, consumer-facing positions, to backroom warehouse jobs, and digital fulfillment positions: These are not the only retailers with holiday hiring plans, just the ones that have come forward so far. Kohl's, Nordstrom, and many other chains are planning to add workers. In many ways, it's a job-seeker's market, with applicants being able to weigh things like pay and benefits against the possibility of becoming a permanent hire when deciding where to apply. The rise of digital sales has put tremendous pressure on the companies that deliver online orders. The United States Postal Service (USPS) has posted job listings in a number of markets looking for both seasonal and permanent workers. The number of openings varies based on the market, but the overall job count seems significant. Not to be outdone by the government, both United Parcel Service and FedEx plan to hire. UPS plans to add about 95,000 seasonal workers, while its rival hopes to hire 50,000 while also offering more overtime for existing employees. In many cases seasonal jobs go to college kids, people working a second gig, or those not looking to enter the workforce full-time. For those seeking permanent employment, however, a seasonal job can be a way to get your foot in the door at a company you want to work at. Every company on this list has both full and seasonal openings, but if your goal is a permanent job, it may be best to take seasonal work at a thriving company. Amazon, for example, is likely to keep more temporary workers than Toys R Us or Macy's simply given the trajectory of their businesses. Still, a chain like Target may be facing challenges, but it's doing well enough that exceptional seasonal workers can probably find a full-time, permanent job after the holiday season. ","

Like solar and wind power, many alternative energy advocates have touted the potential of hydrogen power for years. Investors in fuel cell companies like Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) are still waiting, however, for the inflection point that marks the company's transition to sustained profitability. Perhaps in 2017, though, that time has come. Rising 128% in 2017 as of this writing, Plug Power has delighted the market -- unlike in 2016 -- with several announcements, suggesting that the tide has turned. Thanks in part to a deal with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), fuel cell fever is working its way through Wall Street. Indicating a bullish outlook on the stock, analysts at FBR Capital and Cowen have each identified a $3 price target on the stock. Moreover, an analyst at the investment bank Rodman and Renshaw issued a $4 price target. But Wall Street's enthusiasm doesn't necessarily mean investors should start powering their portfolios with this fuel cell industry leader. Image source: Getty Images. To say that news of the company's deal with Amazon was well received would be a gross understatement. Shares soared more than 60% in April -- the month in which the announcement was made -- and the stock hasn't looked back, continuing to climb ever since. What fed the fervor? For one, Plug Power's management expects the deal to add $70 million to the company's top line in 2017. This is no small sum considering the company reported $86 million in revenue in the prior year. Besides the deal with Amazon, Plug Power pleased investors with its second-quarter earnings report. Management announced a new agreement with long-term partner Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), with an estimated the contract value to be $70 million. And speaking to its fiscal 2017 finances, it was quite optimistic, estimating negative free cash flow of $25 million to $35 million. Additionally, the company expects further progress in its pursuit of profitability, and is forecasting an expansion in its fiscal 2017 gross margin (excluding the impact of warrants issued to Amazon and Wal-Mart) to 8% to 12%; the fiscal 2016 gross margin was only 4.6%. In terms of the stock, because it's unprofitable, we can't use the traditional price-to-earnings metric to value shares, so let's consider the price-to-sales ratio. Shares are trading around 5.4 times sales, slightly higher than the stock's 5.2 average, but those who are optimistic about the company's future could certainly shrug off this seemingly high price tag. Despite the deal with Amazon and an improvement in some areas of its financials, the bear argument for Plug Power remains strong. Image source: Getty Images For one, management's forecast for its fiscal 2017 performance must be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism since it doesn't have a great track record of meeting its guidance. In 2013, it estimated Plug Power would break even on an EBITDA basis by the second or third quarter of 2014. Slightly off, the company reported an EBITDA loss of $84 million in 2014 according to Morningstar. Last year, during its Q1 2016 presentation, it announced a gross margin goal exceeding 12% for fiscal 2016. The company instead reported a gross margin of 4.6%, thereby coming up quite short. Management, furthermore, set an operating cash flow target of negative $20 million. Again missing the target, it reported negative $30 million in operating cash flow in fiscal 2016. PLUG R&D to Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Accounting for 28% of revenue in the trailing 12 months, revenue earmarked for R&D will likely remain a large obstacle on the road to profitability as the company pursues development of its ProGen prototypes for both the domestic and Chinese markets. Predicated on a future where hydrogen has supplanted traditional fuels, picking up shares of Plug Power at this point remains too risky. As one who's been enthusiastic about alternative power for years, I'd be more than happy to add Plug Power to my portfolio. Unfortunately, trust issues regarding its management team still persist, and the failure to translate top-line growth to the bottom line remains a concern. Unless the stock nosedives and reaches rock-bottom prices or the company remedies its issues, I'll be rooting for Plug Power from the sidelines. ","

In the past three years, iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) has pulled off a truly impressive feat. During that time, the maker of home robotics has increased its revenue by nearly 40% while simultaneously reducing its revenue sources. Specifically, the company eliminated $55 million in revenue and pulled out its very roots by divesting its military segment in 2016 and recently discontinued one of its four product lines in the home robotics category, a gutter cleaning line called the Looj. IRBT Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. How then, has the company been able to increase revenue at such a rapid pace? By absolutely dominating in its top product category, that's how! In 2002, iRobot essentially invented the robotic vacuum cleaning market with the launch of the first Roomba. For a decade and a half, Roomba has been the king of robotic vacuum cleaners, especially in the United States, where it holds a jaw-dropping 88% market share. However, it is no longer the only game in town. Let's take a look at the evidence and decide whether there are any companies ready to challenge iRobot's leadership in the fast-growing robotic vacuum cleaner market. It is hard to fathom that any competitor would be able to overtake iRobot in global market share in the near future. iRobot's current position compared to that of its closest rival is simply too dominant: Data source: iRobot. Chart by author. However, just because a competitor can't take the No. 1 spot doesn't mean it can't meaningfully affect iRobot's top and bottom lines, and by extension, its stock price. Let's look further at two companies that might have the potential to do just that. Image source: Ecovacs SharkNinja: SharkNinja is a newcomer to the robotic floor-cleaning market, but it is certainly no stranger to consumers. The company's Ninja Blender has been ranked the No. 1 blender three years in a row in the U.S.,and its upright vacuum cleaners have claimed the No. 1 spot in U.S. market share. Earlier this month, SharkNinja began selling the Shark ION Robot 750. While it's too early to know for sure how big of a splash SharkNinja will make in the market, it's likely the company has big plans. With iRobot's stock dropping 15% after a short-seller said the competitor's entrance to the market posed ""a credible threat,"" it's safe to say shareholders agree. Only time will tell if iRobot will be able to continue growing revenue and earnings at a rapid clip with increasing competition trying to get a bigger share of the pie. We do know that iRobot's management believes its patent portfolio is a huge part of its competitive moat. The other safeguard iRobot may have is a fast-growing market. At a recent investor conference, management stated that the immediately addressable market for robotic vacuums is two to three times the currently installed base and that 700% market growth is expected over the long term. If the market for robotic floor cleaners grows fast enough, it is possible iRobot could lose market share and still grow revenue and profits significantly. At the same time, competition is increasing as we speak. Robotic vacuum cleaners at lower price points have essentially become commoditized home appliances. Amazon's ""robotic vacuums"" product selection numbers in the hundreds, and iRobot estimates that 20% of all vacuums worldwide are robotic -- and more than 30% of those are made by its competitors. With that level of competition already existing for lower-end products, if Ecovacs or Shark Ninja can chip away at market share on the premium lines (which management defines as vacuums costing $200 or above), it's only a matter of time before iRobot's absolute dominance comes to an end.

A full transcript follows the video. Mac Greer: Let's begin with, frankly, a retailer that I have pretty much forgotten is still around -- Bed Bath & Beyond. Wow, Bed Bath & Beyond taking a bath on Wednesday. Shares down more than 14% after the company lowered its earnings outlook and reported weaker-than-expected earnings. David Kretzmann, I go to you. Is Bed Bath & Beyond beyond repair? Is there anything you can do to save this? David Kretzmann: What hurts here is, the stores aren't performing that well, but on the financial side of things, management has done more to add gasoline to that bad fire overall. If you go back to 2014, from a financial perspective, the company looked like it was in decent shape. It was producing over $1 billion in free cash flow annually, had $850 million in net cash on the balance sheet, so they had cash in the bank, they were producing a lot more cash to add to that tally. But that year, they decided to issue $1.5 billion in new debt just to buy back stock. They essentially went into more debt, bought back a lot of stock, and now a few years later the company has over $1 billion in net debt, and their free cash flow production has almost been cut in half to about $570 million. So that's a bleak direction to be going within just a few years. They've really been focusing on buying back stock, they haven't done a whole lot to improve the actual in-store experience, and what they have done has been very slow. They are making some progress with their digital sales, which now make up about 15% of total revenue. They say that their ""differentiated products,"" which they consider their exclusive products, personalizable products, makes up about half of sales, so I think that's probably an area where they really need to double down and find some way to differentiate what they're offering and how they offer it from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other retailers that are still out there. They've also made some acquisitions into new brick-and-mortar retail concepts. They bought a website, personalizationmall.com, late last year, where you can buy and personalize a lot of different items. Going that route makes the most sense to me. It's not a stock I would buy, even though it looks very cheap-looking at these trailing metrics. But I think management has made some very poor cash management decisions over the past few years, and in the meantime, the actual performance of the stores leaves a lot to be desired. Aaron Bush: Yeah, one tidbit that I keep on coming back to for Bed Bath & Beyond and for other struggling retailers is, when a brick-and-mortar store tries to add a quality e-commerce operation, not only does it tend to cause its physical stores to struggle more, but it makes the company increasingly expensive to run, because they have to duplicate the cost just to serve that same customer. So you do see them making really dumb decisions with debt, and adding new retail concepts, which feels more like a distraction than anything. But just the fundamental structure of how the economics work, and managing an in-store presence and an online presence isn't very friendly. And they've been really slow to do this. But now that they are invested in it, it's another reason that's adding a margin drag and keeping earnings lower. Greer: Do you think, in terms of those traditional retailers adding that online piece, I see why you would want to do it. Everyone's trying to fend off Amazon. You have to try anything. So you have Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) with the Jet acquisition. Do you think that's going to work for Wal-Mart? Or, to take your logic even further, if you're Wal-Mart, do you stick to your knitting, which is just bread-and-butter traditional retailers? Bush: I think for Wal-Mart and Jet, I think it was smart to acquire Jet, not for Jet itself, but more for the talent that is in that management team. And I know, I'm blanking on his name ... Marc Lore, who was the head of Jet, now runs Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations. So I think that was smart. What Wal-Mart really needs to do is continue to acquire things and really build up a big suite of an online presence. When it comes to e-commerce, aggregation is increasingly important, so you either have to dominate a niche, or you have to be someone that you can go to for anything and everything. So it's tough. Wal-Mart might be able to pull it off, Amazon is definitely pulling it off, but for someone like Bed Bath & Beyond it's a hard spot. Kretzmann: I think what Aaron mentioned highlights why it's so difficult for these brick-and-mortar retailers to pivot more to online or omnichannel sales because it tends to be more expensive to operate both rather than one or the other. But there is some value to the omnichannel experience. You see Amazon clearly showing a lot of interest in opening up their own brick-and-mortar stores, acquiring Whole Foods. So there is value there. But for a lot of these companies, I think it will be a short-term ding, but it's probably what they need to do to stay relevant and figure out some way to hopefully improve the economics over time, one way or another, whether it's offering more personalized services or some sort of consultation. We're going to talk about Best Buy today. They're trying to do something along those lines. But in the short term, the company needs to stomach those short-term dings if they want to stay relevant with competitors like Amazon. Greer: So, Bed Bath & Beyond shares a lot cheaper today than they were yesterday, but you're still not interested? Kretzmann: Based on management's track record, both managing the stores and how they've been trying to pivot those stores, I think they've been lackluster there. And they've also really jeopardized the company's financial position, because you're not going to go bankrupt if you don't have debt, and they completely pivoted the whole balance sheet a few years ago to buy back stock, which, in hindsight, looks like a very dumb move. Shares have continued dropping since then, so that was a poor investment, and a very poor reason to go into debt. So, from a financial position now, the company's future is in a lot more jeopardy now. So I would stay on the sidelines here. Greer: So, five years from now, are they still a going concern? Are they still around? Kretzmann: I think they're still around but they're probably getting pretty close to bankruptcy, at the rate they're going now. ","

                                   climbed by 0.9%. “The backdrop for gold today is as bullish as it has been in a long time,” said Mark O’Byrne, research director at GoldCore in Dublin. He expects gold prices to reach $1,400 before the end of the year. With President Donald Trump “in the White House and the political situation in the U.S. and globally more uncertain than it has been in many years, gold will almost certainly continue to see robust safe-haven demand,” he said. “This should push gold higher in the coming months.” Recent military tensions between North Korea and the U.S. and its allies has helped to underpin gold’s haven status as a hedge against a sudden escalation in geopolitical tension. According to media reports Monday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told reporters that Trump’s tweet that leader Kim Jong Un “won’t be around much longer” was a declaration of war, and Japanese leader Shinzo Abe on Monday called a snap general election in a bid to consolidate power in the midst of a diplomatic crisis with North Korea. Read: These are the next risk events for investors now Gold is “coming out of a bear market, and “the technical position looks better and better after gold bottomed in December 2015,” said O’Byrne. “Since then, we have seen a series of higher lows and higher highs.” “Global demand remains robust with strong demand being seen in many sectors—especially in the ETFs and also in Chinese demand, he said. Gold is also considered a counter to what some market participants have described as lofty levels for U.S. equities potentially ripening for a correction.

The two markets often move inversely as a weaker dollar can make commodities pegged to the currency, including most of the world’s gold, more appealing to buyers using weaker monetary units.

Passive products allow investors to hold all the components of an index like the Russell 2000

That’s in contrast to actively managed funds, where the securities are individually selected by a portfolio manager. The shift away from active and into passive has been dramatic, driven by both the lower cost and historically better performance of passive funds. According to Morningstar, passive funds attracted inflows of $428.7 billion over 2016, while actively managed funds saw outflows of $285.2 billion, a trend that has occurred for nearly 10 years.

According to FactSet, fully one-seventh of the nearly $4.2 trillion in global ETF assets are in funds tracking the benchmark U.S. equity index. The result of that is that passive funds now own an average of 17% of each component of the S&P 500, per Goldman’s data (the range is as little as 10%, and as much as 35%), whereas passive ownership was “a rounding error” a decade ago. Vanguard alone has at least a 5% stake in 468 components of the S&P 500, according to a June report in The Wall Street Journal, up from just three components in 2005. Read more: Investors flock to Vanguard funds, dump Goldman, Wells Fargo, and others Also: Vanguard calls for more diverse corporate boards, better climate-change disclosures As buying and selling index-funds essentially means buying and selling every component of the underlying index, “less trading is stemming from views on company fundamentals,” Goldman wrote. “Passive holders trade stock for different reasons than active managers, and at different frequencies. Passive’s decision to buy or sell stocks is often directed by broader fund flows and larger rebalances and not typically company specific fundamentals.” The investment bank calculated that for the average S&P 500 company, the share of its stock that might trade on fundamental views has dropped to 77% compared with 95% a decade ago. Those figures are based on a measure Goldman calls “passive-adjusted float,” or the number of shares outstanding minus both restricted holdings and passive holdings. “The impact on portfolio construction, alpha and trading are not fully appreciated by investors,” Fogertey wrote. Alpha refers to outperformance over a benchmark. Earlier this month, UBS analysts wrote that worries over the impact passive investing and ETFs would have on price discovery and liquidity were “misguided.” The firm noted that while passive funds comprise 46% of total ETF and mutual fund assets, they only accounted for 8% of the overall global equity market value. “If the investment landscape were limited to ETFs and mutual funds, it may warrant the current level of attention,” they wrote. “However, the investment landscape is far more expansive than just ETFs and mutual funds. There are hedge funds, separately managed accounts, and equities managed by other institutional investors and households that should factor into the analysis.” Read more: Relax, Wall Street: ETFs aren’t the root of all evil Related: Don’t blame ETFs or passive investors for high valuations Nonetheless, the impact of this factor depends on the specific security, as “passive ownership varies in both size and scope even within sectors.” Roughly 30% of the float of energy firm ONEOK

Jeffry Bartash,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 25, 2017 1:00 p.m. ET Economists see small Trump boost, still-low inflation, NABE says By The U.S. economy these days is like an old and reliable car. It’s not going to set any speed records but it’s also not going to break down and leave people stranded. That sums up the latest quarterly outlook by the nation’s most prominent business economists. They predict the U.S. will only grow a touch faster in 2018 — around 2.4% compared to an estimated 2.2% this year. Part of the fuel for faster growth in 2018 are expected tax reductions and spending increases by the Trump White House, according to the National Association of Business Economists. Yet economists also believe there’s just a one-in-four chance of a recession in the next two years, “A large majority of the panel views a near-term recession as highly unlikely,” said Kevin Swift, vice president elect of the NABE. The largely worry-free view of the economy stems from it’s mild rate of growth. The U.S. historically has grown more than 3% a year and at times even faster, but in the absence of such high rates of growth, dangerous imbalances apparently have failed to materialize. The slower rate of growth since the end of the 2007-2009 recession — the U.S. has expanded around 2% a year — also means the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates as high as it normally does. Past recessions have often been caused in part by the central bank raising the cost of borrowing quickly or aggressively. The Fed’s benchmark short-term interest rate, known as fed funds, now ranges from 1% to 1.25%. The NABE predicts the fed funds rate will rise to 2.125% by the end of 2018, but that’s still quite low by historical standards. The more immediate threats to the economy, NABE respondents said, could come from: • A war over free trade that leads to sharp restrictions: • A big reversal in surging U.S. stock markets; • Or tight immigration rules that limit the supply of labor in a time of growing manpower shortages. Inflation is not much of a danger, the NABE said. Economist predict annual prices increases will top out at no more than 1.9% in 2018, using the Fed’s preferred PCE inflation gauge. Also Read: Watch this inflation number to see where interest rates go next The now familiar constraints on the economy’s pace of growth are unlikely to ease much, the NABE said. Worker pay, business investment and productivity should all rise in 2018, but not at a rate strong enough to push U.S. growth above 3%. A lift could come from White House plans to cut taxes and improve public works . But economists are skeptical it will add a big boost — no more than 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points. The last time the U.S. grew at least 3% was in 2005. The current 12-year stretch of sub-3% growth is the longest on record. The flip side is, a recovery now nine years old could end up becoming the longest on record if the economy avoids a downturn in the next two years. The current expansion will turn 99 months old at the end of September. The record is 120 months from 1991 to 2001. ",U.S. economy likely to speed up in 2018 but not shatter any records - MarketWatch

That’s from analysts at Bernstein, who took a deep dive into Tesla’s cash burn, which they estimate will have reached a cumulative $10.6 billion by the end of the year. “Bears argue that this level of capital spending is unprecedented and that Tesla will inevitably run out of cash. Meanwhile, bulls argue that Tesla’s spending is par for course among high-growth companies,” the Bernstein analysts said.

For Tesla, it will all come down to how well the company rolls out the Model 3, the electric sedan the company unveiled in late July. Model 3 deliveries are expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter. Tesla’s $60 billion valuation can be interpreted as a “vote of confidence from the market,” as long as Tesla’s near-team growth stays intact and investors believe profits will follow, the Bernstein analysts said. Investors “will continue to supply liquidity and overlook Tesla’s cash burn, just as they historically did” with Wal-Mart and Home Depot, they said. Related: Tesla will be a money-losing business until 2020, analyst says “However, even if we can disregard Tesla’s cash burn, we continue to worry about the company’s ability to deliver upon its long-term vision of profitability.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc is testing a service to stock groceries directly to customers’ refrigerators as it seeks to take on e-commerce giant Amazon.com. The delivery of groceries and meal kits is emerging as the next frontier of competition among retailers. The world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer said on Friday it is partnering with August Home, a provider of smart locks and  home accessories, to test the service with certain customers in the Silicon Valley. (bit.ly/2ffqqvT) The grocery business is set to be upended through Amazon’s acquisition of upmarket grocer Whole Foods last month and the online retailer is also entrenching itself more deeply in the restaurants business. Amazon Restaurants on Friday teamed up with online food ordering company Olo whose network of restaurants includes Applebee’s and Chipotle. The partnership will help Olo’s restaurant customers connect with Amazon’s delivery services. The competition in the meal-kits business is also heating up. Supermarket operator Albertsons Cos Inc said it would buy meal-kit delivery service Plated while rival Kroger-owned Ralphs started selling meal kits in stores this week. ONE-TIME PASSCODE DELIVERY As part of the test, Wal-Mart delivery persons gain access to a customer’s house using a pre-authorized one-time passcode and put away groceries in the fridge and other items in the foyer. Homeowners would receive notifications when the delivery is in progress and could also watch the real-time process from their home security cameras through the August Home app. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has been exploring new methods of delivery and in June said it was testing using its own store employees to deliver packages ordered online.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Maria has devastated the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, another blow to its already precarious economic situation. Puerto Rico’s government owes $72 billion to bondholders, and an additional $50 billion in pension obligations to teachers and almost all other government employees. In May, it filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. The following are responses from multinational companies on how they are dealing with the aftermath of Maria: WAL-MART STORES INC Phillip Keene, Wal-Mart’s director of corporate communications, said, “Like many businesses, we are working to assess any damage to our facilities as we are safely able to access them and working to connect with our associates to assess what their needs are so we can support as appropriate. We are planning to open facilities very thoughtfully, starting with limited hours at our Sam’s Club near San Juan, perhaps as soon as Sunday. One of our Amigo stores has already reopened under limited hours on the south side of San Juan as of this morning. “Walmart operates 48 retail facilities, a distribution center and a satellite headquarters in Puerto Rico, supported by more than 14,700 associates across the Island. At this time, we are trying to best understand the impacts of Hurricane Maria to Puerto Rico, but it’s been a slow process due to widespread power outages and communication issues. We have activated the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the Walmart Home Office in Bentonville, Arkansas, to support our associates in Puerto Rico. The EOC is Walmart’s centralized platform for crisis coordination. In the EOC, we work directly with logistics, store operations and other teams within the business to ensure we’re aligned on our support plans. “We have been in contact with leaders on the Island and continue to be in regular contact with FEMA and the American Red Cross. Our first priority is, and continues to be, the safety of our associates - taking care of them and their families. We are working rapidly to account for our associates, through store and HR leadership as well as social media, local radio and other channels. These efforts will continue. “Although our normal assessment process has been impeded a bit by road conditions and flooding, we are currently working to identify the status of our facilities on the Island. Our Merchandising, Replenishment, Supply Chain and Logistics teams are working to ensure we have critical supplies and product headed to the island via shipping vessels that are slated to depart as soon as Friday (Sept. 22). This is in addition to the shipment of water that was sent toward the island earlier this week, which is currently staged at sea awaiting clearance to safely enter port. We will continue to assess the right flow and mix of merchandise and supplies to send to Puerto Rico in the coming days and weeks.” Tammy Hull, communications manager at Eli Lilly, said: “Lilly has two manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico as well as an affiliate office and sales team. Safety of our employees is our primary concern. The small team of employees who stayed onsite during the storm are safe. We are still accounting for all employees, which is a slow process due to power and communications loss on the island. We are currently assessing our facilities to determine if any damage occurred. Lilly follows emergency procedures that enable us to maintain adequate inventory at our manufacturing sites around the world to ensure a reliable supply of medicine for patients.” Kristen Davis, senior manager of corporate communications at Amgen, said: “Our first priority is the safety of our colleagues and their families. The vast majority of staff at our Amgen Manufacturing Limited (AML) site in Juncos were sent home prior to Maria making landfall, with only a limited number of colleagues remaining on site to monitor operations. At the moment, we are still working to determine the safety of our people and are hopeful that all will be well. At the same time, we are executing on a comprehensive and well-rehearsed business continuity plan for the site itself. Based on what we know at the moment, we are confident there will be no product supply disruptions for patients around the world. Of course, we will work diligently to ensure drug supply for patients in Puerto Rico and to return our operations in Puerto Rico to normal as quickly as possible.” Michele Meixell, head of external communications and affairs at AstraZeneca, said: “Given the early nature of the disaster, we are still in the process of gathering more information, but I can tell you what we know so far. Our Puerto Rico employee base consists of approximately 250 colleagues. This represents both field-based employees as well as those working in our manufacturing facility located in Canovanas. “Right now our number one priority remains the safety and health of our employees and their families. At this point, it’s still early to understand the full impact to our site, but we have started the process to assess our facility. The site does have backup power capabilities and we have a storm crew in limited operation right now until employees are able to safely return to work. In advance of the storm, the facility took appropriate precautions and we have business continuity plans in place to ensure our medicines continue in production. “We do not anticipate interruption in supply at this time. I also want to point out that while our Puerto Rico site is of critical importance to our organization, we have manufacturing facilities all over the globe producing medicines, so in terms of overall business impact, this is important to clarify. “Regarding the safety of our employees, all non-essential employees had been sent home prior to the storm earlier this week. This is a critical time for our employees to be safe and with their families and we will stay in touch with them in various ways that work best for them in this time of need. We stand behind those impacted by Hurricane Maria and AstraZeneca is committed to helping the people and employees affected by all of these recent natural disasters. We will continue to assess the needs of both our employees and those impacted by the storm and once we have more clarity on their needs, provide support and aid however we can.” Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion said, “We’re continuing to assess the situation in Puerto Rico.” ","

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"More than a third of migrant fishermen in Thailand clearly were victims of trafficking over the past five years, and even more workers in the industry were possibly trafficked as well, according to a report published Thursday. Routinely underpaid and physically abused, three-quarters of migrants working on Thai fishing vessels have been in debt bondage, working to pay off an obligation, said the study by the anti-trafficking group International Justice Mission (IJM). Thailand's multibillion-dollar seafood sector came under fire in recent years after investigations showed widespread slavery, trafficking and violence on fishing boats and in onshore food-processing factories. The politically unstable country, which is under military rule, has vowed to crack down on trafficking and recently introduced reforms to its fisheries law. The IJM study of 260 fishermen from Myanmar and Cambodia found 38 percent were clearly trafficked and another 49 percent possibly trafficked. Only 13 percent reported fair labor conditions at sea and no exploitative recruitment, it said. Three-quarters reported working at least 16 hours a day, and only 11 percent said they were paid more than 9,000 Baht ($272 U.S.) per month, the legal monthly minimum wage in Thailand. One fisherman was quoted in the report as saying he was held in debt bondage, owing 20,000 Baht ($604) to his brother, who worked as a supervisor overseeing fishermen. In debt to brother ""I fear for my life as he has killed in front of me before,"" he was quoted as saying. ""I don't dare to run. He would kill my children."" Field researchers surveyed the 260 fishermen in 20 Thai fishing localities in 2016, collecting information on fishing jobs they had held in the previous five years. Thailand, the world's third-largest seafood exporter, had more than 42,000 active fishing vessels as of 2014, and more than 172,000 people were employed as fishermen, the study said. The study was funded by the Walmart Foundation, the charitable arm of giant U.S. retailer Walmart. With release of the study, the foundation announced a grant to help the IJM improve law enforcement efforts against human trafficking in the Thai fishing industry.

(AMZN) may be the king of e-commerce, but when it comes to the best prices and the speediest shipping, it's Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) that takes the crown. That’s according to BMO Capital Markets, which did a deep dive into pricing and shipping costs at Amazon, Costco and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and found that in the 16 categories analyst Kelly Bania and her team studied, the warehouse retailer had prices 7% lower than on Amazon's website. Shipping took an average of 4.5 days per each item compared to 5.5 at Amazon. Wal-Mart and its Jet.com owned e-commerce website had prices that were 18% higher than Amazon's and took a lot longer to ship with the average being 9.8 days. When taking into account Amazon’s Prime membership program that offers discounts and free two-day shipping, BMO Capital Markets found Amazon prices were 4% lower than Wal-Mart when shipping wasn’t included and 10% cheaper when all of the fees were factored in, reported Barron’s, which covered the research report. (See also: Why Amazon Is Losing to JD.com and Wal-Mart.) “With Costco generally beating Amazon in both price and shipping, it’s a reminder that Amazon has strong competition for all those musing about antitrust concerns, especially ones with a strong membership program like Costco's. And with Walmart investing heavily in eCommerce, we think it remains a vital competitor to watch, especially on price,” wrote Bania. “With that said, Amazon offers a wider set of SKUs​ than Costco does, and Prime has other benefits (video, music, etc.) that create differentiation.” The analyst reiterated her outperform rating on Amazon and her $1,200 price target. The analyst rates Wal-Mart and Costco at market perform with price targets of $80 and $170, respectively. “Despite Costco's price gap to Amazon we believe near-term sentiment and fear of the long-term impact of Amazon on Costco's business (whether or not justified by near-term fundamentals) could continue to create an overhang on COST shares and limit valuation upside,” she wrote in the research note.

Marguerite Ward,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"The approaching holiday season means more shopping, and as a result, more jobs in retail. For some retail employees, it will also mean higher wages. Target announced today that it would raise its minimum wage above $10 beginning in October, eventually reaching $11 per hour for all U.S. stores. The retailer has already promised to add 100,000 jobs in the coming months and has committed to raising minimum wage to $15 by 2020. Though many of these jobs may be temporary, they provide experience as well as a source of income, and knowing how major stores compare in terms of hourly pay could help you if you're in the market for a job. Using  Fortune's list of the 20 retailers with the greatest number of employees in the U.S., CNBC Make It looked at average hourly wages for the position of ""sales associate"" —  a common consumer-facing, non-managerial role — at each company. Wages were determined using data submitted by employees to jobs and salary platform Glassdoor. Each company on the list was also contacted to provide information or comment. Here's how the country's 20 biggest retail employers rank in terms of pay: Average hourly wage for sales associates: $7.87Number of employees: 121,000 Average hourly wage for sales associates:  $8.17 to  $8.26Number of employees: 116,050 After five months, some Dollar Tree employees can earn $9 per hour, The Wall Street Journal reports. Average hourly wage for sales associates:  $8.54Number of employees: 140,000 Average hourly wage for sales associates: $8.57 Number of employees: 78,600 Business Insider reports that Ross Stores leadership announced in 2015 it would raise starting wages to $9. Average hourly wage for sales associates:  $8.71Number of employees: 85,000 Average hourly wage for sales associates: $8.75, as determined by averaging Glassdoor data for TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods. (Too few Glassdoor salary reports were available to determine wages for Sierra Trading Post.)Number of employees: 235,000 A company representative tells CNBC Make It that all sales associates now make a starting wage of at least $9 per hour, and at least $10 per hour after six months.

There are many who argue that big retailers could afford to increase wages. Some retail employees say they struggle to make ends meet and many have joined the ""Fight for 15"" protests, which call for a minimum wage of $15 per hour and have gained traction in many major cities. Jiyoung Hwang, assistant professor of marketing at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro's Bryan School of Business and Economics, says there are a few factors at play. Chief among them are the minimum wage in each state, which she says retailers often use a benchmark, the level of skill each employee has and the company's emphasis on corporate social responsibility (CSR.) ""Costco is well-known for its CSR while Wal-Mart is quite lower in that reputation,"" Hwang says. Pressure to offer customers low prices, long operating hours and the importance of competing with other retailers also play a big role, she adds. In addition, company sales, the cost of living in an area and a worker's responsibilities contribute to wage decisions, according to Ana Serafin Smith, senior director of media relations at the National Retail Federation (NRF). Still, Smith says that those who earn minimum wage from major retailers may not have to do so for long. ""A majority of those hired in an entry-level position,"" Smith says, citing NRF research, ""reported earning a promotion within a year of employment.""

Chief executive Brian Cornell said the decision to raise wages to $15 by 2020 will help Target attract and retain talent as the hyper-competitive retail sector enters its busiest quarter. It also shows the growing impact of the Fight for $15–and puts pressure on other major players like Amazon, Walmart and McDonalds to follow suit. Since striking fast-food workers launched the Fight for $15 in 2012, states and cities comprising more than 18 percent of the U.S. workforce—including Target's home city of Minneapolis—have approved $15 minimum wages. And scores of companies have raised pay to $15, including insurance giants Aetna and Allstate, major hospital chains across the country, and tech leader Facebook for its contracted bus drivers, janitors and security guards. But Target's role as an industry leader in retail—which together with restaurants employs the largest share of workers paid less than $15–illustrates what business strategists have long argued: historically low-paying sectors can make the shift to significantly higher pay. MIT business professor Zeynep Ton has shown how industry leaders like Costco and Trader Joe's provide a roadmap for how investing in retail workers with good wages and benefits goes hand-in-hand with strong growth and productivity. Target's move blows up the claims of corporate lobbyists who argue it's simply not possible for industries like retail and restaurants to pay a $15 minimum wage. In fact,  growing numbers of business owners and economists confirm that a phased-in $15 minimum wage is realistic for employers and will help boost the consumer spending that ultimately drives job growth. But ultimately the imperative to pay a living wage is about our nation's values. As La Colombe CEO Todd Carmichael  argued last week, ""unless you pay your employees a nonpredatory living wage that keeps people and their families above the poverty line, you don't deserve to be in business."" Part of what's driving employers like Target to pay $15 an hour is the simple fact that,  everywhere in America—not just on the coasts-- a single worker will soon need to earn at least that much just to afford the basics. And workers on the coasts or supporting kids will need even more. Yet more than 43 percent of America's workers struggle on less than $15 an hour. Far from teenagers, the median age of the millions of  workers earning less than $15 an hour in the U.S. is 32. They include hospital workers and preschool teachers, auto-parts workers and waitresses. In other words, many of the front line jobs in which U.S. workers today spend their careers pay less than $15 an hour. And we all end up subsidizing those low wages. Low pay by corporations like McDonald's and Walmart cost taxpayers  a whopping $153 billion a year in public assistance to working families, according to a recent study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. A key issue when employers like Target raise pay is what happens to the growing numbers of employees who don't work for them directly but instead through staffing agencies or service contractors. In the Twin Cities, Target has already been a leader in tackling this issue,  agreeing last year to support the efforts of its contracted janitors to unionize and raise their pay substantially. Ensuring that more employers raise standards for contracted and direct employees alike is essential  in our increasingly ""fissured"" workplaces. Low pay is hurting America's working families and holding back our economy, which depends on a thriving consumer class to drive growth. Target's plan to raise pay to $15 an hour over the next 30 months is smart business strategy, and what our nation's workforce and economy need. There's now a bullseye on the back of employers like Amazon, Walmart and McDonalds. They should follow Target's lead. ",Target's $15 an hour move 'blows up' minimum wage myths-commentary

The Wharton School's Jeremy Siegel believes it'll have a lot to do with President Donald Trump's intention to get business-friendly reforms passed on Capitol Hill — not the latest Federal Reserve decision on interest rates or better-than-expected economic growth figures. ""I would say corporate tax reform could add another 10 percent to the market even this year,"" Siegel said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" A deal ""looks very likely to get done."" It's the second time in less than 12 months that Siegel, a longtime bull, has made a bold market call. And it came on a day when the Dow and S&P 500 closed at record highs. In the final weeks of 2016, Siegel argued that the blue chip stock index was very close to hitting the 20,000 milestone. It broke through that key psychological level on Jan. 25 and since then has soared more than 10 percent. If Siegel is right this time, too, a 10 percent jump would put the Dow around 24,650 and the S&P 500 at 2,760 based on Wednesday's closes. ""There's new hope that taxes really have a chance to be done. I remained steadfast throughout some of the bleak days in the last few months when no one thought anything could be done,"" Siegel added. ""There's a little bit more optimism now.

Over the past year, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has been stocking up on online retail outlets. It closed its acquisition of Jet.com about a year ago, and it's since bought four other small online retailers. Wal-Mart's efforts have resulted in huge online sales growth, but its acquisition strategy may be somewhat flawed. Wal-Mart has put the former CEO of Jet.com, Marc Lore, in charge of its online operations in the United States. He recently spoke at a conference, and when asked what Wal-Mart does better than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), he said Wal-Mart's unique assets separate it from the competition. Image source: Wal-Mart Lore pointed specifically to the ""4,600"" stores Wal-Mart operates in the United States as a unique advantage over Amazon. Lore may have been using an old store count, because Wal-Mart says it has 4,741 stores in the U.S. That number is somehow getting larger every year. Roughly 90% of the U.S. population is within 10 miles of a Walmart store. That means Wal-Mart has a big advantage in in-store pickup and online grocery ordering, and has the infrastructure to succeed in shipping items to customers' homes. Indeed, Wal-Mart was able to launch free two-day shipping on its online orders over $35 earlier this year thanks in part to its network of stores. ""We can do 2-hour delivery cheaper than anybody else because of the assets we have,"" Lore said. After purchasing Whole Foods Market, Amazon's physical storefronts still only amount to about 10% of Wal-Mart's. Even with its  network of fulfillment centers, just 44% of the population lived within 20 miles of Amazon's network as of a year ago. Those fulfillment centers naturally have a lot of overlap with Whole Foods locations as they both target high-population areas. Wal-Mart is the nation's largest private employer with 1.5 million employees in the U.S. Lore cites this as an asset, although the larger overhead has been more of a drag for Wal-Mart. Amazon generates twice as much revenue per employee compared to Wal-Mart. Lore has been creative in finding ways to make employees more efficient as Wal-Mart boosts online sales. Not only does the large number of employees allow Wal-Mart to quickly ramp up services like fulfilling online grocery orders in its stores, Lore tested using employees to deliver online orders the last mile to customers' doorsteps. Physical retail necessitates more employees compared to online-only operations like Amazon. Workers need to stock shelves, assist customers in stores, and work the checkout lines. Investors should expect Amazon's revenue-per-employee number to fall after incorporating Whole Foods' numbers into the mix. But those extra employees offer an opportunity to expand a retailer's capabilities. Wal-Mart's biggest success, so far, has been online grocery ordering and pickup. Lore will continue to search for opportunities like that. Lore wasn't afraid to admit where Amazon has Wal-Mart beat -- that's the overall shopping experience on Amazon compared to Walmart. He said it's easier to find the product you want on Amazon, the competitor often has a greater assortment of goods, and the delivery experience is often superior. It's simple to hire a bunch of engineers to hack away at Walmart.com's search and recommendation algorithms to find the products people really want. It's a lot tougher for Wal-Mart to convince certain brands to sell their goods at its stores. Wal-Mart's reputation for low quality keeps it from attracting more high-end brands. That's part of the idea of buying up smaller online outlets like Bonobos and ShoeBuy. It's also made an effort to attract more third-party merchants to its online marketplace. A quality shopping experience is the biggest hurdle for Wal-Mart to really take on Amazon. And as Amazon moves into brick-and-mortar retail, Wal-Mart may start to feel a bit more pressure to get it right. ","

"Timothy Green, Danny Vena, and Keith Speights",09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. To be a successful long-term investor, you need to make sure your portfolio won't implode on the first sign of a rainy day. What seems like a great idea during the best of times will only reveal its true nature during the worst of times. Sticking with companies that can perform well regardless of economic conditions is an effective way to harden your portfolio. Here's why three of our Foolish investors think Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are some of the best rainy-day stocks. Image source: Getty Images. Danny Vena (Wal-Mart): Investors planning for a rainy day should fortify their portfolio with companies that can perform well during periods of economic instability, which is when consumers tend to spend carefully, forgoing their usual shopping habits and opting for lower prices. During the depths of the Great Recession, many shoppers turned to Wal-Mart's ""Always low prices"" to help make ends meet. As the largest retailer in the world, Wal-Mart has unmatched economies of scale. For its fiscal year ended January 2017, it produced revenue of $485.9 billion and operating income of $22.8 billion. Its operating cash flow totaled $31.5 billion, and it returned $8.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchases. Wal-Mart is also a Dividend Aristocrat, having paid a dividend every year since 1974 and boasting 44 years of consecutive increases. It has a dividend that currently yields 2.5% and a healthy payout ratio of 48%, leaving room for future increases. While the company was initially slow to embrace e-commerce, it corrected that last year with its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, as well as a number of other smaller specialty clothiers. As a result, in its most recent quarter the company posted impressive increases in e-commerce sales, which grew 60% over the prior-year quarter, with gross merchandise volume increasing 67% year over year. If you're looking for a stock for a rainy day, consider this: During the bear market that began Oct. 9, 2007, and ended March 9, 2009, while the broader S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) fell 56%, Wal-Mart stock gained 10%. Data by YCharts. Keith Speights (Facebook): What do people do on a rainy day? They stay inside. While inside, there's a pretty good chance that they'll look at social media. And the undisputed king of social media is Facebook. I suspect that the executives at Facebook like it when people stay inside on rainy days, because it increases the amount of time they spend catching up on friends' posts -- and looking at ads. Ads generate 98% of Facebook's revenue. And that revenue is growing, with the company reporting a 47% year-over-year jump in advertising revenue in the second quarter of 2017. This growth stems from two factors. First, Facebook charged 24% more per ad in the last quarter. It can get away with that kind of price boost because it reaches more than 2 billion monthly active users. Second, the company is also increasing the number of ads displayed. More volume at higher prices is a surefire way to make more money. But can buying Facebook stock make you plenty of money? I think so. Wall Street projects that Facebook will achieve average annual earnings growth over the next five years of nearly 27%. That's a drop from the heady growth of past years, but it's still an impressive level. That growth makes Facebook's valuation look pretty reasonable as well. Facebook isn't just a leader in social media. It's also a leader in artificial intelligence and augmented reality, two of the hottest trends in technology today. Buying Facebook stock is a way of investing in these two trends. That's a pretty smart way, in my view, to use time on a rainy day so that your financial future isn't stormy. Tim Green (Microsoft): Software giant Microsoft has changed quite a bit over the past few years. It's embraced cloud computing, building its Azure cloud platform into a strong No. 2 player. It's dropped its Windows-centric position, building first-class apps for Android and iOS. And it's building an increasing amount of hardware, from its Surface tablets and laptop to its HoloLens augmented reality headset. But what hasn't changed about Microsoft is its dominant position in the productivity software market. Businesses depend on Office, Outlook, and other Microsoft products, and that's likely to remain true regardless of the state of the economy. Office is still the company's cash cow, despite serious competition from Alphabet's Google. While Microsoft is heavily investing in growth businesses like cloud computing, the company is still producing impressive profits. During fiscal 2017, Microsoft generated $21.2 billion of net income on $90.0 billion of revenue. Meanwhile, Azure revenue is doubling year over year, and Office 365 commercial, the subscription version of Office, is growing by more than 40% annually. Microsoft is in an enviable position, with dominant businesses like Office throwing off cash, allowing the company to invest in newer businesses that will act as its growth engine for years to come. Through the good times and the bad, Microsoft should continue to produce exceptional results. ","

Target (NYSE:TGT) made news earlier this week by making public plans to increase its minimum hourly wage for all employees to $11 in October. The chain also pledged to increase wages to a $15-per-hour minimum by 2020. The company said in a press release that a ""significant investment in its team will allow Target to continue to recruit and retain strong team members."" It comes at a time when unemployment sits near historic lows and the idea of a $15-an-hour minimum wage has become a huge topic of national debate. Target's move follows its previous wage hike to a $10 an hour minimum in 2016. It also follows efforts from its chief rival, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), to raise wages. In February 2016 the company pledged to pay any employees hired before Jan. 1, 2016 at $10 an hour and that any workers hired after that would receive at least $9 an hour, with their rate increasing to at least $10 upon completion of a training program. Target has increased the minimum hourly wage for its employees. Image source: Target. Only two states -- Massachusetts and Washington -- have $11-an-hour minimum wages. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia, however, have a minimum wage that exceeds the federal standard of $7.25. In his remarks in the press release Target's CEO Brian Cornell framed the move as being about making life better for his chain's workers. Target has always offered market competitive wages to our team members. With this latest commitment, we'll be providing even more meaningful pay, as well as the tools, training and support our team needs to build their skills, develop professionally and offer the service and expertise that set Target apart. That's, of course, a piece of it, but the reality is that changing market conditions dictate the increase. With unemployment standing at 4.4% in August, near historic lows, the reality is Target needs to pay more to attract workers. An employee who makes $11 an hour for a 40-hour week would earn $22,800 a year. That's less than the average annual wages for cashiers ($27,701) and warehouse associates ($40,784), according to GlassDoor's most-recent Local Pay Reports. Of course, those reports offer the average of all workers in those positions, not the minimum hourly starting wage. Target's starting pay will also be less than the $14.21 an hour the average Costco cashier makes and less than the $12.42 an Amazon fulfillment associate earns per hour, according to GlassDoor salary reviews. That data is based on 158 Costco employees reporting their earnings to the jobs data website and 683 Amazon warehouse workers doing the same. The new rate, however, is very competitive in other areas of the market. Starting workers at $11 an hour does put Target well ahead of the $8.41 to $8.61 an hour the average McDonald's crew member or cashier makes. Target's starting salary will also be more than the average Starbucks barista makes ($9.55 to $9.57), and more than Sears ($8.37 to $8.54) and J.C. Penney ($9.04 to $9.07) associates and cashiers, according to what was reported to GlassDoor. In the retail world, especially when it comes to entry-level positions, small differences in salary can be the difference between someone taking a job or electing to go elsewhere. Competitive pay can also help a company retain employees, lowering its long-term training costs while also improving customer service. Heading into a time when it and many of its rivals are hiring for the holidays, Target has given itself a leg up on the competition. By paying more than the competition, the retailer should have an easier time hiring and holding onto the employees it needs. That should improve the in-store experience for customers and help the company meet its Q4 goals. The company's long-range wage increases will help it build an ongoing foundation of well-trained, experienced employees. ","
      
    How Much Do Retailers Actually Pay Hourly Workers? -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In the 1980s and even the 1990s, Toys R Us was a place children begged their parents to take them. The chain had a selection of toys that dwarfed what was sold at now-defunct department store chains like Ames, Caldor, and Bradlees. Even its Sunday newspaper inserts were an event, and its holiday season ""toy book"" was much perused by children in order to pick out what gifts they planned to ask for. Toys R Us' slow path to bankruptcy, which it filed on Sept. 18, did not begin with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). It started with chains like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) creating toy departments that not only pushed prices (and margins) lower, but also made it so a visit to Toys R Us was no longer unique. Wal-Mart and Target made Toys R Us less of a destination and gave parents a way to placate their kids while also doing their own shopping. Toys R Us has filed for bankruptcy. Image source: Getty Images. For two years, I ran the largest toy and hobby store in New England. We had a Toys R Us, a Target, and a Wal-Mart within a couple of miles of us. We were also in a relatively remote location while our toy-selling rivals were closer to the highway and near a major mall. Despite those deficits and the fact that we were generally more expensive than the chains we competed with, we thrived. The mistake Toys R Us has made is that it has done very little to differentiate itself from its department store rivals. My former toy store, which is doing well to this day, did much more than sell toys, hobby items, model trains, and more. It actively gave customers a reason to visit. We hosted gaming events, tournaments, and learn-to-play classes for everything from the easiest children's games to the most complicated collectible offerings. We also had multiple huge model train sets that were shown off for free twice a month, and every Sunday during the holiday season. Those trains were maintained and built by clubs that met in the store. During weekdays, we had story time for children, and on holidays, we barbecued, made cotton candy, or handed out special treats to our customers. Even when nothing was happening, we had play areas for little kids, model-building areas for all ages, and a near-endless supply of curios we picked up in theory to sell, but just as much to give customers something to look at. We also had a customer-first attitude where we welcomed everyone warmly, treated regulars like family, and accepted that sometimes we were going to teach a customer about a product only for them to buy it cheaper on Amazon. Our store also had merchandise that wouldn't be found at a Toys R Us or a department store, as well as staff that was passionate about what they sold. Toys R Us had the tools and the space to be all of those things, but either arrogance or complacency stopped it from evolving. Once simply having toys stopped making it a destination for kids and toy lovers, the chain needed to do more. CEO David Brandon acknowledged that in the bankruptcy filing, explaining how the company would change its stores. ""Once these initiatives are implemented, Toys R Us stores will be interactive spaces with rooms to use for parties, live product demonstrations put on by trained employees, and the freedom for employees to remove product from boxes to let kids play with the latest toys,"" he said. That's the model that would have worked all along. It's a game Target and Wal-Mart are unlikely to play, and one that Amazon, for obvious reasons, can't. Bankruptcy may clear some debt and let the company shed some leases, but it needs to change in order to avoid slowly falling right back into the same hole. Toys R Us has to go from being a place that sells toys and games to one that's full of activities, experiences, and discoveries for kids and adults alike. The chain needs to transform from store to destination -- if it does that, then sales will follow. ","

It wasn't so long ago that investors couldn't buy enough of Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR): Between 2013 and 2015, the stock rose an astonishing 217%. Yet since January 2016, Kroger's shares have lost 50% of their value. Over the last 18 months, Kroger's comparable quarterly sales, excluding fuel sales, have shifted from healthy growth in the mid-single digits to a complete standstill. In the final quarter of 2016, the company saw its 13-year streak of comparable sales growth snap, as comps declined for the first time in 53 quarters. Kroger is cuing up a comps revival, but for now, progress is wan. Management projects just a slight expansion in this metric of 0.5% to 1% for the second half of the current fiscal year. The culprit, of course, is fierce competition among grocers for customers. And it will only intensify: 2018 promises to ring in a battle royale within the grocery industry. Whole Foods Market will present a distinct online retailing challenge once new owner Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) integrates the organic chain's loyalty program with its Amazon Prime service. As for brick-and-mortar developments, privately held German discount grocers Aldi and Lidl will open 500 new stores in the U.S. between them by the end of 2018 alone, as Aldi seeks to expand and Lidl builds on its 2017 entry on the east coast. In a pre-emptive response to the European invasion, Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) -- never an easy grocer to undercut -- is already allowing its gross margin to slip in 2017 in order to ""invest in price."" These pitched battles, both online and in midsized and major metropolitan areas, are occurring just as shopping habits undergo significant change. The Food Marketing Institute has been tracking grocery industry trends for decades. Last year, its ""U.S. Grocery Shopper Report"" confirmed what many of us have experienced personally: Shoppers are splitting their grocery buys over a number of different store types and channels. In fact, the report showed that in each of the preceding three years, a ""significant"" number of shoppers (between 7% and 9%) no longer claimed loyalty to a primary grocery store. That's a problem for Kroger, which operates as a conventional grocer in an increasingly specialized world. It's not a premium grocer like Whole Foods, nor a deep-discounter like Aldi or Lidl. The company instead has existed as a traditional supermarket which uses high customer engagement and sheer proximity to customers (with approximately 2,800 stores spread across 35 states) to drive traffic. Image source: Getty Images. To keep comps from treading water, which won't be kind to its stock price, Kroger has a complex task ahead. The company will have to stay focused, avoid overreaching for desperate solutions, and double down on its very formidable core strengths. Read through a recent earnings call transcript, or browse the company's quarterly earnings reports, and you'll be reminded of the slate of advantages that propelled Kroger, not many quarters ago, to brisk comps growth. I'll summarize them briefly as follows: Think of the advantages above as a sort of body armor Kroger constructed over the last few years as competitors refined their individual niches and prepared to attack on price and differentiation. Now's the time to wear that armor in the battle to protect market share and build comps. This month, CEO Rodney McMullen said emphatically in an earnings conference call that the grocer is ""not going to lose on price."" Cutting prices is simple, but retaining customers on price alone is not. A more sustainable strategy is to shift more resources away from price investment, and toward the manufacturing, brand, and technology investments which boost inherent advantages. To stabilize in this environment and grow again, Kroger needs to push its Simple Truth line. It should expand private-label brands that contribute to higher profits. It should continue to embrace online shopping, and dial up the use of analytics to retain customers and incentivize shopping frequency. In reaffirming its strengths, Kroger will reaffirm its identity to its customers.

Daniel B. Kline,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The fourth quarter has become a sort of retail free-for-all where stores try increasingly desperate tactics to lure in customers. From opening on Thanksgiving Day to heavy discounts and aggressive promotions, retailers pull out all the stops. That makes sense because the importance of the period seems to grow each year. In 2017, early predictions from Deloitte show that total holiday sales, excluding automobiles and gasoline, will reach $1.04 trillion to $1.05 trillion between November and January, up from $1 trillion last year. And while the digital portion of overall sales has grown, e-commerce sales will only account for $111 billion to $114 billion of that total -- an 18%-21% increase over $93.8 billion in 2016. Servicing all of those sales requires workers. In Q4, really toward the end of Q3 in September, many retail and retail-adjacent companies have traditionally hired a lot of people. This list will expand as the season gets closer, but there are a lot of jobs out there in a market that's already near historically high employment rates. Unlike last year, these jobs may not be easy to fill, a fact that has already caused Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) to decide against hiring temporary workers. Instead, the retailer will fill its need by offering overtime to existing employees. Some of the companies on this list may end up following Wal-Mart's lead if they can't find enough qualified applicants, but for now, here's the list of companies that are hiring and how many people they need. Retailers will be hiring tens of thousands of workers for the holiday season. Image source: Target. Even though Wal-Mart has elected to sit out the hiring season, most of its rivals have different plans. There will literally be hundreds of thousands of openings in everything from front-end, consumer-facing positions, to backroom warehouse jobs, and digital fulfillment positions: These are not the only retailers with holiday hiring plans, just the ones that have come forward so far. Kohl's, Nordstrom, and many other chains are planning to add workers. In many ways, it's a job-seeker's market, with applicants being able to weigh things like pay and benefits against the possibility of becoming a permanent hire when deciding where to apply. The rise of digital sales has put tremendous pressure on the companies that deliver online orders. The United States Postal Service (USPS) has posted job listings in a number of markets looking for both seasonal and permanent workers. The number of openings varies based on the market, but the overall job count seems significant. Not to be outdone by the government, both United Parcel Service and FedEx plan to hire. UPS plans to add about 95,000 seasonal workers, while its rival hopes to hire 50,000 while also offering more overtime for existing employees. In many cases seasonal jobs go to college kids, people working a second gig, or those not looking to enter the workforce full-time. For those seeking permanent employment, however, a seasonal job can be a way to get your foot in the door at a company you want to work at. Every company on this list has both full and seasonal openings, but if your goal is a permanent job, it may be best to take seasonal work at a thriving company. Amazon, for example, is likely to keep more temporary workers than Toys R Us or Macy's simply given the trajectory of their businesses. Still, a chain like Target may be facing challenges, but it's doing well enough that exceptional seasonal workers can probably find a full-time, permanent job after the holiday season. ","

Scott Levine,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Like solar and wind power, many alternative energy advocates have touted the potential of hydrogen power for years. Investors in fuel cell companies like Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) are still waiting, however, for the inflection point that marks the company's transition to sustained profitability. Perhaps in 2017, though, that time has come. Rising 128% in 2017 as of this writing, Plug Power has delighted the market -- unlike in 2016 -- with several announcements, suggesting that the tide has turned. Thanks in part to a deal with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), fuel cell fever is working its way through Wall Street. Indicating a bullish outlook on the stock, analysts at FBR Capital and Cowen have each identified a $3 price target on the stock. Moreover, an analyst at the investment bank Rodman and Renshaw issued a $4 price target. But Wall Street's enthusiasm doesn't necessarily mean investors should start powering their portfolios with this fuel cell industry leader. Image source: Getty Images. To say that news of the company's deal with Amazon was well received would be a gross understatement. Shares soared more than 60% in April -- the month in which the announcement was made -- and the stock hasn't looked back, continuing to climb ever since. What fed the fervor? For one, Plug Power's management expects the deal to add $70 million to the company's top line in 2017. This is no small sum considering the company reported $86 million in revenue in the prior year. Besides the deal with Amazon, Plug Power pleased investors with its second-quarter earnings report. Management announced a new agreement with long-term partner Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), with an estimated the contract value to be $70 million. And speaking to its fiscal 2017 finances, it was quite optimistic, estimating negative free cash flow of $25 million to $35 million. Additionally, the company expects further progress in its pursuit of profitability, and is forecasting an expansion in its fiscal 2017 gross margin (excluding the impact of warrants issued to Amazon and Wal-Mart) to 8% to 12%; the fiscal 2016 gross margin was only 4.6%. In terms of the stock, because it's unprofitable, we can't use the traditional price-to-earnings metric to value shares, so let's consider the price-to-sales ratio. Shares are trading around 5.4 times sales, slightly higher than the stock's 5.2 average, but those who are optimistic about the company's future could certainly shrug off this seemingly high price tag. Despite the deal with Amazon and an improvement in some areas of its financials, the bear argument for Plug Power remains strong. Image source: Getty Images For one, management's forecast for its fiscal 2017 performance must be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism since it doesn't have a great track record of meeting its guidance. In 2013, it estimated Plug Power would break even on an EBITDA basis by the second or third quarter of 2014. Slightly off, the company reported an EBITDA loss of $84 million in 2014 according to Morningstar. Last year, during its Q1 2016 presentation, it announced a gross margin goal exceeding 12% for fiscal 2016. The company instead reported a gross margin of 4.6%, thereby coming up quite short. Management, furthermore, set an operating cash flow target of negative $20 million. Again missing the target, it reported negative $30 million in operating cash flow in fiscal 2016. PLUG R&D to Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Accounting for 28% of revenue in the trailing 12 months, revenue earmarked for R&D will likely remain a large obstacle on the road to profitability as the company pursues development of its ProGen prototypes for both the domestic and Chinese markets. Predicated on a future where hydrogen has supplanted traditional fuels, picking up shares of Plug Power at this point remains too risky. As one who's been enthusiastic about alternative power for years, I'd be more than happy to add Plug Power to my portfolio. Unfortunately, trust issues regarding its management team still persist, and the failure to translate top-line growth to the bottom line remains a concern. Unless the stock nosedives and reaches rock-bottom prices or the company remedies its issues, I'll be rooting for Plug Power from the sidelines. ","

Jeff Vande Hey,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In the past three years, iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) has pulled off a truly impressive feat. During that time, the maker of home robotics has increased its revenue by nearly 40% while simultaneously reducing its revenue sources. Specifically, the company eliminated $55 million in revenue and pulled out its very roots by divesting its military segment in 2016 and recently discontinued one of its four product lines in the home robotics category, a gutter cleaning line called the Looj. IRBT Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. How then, has the company been able to increase revenue at such a rapid pace? By absolutely dominating in its top product category, that's how! In 2002, iRobot essentially invented the robotic vacuum cleaning market with the launch of the first Roomba. For a decade and a half, Roomba has been the king of robotic vacuum cleaners, especially in the United States, where it holds a jaw-dropping 88% market share. However, it is no longer the only game in town. Let's take a look at the evidence and decide whether there are any companies ready to challenge iRobot's leadership in the fast-growing robotic vacuum cleaner market. It is hard to fathom that any competitor would be able to overtake iRobot in global market share in the near future. iRobot's current position compared to that of its closest rival is simply too dominant: Data source: iRobot. Chart by author. However, just because a competitor can't take the No. 1 spot doesn't mean it can't meaningfully affect iRobot's top and bottom lines, and by extension, its stock price. Let's look further at two companies that might have the potential to do just that. Image source: Ecovacs SharkNinja: SharkNinja is a newcomer to the robotic floor-cleaning market, but it is certainly no stranger to consumers. The company's Ninja Blender has been ranked the No. 1 blender three years in a row in the U.S.,and its upright vacuum cleaners have claimed the No. 1 spot in U.S. market share. Earlier this month, SharkNinja began selling the Shark ION Robot 750. While it's too early to know for sure how big of a splash SharkNinja will make in the market, it's likely the company has big plans. With iRobot's stock dropping 15% after a short-seller said the competitor's entrance to the market posed ""a credible threat,"" it's safe to say shareholders agree. Only time will tell if iRobot will be able to continue growing revenue and earnings at a rapid clip with increasing competition trying to get a bigger share of the pie. We do know that iRobot's management believes its patent portfolio is a huge part of its competitive moat. The other safeguard iRobot may have is a fast-growing market. At a recent investor conference, management stated that the immediately addressable market for robotic vacuums is two to three times the currently installed base and that 700% market growth is expected over the long term. If the market for robotic floor cleaners grows fast enough, it is possible iRobot could lose market share and still grow revenue and profits significantly. At the same time, competition is increasing as we speak. Robotic vacuum cleaners at lower price points have essentially become commoditized home appliances. Amazon's ""robotic vacuums"" product selection numbers in the hundreds, and iRobot estimates that 20% of all vacuums worldwide are robotic -- and more than 30% of those are made by its competitors. With that level of competition already existing for lower-end products, if Ecovacs or Shark Ninja can chip away at market share on the premium lines (which management defines as vacuums costing $200 or above), it's only a matter of time before iRobot's absolute dominance comes to an end.

A full transcript follows the video. Mac Greer: Let's begin with, frankly, a retailer that I have pretty much forgotten is still around -- Bed Bath & Beyond. Wow, Bed Bath & Beyond taking a bath on Wednesday. Shares down more than 14% after the company lowered its earnings outlook and reported weaker-than-expected earnings. David Kretzmann, I go to you. Is Bed Bath & Beyond beyond repair? Is there anything you can do to save this? David Kretzmann: What hurts here is, the stores aren't performing that well, but on the financial side of things, management has done more to add gasoline to that bad fire overall. If you go back to 2014, from a financial perspective, the company looked like it was in decent shape. It was producing over $1 billion in free cash flow annually, had $850 million in net cash on the balance sheet, so they had cash in the bank, they were producing a lot more cash to add to that tally. But that year, they decided to issue $1.5 billion in new debt just to buy back stock. They essentially went into more debt, bought back a lot of stock, and now a few years later the company has over $1 billion in net debt, and their free cash flow production has almost been cut in half to about $570 million. So that's a bleak direction to be going within just a few years. They've really been focusing on buying back stock, they haven't done a whole lot to improve the actual in-store experience, and what they have done has been very slow. They are making some progress with their digital sales, which now make up about 15% of total revenue. They say that their ""differentiated products,"" which they consider their exclusive products, personalizable products, makes up about half of sales, so I think that's probably an area where they really need to double down and find some way to differentiate what they're offering and how they offer it from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other retailers that are still out there. They've also made some acquisitions into new brick-and-mortar retail concepts. They bought a website, personalizationmall.com, late last year, where you can buy and personalize a lot of different items. Going that route makes the most sense to me. It's not a stock I would buy, even though it looks very cheap-looking at these trailing metrics. But I think management has made some very poor cash management decisions over the past few years, and in the meantime, the actual performance of the stores leaves a lot to be desired. Aaron Bush: Yeah, one tidbit that I keep on coming back to for Bed Bath & Beyond and for other struggling retailers is, when a brick-and-mortar store tries to add a quality e-commerce operation, not only does it tend to cause its physical stores to struggle more, but it makes the company increasingly expensive to run, because they have to duplicate the cost just to serve that same customer. So you do see them making really dumb decisions with debt, and adding new retail concepts, which feels more like a distraction than anything. But just the fundamental structure of how the economics work, and managing an in-store presence and an online presence isn't very friendly. And they've been really slow to do this. But now that they are invested in it, it's another reason that's adding a margin drag and keeping earnings lower. Greer: Do you think, in terms of those traditional retailers adding that online piece, I see why you would want to do it. Everyone's trying to fend off Amazon. You have to try anything. So you have Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) with the Jet acquisition. Do you think that's going to work for Wal-Mart? Or, to take your logic even further, if you're Wal-Mart, do you stick to your knitting, which is just bread-and-butter traditional retailers? Bush: I think for Wal-Mart and Jet, I think it was smart to acquire Jet, not for Jet itself, but more for the talent that is in that management team. And I know, I'm blanking on his name ... Marc Lore, who was the head of Jet, now runs Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations. So I think that was smart. What Wal-Mart really needs to do is continue to acquire things and really build up a big suite of an online presence. When it comes to e-commerce, aggregation is increasingly important, so you either have to dominate a niche, or you have to be someone that you can go to for anything and everything. So it's tough. Wal-Mart might be able to pull it off, Amazon is definitely pulling it off, but for someone like Bed Bath & Beyond it's a hard spot. Kretzmann: I think what Aaron mentioned highlights why it's so difficult for these brick-and-mortar retailers to pivot more to online or omnichannel sales because it tends to be more expensive to operate both rather than one or the other. But there is some value to the omnichannel experience. You see Amazon clearly showing a lot of interest in opening up their own brick-and-mortar stores, acquiring Whole Foods. So there is value there. But for a lot of these companies, I think it will be a short-term ding, but it's probably what they need to do to stay relevant and figure out some way to hopefully improve the economics over time, one way or another, whether it's offering more personalized services or some sort of consultation. We're going to talk about Best Buy today. They're trying to do something along those lines. But in the short term, the company needs to stomach those short-term dings if they want to stay relevant with competitors like Amazon. Greer: So, Bed Bath & Beyond shares a lot cheaper today than they were yesterday, but you're still not interested? Kretzmann: Based on management's track record, both managing the stores and how they've been trying to pivot those stores, I think they've been lackluster there. And they've also really jeopardized the company's financial position, because you're not going to go bankrupt if you don't have debt, and they completely pivoted the whole balance sheet a few years ago to buy back stock, which, in hindsight, looks like a very dumb move. Shares have continued dropping since then, so that was a poor investment, and a very poor reason to go into debt. So, from a financial position now, the company's future is in a lot more jeopardy now. So I would stay on the sidelines here. Greer: So, five years from now, are they still a going concern? Are they still around? Kretzmann: I think they're still around but they're probably getting pretty close to bankruptcy, at the rate they're going now. ","

                                   climbed by 0.9%. “The backdrop for gold today is as bullish as it has been in a long time,” said Mark O’Byrne, research director at GoldCore in Dublin. He expects gold prices to reach $1,400 before the end of the year. With President Donald Trump “in the White House and the political situation in the U.S. and globally more uncertain than it has been in many years, gold will almost certainly continue to see robust safe-haven demand,” he said. “This should push gold higher in the coming months.” Recent military tensions between North Korea and the U.S. and its allies has helped to underpin gold’s haven status as a hedge against a sudden escalation in geopolitical tension. According to media reports Monday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told reporters that Trump’s tweet that leader Kim Jong Un “won’t be around much longer” was a declaration of war, and Japanese leader Shinzo Abe on Monday called a snap general election in a bid to consolidate power in the midst of a diplomatic crisis with North Korea. Read: These are the next risk events for investors now Gold is “coming out of a bear market, and “the technical position looks better and better after gold bottomed in December 2015,” said O’Byrne. “Since then, we have seen a series of higher lows and higher highs.” “Global demand remains robust with strong demand being seen in many sectors—especially in the ETFs and also in Chinese demand, he said. Gold is also considered a counter to what some market participants have described as lofty levels for U.S. equities potentially ripening for a correction.

The two markets often move inversely as a weaker dollar can make commodities pegged to the currency, including most of the world’s gold, more appealing to buyers using weaker monetary units. The dollar strengthened against the euro, which was under pressure after a heavy drop in support for mainstream parties in Germany’s general election on Sunday left the way forward in doubt for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative alliance.

Higher rates not only boost the dollar but can dull the appeal of nonyielding bullion. A busy lineup of Fed speakers this week features the central bank’s chairwoman, Janet Yellen, on Tuesday, and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer on Thursday.

Passive products allow investors to hold all the components of an index like the Russell 2000

That’s in contrast to actively managed funds, where the securities are individually selected by a portfolio manager. The shift away from active and into passive has been dramatic, driven by both the lower cost and historically better performance of passive funds. According to Morningstar, passive funds attracted inflows of $428.7 billion over 2016, while actively managed funds saw outflows of $285.2 billion, a trend that has occurred for nearly 10 years.

According to FactSet, fully one-seventh of the nearly $4.2 trillion in global ETF assets are in funds tracking the benchmark U.S. equity index. The result of that is that passive funds now own an average of 17% of each component of the S&P 500, per Goldman’s data (the range is as little as 10%, and as much as 35%), whereas passive ownership was “a rounding error” a decade ago. Vanguard alone has at least a 5% stake in 468 components of the S&P 500, according to a June report in The Wall Street Journal, up from just three components in 2005. Read more: Investors flock to Vanguard funds, dump Goldman, Wells Fargo, and others Also: Vanguard calls for more diverse corporate boards, better climate-change disclosures As buying and selling index-funds essentially means buying and selling every component of the underlying index, “less trading is stemming from views on company fundamentals,” Goldman wrote. “Passive holders trade stock for different reasons than active managers, and at different frequencies. Passive’s decision to buy or sell stocks is often directed by broader fund flows and larger rebalances and not typically company specific fundamentals.” The investment bank calculated that for the average S&P 500 company, the share of its stock that might trade on fundamental views has dropped to 77% compared with 95% a decade ago. Those figures are based on a measure Goldman calls “passive-adjusted float,” or the number of shares outstanding minus both restricted holdings and passive holdings. “The impact on portfolio construction, alpha and trading are not fully appreciated by investors,” Fogertey wrote. Alpha refers to outperformance over a benchmark. Earlier this month, UBS analysts wrote that worries over the impact passive investing and ETFs would have on price discovery and liquidity were “misguided.” The firm noted that while passive funds comprise 46% of total ETF and mutual fund assets, they only accounted for 8% of the overall global equity market value. “If the investment landscape were limited to ETFs and mutual funds, it may warrant the current level of attention,” they wrote. “However, the investment landscape is far more expansive than just ETFs and mutual funds. There are hedge funds, separately managed accounts, and equities managed by other institutional investors and households that should factor into the analysis.” Read more: Relax, Wall Street: ETFs aren’t the root of all evil Related: Don’t blame ETFs or passive investors for high valuations Nonetheless, the impact of this factor depends on the specific security, as “passive ownership varies in both size and scope even within sectors.” Roughly 30% of the float of energy firm ONEOK

The IPO, initially filed earlier this month, is expected to price between $14 and $16 a share. Including options granted to underwriters to buy additional shares, the IPO could raise up to $575 million. The company had revenue of $318.4 million in 2016, up 20% from 2015, although profits fell more than 50% to $31.4 million from $73.5 million. The company said it planned to use the proceeds from the IPO to buy out investors in Switch Ltd. and take control of that company though Switch Inc., which was just incorporated in 2017.

Jeffry Bartash,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 25, 2017 1:00 p.m. ET Economists see small Trump boost, still-low inflation, NABE says By The U.S. economy these days is like an old and reliable car. It’s not going to set any speed records but it’s also not going to break down and leave people stranded. That sums up the latest quarterly outlook by the nation’s most prominent business economists. They predict the U.S. will only grow a touch faster in 2018 — around 2.4% compared to an estimated 2.2% this year. Part of the fuel for faster growth in 2018 are expected tax reductions and spending increases by the Trump White House, according to the National Association of Business Economists. Yet economists also believe there’s just a one-in-four chance of a recession in the next two years, “A large majority of the panel views a near-term recession as highly unlikely,” said Kevin Swift, vice president elect of the NABE. The largely worry-free view of the economy stems from it’s mild rate of growth. The U.S. historically has grown more than 3% a year and at times even faster, but in the absence of such high rates of growth, dangerous imbalances apparently have failed to materialize. The slower rate of growth since the end of the 2007-2009 recession — the U.S. has expanded around 2% a year — also means the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates as high as it normally does. Past recessions have often been caused in part by the central bank raising the cost of borrowing quickly or aggressively. The Fed’s benchmark short-term interest rate, known as fed funds, now ranges from 1% to 1.25%. The NABE predicts the fed funds rate will rise to 2.125% by the end of 2018, but that’s still quite low by historical standards. The more immediate threats to the economy, NABE respondents said, could come from: • A war over free trade that leads to sharp restrictions: • A big reversal in surging U.S. stock markets; • Or tight immigration rules that limit the supply of labor in a time of growing manpower shortages. Inflation is not much of a danger, the NABE said. Economist predict annual prices increases will top out at no more than 1.9% in 2018, using the Fed’s preferred PCE inflation gauge. Also Read: Watch this inflation number to see where interest rates go next The now familiar constraints on the economy’s pace of growth are unlikely to ease much, the NABE said. Worker pay, business investment and productivity should all rise in 2018, but not at a rate strong enough to push U.S. growth above 3%. A lift could come from White House plans to cut taxes and improve public works . But economists are skeptical it will add a big boost — no more than 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points. The last time the U.S. grew at least 3% was in 2005. The current 12-year stretch of sub-3% growth is the longest on record. The flip side is, a recovery now nine years old could end up becoming the longest on record if the economy avoids a downturn in the next two years. The current expansion will turn 99 months old at the end of September. The record is 120 months from 1991 to 2001. ",U.S. economy likely to speed up in 2018 but not shatter any records - MarketWatch
Claudia Assis,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 28, 2017 7:27 a.m. ET Analysts take a deep dive in Tesla’s cash burn By Investors have given Tesla Inc. a vote of confidence despite the Silicon Valley’s car maker billion-dollar cash burn, but a botched Model 3 roll-out could trigger a “moment of panic” in the market, leading to a possible share-price plunge and drying-up of liquidity. That’s from analysts at Bernstein, who took a deep dive into Tesla’s cash burn, which they estimate will have reached a cumulative $10.6 billion by the end of the year. “Bears argue that this level of capital spending is unprecedented and that Tesla will inevitably run out of cash. Meanwhile, bulls argue that Tesla’s spending is par for course among high-growth companies,” the Bernstein analysts said.

Read more: Tesla car population will explode within a few years, Morgan Stanley says They kept the equivalent of a neutral rating on Tesla, with a target price of $265, which would represent a downside around 23% from Wednesday prices. For Tesla, it will all come down to how well the company rolls out the Model 3, the electric sedan the company unveiled in late July. Model 3 deliveries are expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter. Tesla’s $60 billion valuation can be interpreted as a “vote of confidence from the market,” as long as Tesla’s near-team growth stays intact and investors believe profits will follow, the Bernstein analysts said. Investors “will continue to supply liquidity and overlook Tesla’s cash burn, just as they historically did” with Wal-Mart and Home Depot, they said. Related: Tesla will be a money-losing business until 2020, analyst says “However, even if we can disregard Tesla’s cash burn, we continue to worry about the company’s ability to deliver upon its long-term vision of profitability. Specifically, we worry about whether Tesla can successfully build the mass-market Model 3,” the analysts said. That means launching the sedan with good gross margins, good quality, and on time, with gross margins a key element as they set the baseline for Tesla’s future profitability, they said.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc is testing a service to stock groceries directly to customers’ refrigerators as it seeks to take on e-commerce giant Amazon.com. The delivery of groceries and meal kits is emerging as the next frontier of competition among retailers. The world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer said on Friday it is partnering with August Home, a provider of smart locks and  home accessories, to test the service with certain customers in the Silicon Valley. (bit.ly/2ffqqvT) The grocery business is set to be upended through Amazon’s acquisition of upmarket grocer Whole Foods last month and the online retailer is also entrenching itself more deeply in the restaurants business. Amazon Restaurants on Friday teamed up with online food ordering company Olo whose network of restaurants includes Applebee’s and Chipotle. The partnership will help Olo’s restaurant customers connect with Amazon’s delivery services. The competition in the meal-kits business is also heating up. Supermarket operator Albertsons Cos Inc said it would buy meal-kit delivery service Plated while rival Kroger-owned Ralphs started selling meal kits in stores this week. ONE-TIME PASSCODE DELIVERY As part of the test, Wal-Mart delivery persons gain access to a customer’s house using a pre-authorized one-time passcode and put away groceries in the fridge and other items in the foyer. Homeowners would receive notifications when the delivery is in progress and could also watch the real-time process from their home security cameras through the August Home app. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has been exploring new methods of delivery and in June said it was testing using its own store employees to deliver packages ordered online.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Maria has devastated the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, another blow to its already precarious economic situation. Puerto Rico’s government owes $72 billion to bondholders, and an additional $50 billion in pension obligations to teachers and almost all other government employees. In May, it filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. The following are responses from multinational companies on how they are dealing with the aftermath of Maria: WAL-MART STORES INC Phillip Keene, Wal-Mart’s director of corporate communications, said, “Like many businesses, we are working to assess any damage to our facilities as we are safely able to access them and working to connect with our associates to assess what their needs are so we can support as appropriate. We are planning to open facilities very thoughtfully, starting with limited hours at our Sam’s Club near San Juan, perhaps as soon as Sunday. One of our Amigo stores has already reopened under limited hours on the south side of San Juan as of this morning. “Walmart operates 48 retail facilities, a distribution center and a satellite headquarters in Puerto Rico, supported by more than 14,700 associates across the Island. At this time, we are trying to best understand the impacts of Hurricane Maria to Puerto Rico, but it’s been a slow process due to widespread power outages and communication issues. We have activated the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the Walmart Home Office in Bentonville, Arkansas, to support our associates in Puerto Rico. The EOC is Walmart’s centralized platform for crisis coordination. In the EOC, we work directly with logistics, store operations and other teams within the business to ensure we’re aligned on our support plans. “We have been in contact with leaders on the Island and continue to be in regular contact with FEMA and the American Red Cross. Our first priority is, and continues to be, the safety of our associates - taking care of them and their families. We are working rapidly to account for our associates, through store and HR leadership as well as social media, local radio and other channels. These efforts will continue. “Although our normal assessment process has been impeded a bit by road conditions and flooding, we are currently working to identify the status of our facilities on the Island. Our Merchandising, Replenishment, Supply Chain and Logistics teams are working to ensure we have critical supplies and product headed to the island via shipping vessels that are slated to depart as soon as Friday (Sept. 22). This is in addition to the shipment of water that was sent toward the island earlier this week, which is currently staged at sea awaiting clearance to safely enter port. We will continue to assess the right flow and mix of merchandise and supplies to send to Puerto Rico in the coming days and weeks.” Tammy Hull, communications manager at Eli Lilly, said: “Lilly has two manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico as well as an affiliate office and sales team. Safety of our employees is our primary concern. The small team of employees who stayed onsite during the storm are safe. We are still accounting for all employees, which is a slow process due to power and communications loss on the island. We are currently assessing our facilities to determine if any damage occurred. Lilly follows emergency procedures that enable us to maintain adequate inventory at our manufacturing sites around the world to ensure a reliable supply of medicine for patients.” Kristen Davis, senior manager of corporate communications at Amgen, said: “Our first priority is the safety of our colleagues and their families. The vast majority of staff at our Amgen Manufacturing Limited (AML) site in Juncos were sent home prior to Maria making landfall, with only a limited number of colleagues remaining on site to monitor operations. At the moment, we are still working to determine the safety of our people and are hopeful that all will be well. At the same time, we are executing on a comprehensive and well-rehearsed business continuity plan for the site itself. Based on what we know at the moment, we are confident there will be no product supply disruptions for patients around the world. Of course, we will work diligently to ensure drug supply for patients in Puerto Rico and to return our operations in Puerto Rico to normal as quickly as possible.” Michele Meixell, head of external communications and affairs at AstraZeneca, said: “Given the early nature of the disaster, we are still in the process of gathering more information, but I can tell you what we know so far. Our Puerto Rico employee base consists of approximately 250 colleagues. This represents both field-based employees as well as those working in our manufacturing facility located in Canovanas. “Right now our number one priority remains the safety and health of our employees and their families. At this point, it’s still early to understand the full impact to our site, but we have started the process to assess our facility. The site does have backup power capabilities and we have a storm crew in limited operation right now until employees are able to safely return to work. In advance of the storm, the facility took appropriate precautions and we have business continuity plans in place to ensure our medicines continue in production. “We do not anticipate interruption in supply at this time. I also want to point out that while our Puerto Rico site is of critical importance to our organization, we have manufacturing facilities all over the globe producing medicines, so in terms of overall business impact, this is important to clarify. “Regarding the safety of our employees, all non-essential employees had been sent home prior to the storm earlier this week. This is a critical time for our employees to be safe and with their families and we will stay in touch with them in various ways that work best for them in this time of need. We stand behind those impacted by Hurricane Maria and AstraZeneca is committed to helping the people and employees affected by all of these recent natural disasters. We will continue to assess the needs of both our employees and those impacted by the storm and once we have more clarity on their needs, provide support and aid however we can.” Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion said, “We’re continuing to assess the situation in Puerto Rico.” ","

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"More than a third of migrant fishermen in Thailand clearly were victims of trafficking over the past five years, and even more workers in the industry were possibly trafficked as well, according to a report published Thursday. Routinely underpaid and physically abused, three-quarters of migrants working on Thai fishing vessels have been in debt bondage, working to pay off an obligation, said the study by the anti-trafficking group International Justice Mission (IJM). Thailand's multibillion-dollar seafood sector came under fire in recent years after investigations showed widespread slavery, trafficking and violence on fishing boats and in onshore food-processing factories. The politically unstable country, which is under military rule, has vowed to crack down on trafficking and recently introduced reforms to its fisheries law.

(AMZN) may be the king of e-commerce, but when it comes to the best prices and the speediest shipping, it's Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) that takes the crown. That’s according to BMO Capital Markets, which did a deep dive into pricing and shipping costs at Amazon, Costco and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and found that in the 16 categories analyst Kelly Bania and her team studied, the warehouse retailer had prices 7% lower than on Amazon's website. Shipping took an average of 4.5 days per each item compared to 5.5 at Amazon. Wal-Mart and its Jet.com owned e-commerce website had prices that were 18% higher than Amazon's and took a lot longer to ship with the average being 9.8 days. When taking into account Amazon’s Prime membership program that offers discounts and free two-day shipping, BMO Capital Markets found Amazon prices were 4% lower than Wal-Mart when shipping wasn’t included and 10% cheaper when all of the fees were factored in, reported Barron’s, which covered the research report. (See also: Why Amazon Is Losing to JD.com and Wal-Mart.) “With Costco generally beating Amazon in both price and shipping, it’s a reminder that Amazon has strong competition for all those musing about antitrust concerns, especially ones with a strong membership program like Costco's. And with Walmart investing heavily in eCommerce, we think it remains a vital competitor to watch, especially on price,” wrote Bania. “With that said, Amazon offers a wider set of SKUs​ than Costco does, and Prime has other benefits (video, music, etc.) that create differentiation.” The analyst reiterated her outperform rating on Amazon and her $1,200 price target. The analyst rates Wal-Mart and Costco at market perform with price targets of $80 and $170, respectively. “Despite Costco's price gap to Amazon we believe near-term sentiment and fear of the long-term impact of Amazon on Costco's business (whether or not justified by near-term fundamentals) could continue to create an overhang on COST shares and limit valuation upside,” she wrote in the research note.

Marguerite Ward,09282017,CNBC,09212017,"The approaching holiday season means more shopping, and as a result, more jobs in retail. For some retail employees, it will also mean higher wages. Target announced today that it would raise its minimum wage above $10 beginning in October, eventually reaching $11 per hour for all U.S. stores. The retailer has already promised to add 100,000 jobs in the coming months and has committed to raising minimum wage to $15 by 2020. Though many of these jobs may be temporary, they provide experience as well as a source of income, and knowing how major stores compare in terms of hourly pay could help you if you're in the market for a job. Using  Fortune's list of the 20 retailers with the greatest number of employees in the U.S., CNBC Make It looked at average hourly wages for the position of ""sales associate"" —  a common consumer-facing, non-managerial role — at each company. Wages were determined using data submitted by employees to jobs and salary platform Glassdoor. Each company on the list was also contacted to provide information or comment. Here's how the country's 20 biggest retail employers rank in terms of pay: Average hourly wage for sales associates: $7.87Number of employees: 121,000 Average hourly wage for sales associates:  $8.17 to  $8.26Number of employees: 116,050 After five months, some Dollar Tree employees can earn $9 per hour, The Wall Street Journal reports. Average hourly wage for sales associates:  $8.54Number of employees: 140,000 Average hourly wage for sales associates: $8.57 Number of employees: 78,600 Business Insider reports that Ross Stores leadership announced in 2015 it would raise starting wages to $9. Average hourly wage for sales associates:  $8.71Number of employees: 85,000 Average hourly wage for sales associates: $8.75, as determined by averaging Glassdoor data for TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods. (Too few Glassdoor salary reports were available to determine wages for Sierra Trading Post.)Number of employees: 235,000 A company representative tells CNBC Make It that all sales associates now make a starting wage of at least $9 per hour, and at least $10 per hour after six months.

There are many who argue that big retailers could afford to increase wages. Some retail employees say they struggle to make ends meet and many have joined the ""Fight for 15"" protests, which call for a minimum wage of $15 per hour and have gained traction in many major cities. Jiyoung Hwang, assistant professor of marketing at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro's Bryan School of Business and Economics, says there are a few factors at play. Chief among them are the minimum wage in each state, which she says retailers often use a benchmark, the level of skill each employee has and the company's emphasis on corporate social responsibility (CSR.) ""Costco is well-known for its CSR while Wal-Mart is quite lower in that reputation,"" Hwang says. Pressure to offer customers low prices, long operating hours and the importance of competing with other retailers also play a big role, she adds. In addition, company sales, the cost of living in an area and a worker's responsibilities contribute to wage decisions, according to Ana Serafin Smith, senior director of media relations at the National Retail Federation (NRF). Still, Smith says that those who earn minimum wage from major retailers may not have to do so for long. ""A majority of those hired in an entry-level position,"" Smith says, citing NRF research, ""reported earning a promotion within a year of employment.""

"Paul Sonn, general counsel, National Employment Law Project",09282017,CNBC,09212017,"With the holiday season approaching, this week Target became the first low-wage chain to announce it will raise pay to $15 an hour. Chief executive Brian Cornell said the decision to raise wages to $15 by 2020 will help Target attract and retain talent as the hyper-competitive retail sector enters its busiest quarter. It also shows the growing impact of the Fight for $15–and puts pressure on other major players like Amazon, Walmart and McDonalds to follow suit. Since striking fast-food workers launched the Fight for $15 in 2012, states and cities comprising more than 18 percent of the U.S. workforce—including Target's home city of Minneapolis—have approved $15 minimum wages. And scores of companies have raised pay to $15, including insurance giants Aetna and Allstate, major hospital chains across the country, and tech leader Facebook for its contracted bus drivers, janitors and security guards. But Target's role as an industry leader in retail—which together with restaurants employs the largest share of workers paid less than $15–illustrates what business strategists have long argued: historically low-paying sectors can make the shift to significantly higher pay. MIT business professor Zeynep Ton has shown how industry leaders like Costco and Trader Joe's provide a roadmap for how investing in retail workers with good wages and benefits goes hand-in-hand with strong growth and productivity. Target's move blows up the claims of corporate lobbyists who argue it's simply not possible for industries like retail and restaurants to pay a $15 minimum wage. In fact,  growing numbers of business owners and economists confirm that a phased-in $15 minimum wage is realistic for employers and will help boost the consumer spending that ultimately drives job growth. But ultimately the imperative to pay a living wage is about our nation's values. As La Colombe CEO Todd Carmichael  argued last week, ""unless you pay your employees a nonpredatory living wage that keeps people and their families above the poverty line, you don't deserve to be in business."" Part of what's driving employers like Target to pay $15 an hour is the simple fact that,  everywhere in America—not just on the coasts-- a single worker will soon need to earn at least that much just to afford the basics. And workers on the coasts or supporting kids will need even more. Yet more than 43 percent of America's workers struggle on less than $15 an hour. Far from teenagers, the median age of the millions of  workers earning less than $15 an hour in the U.S. is 32. They include hospital workers and preschool teachers, auto-parts workers and waitresses. In other words, many of the front line jobs in which U.S. workers today spend their careers pay less than $15 an hour. And we all end up subsidizing those low wages. Low pay by corporations like McDonald's and Walmart cost taxpayers  a whopping $153 billion a year in public assistance to working families, according to a recent study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. A key issue when employers like Target raise pay is what happens to the growing numbers of employees who don't work for them directly but instead through staffing agencies or service contractors. In the Twin Cities, Target has already been a leader in tackling this issue,  agreeing last year to support the efforts of its contracted janitors to unionize and raise their pay substantially. Ensuring that more employers raise standards for contracted and direct employees alike is essential  in our increasingly ""fissured"" workplaces. Low pay is hurting America's working families and holding back our economy, which depends on a thriving consumer class to drive growth. Target's plan to raise pay to $15 an hour over the next 30 months is smart business strategy, and what our nation's workforce and economy need. There's now a bullseye on the back of employers like Amazon, Walmart and McDonalds. They should follow Target's lead. ",Target's $15 an hour move 'blows up' minimum wage myths-commentary

The Wharton School's Jeremy Siegel believes it'll have a lot to do with President Donald Trump's intention to get business-friendly reforms passed on Capitol Hill — not the latest Federal Reserve decision on interest rates or better-than-expected economic growth figures. ""I would say corporate tax reform could add another 10 percent to the market even this year,"" Siegel said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" A deal ""looks very likely to get done."" It's the second time in less than 12 months that Siegel, a longtime bull, has made a bold market call. And it came on a day when the Dow and S&P 500 closed at record highs. In the final weeks of 2016, Siegel argued that the blue chip stock index was very close to hitting the 20,000 milestone. It broke through that key psychological level on Jan. 25 and since then has soared more than 10 percent. If Siegel is right this time, too, a 10 percent jump would put the Dow around 24,650 and the S&P 500 at 2,760 based on Wednesday's closes. ""There's new hope that taxes really have a chance to be done. I remained steadfast throughout some of the bleak days in the last few months when no one thought anything could be done,"" Siegel added. ""There's a little bit more optimism now. I think a corporate tax deal will be done, and I think that will be positive for the equity market,"" he said. Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.

Beyond the magazine, Hefner had an eclectic career that included a chain of Playboy nightclubs across the United States and abroad, a television show called ""Playboy After Dark"" and countless cameos in feature films and television. The following are some of the photos that captured the life and times of the quintessential bachelor who lived in the ultimate bachelor pad known as the Playboy Mansion.

Over the past year, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has been stocking up on online retail outlets. It closed its acquisition of Jet.com about a year ago, and it's since bought four other small online retailers. Wal-Mart's efforts have resulted in huge online sales growth, but its acquisition strategy may be somewhat flawed. Wal-Mart has put the former CEO of Jet.com, Marc Lore, in charge of its online operations in the United States. He recently spoke at a conference, and when asked what Wal-Mart does better than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), he said Wal-Mart's unique assets separate it from the competition. Image source: Wal-Mart Lore pointed specifically to the ""4,600"" stores Wal-Mart operates in the United States as a unique advantage over Amazon. Lore may have been using an old store count, because Wal-Mart says it has 4,741 stores in the U.S. That number is somehow getting larger every year. Roughly 90% of the U.S. population is within 10 miles of a Walmart store. That means Wal-Mart has a big advantage in in-store pickup and online grocery ordering, and has the infrastructure to succeed in shipping items to customers' homes. Indeed, Wal-Mart was able to launch free two-day shipping on its online orders over $35 earlier this year thanks in part to its network of stores. ""We can do 2-hour delivery cheaper than anybody else because of the assets we have,"" Lore said. After purchasing Whole Foods Market, Amazon's physical storefronts still only amount to about 10% of Wal-Mart's. Even with its  network of fulfillment centers, just 44% of the population lived within 20 miles of Amazon's network as of a year ago. Those fulfillment centers naturally have a lot of overlap with Whole Foods locations as they both target high-population areas. Wal-Mart is the nation's largest private employer with 1.5 million employees in the U.S. Lore cites this as an asset, although the larger overhead has been more of a drag for Wal-Mart. Amazon generates twice as much revenue per employee compared to Wal-Mart. Lore has been creative in finding ways to make employees more efficient as Wal-Mart boosts online sales. Not only does the large number of employees allow Wal-Mart to quickly ramp up services like fulfilling online grocery orders in its stores, Lore tested using employees to deliver online orders the last mile to customers' doorsteps. Physical retail necessitates more employees compared to online-only operations like Amazon. Workers need to stock shelves, assist customers in stores, and work the checkout lines. Investors should expect Amazon's revenue-per-employee number to fall after incorporating Whole Foods' numbers into the mix. But those extra employees offer an opportunity to expand a retailer's capabilities. Wal-Mart's biggest success, so far, has been online grocery ordering and pickup. Lore will continue to search for opportunities like that. Lore wasn't afraid to admit where Amazon has Wal-Mart beat -- that's the overall shopping experience on Amazon compared to Walmart. He said it's easier to find the product you want on Amazon, the competitor often has a greater assortment of goods, and the delivery experience is often superior. It's simple to hire a bunch of engineers to hack away at Walmart.com's search and recommendation algorithms to find the products people really want. It's a lot tougher for Wal-Mart to convince certain brands to sell their goods at its stores. Wal-Mart's reputation for low quality keeps it from attracting more high-end brands. That's part of the idea of buying up smaller online outlets like Bonobos and ShoeBuy. It's also made an effort to attract more third-party merchants to its online marketplace. A quality shopping experience is the biggest hurdle for Wal-Mart to really take on Amazon. And as Amazon moves into brick-and-mortar retail, Wal-Mart may start to feel a bit more pressure to get it right. ","
      
    Wal-Mart's Biggest Advantage Over Amazon -- The Motley Fool

To be a successful long-term investor, you need to make sure your portfolio won't implode on the first sign of a rainy day. What seems like a great idea during the best of times will only reveal its true nature during the worst of times. Sticking with companies that can perform well regardless of economic conditions is an effective way to harden your portfolio. Here's why three of our Foolish investors think Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are some of the best rainy-day stocks. Image source: Getty Images. Danny Vena (Wal-Mart): Investors planning for a rainy day should fortify their portfolio with companies that can perform well during periods of economic instability, which is when consumers tend to spend carefully, forgoing their usual shopping habits and opting for lower prices. During the depths of the Great Recession, many shoppers turned to Wal-Mart's ""Always low prices"" to help make ends meet. As the largest retailer in the world, Wal-Mart has unmatched economies of scale. For its fiscal year ended January 2017, it produced revenue of $485.9 billion and operating income of $22.8 billion. Its operating cash flow totaled $31.5 billion, and it returned $8.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchases. Wal-Mart is also a Dividend Aristocrat, having paid a dividend every year since 1974 and boasting 44 years of consecutive increases. It has a dividend that currently yields 2.5% and a healthy payout ratio of 48%, leaving room for future increases. While the company was initially slow to embrace e-commerce, it corrected that last year with its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, as well as a number of other smaller specialty clothiers. As a result, in its most recent quarter the company posted impressive increases in e-commerce sales, which grew 60% over the prior-year quarter, with gross merchandise volume increasing 67% year over year. If you're looking for a stock for a rainy day, consider this: During the bear market that began Oct. 9, 2007, and ended March 9, 2009, while the broader S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) fell 56%, Wal-Mart stock gained 10%. Data by YCharts. Keith Speights (Facebook): What do people do on a rainy day? They stay inside. While inside, there's a pretty good chance that they'll look at social media. And the undisputed king of social media is Facebook. I suspect that the executives at Facebook like it when people stay inside on rainy days, because it increases the amount of time they spend catching up on friends' posts -- and looking at ads. Ads generate 98% of Facebook's revenue. And that revenue is growing, with the company reporting a 47% year-over-year jump in advertising revenue in the second quarter of 2017. This growth stems from two factors. First, Facebook charged 24% more per ad in the last quarter. It can get away with that kind of price boost because it reaches more than 2 billion monthly active users. Second, the company is also increasing the number of ads displayed. More volume at higher prices is a surefire way to make more money. But can buying Facebook stock make you plenty of money? I think so. Wall Street projects that Facebook will achieve average annual earnings growth over the next five years of nearly 27%. That's a drop from the heady growth of past years, but it's still an impressive level. That growth makes Facebook's valuation look pretty reasonable as well. Facebook isn't just a leader in social media. It's also a leader in artificial intelligence and augmented reality, two of the hottest trends in technology today. Buying Facebook stock is a way of investing in these two trends. That's a pretty smart way, in my view, to use time on a rainy day so that your financial future isn't stormy. Tim Green (Microsoft): Software giant Microsoft has changed quite a bit over the past few years. It's embraced cloud computing, building its Azure cloud platform into a strong No. 2 player. It's dropped its Windows-centric position, building first-class apps for Android and iOS. And it's building an increasing amount of hardware, from its Surface tablets and laptop to its HoloLens augmented reality headset. But what hasn't changed about Microsoft is its dominant position in the productivity software market. Businesses depend on Office, Outlook, and other Microsoft products, and that's likely to remain true regardless of the state of the economy. Office is still the company's cash cow, despite serious competition from Alphabet's Google. While Microsoft is heavily investing in growth businesses like cloud computing, the company is still producing impressive profits. During fiscal 2017, Microsoft generated $21.2 billion of net income on $90.0 billion of revenue. Meanwhile, Azure revenue is doubling year over year, and Office 365 commercial, the subscription version of Office, is growing by more than 40% annually. Microsoft is in an enviable position, with dominant businesses like Office throwing off cash, allowing the company to invest in newer businesses that will act as its growth engine for years to come. Through the good times and the bad, Microsoft should continue to produce exceptional results. ","

Target (NYSE:TGT) made news earlier this week by making public plans to increase its minimum hourly wage for all employees to $11 in October. The chain also pledged to increase wages to a $15-per-hour minimum by 2020. The company said in a press release that a ""significant investment in its team will allow Target to continue to recruit and retain strong team members."" It comes at a time when unemployment sits near historic lows and the idea of a $15-an-hour minimum wage has become a huge topic of national debate. Target's move follows its previous wage hike to a $10 an hour minimum in 2016. It also follows efforts from its chief rival, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), to raise wages. In February 2016 the company pledged to pay any employees hired before Jan. 1, 2016 at $10 an hour and that any workers hired after that would receive at least $9 an hour, with their rate increasing to at least $10 upon completion of a training program. Target has increased the minimum hourly wage for its employees. Image source: Target. Only two states -- Massachusetts and Washington -- have $11-an-hour minimum wages. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia, however, have a minimum wage that exceeds the federal standard of $7.25. In his remarks in the press release Target's CEO Brian Cornell framed the move as being about making life better for his chain's workers. Target has always offered market competitive wages to our team members. With this latest commitment, we'll be providing even more meaningful pay, as well as the tools, training and support our team needs to build their skills, develop professionally and offer the service and expertise that set Target apart. That's, of course, a piece of it, but the reality is that changing market conditions dictate the increase. With unemployment standing at 4.4% in August, near historic lows, the reality is Target needs to pay more to attract workers. An employee who makes $11 an hour for a 40-hour week would earn $22,800 a year. That's less than the average annual wages for cashiers ($27,701) and warehouse associates ($40,784), according to GlassDoor's most-recent Local Pay Reports. Of course, those reports offer the average of all workers in those positions, not the minimum hourly starting wage. Target's starting pay will also be less than the $14.21 an hour the average Costco cashier makes and less than the $12.42 an Amazon fulfillment associate earns per hour, according to GlassDoor salary reviews. That data is based on 158 Costco employees reporting their earnings to the jobs data website and 683 Amazon warehouse workers doing the same. The new rate, however, is very competitive in other areas of the market. Starting workers at $11 an hour does put Target well ahead of the $8.41 to $8.61 an hour the average McDonald's crew member or cashier makes. Target's starting salary will also be more than the average Starbucks barista makes ($9.55 to $9.57), and more than Sears ($8.37 to $8.54) and J.C. Penney ($9.04 to $9.07) associates and cashiers, according to what was reported to GlassDoor. In the retail world, especially when it comes to entry-level positions, small differences in salary can be the difference between someone taking a job or electing to go elsewhere. Competitive pay can also help a company retain employees, lowering its long-term training costs while also improving customer service. Heading into a time when it and many of its rivals are hiring for the holidays, Target has given itself a leg up on the competition. By paying more than the competition, the retailer should have an easier time hiring and holding onto the employees it needs. That should improve the in-store experience for customers and help the company meet its Q4 goals. The company's long-range wage increases will help it build an ongoing foundation of well-trained, experienced employees. ","

In the 1980s and even the 1990s, Toys R Us was a place children begged their parents to take them. The chain had a selection of toys that dwarfed what was sold at now-defunct department store chains like Ames, Caldor, and Bradlees. Even its Sunday newspaper inserts were an event, and its holiday season ""toy book"" was much perused by children in order to pick out what gifts they planned to ask for. Toys R Us' slow path to bankruptcy, which it filed on Sept. 18, did not begin with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). It started with chains like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) creating toy departments that not only pushed prices (and margins) lower, but also made it so a visit to Toys R Us was no longer unique. Wal-Mart and Target made Toys R Us less of a destination and gave parents a way to placate their kids while also doing their own shopping. Toys R Us has filed for bankruptcy. Image source: Getty Images. For two years, I ran the largest toy and hobby store in New England. We had a Toys R Us, a Target, and a Wal-Mart within a couple of miles of us. We were also in a relatively remote location while our toy-selling rivals were closer to the highway and near a major mall. Despite those deficits and the fact that we were generally more expensive than the chains we competed with, we thrived. The mistake Toys R Us has made is that it has done very little to differentiate itself from its department store rivals. My former toy store, which is doing well to this day, did much more than sell toys, hobby items, model trains, and more. It actively gave customers a reason to visit. We hosted gaming events, tournaments, and learn-to-play classes for everything from the easiest children's games to the most complicated collectible offerings. We also had multiple huge model train sets that were shown off for free twice a month, and every Sunday during the holiday season. Those trains were maintained and built by clubs that met in the store. During weekdays, we had story time for children, and on holidays, we barbecued, made cotton candy, or handed out special treats to our customers. Even when nothing was happening, we had play areas for little kids, model-building areas for all ages, and a near-endless supply of curios we picked up in theory to sell, but just as much to give customers something to look at. We also had a customer-first attitude where we welcomed everyone warmly, treated regulars like family, and accepted that sometimes we were going to teach a customer about a product only for them to buy it cheaper on Amazon. Our store also had merchandise that wouldn't be found at a Toys R Us or a department store, as well as staff that was passionate about what they sold. Toys R Us had the tools and the space to be all of those things, but either arrogance or complacency stopped it from evolving. Once simply having toys stopped making it a destination for kids and toy lovers, the chain needed to do more. CEO David Brandon acknowledged that in the bankruptcy filing, explaining how the company would change its stores. ""Once these initiatives are implemented, Toys R Us stores will be interactive spaces with rooms to use for parties, live product demonstrations put on by trained employees, and the freedom for employees to remove product from boxes to let kids play with the latest toys,"" he said. That's the model that would have worked all along. It's a game Target and Wal-Mart are unlikely to play, and one that Amazon, for obvious reasons, can't. Bankruptcy may clear some debt and let the company shed some leases, but it needs to change in order to avoid slowly falling right back into the same hole. Toys R Us has to go from being a place that sells toys and games to one that's full of activities, experiences, and discoveries for kids and adults alike. The chain needs to transform from store to destination -- if it does that, then sales will follow. ","

It wasn't so long ago that investors couldn't buy enough of Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR): Between 2013 and 2015, the stock rose an astonishing 217%. Yet since January 2016, Kroger's shares have lost 50% of their value. Over the last 18 months, Kroger's comparable quarterly sales, excluding fuel sales, have shifted from healthy growth in the mid-single digits to a complete standstill. In the final quarter of 2016, the company saw its 13-year streak of comparable sales growth snap, as comps declined for the first time in 53 quarters. Kroger is cuing up a comps revival, but for now, progress is wan. Management projects just a slight expansion in this metric of 0.5% to 1% for the second half of the current fiscal year. The culprit, of course, is fierce competition among grocers for customers. And it will only intensify: 2018 promises to ring in a battle royale within the grocery industry. Whole Foods Market will present a distinct online retailing challenge once new owner Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) integrates the organic chain's loyalty program with its Amazon Prime service. As for brick-and-mortar developments, privately held German discount grocers Aldi and Lidl will open 500 new stores in the U.S. between them by the end of 2018 alone, as Aldi seeks to expand and Lidl builds on its 2017 entry on the east coast. In a pre-emptive response to the European invasion, Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) -- never an easy grocer to undercut -- is already allowing its gross margin to slip in 2017 in order to ""invest in price."" These pitched battles, both online and in midsized and major metropolitan areas, are occurring just as shopping habits undergo significant change. The Food Marketing Institute has been tracking grocery industry trends for decades. Last year, its ""U.S. Grocery Shopper Report"" confirmed what many of us have experienced personally: Shoppers are splitting their grocery buys over a number of different store types and channels. In fact, the report showed that in each of the preceding three years, a ""significant"" number of shoppers (between 7% and 9%) no longer claimed loyalty to a primary grocery store. That's a problem for Kroger, which operates as a conventional grocer in an increasingly specialized world. It's not a premium grocer like Whole Foods, nor a deep-discounter like Aldi or Lidl. The company instead has existed as a traditional supermarket which uses high customer engagement and sheer proximity to customers (with approximately 2,800 stores spread across 35 states) to drive traffic. Image source: Getty Images. To keep comps from treading water, which won't be kind to its stock price, Kroger has a complex task ahead. The company will have to stay focused, avoid overreaching for desperate solutions, and double down on its very formidable core strengths. Read through a recent earnings call transcript, or browse the company's quarterly earnings reports, and you'll be reminded of the slate of advantages that propelled Kroger, not many quarters ago, to brisk comps growth. I'll summarize them briefly as follows: Think of the advantages above as a sort of body armor Kroger constructed over the last few years as competitors refined their individual niches and prepared to attack on price and differentiation. Now's the time to wear that armor in the battle to protect market share and build comps. This month, CEO Rodney McMullen said emphatically in an earnings conference call that the grocer is ""not going to lose on price."" Cutting prices is simple, but retaining customers on price alone is not. A more sustainable strategy is to shift more resources away from price investment, and toward the manufacturing, brand, and technology investments which boost inherent advantages. To stabilize in this environment and grow again, Kroger needs to push its Simple Truth line. It should expand private-label brands that contribute to higher profits. It should continue to embrace online shopping, and dial up the use of analytics to retain customers and incentivize shopping frequency. In reaffirming its strengths, Kroger will reaffirm its identity to its customers.

The fourth quarter has become a sort of retail free-for-all where stores try increasingly desperate tactics to lure in customers. From opening on Thanksgiving Day to heavy discounts and aggressive promotions, retailers pull out all the stops. That makes sense because the importance of the period seems to grow each year. In 2017, early predictions from Deloitte show that total holiday sales, excluding automobiles and gasoline, will reach $1.04 trillion to $1.05 trillion between November and January, up from $1 trillion last year. And while the digital portion of overall sales has grown, e-commerce sales will only account for $111 billion to $114 billion of that total -- an 18%-21% increase over $93.8 billion in 2016. Servicing all of those sales requires workers. In Q4, really toward the end of Q3 in September, many retail and retail-adjacent companies have traditionally hired a lot of people. This list will expand as the season gets closer, but there are a lot of jobs out there in a market that's already near historically high employment rates. Unlike last year, these jobs may not be easy to fill, a fact that has already caused Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) to decide against hiring temporary workers. Instead, the retailer will fill its need by offering overtime to existing employees. Some of the companies on this list may end up following Wal-Mart's lead if they can't find enough qualified applicants, but for now, here's the list of companies that are hiring and how many people they need. Retailers will be hiring tens of thousands of workers for the holiday season. Image source: Target. Even though Wal-Mart has elected to sit out the hiring season, most of its rivals have different plans. There will literally be hundreds of thousands of openings in everything from front-end, consumer-facing positions, to backroom warehouse jobs, and digital fulfillment positions: These are not the only retailers with holiday hiring plans, just the ones that have come forward so far. Kohl's, Nordstrom, and many other chains are planning to add workers. In many ways, it's a job-seeker's market, with applicants being able to weigh things like pay and benefits against the possibility of becoming a permanent hire when deciding where to apply. The rise of digital sales has put tremendous pressure on the companies that deliver online orders. The United States Postal Service (USPS) has posted job listings in a number of markets looking for both seasonal and permanent workers. The number of openings varies based on the market, but the overall job count seems significant. Not to be outdone by the government, both United Parcel Service and FedEx plan to hire. UPS plans to add about 95,000 seasonal workers, while its rival hopes to hire 50,000 while also offering more overtime for existing employees. In many cases seasonal jobs go to college kids, people working a second gig, or those not looking to enter the workforce full-time. For those seeking permanent employment, however, a seasonal job can be a way to get your foot in the door at a company you want to work at. Every company on this list has both full and seasonal openings, but if your goal is a permanent job, it may be best to take seasonal work at a thriving company. Amazon, for example, is likely to keep more temporary workers than Toys R Us or Macy's simply given the trajectory of their businesses. Still, a chain like Target may be facing challenges, but it's doing well enough that exceptional seasonal workers can probably find a full-time, permanent job after the holiday season. ","

Like solar and wind power, many alternative energy advocates have touted the potential of hydrogen power for years. Investors in fuel cell companies like Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) are still waiting, however, for the inflection point that marks the company's transition to sustained profitability. Perhaps in 2017, though, that time has come. Rising 128% in 2017 as of this writing, Plug Power has delighted the market -- unlike in 2016 -- with several announcements, suggesting that the tide has turned. Thanks in part to a deal with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), fuel cell fever is working its way through Wall Street. Indicating a bullish outlook on the stock, analysts at FBR Capital and Cowen have each identified a $3 price target on the stock. Moreover, an analyst at the investment bank Rodman and Renshaw issued a $4 price target. But Wall Street's enthusiasm doesn't necessarily mean investors should start powering their portfolios with this fuel cell industry leader. Image source: Getty Images. To say that news of the company's deal with Amazon was well received would be a gross understatement. Shares soared more than 60% in April -- the month in which the announcement was made -- and the stock hasn't looked back, continuing to climb ever since. What fed the fervor? For one, Plug Power's management expects the deal to add $70 million to the company's top line in 2017. This is no small sum considering the company reported $86 million in revenue in the prior year. Besides the deal with Amazon, Plug Power pleased investors with its second-quarter earnings report. Management announced a new agreement with long-term partner Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), with an estimated the contract value to be $70 million. And speaking to its fiscal 2017 finances, it was quite optimistic, estimating negative free cash flow of $25 million to $35 million. Additionally, the company expects further progress in its pursuit of profitability, and is forecasting an expansion in its fiscal 2017 gross margin (excluding the impact of warrants issued to Amazon and Wal-Mart) to 8% to 12%; the fiscal 2016 gross margin was only 4.6%. In terms of the stock, because it's unprofitable, we can't use the traditional price-to-earnings metric to value shares, so let's consider the price-to-sales ratio. Shares are trading around 5.4 times sales, slightly higher than the stock's 5.2 average, but those who are optimistic about the company's future could certainly shrug off this seemingly high price tag. Despite the deal with Amazon and an improvement in some areas of its financials, the bear argument for Plug Power remains strong. Image source: Getty Images For one, management's forecast for its fiscal 2017 performance must be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism since it doesn't have a great track record of meeting its guidance. In 2013, it estimated Plug Power would break even on an EBITDA basis by the second or third quarter of 2014. Slightly off, the company reported an EBITDA loss of $84 million in 2014 according to Morningstar. Last year, during its Q1 2016 presentation, it announced a gross margin goal exceeding 12% for fiscal 2016. The company instead reported a gross margin of 4.6%, thereby coming up quite short. Management, furthermore, set an operating cash flow target of negative $20 million. Again missing the target, it reported negative $30 million in operating cash flow in fiscal 2016. PLUG R&D to Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Accounting for 28% of revenue in the trailing 12 months, revenue earmarked for R&D will likely remain a large obstacle on the road to profitability as the company pursues development of its ProGen prototypes for both the domestic and Chinese markets. Predicated on a future where hydrogen has supplanted traditional fuels, picking up shares of Plug Power at this point remains too risky. As one who's been enthusiastic about alternative power for years, I'd be more than happy to add Plug Power to my portfolio. Unfortunately, trust issues regarding its management team still persist, and the failure to translate top-line growth to the bottom line remains a concern. Unless the stock nosedives and reaches rock-bottom prices or the company remedies its issues, I'll be rooting for Plug Power from the sidelines. ","

In the past three years, iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) has pulled off a truly impressive feat. During that time, the maker of home robotics has increased its revenue by nearly 40% while simultaneously reducing its revenue sources. Specifically, the company eliminated $55 million in revenue and pulled out its very roots by divesting its military segment in 2016 and recently discontinued one of its four product lines in the home robotics category, a gutter cleaning line called the Looj. IRBT Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. How then, has the company been able to increase revenue at such a rapid pace? By absolutely dominating in its top product category, that's how! In 2002, iRobot essentially invented the robotic vacuum cleaning market with the launch of the first Roomba. For a decade and a half, Roomba has been the king of robotic vacuum cleaners, especially in the United States, where it holds a jaw-dropping 88% market share. However, it is no longer the only game in town. Let's take a look at the evidence and decide whether there are any companies ready to challenge iRobot's leadership in the fast-growing robotic vacuum cleaner market. It is hard to fathom that any competitor would be able to overtake iRobot in global market share in the near future. iRobot's current position compared to that of its closest rival is simply too dominant: Data source: iRobot. Chart by author. However, just because a competitor can't take the No. 1 spot doesn't mean it can't meaningfully affect iRobot's top and bottom lines, and by extension, its stock price. Let's look further at two companies that might have the potential to do just that. Image source: Ecovacs SharkNinja: SharkNinja is a newcomer to the robotic floor-cleaning market, but it is certainly no stranger to consumers. The company's Ninja Blender has been ranked the No. 1 blender three years in a row in the U.S.,and its upright vacuum cleaners have claimed the No. 1 spot in U.S. market share. Earlier this month, SharkNinja began selling the Shark ION Robot 750. While it's too early to know for sure how big of a splash SharkNinja will make in the market, it's likely the company has big plans. With iRobot's stock dropping 15% after a short-seller said the competitor's entrance to the market posed ""a credible threat,"" it's safe to say shareholders agree. Only time will tell if iRobot will be able to continue growing revenue and earnings at a rapid clip with increasing competition trying to get a bigger share of the pie. We do know that iRobot's management believes its patent portfolio is a huge part of its competitive moat. The other safeguard iRobot may have is a fast-growing market. At a recent investor conference, management stated that the immediately addressable market for robotic vacuums is two to three times the currently installed base and that 700% market growth is expected over the long term. If the market for robotic floor cleaners grows fast enough, it is possible iRobot could lose market share and still grow revenue and profits significantly. At the same time, competition is increasing as we speak. Robotic vacuum cleaners at lower price points have essentially become commoditized home appliances. Amazon's ""robotic vacuums"" product selection numbers in the hundreds, and iRobot estimates that 20% of all vacuums worldwide are robotic -- and more than 30% of those are made by its competitors. With that level of competition already existing for lower-end products, if Ecovacs or Shark Ninja can chip away at market share on the premium lines (which management defines as vacuums costing $200 or above), it's only a matter of time before iRobot's absolute dominance comes to an end.

A full transcript follows the video. Mac Greer: Let's begin with, frankly, a retailer that I have pretty much forgotten is still around -- Bed Bath & Beyond. Wow, Bed Bath & Beyond taking a bath on Wednesday. Shares down more than 14% after the company lowered its earnings outlook and reported weaker-than-expected earnings. David Kretzmann, I go to you. Is Bed Bath & Beyond beyond repair? Is there anything you can do to save this? David Kretzmann: What hurts here is, the stores aren't performing that well, but on the financial side of things, management has done more to add gasoline to that bad fire overall. If you go back to 2014, from a financial perspective, the company looked like it was in decent shape. It was producing over $1 billion in free cash flow annually, had $850 million in net cash on the balance sheet, so they had cash in the bank, they were producing a lot more cash to add to that tally. But that year, they decided to issue $1.5 billion in new debt just to buy back stock. They essentially went into more debt, bought back a lot of stock, and now a few years later the company has over $1 billion in net debt, and their free cash flow production has almost been cut in half to about $570 million. So that's a bleak direction to be going within just a few years. They've really been focusing on buying back stock, they haven't done a whole lot to improve the actual in-store experience, and what they have done has been very slow. They are making some progress with their digital sales, which now make up about 15% of total revenue. They say that their ""differentiated products,"" which they consider their exclusive products, personalizable products, makes up about half of sales, so I think that's probably an area where they really need to double down and find some way to differentiate what they're offering and how they offer it from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other retailers that are still out there. They've also made some acquisitions into new brick-and-mortar retail concepts. They bought a website, personalizationmall.com, late last year, where you can buy and personalize a lot of different items. Going that route makes the most sense to me. It's not a stock I would buy, even though it looks very cheap-looking at these trailing metrics. But I think management has made some very poor cash management decisions over the past few years, and in the meantime, the actual performance of the stores leaves a lot to be desired. Aaron Bush: Yeah, one tidbit that I keep on coming back to for Bed Bath & Beyond and for other struggling retailers is, when a brick-and-mortar store tries to add a quality e-commerce operation, not only does it tend to cause its physical stores to struggle more, but it makes the company increasingly expensive to run, because they have to duplicate the cost just to serve that same customer. So you do see them making really dumb decisions with debt, and adding new retail concepts, which feels more like a distraction than anything. But just the fundamental structure of how the economics work, and managing an in-store presence and an online presence isn't very friendly. And they've been really slow to do this. But now that they are invested in it, it's another reason that's adding a margin drag and keeping earnings lower. Greer: Do you think, in terms of those traditional retailers adding that online piece, I see why you would want to do it. Everyone's trying to fend off Amazon. You have to try anything. So you have Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) with the Jet acquisition. Do you think that's going to work for Wal-Mart? Or, to take your logic even further, if you're Wal-Mart, do you stick to your knitting, which is just bread-and-butter traditional retailers? Bush: I think for Wal-Mart and Jet, I think it was smart to acquire Jet, not for Jet itself, but more for the talent that is in that management team. And I know, I'm blanking on his name ... Marc Lore, who was the head of Jet, now runs Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations. So I think that was smart. What Wal-Mart really needs to do is continue to acquire things and really build up a big suite of an online presence. When it comes to e-commerce, aggregation is increasingly important, so you either have to dominate a niche, or you have to be someone that you can go to for anything and everything. So it's tough. Wal-Mart might be able to pull it off, Amazon is definitely pulling it off, but for someone like Bed Bath & Beyond it's a hard spot. Kretzmann: I think what Aaron mentioned highlights why it's so difficult for these brick-and-mortar retailers to pivot more to online or omnichannel sales because it tends to be more expensive to operate both rather than one or the other. But there is some value to the omnichannel experience. You see Amazon clearly showing a lot of interest in opening up their own brick-and-mortar stores, acquiring Whole Foods. So there is value there. But for a lot of these companies, I think it will be a short-term ding, but it's probably what they need to do to stay relevant and figure out some way to hopefully improve the economics over time, one way or another, whether it's offering more personalized services or some sort of consultation. We're going to talk about Best Buy today. They're trying to do something along those lines. But in the short term, the company needs to stomach those short-term dings if they want to stay relevant with competitors like Amazon. Greer: So, Bed Bath & Beyond shares a lot cheaper today than they were yesterday, but you're still not interested? Kretzmann: Based on management's track record, both managing the stores and how they've been trying to pivot those stores, I think they've been lackluster there. And they've also really jeopardized the company's financial position, because you're not going to go bankrupt if you don't have debt, and they completely pivoted the whole balance sheet a few years ago to buy back stock, which, in hindsight, looks like a very dumb move. Shares have continued dropping since then, so that was a poor investment, and a very poor reason to go into debt. So, from a financial position now, the company's future is in a lot more jeopardy now. So I would stay on the sidelines here. Greer: So, five years from now, are they still a going concern? Are they still around? Kretzmann: I think they're still around but they're probably getting pretty close to bankruptcy, at the rate they're going now. ","

                                   climbed by 0.9%. “The backdrop for gold today is as bullish as it has been in a long time,” said Mark O’Byrne, research director at GoldCore in Dublin. He expects gold prices to reach $1,400 before the end of the year. With President Donald Trump “in the White House and the political situation in the U.S. and globally more uncertain than it has been in many years, gold will almost certainly continue to see robust safe-haven demand,” he said. “This should push gold higher in the coming months.” Recent military tensions between North Korea and the U.S. and its allies has helped to underpin gold’s haven status as a hedge against a sudden escalation in geopolitical tension. According to media reports Monday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told reporters that Trump’s tweet that leader Kim Jong Un “won’t be around much longer” was a declaration of war, and Japanese leader Shinzo Abe on Monday called a snap general election in a bid to consolidate power in the midst of a diplomatic crisis with North Korea. Read: These are the next risk events for investors now Gold is “coming out of a bear market, and “the technical position looks better and better after gold bottomed in December 2015,” said O’Byrne. “Since then, we have seen a series of higher lows and higher highs.” “Global demand remains robust with strong demand being seen in many sectors—especially in the ETFs and also in Chinese demand, he said. Gold is also considered a counter to what some market participants have described as lofty levels for U.S. equities potentially ripening for a correction.

That’s in contrast to actively managed funds, where the securities are individually selected by a portfolio manager. The shift away from active and into passive has been dramatic, driven by both the lower cost and historically better performance of passive funds. According to Morningstar, passive funds attracted inflows of $428.7 billion over 2016, while actively managed funds saw outflows of $285.2 billion, a trend that has occurred for nearly 10 years.

According to FactSet, fully one-seventh of the nearly $4.2 trillion in global ETF assets are in funds tracking the benchmark U.S. equity index. The result of that is that passive funds now own an average of 17% of each component of the S&P 500, per Goldman’s data (the range is as little as 10%, and as much as 35%), whereas passive ownership was “a rounding error” a decade ago. Vanguard alone has at least a 5% stake in 468 components of the S&P 500, according to a June report in The Wall Street Journal, up from just three components in 2005. Read more: Investors flock to Vanguard funds, dump Goldman, Wells Fargo, and others Also: Vanguard calls for more diverse corporate boards, better climate-change disclosures As buying and selling index-funds essentially means buying and selling every component of the underlying index, “less trading is stemming from views on company fundamentals,” Goldman wrote. “Passive holders trade stock for different reasons than active managers, and at different frequencies. Passive’s decision to buy or sell stocks is often directed by broader fund flows and larger rebalances and not typically company specific fundamentals.” The investment bank calculated that for the average S&P 500 company, the share of its stock that might trade on fundamental views has dropped to 77% compared with 95% a decade ago. Those figures are based on a measure Goldman calls “passive-adjusted float,” or the number of shares outstanding minus both restricted holdings and passive holdings. “The impact on portfolio construction, alpha and trading are not fully appreciated by investors,” Fogertey wrote. Alpha refers to outperformance over a benchmark. Earlier this month, UBS analysts wrote that worries over the impact passive investing and ETFs would have on price discovery and liquidity were “misguided.” The firm noted that while passive funds comprise 46% of total ETF and mutual fund assets, they only accounted for 8% of the overall global equity market value. “If the investment landscape were limited to ETFs and mutual funds, it may warrant the current level of attention,” they wrote. “However, the investment landscape is far more expansive than just ETFs and mutual funds. There are hedge funds, separately managed accounts, and equities managed by other institutional investors and households that should factor into the analysis.” Read more: Relax, Wall Street: ETFs aren’t the root of all evil Related: Don’t blame ETFs or passive investors for high valuations Nonetheless, the impact of this factor depends on the specific security, as “passive ownership varies in both size and scope even within sectors.” Roughly 30% of the float of energy firm ONEOK

Jeffry Bartash,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 25, 2017 1:00 p.m. ET Economists see small Trump boost, still-low inflation, NABE says By The U.S. economy these days is like an old and reliable car. It’s not going to set any speed records but it’s also not going to break down and leave people stranded. That sums up the latest quarterly outlook by the nation’s most prominent business economists. They predict the U.S. will only grow a touch faster in 2018 — around 2.4% compared to an estimated 2.2% this year. Part of the fuel for faster growth in 2018 are expected tax reductions and spending increases by the Trump White House, according to the National Association of Business Economists. Yet economists also believe there’s just a one-in-four chance of a recession in the next two years, “A large majority of the panel views a near-term recession as highly unlikely,” said Kevin Swift, vice president elect of the NABE. The largely worry-free view of the economy stems from it’s mild rate of growth. The U.S. historically has grown more than 3% a year and at times even faster, but in the absence of such high rates of growth, dangerous imbalances apparently have failed to materialize. The slower rate of growth since the end of the 2007-2009 recession — the U.S. has expanded around 2% a year — also means the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates as high as it normally does. Past recessions have often been caused in part by the central bank raising the cost of borrowing quickly or aggressively. The Fed’s benchmark short-term interest rate, known as fed funds, now ranges from 1% to 1.25%. The NABE predicts the fed funds rate will rise to 2.125% by the end of 2018, but that’s still quite low by historical standards. The more immediate threats to the economy, NABE respondents said, could come from: • A war over free trade that leads to sharp restrictions: • A big reversal in surging U.S. stock markets; • Or tight immigration rules that limit the supply of labor in a time of growing manpower shortages. Inflation is not much of a danger, the NABE said. Economist predict annual prices increases will top out at no more than 1.9% in 2018, using the Fed’s preferred PCE inflation gauge. Also Read: Watch this inflation number to see where interest rates go next The now familiar constraints on the economy’s pace of growth are unlikely to ease much, the NABE said. Worker pay, business investment and productivity should all rise in 2018, but not at a rate strong enough to push U.S. growth above 3%. A lift could come from White House plans to cut taxes and improve public works . But economists are skeptical it will add a big boost — no more than 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points. The last time the U.S. grew at least 3% was in 2005. The current 12-year stretch of sub-3% growth is the longest on record. The flip side is, a recovery now nine years old could end up becoming the longest on record if the economy avoids a downturn in the next two years. The current expansion will turn 99 months old at the end of September. The record is 120 months from 1991 to 2001. ",U.S. economy likely to speed up in 2018 but not shatter any records - MarketWatch

That’s from analysts at Bernstein, who took a deep dive into Tesla’s cash burn, which they estimate will have reached a cumulative $10.6 billion by the end of the year. “Bears argue that this level of capital spending is unprecedented and that Tesla will inevitably run out of cash. Meanwhile, bulls argue that Tesla’s spending is par for course among high-growth companies,” the Bernstein analysts said.

For Tesla, it will all come down to how well the company rolls out the Model 3, the electric sedan the company unveiled in late July. Model 3 deliveries are expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter. Tesla’s $60 billion valuation can be interpreted as a “vote of confidence from the market,” as long as Tesla’s near-team growth stays intact and investors believe profits will follow, the Bernstein analysts said. Investors “will continue to supply liquidity and overlook Tesla’s cash burn, just as they historically did” with Wal-Mart and Home Depot, they said. Related: Tesla will be a money-losing business until 2020, analyst says “However, even if we can disregard Tesla’s cash burn, we continue to worry about the company’s ability to deliver upon its long-term vision of profitability.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc is testing a service to stock groceries directly to customers’ refrigerators as it seeks to take on e-commerce giant Amazon.com. The delivery of groceries and meal kits is emerging as the next frontier of competition among retailers. The world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer said on Friday it is partnering with August Home, a provider of smart locks and  home accessories, to test the service with certain customers in the Silicon Valley. (bit.ly/2ffqqvT) The grocery business is set to be upended through Amazon’s acquisition of upmarket grocer Whole Foods last month and the online retailer is also entrenching itself more deeply in the restaurants business. Amazon Restaurants on Friday teamed up with online food ordering company Olo whose network of restaurants includes Applebee’s and Chipotle. The partnership will help Olo’s restaurant customers connect with Amazon’s delivery services. The competition in the meal-kits business is also heating up. Supermarket operator Albertsons Cos Inc said it would buy meal-kit delivery service Plated while rival Kroger-owned Ralphs started selling meal kits in stores this week. ONE-TIME PASSCODE DELIVERY As part of the test, Wal-Mart delivery persons gain access to a customer’s house using a pre-authorized one-time passcode and put away groceries in the fridge and other items in the foyer. Homeowners would receive notifications when the delivery is in progress and could also watch the real-time process from their home security cameras through the August Home app. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has been exploring new methods of delivery and in June said it was testing using its own store employees to deliver packages ordered online.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Maria has devastated the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, another blow to its already precarious economic situation. Puerto Rico’s government owes $72 billion to bondholders, and an additional $50 billion in pension obligations to teachers and almost all other government employees. In May, it filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. The following are responses from multinational companies on how they are dealing with the aftermath of Maria: WAL-MART STORES INC Phillip Keene, Wal-Mart’s director of corporate communications, said, “Like many businesses, we are working to assess any damage to our facilities as we are safely able to access them and working to connect with our associates to assess what their needs are so we can support as appropriate. We are planning to open facilities very thoughtfully, starting with limited hours at our Sam’s Club near San Juan, perhaps as soon as Sunday. One of our Amigo stores has already reopened under limited hours on the south side of San Juan as of this morning. “Walmart operates 48 retail facilities, a distribution center and a satellite headquarters in Puerto Rico, supported by more than 14,700 associates across the Island. At this time, we are trying to best understand the impacts of Hurricane Maria to Puerto Rico, but it’s been a slow process due to widespread power outages and communication issues. We have activated the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the Walmart Home Office in Bentonville, Arkansas, to support our associates in Puerto Rico. The EOC is Walmart’s centralized platform for crisis coordination. In the EOC, we work directly with logistics, store operations and other teams within the business to ensure we’re aligned on our support plans. “We have been in contact with leaders on the Island and continue to be in regular contact with FEMA and the American Red Cross. Our first priority is, and continues to be, the safety of our associates - taking care of them and their families. We are working rapidly to account for our associates, through store and HR leadership as well as social media, local radio and other channels. These efforts will continue. “Although our normal assessment process has been impeded a bit by road conditions and flooding, we are currently working to identify the status of our facilities on the Island. Our Merchandising, Replenishment, Supply Chain and Logistics teams are working to ensure we have critical supplies and product headed to the island via shipping vessels that are slated to depart as soon as Friday (Sept. 22). This is in addition to the shipment of water that was sent toward the island earlier this week, which is currently staged at sea awaiting clearance to safely enter port. We will continue to assess the right flow and mix of merchandise and supplies to send to Puerto Rico in the coming days and weeks.” Tammy Hull, communications manager at Eli Lilly, said: “Lilly has two manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico as well as an affiliate office and sales team. Safety of our employees is our primary concern. The small team of employees who stayed onsite during the storm are safe. We are still accounting for all employees, which is a slow process due to power and communications loss on the island. We are currently assessing our facilities to determine if any damage occurred. Lilly follows emergency procedures that enable us to maintain adequate inventory at our manufacturing sites around the world to ensure a reliable supply of medicine for patients.” Kristen Davis, senior manager of corporate communications at Amgen, said: “Our first priority is the safety of our colleagues and their families. The vast majority of staff at our Amgen Manufacturing Limited (AML) site in Juncos were sent home prior to Maria making landfall, with only a limited number of colleagues remaining on site to monitor operations. At the moment, we are still working to determine the safety of our people and are hopeful that all will be well. At the same time, we are executing on a comprehensive and well-rehearsed business continuity plan for the site itself. Based on what we know at the moment, we are confident there will be no product supply disruptions for patients around the world. Of course, we will work diligently to ensure drug supply for patients in Puerto Rico and to return our operations in Puerto Rico to normal as quickly as possible.” Michele Meixell, head of external communications and affairs at AstraZeneca, said: “Given the early nature of the disaster, we are still in the process of gathering more information, but I can tell you what we know so far. Our Puerto Rico employee base consists of approximately 250 colleagues. This represents both field-based employees as well as those working in our manufacturing facility located in Canovanas. “Right now our number one priority remains the safety and health of our employees and their families. At this point, it’s still early to understand the full impact to our site, but we have started the process to assess our facility. The site does have backup power capabilities and we have a storm crew in limited operation right now until employees are able to safely return to work. In advance of the storm, the facility took appropriate precautions and we have business continuity plans in place to ensure our medicines continue in production. “We do not anticipate interruption in supply at this time. I also want to point out that while our Puerto Rico site is of critical importance to our organization, we have manufacturing facilities all over the globe producing medicines, so in terms of overall business impact, this is important to clarify. “Regarding the safety of our employees, all non-essential employees had been sent home prior to the storm earlier this week. This is a critical time for our employees to be safe and with their families and we will stay in touch with them in various ways that work best for them in this time of need. We stand behind those impacted by Hurricane Maria and AstraZeneca is committed to helping the people and employees affected by all of these recent natural disasters. We will continue to assess the needs of both our employees and those impacted by the storm and once we have more clarity on their needs, provide support and aid however we can.” Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion said, “We’re continuing to assess the situation in Puerto Rico.” ","

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"More than a third of migrant fishermen in Thailand clearly were victims of trafficking over the past five years, and even more workers in the industry were possibly trafficked as well, according to a report published Thursday. Routinely underpaid and physically abused, three-quarters of migrants working on Thai fishing vessels have been in debt bondage, working to pay off an obligation, said the study by the anti-trafficking group International Justice Mission (IJM). Thailand's multibillion-dollar seafood sector came under fire in recent years after investigations showed widespread slavery, trafficking and violence on fishing boats and in onshore food-processing factories. The politically unstable country, which is under military rule, has vowed to crack down on trafficking and recently introduced reforms to its fisheries law. The IJM study of 260 fishermen from Myanmar and Cambodia found 38 percent were clearly trafficked and another 49 percent possibly trafficked. Only 13 percent reported fair labor conditions at sea and no exploitative recruitment, it said. Three-quarters reported working at least 16 hours a day, and only 11 percent said they were paid more than 9,000 Baht ($272 U.S.) per month, the legal monthly minimum wage in Thailand. One fisherman was quoted in the report as saying he was held in debt bondage, owing 20,000 Baht ($604) to his brother, who worked as a supervisor overseeing fishermen. In debt to brother ""I fear for my life as he has killed in front of me before,"" he was quoted as saying. ""I don't dare to run. He would kill my children."" Field researchers surveyed the 260 fishermen in 20 Thai fishing localities in 2016, collecting information on fishing jobs they had held in the previous five years. Thailand, the world's third-largest seafood exporter, had more than 42,000 active fishing vessels as of 2014, and more than 172,000 people were employed as fishermen, the study said. The study was funded by the Walmart Foundation, the charitable arm of giant U.S. retailer Walmart. With release of the study, the foundation announced a grant to help the IJM improve law enforcement efforts against human trafficking in the Thai fishing industry. Neither Walmart nor the charity would specify the value of the grant. Walmart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email that ""combating forced labor remains a key challenge throughout the world."" ""Regardless of where it occurs in the global supply chain, Walmart is committed to help eliminate forced labor through transparency and collaboration,"" she wrote.

(AMZN) may be the king of e-commerce, but when it comes to the best prices and the speediest shipping, it's Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) that takes the crown. That’s according to BMO Capital Markets, which did a deep dive into pricing and shipping costs at Amazon, Costco and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and found that in the 16 categories analyst Kelly Bania and her team studied, the warehouse retailer had prices 7% lower than on Amazon's website. Shipping took an average of 4.5 days per each item compared to 5.5 at Amazon. Wal-Mart and its Jet.com owned e-commerce website had prices that were 18% higher than Amazon's and took a lot longer to ship with the average being 9.8 days. When taking into account Amazon’s Prime membership program that offers discounts and free two-day shipping, BMO Capital Markets found Amazon prices were 4% lower than Wal-Mart when shipping wasn’t included and 10% cheaper when all of the fees were factored in, reported Barron’s, which covered the research report. (See also: Why Amazon Is Losing to JD.com and Wal-Mart.) “With Costco generally beating Amazon in both price and shipping, it’s a reminder that Amazon has strong competition for all those musing about antitrust concerns, especially ones with a strong membership program like Costco's. And with Walmart investing heavily in eCommerce, we think it remains a vital competitor to watch, especially on price,” wrote Bania. “With that said, Amazon offers a wider set of SKUs​ than Costco does, and Prime has other benefits (video, music, etc.) that create differentiation.” The analyst reiterated her outperform rating on Amazon and her $1,200 price target. The analyst rates Wal-Mart and Costco at market perform with price targets of $80 and $170, respectively. “Despite Costco's price gap to Amazon we believe near-term sentiment and fear of the long-term impact of Amazon on Costco's business (whether or not justified by near-term fundamentals) could continue to create an overhang on COST shares and limit valuation upside,” she wrote in the research note.

The retailer has already promised to add 100,000 jobs in the coming months and has committed to raising minimum wage to $15 by 2020.

There are many who argue that big retailers could afford to increase wages. Some retail employees say they struggle to make ends meet and many have joined the ""Fight for 15"" protests, which call for a minimum wage of $15 per hour and have gained traction in many major cities. Jiyoung Hwang, assistant professor of marketing at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro's Bryan School of Business and Economics, says there are a few factors at play. Chief among them are the minimum wage in each state, which she says retailers often use a benchmark, the level of skill each employee has and the company's emphasis on corporate social responsibility (CSR.) ""Costco is well-known for its CSR while Wal-Mart is quite lower in that reputation,"" Hwang says. Pressure to offer customers low prices, long operating hours and the importance of competing with other retailers also play a big role, she adds. In addition, company sales, the cost of living in an area and a worker's responsibilities contribute to wage decisions, according to Ana Serafin Smith, senior director of media relations at the National Retail Federation (NRF). Still, Smith says that those who earn minimum wage from major retailers may not have to do so for long. ""A majority of those hired in an entry-level position,"" Smith says, citing NRF research, ""reported earning a promotion within a year of employment.""

"Paul Sonn, general counsel, National Employment Law Project",09282017,CNBC,09212017,"With the holiday season approaching, this week Target became the first low-wage chain to announce it will raise pay to $15 an hour. Chief executive Brian Cornell said the decision to raise wages to $15 by 2020 will help Target attract and retain talent as the hyper-competitive retail sector enters its busiest quarter. It also shows the growing impact of the Fight for $15–and puts pressure on other major players like Amazon, Walmart and McDonalds to follow suit. Since striking fast-food workers launched the Fight for $15 in 2012, states and cities comprising more than 18 percent of the U.S. workforce—including Target's home city of Minneapolis—have approved $15 minimum wages. And scores of companies have raised pay to $15, including insurance giants Aetna and Allstate, major hospital chains across the country, and tech leader Facebook for its contracted bus drivers, janitors and security guards. But Target's role as an industry leader in retail—which together with restaurants employs the largest share of workers paid less than $15–illustrates what business strategists have long argued: historically low-paying sectors can make the shift to significantly higher pay. MIT business professor Zeynep Ton has shown how industry leaders like Costco and Trader Joe's provide a roadmap for how investing in retail workers with good wages and benefits goes hand-in-hand with strong growth and productivity. Target's move blows up the claims of corporate lobbyists who argue it's simply not possible for industries like retail and restaurants to pay a $15 minimum wage. In fact,  growing numbers of business owners and economists confirm that a phased-in $15 minimum wage is realistic for employers and will help boost the consumer spending that ultimately drives job growth. But ultimately the imperative to pay a living wage is about our nation's values. As La Colombe CEO Todd Carmichael  argued last week, ""unless you pay your employees a nonpredatory living wage that keeps people and their families above the poverty line, you don't deserve to be in business."" Part of what's driving employers like Target to pay $15 an hour is the simple fact that,  everywhere in America—not just on the coasts-- a single worker will soon need to earn at least that much just to afford the basics. And workers on the coasts or supporting kids will need even more. Yet more than 43 percent of America's workers struggle on less than $15 an hour. Far from teenagers, the median age of the millions of  workers earning less than $15 an hour in the U.S. is 32. They include hospital workers and preschool teachers, auto-parts workers and waitresses. In other words, many of the front line jobs in which U.S. workers today spend their careers pay less than $15 an hour. And we all end up subsidizing those low wages. Low pay by corporations like McDonald's and Walmart cost taxpayers  a whopping $153 billion a year in public assistance to working families, according to a recent study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. A key issue when employers like Target raise pay is what happens to the growing numbers of employees who don't work for them directly but instead through staffing agencies or service contractors. In the Twin Cities, Target has already been a leader in tackling this issue,  agreeing last year to support the efforts of its contracted janitors to unionize and raise their pay substantially. Ensuring that more employers raise standards for contracted and direct employees alike is essential  in our increasingly ""fissured"" workplaces. Low pay is hurting America's working families and holding back our economy, which depends on a thriving consumer class to drive growth. Target's plan to raise pay to $15 an hour over the next 30 months is smart business strategy, and what our nation's workforce and economy need. There's now a bullseye on the back of employers like Amazon, Walmart and McDonalds. They should follow Target's lead. ",Target's $15 an hour move 'blows up' minimum wage myths-commentary

The Wharton School's Jeremy Siegel believes it'll have a lot to do with President Donald Trump's intention to get business-friendly reforms passed on Capitol Hill — not the latest Federal Reserve decision on interest rates or better-than-expected economic growth figures. ""I would say corporate tax reform could add another 10 percent to the market even this year,"" Siegel said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" A deal ""looks very likely to get done."" It's the second time in less than 12 months that Siegel, a longtime bull, has made a bold market call. And it came on a day when the Dow and S&P 500 closed at record highs. In the final weeks of 2016, Siegel argued that the blue chip stock index was very close to hitting the 20,000 milestone. It broke through that key psychological level on Jan. 25 and since then has soared more than 10 percent. If Siegel is right this time, too, a 10 percent jump would put the Dow around 24,650 and the S&P 500 at 2,760 based on Wednesday's closes. ""There's new hope that taxes really have a chance to be done. I remained steadfast throughout some of the bleak days in the last few months when no one thought anything could be done,"" Siegel added. ""There's a little bit more optimism now. I think a corporate tax deal will be done, and I think that will be positive for the equity market,"" he said. Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.

After founding Playboy magazine in 1953, ""Hef"" built a publishing empire that spanned more than 60 years by featuring photos of nude women, in-depth interviews and the writings of literary luminaries, all instrumental in promoting the sexual revolution.

Over the past year, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has been stocking up on online retail outlets. It closed its acquisition of Jet.com about a year ago, and it's since bought four other small online retailers. Wal-Mart's efforts have resulted in huge online sales growth, but its acquisition strategy may be somewhat flawed. Wal-Mart has put the former CEO of Jet.com, Marc Lore, in charge of its online operations in the United States. He recently spoke at a conference, and when asked what Wal-Mart does better than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), he said Wal-Mart's unique assets separate it from the competition. Image source: Wal-Mart Lore pointed specifically to the ""4,600"" stores Wal-Mart operates in the United States as a unique advantage over Amazon. Lore may have been using an old store count, because Wal-Mart says it has 4,741 stores in the U.S. That number is somehow getting larger every year. Roughly 90% of the U.S. population is within 10 miles of a Walmart store. That means Wal-Mart has a big advantage in in-store pickup and online grocery ordering, and has the infrastructure to succeed in shipping items to customers' homes. Indeed, Wal-Mart was able to launch free two-day shipping on its online orders over $35 earlier this year thanks in part to its network of stores. ""We can do 2-hour delivery cheaper than anybody else because of the assets we have,"" Lore said. After purchasing Whole Foods Market, Amazon's physical storefronts still only amount to about 10% of Wal-Mart's. Even with its  network of fulfillment centers, just 44% of the population lived within 20 miles of Amazon's network as of a year ago. Those fulfillment centers naturally have a lot of overlap with Whole Foods locations as they both target high-population areas. Wal-Mart is the nation's largest private employer with 1.5 million employees in the U.S. Lore cites this as an asset, although the larger overhead has been more of a drag for Wal-Mart. Amazon generates twice as much revenue per employee compared to Wal-Mart. Lore has been creative in finding ways to make employees more efficient as Wal-Mart boosts online sales. Not only does the large number of employees allow Wal-Mart to quickly ramp up services like fulfilling online grocery orders in its stores, Lore tested using employees to deliver online orders the last mile to customers' doorsteps. Physical retail necessitates more employees compared to online-only operations like Amazon. Workers need to stock shelves, assist customers in stores, and work the checkout lines. Investors should expect Amazon's revenue-per-employee number to fall after incorporating Whole Foods' numbers into the mix. But those extra employees offer an opportunity to expand a retailer's capabilities. Wal-Mart's biggest success, so far, has been online grocery ordering and pickup. Lore will continue to search for opportunities like that. Lore wasn't afraid to admit where Amazon has Wal-Mart beat -- that's the overall shopping experience on Amazon compared to Walmart. He said it's easier to find the product you want on Amazon, the competitor often has a greater assortment of goods, and the delivery experience is often superior. It's simple to hire a bunch of engineers to hack away at Walmart.com's search and recommendation algorithms to find the products people really want. It's a lot tougher for Wal-Mart to convince certain brands to sell their goods at its stores. Wal-Mart's reputation for low quality keeps it from attracting more high-end brands. That's part of the idea of buying up smaller online outlets like Bonobos and ShoeBuy. It's also made an effort to attract more third-party merchants to its online marketplace. A quality shopping experience is the biggest hurdle for Wal-Mart to really take on Amazon. And as Amazon moves into brick-and-mortar retail, Wal-Mart may start to feel a bit more pressure to get it right. ","

"Timothy Green, Danny Vena, and Keith Speights",09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. To be a successful long-term investor, you need to make sure your portfolio won't implode on the first sign of a rainy day. What seems like a great idea during the best of times will only reveal its true nature during the worst of times. Sticking with companies that can perform well regardless of economic conditions is an effective way to harden your portfolio. Here's why three of our Foolish investors think Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are some of the best rainy-day stocks. Image source: Getty Images. Danny Vena (Wal-Mart): Investors planning for a rainy day should fortify their portfolio with companies that can perform well during periods of economic instability, which is when consumers tend to spend carefully, forgoing their usual shopping habits and opting for lower prices. During the depths of the Great Recession, many shoppers turned to Wal-Mart's ""Always low prices"" to help make ends meet. As the largest retailer in the world, Wal-Mart has unmatched economies of scale. For its fiscal year ended January 2017, it produced revenue of $485.9 billion and operating income of $22.8 billion. Its operating cash flow totaled $31.5 billion, and it returned $8.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchases. Wal-Mart is also a Dividend Aristocrat, having paid a dividend every year since 1974 and boasting 44 years of consecutive increases. It has a dividend that currently yields 2.5% and a healthy payout ratio of 48%, leaving room for future increases. While the company was initially slow to embrace e-commerce, it corrected that last year with its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, as well as a number of other smaller specialty clothiers. As a result, in its most recent quarter the company posted impressive increases in e-commerce sales, which grew 60% over the prior-year quarter, with gross merchandise volume increasing 67% year over year. If you're looking for a stock for a rainy day, consider this: During the bear market that began Oct. 9, 2007, and ended March 9, 2009, while the broader S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) fell 56%, Wal-Mart stock gained 10%. Data by YCharts. Keith Speights (Facebook): What do people do on a rainy day? They stay inside. While inside, there's a pretty good chance that they'll look at social media. And the undisputed king of social media is Facebook. I suspect that the executives at Facebook like it when people stay inside on rainy days, because it increases the amount of time they spend catching up on friends' posts -- and looking at ads. Ads generate 98% of Facebook's revenue. And that revenue is growing, with the company reporting a 47% year-over-year jump in advertising revenue in the second quarter of 2017. This growth stems from two factors. First, Facebook charged 24% more per ad in the last quarter. It can get away with that kind of price boost because it reaches more than 2 billion monthly active users. Second, the company is also increasing the number of ads displayed. More volume at higher prices is a surefire way to make more money. But can buying Facebook stock make you plenty of money? I think so. Wall Street projects that Facebook will achieve average annual earnings growth over the next five years of nearly 27%. That's a drop from the heady growth of past years, but it's still an impressive level. That growth makes Facebook's valuation look pretty reasonable as well. Facebook isn't just a leader in social media. It's also a leader in artificial intelligence and augmented reality, two of the hottest trends in technology today. Buying Facebook stock is a way of investing in these two trends. That's a pretty smart way, in my view, to use time on a rainy day so that your financial future isn't stormy. Tim Green (Microsoft): Software giant Microsoft has changed quite a bit over the past few years. It's embraced cloud computing, building its Azure cloud platform into a strong No. 2 player. It's dropped its Windows-centric position, building first-class apps for Android and iOS. And it's building an increasing amount of hardware, from its Surface tablets and laptop to its HoloLens augmented reality headset. But what hasn't changed about Microsoft is its dominant position in the productivity software market. Businesses depend on Office, Outlook, and other Microsoft products, and that's likely to remain true regardless of the state of the economy. Office is still the company's cash cow, despite serious competition from Alphabet's Google. While Microsoft is heavily investing in growth businesses like cloud computing, the company is still producing impressive profits. During fiscal 2017, Microsoft generated $21.2 billion of net income on $90.0 billion of revenue. Meanwhile, Azure revenue is doubling year over year, and Office 365 commercial, the subscription version of Office, is growing by more than 40% annually. Microsoft is in an enviable position, with dominant businesses like Office throwing off cash, allowing the company to invest in newer businesses that will act as its growth engine for years to come. Through the good times and the bad, Microsoft should continue to produce exceptional results. ","

Target (NYSE:TGT) made news earlier this week by making public plans to increase its minimum hourly wage for all employees to $11 in October. The chain also pledged to increase wages to a $15-per-hour minimum by 2020. The company said in a press release that a ""significant investment in its team will allow Target to continue to recruit and retain strong team members."" It comes at a time when unemployment sits near historic lows and the idea of a $15-an-hour minimum wage has become a huge topic of national debate. Target's move follows its previous wage hike to a $10 an hour minimum in 2016. It also follows efforts from its chief rival, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), to raise wages. In February 2016 the company pledged to pay any employees hired before Jan. 1, 2016 at $10 an hour and that any workers hired after that would receive at least $9 an hour, with their rate increasing to at least $10 upon completion of a training program. Target has increased the minimum hourly wage for its employees. Image source: Target. Only two states -- Massachusetts and Washington -- have $11-an-hour minimum wages. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia, however, have a minimum wage that exceeds the federal standard of $7.25. In his remarks in the press release Target's CEO Brian Cornell framed the move as being about making life better for his chain's workers. Target has always offered market competitive wages to our team members. With this latest commitment, we'll be providing even more meaningful pay, as well as the tools, training and support our team needs to build their skills, develop professionally and offer the service and expertise that set Target apart. That's, of course, a piece of it, but the reality is that changing market conditions dictate the increase. With unemployment standing at 4.4% in August, near historic lows, the reality is Target needs to pay more to attract workers. An employee who makes $11 an hour for a 40-hour week would earn $22,800 a year. That's less than the average annual wages for cashiers ($27,701) and warehouse associates ($40,784), according to GlassDoor's most-recent Local Pay Reports. Of course, those reports offer the average of all workers in those positions, not the minimum hourly starting wage. Target's starting pay will also be less than the $14.21 an hour the average Costco cashier makes and less than the $12.42 an Amazon fulfillment associate earns per hour, according to GlassDoor salary reviews. That data is based on 158 Costco employees reporting their earnings to the jobs data website and 683 Amazon warehouse workers doing the same. The new rate, however, is very competitive in other areas of the market. Starting workers at $11 an hour does put Target well ahead of the $8.41 to $8.61 an hour the average McDonald's crew member or cashier makes. Target's starting salary will also be more than the average Starbucks barista makes ($9.55 to $9.57), and more than Sears ($8.37 to $8.54) and J.C. Penney ($9.04 to $9.07) associates and cashiers, according to what was reported to GlassDoor. In the retail world, especially when it comes to entry-level positions, small differences in salary can be the difference between someone taking a job or electing to go elsewhere. Competitive pay can also help a company retain employees, lowering its long-term training costs while also improving customer service. Heading into a time when it and many of its rivals are hiring for the holidays, Target has given itself a leg up on the competition. By paying more than the competition, the retailer should have an easier time hiring and holding onto the employees it needs. That should improve the in-store experience for customers and help the company meet its Q4 goals. The company's long-range wage increases will help it build an ongoing foundation of well-trained, experienced employees. ","

Daniel B. Kline,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In the 1980s and even the 1990s, Toys R Us was a place children begged their parents to take them. The chain had a selection of toys that dwarfed what was sold at now-defunct department store chains like Ames, Caldor, and Bradlees. Even its Sunday newspaper inserts were an event, and its holiday season ""toy book"" was much perused by children in order to pick out what gifts they planned to ask for. Toys R Us' slow path to bankruptcy, which it filed on Sept. 18, did not begin with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). It started with chains like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) creating toy departments that not only pushed prices (and margins) lower, but also made it so a visit to Toys R Us was no longer unique. Wal-Mart and Target made Toys R Us less of a destination and gave parents a way to placate their kids while also doing their own shopping. Toys R Us has filed for bankruptcy. Image source: Getty Images. For two years, I ran the largest toy and hobby store in New England. We had a Toys R Us, a Target, and a Wal-Mart within a couple of miles of us. We were also in a relatively remote location while our toy-selling rivals were closer to the highway and near a major mall. Despite those deficits and the fact that we were generally more expensive than the chains we competed with, we thrived. The mistake Toys R Us has made is that it has done very little to differentiate itself from its department store rivals. My former toy store, which is doing well to this day, did much more than sell toys, hobby items, model trains, and more. It actively gave customers a reason to visit. We hosted gaming events, tournaments, and learn-to-play classes for everything from the easiest children's games to the most complicated collectible offerings. We also had multiple huge model train sets that were shown off for free twice a month, and every Sunday during the holiday season. Those trains were maintained and built by clubs that met in the store. During weekdays, we had story time for children, and on holidays, we barbecued, made cotton candy, or handed out special treats to our customers. Even when nothing was happening, we had play areas for little kids, model-building areas for all ages, and a near-endless supply of curios we picked up in theory to sell, but just as much to give customers something to look at. We also had a customer-first attitude where we welcomed everyone warmly, treated regulars like family, and accepted that sometimes we were going to teach a customer about a product only for them to buy it cheaper on Amazon. Our store also had merchandise that wouldn't be found at a Toys R Us or a department store, as well as staff that was passionate about what they sold. Toys R Us had the tools and the space to be all of those things, but either arrogance or complacency stopped it from evolving. Once simply having toys stopped making it a destination for kids and toy lovers, the chain needed to do more. CEO David Brandon acknowledged that in the bankruptcy filing, explaining how the company would change its stores. ""Once these initiatives are implemented, Toys R Us stores will be interactive spaces with rooms to use for parties, live product demonstrations put on by trained employees, and the freedom for employees to remove product from boxes to let kids play with the latest toys,"" he said. That's the model that would have worked all along. It's a game Target and Wal-Mart are unlikely to play, and one that Amazon, for obvious reasons, can't. Bankruptcy may clear some debt and let the company shed some leases, but it needs to change in order to avoid slowly falling right back into the same hole. Toys R Us has to go from being a place that sells toys and games to one that's full of activities, experiences, and discoveries for kids and adults alike. The chain needs to transform from store to destination -- if it does that, then sales will follow. ","

It wasn't so long ago that investors couldn't buy enough of Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR): Between 2013 and 2015, the stock rose an astonishing 217%. Yet since January 2016, Kroger's shares have lost 50% of their value. Over the last 18 months, Kroger's comparable quarterly sales, excluding fuel sales, have shifted from healthy growth in the mid-single digits to a complete standstill. In the final quarter of 2016, the company saw its 13-year streak of comparable sales growth snap, as comps declined for the first time in 53 quarters. Kroger is cuing up a comps revival, but for now, progress is wan. Management projects just a slight expansion in this metric of 0.5% to 1% for the second half of the current fiscal year. The culprit, of course, is fierce competition among grocers for customers. And it will only intensify: 2018 promises to ring in a battle royale within the grocery industry. Whole Foods Market will present a distinct online retailing challenge once new owner Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) integrates the organic chain's loyalty program with its Amazon Prime service. As for brick-and-mortar developments, privately held German discount grocers Aldi and Lidl will open 500 new stores in the U.S. between them by the end of 2018 alone, as Aldi seeks to expand and Lidl builds on its 2017 entry on the east coast. In a pre-emptive response to the European invasion, Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) -- never an easy grocer to undercut -- is already allowing its gross margin to slip in 2017 in order to ""invest in price."" These pitched battles, both online and in midsized and major metropolitan areas, are occurring just as shopping habits undergo significant change. The Food Marketing Institute has been tracking grocery industry trends for decades. Last year, its ""U.S. Grocery Shopper Report"" confirmed what many of us have experienced personally: Shoppers are splitting their grocery buys over a number of different store types and channels. In fact, the report showed that in each of the preceding three years, a ""significant"" number of shoppers (between 7% and 9%) no longer claimed loyalty to a primary grocery store. That's a problem for Kroger, which operates as a conventional grocer in an increasingly specialized world. It's not a premium grocer like Whole Foods, nor a deep-discounter like Aldi or Lidl. The company instead has existed as a traditional supermarket which uses high customer engagement and sheer proximity to customers (with approximately 2,800 stores spread across 35 states) to drive traffic. Image source: Getty Images. To keep comps from treading water, which won't be kind to its stock price, Kroger has a complex task ahead. The company will have to stay focused, avoid overreaching for desperate solutions, and double down on its very formidable core strengths. Read through a recent earnings call transcript, or browse the company's quarterly earnings reports, and you'll be reminded of the slate of advantages that propelled Kroger, not many quarters ago, to brisk comps growth. I'll summarize them briefly as follows: Think of the advantages above as a sort of body armor Kroger constructed over the last few years as competitors refined their individual niches and prepared to attack on price and differentiation. Now's the time to wear that armor in the battle to protect market share and build comps. This month, CEO Rodney McMullen said emphatically in an earnings conference call that the grocer is ""not going to lose on price."" Cutting prices is simple, but retaining customers on price alone is not. A more sustainable strategy is to shift more resources away from price investment, and toward the manufacturing, brand, and technology investments which boost inherent advantages. To stabilize in this environment and grow again, Kroger needs to push its Simple Truth line. It should expand private-label brands that contribute to higher profits. It should continue to embrace online shopping, and dial up the use of analytics to retain customers and incentivize shopping frequency. In reaffirming its strengths, Kroger will reaffirm its identity to its customers.

Kline,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The fourth quarter has become a sort of retail free-for-all where stores try increasingly desperate tactics to lure in customers. From opening on Thanksgiving Day to heavy discounts and aggressive promotions, retailers pull out all the stops. That makes sense because the importance of the period seems to grow each year. In 2017, early predictions from Deloitte show that total holiday sales, excluding automobiles and gasoline, will reach $1.04 trillion to $1.05 trillion between November and January, up from $1 trillion last year. And while the digital portion of overall sales has grown, e-commerce sales will only account for $111 billion to $114 billion of that total -- an 18%-21% increase over $93.8 billion in 2016. Servicing all of those sales requires workers. In Q4, really toward the end of Q3 in September, many retail and retail-adjacent companies have traditionally hired a lot of people. This list will expand as the season gets closer, but there are a lot of jobs out there in a market that's already near historically high employment rates. Unlike last year, these jobs may not be easy to fill, a fact that has already caused Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) to decide against hiring temporary workers. Instead, the retailer will fill its need by offering overtime to existing employees. Some of the companies on this list may end up following Wal-Mart's lead if they can't find enough qualified applicants, but for now, here's the list of companies that are hiring and how many people they need. Retailers will be hiring tens of thousands of workers for the holiday season. Image source: Target. Even though Wal-Mart has elected to sit out the hiring season, most of its rivals have different plans. There will literally be hundreds of thousands of openings in everything from front-end, consumer-facing positions, to backroom warehouse jobs, and digital fulfillment positions: These are not the only retailers with holiday hiring plans, just the ones that have come forward so far. Kohl's, Nordstrom, and many other chains are planning to add workers. In many ways, it's a job-seeker's market, with applicants being able to weigh things like pay and benefits against the possibility of becoming a permanent hire when deciding where to apply. The rise of digital sales has put tremendous pressure on the companies that deliver online orders. The United States Postal Service (USPS) has posted job listings in a number of markets looking for both seasonal and permanent workers. The number of openings varies based on the market, but the overall job count seems significant. Not to be outdone by the government, both United Parcel Service and FedEx plan to hire. UPS plans to add about 95,000 seasonal workers, while its rival hopes to hire 50,000 while also offering more overtime for existing employees. In many cases seasonal jobs go to college kids, people working a second gig, or those not looking to enter the workforce full-time. For those seeking permanent employment, however, a seasonal job can be a way to get your foot in the door at a company you want to work at. Every company on this list has both full and seasonal openings, but if your goal is a permanent job, it may be best to take seasonal work at a thriving company. Amazon, for example, is likely to keep more temporary workers than Toys R Us or Macy's simply given the trajectory of their businesses. Still, a chain like Target may be facing challenges, but it's doing well enough that exceptional seasonal workers can probably find a full-time, permanent job after the holiday season. ","

Like solar and wind power, many alternative energy advocates have touted the potential of hydrogen power for years. Investors in fuel cell companies like Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) are still waiting, however, for the inflection point that marks the company's transition to sustained profitability. Perhaps in 2017, though, that time has come. Rising 128% in 2017 as of this writing, Plug Power has delighted the market -- unlike in 2016 -- with several announcements, suggesting that the tide has turned. Thanks in part to a deal with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), fuel cell fever is working its way through Wall Street. Indicating a bullish outlook on the stock, analysts at FBR Capital and Cowen have each identified a $3 price target on the stock. Moreover, an analyst at the investment bank Rodman and Renshaw issued a $4 price target. But Wall Street's enthusiasm doesn't necessarily mean investors should start powering their portfolios with this fuel cell industry leader. Image source: Getty Images. To say that news of the company's deal with Amazon was well received would be a gross understatement. Shares soared more than 60% in April -- the month in which the announcement was made -- and the stock hasn't looked back, continuing to climb ever since. What fed the fervor? For one, Plug Power's management expects the deal to add $70 million to the company's top line in 2017. This is no small sum considering the company reported $86 million in revenue in the prior year. Besides the deal with Amazon, Plug Power pleased investors with its second-quarter earnings report. Management announced a new agreement with long-term partner Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), with an estimated the contract value to be $70 million. And speaking to its fiscal 2017 finances, it was quite optimistic, estimating negative free cash flow of $25 million to $35 million. Additionally, the company expects further progress in its pursuit of profitability, and is forecasting an expansion in its fiscal 2017 gross margin (excluding the impact of warrants issued to Amazon and Wal-Mart) to 8% to 12%; the fiscal 2016 gross margin was only 4.6%. In terms of the stock, because it's unprofitable, we can't use the traditional price-to-earnings metric to value shares, so let's consider the price-to-sales ratio. Shares are trading around 5.4 times sales, slightly higher than the stock's 5.2 average, but those who are optimistic about the company's future could certainly shrug off this seemingly high price tag. Despite the deal with Amazon and an improvement in some areas of its financials, the bear argument for Plug Power remains strong. Image source: Getty Images For one, management's forecast for its fiscal 2017 performance must be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism since it doesn't have a great track record of meeting its guidance. In 2013, it estimated Plug Power would break even on an EBITDA basis by the second or third quarter of 2014. Slightly off, the company reported an EBITDA loss of $84 million in 2014 according to Morningstar. Last year, during its Q1 2016 presentation, it announced a gross margin goal exceeding 12% for fiscal 2016. The company instead reported a gross margin of 4.6%, thereby coming up quite short. Management, furthermore, set an operating cash flow target of negative $20 million. Again missing the target, it reported negative $30 million in operating cash flow in fiscal 2016. PLUG R&D to Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Accounting for 28% of revenue in the trailing 12 months, revenue earmarked for R&D will likely remain a large obstacle on the road to profitability as the company pursues development of its ProGen prototypes for both the domestic and Chinese markets. Predicated on a future where hydrogen has supplanted traditional fuels, picking up shares of Plug Power at this point remains too risky. As one who's been enthusiastic about alternative power for years, I'd be more than happy to add Plug Power to my portfolio. Unfortunately, trust issues regarding its management team still persist, and the failure to translate top-line growth to the bottom line remains a concern. Unless the stock nosedives and reaches rock-bottom prices or the company remedies its issues, I'll be rooting for Plug Power from the sidelines. ","

In the past three years, iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) has pulled off a truly impressive feat. During that time, the maker of home robotics has increased its revenue by nearly 40% while simultaneously reducing its revenue sources. Specifically, the company eliminated $55 million in revenue and pulled out its very roots by divesting its military segment in 2016 and recently discontinued one of its four product lines in the home robotics category, a gutter cleaning line called the Looj. IRBT Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. How then, has the company been able to increase revenue at such a rapid pace? By absolutely dominating in its top product category, that's how! In 2002, iRobot essentially invented the robotic vacuum cleaning market with the launch of the first Roomba. For a decade and a half, Roomba has been the king of robotic vacuum cleaners, especially in the United States, where it holds a jaw-dropping 88% market share. However, it is no longer the only game in town. Let's take a look at the evidence and decide whether there are any companies ready to challenge iRobot's leadership in the fast-growing robotic vacuum cleaner market. It is hard to fathom that any competitor would be able to overtake iRobot in global market share in the near future. iRobot's current position compared to that of its closest rival is simply too dominant: Data source: iRobot. Chart by author. However, just because a competitor can't take the No. 1 spot doesn't mean it can't meaningfully affect iRobot's top and bottom lines, and by extension, its stock price. Let's look further at two companies that might have the potential to do just that. Image source: Ecovacs SharkNinja: SharkNinja is a newcomer to the robotic floor-cleaning market, but it is certainly no stranger to consumers. The company's Ninja Blender has been ranked the No. 1 blender three years in a row in the U.S.,and its upright vacuum cleaners have claimed the No. 1 spot in U.S. market share. Earlier this month, SharkNinja began selling the Shark ION Robot 750. While it's too early to know for sure how big of a splash SharkNinja will make in the market, it's likely the company has big plans. With iRobot's stock dropping 15% after a short-seller said the competitor's entrance to the market posed ""a credible threat,"" it's safe to say shareholders agree. Only time will tell if iRobot will be able to continue growing revenue and earnings at a rapid clip with increasing competition trying to get a bigger share of the pie. We do know that iRobot's management believes its patent portfolio is a huge part of its competitive moat. The other safeguard iRobot may have is a fast-growing market. At a recent investor conference, management stated that the immediately addressable market for robotic vacuums is two to three times the currently installed base and that 700% market growth is expected over the long term. If the market for robotic floor cleaners grows fast enough, it is possible iRobot could lose market share and still grow revenue and profits significantly. At the same time, competition is increasing as we speak. Robotic vacuum cleaners at lower price points have essentially become commoditized home appliances. Amazon's ""robotic vacuums"" product selection numbers in the hundreds, and iRobot estimates that 20% of all vacuums worldwide are robotic -- and more than 30% of those are made by its competitors. With that level of competition already existing for lower-end products, if Ecovacs or Shark Ninja can chip away at market share on the premium lines (which management defines as vacuums costing $200 or above), it's only a matter of time before iRobot's absolute dominance comes to an end.

A full transcript follows the video. Mac Greer: Let's begin with, frankly, a retailer that I have pretty much forgotten is still around -- Bed Bath & Beyond. Wow, Bed Bath & Beyond taking a bath on Wednesday. Shares down more than 14% after the company lowered its earnings outlook and reported weaker-than-expected earnings. David Kretzmann, I go to you. Is Bed Bath & Beyond beyond repair? Is there anything you can do to save this? David Kretzmann: What hurts here is, the stores aren't performing that well, but on the financial side of things, management has done more to add gasoline to that bad fire overall. If you go back to 2014, from a financial perspective, the company looked like it was in decent shape. It was producing over $1 billion in free cash flow annually, had $850 million in net cash on the balance sheet, so they had cash in the bank, they were producing a lot more cash to add to that tally. But that year, they decided to issue $1.5 billion in new debt just to buy back stock. They essentially went into more debt, bought back a lot of stock, and now a few years later the company has over $1 billion in net debt, and their free cash flow production has almost been cut in half to about $570 million. So that's a bleak direction to be going within just a few years. They've really been focusing on buying back stock, they haven't done a whole lot to improve the actual in-store experience, and what they have done has been very slow. They are making some progress with their digital sales, which now make up about 15% of total revenue. They say that their ""differentiated products,"" which they consider their exclusive products, personalizable products, makes up about half of sales, so I think that's probably an area where they really need to double down and find some way to differentiate what they're offering and how they offer it from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other retailers that are still out there. They've also made some acquisitions into new brick-and-mortar retail concepts. They bought a website, personalizationmall.com, late last year, where you can buy and personalize a lot of different items. Going that route makes the most sense to me. It's not a stock I would buy, even though it looks very cheap-looking at these trailing metrics. But I think management has made some very poor cash management decisions over the past few years, and in the meantime, the actual performance of the stores leaves a lot to be desired. Aaron Bush: Yeah, one tidbit that I keep on coming back to for Bed Bath & Beyond and for other struggling retailers is, when a brick-and-mortar store tries to add a quality e-commerce operation, not only does it tend to cause its physical stores to struggle more, but it makes the company increasingly expensive to run, because they have to duplicate the cost just to serve that same customer. So you do see them making really dumb decisions with debt, and adding new retail concepts, which feels more like a distraction than anything. But just the fundamental structure of how the economics work, and managing an in-store presence and an online presence isn't very friendly. And they've been really slow to do this. But now that they are invested in it, it's another reason that's adding a margin drag and keeping earnings lower. Greer: Do you think, in terms of those traditional retailers adding that online piece, I see why you would want to do it. Everyone's trying to fend off Amazon. You have to try anything. So you have Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) with the Jet acquisition. Do you think that's going to work for Wal-Mart? Or, to take your logic even further, if you're Wal-Mart, do you stick to your knitting, which is just bread-and-butter traditional retailers? Bush: I think for Wal-Mart and Jet, I think it was smart to acquire Jet, not for Jet itself, but more for the talent that is in that management team. And I know, I'm blanking on his name ... Marc Lore, who was the head of Jet, now runs Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations. So I think that was smart. What Wal-Mart really needs to do is continue to acquire things and really build up a big suite of an online presence. When it comes to e-commerce, aggregation is increasingly important, so you either have to dominate a niche, or you have to be someone that you can go to for anything and everything. So it's tough. Wal-Mart might be able to pull it off, Amazon is definitely pulling it off, but for someone like Bed Bath & Beyond it's a hard spot. Kretzmann: I think what Aaron mentioned highlights why it's so difficult for these brick-and-mortar retailers to pivot more to online or omnichannel sales because it tends to be more expensive to operate both rather than one or the other. But there is some value to the omnichannel experience. You see Amazon clearly showing a lot of interest in opening up their own brick-and-mortar stores, acquiring Whole Foods. So there is value there. But for a lot of these companies, I think it will be a short-term ding, but it's probably what they need to do to stay relevant and figure out some way to hopefully improve the economics over time, one way or another, whether it's offering more personalized services or some sort of consultation. We're going to talk about Best Buy today. They're trying to do something along those lines. But in the short term, the company needs to stomach those short-term dings if they want to stay relevant with competitors like Amazon. Greer: So, Bed Bath & Beyond shares a lot cheaper today than they were yesterday, but you're still not interested? Kretzmann: Based on management's track record, both managing the stores and how they've been trying to pivot those stores, I think they've been lackluster there. And they've also really jeopardized the company's financial position, because you're not going to go bankrupt if you don't have debt, and they completely pivoted the whole balance sheet a few years ago to buy back stock, which, in hindsight, looks like a very dumb move. Shares have continued dropping since then, so that was a poor investment, and a very poor reason to go into debt. So, from a financial position now, the company's future is in a lot more jeopardy now. So I would stay on the sidelines here. Greer: So, five years from now, are they still a going concern? Are they still around? Kretzmann: I think they're still around but they're probably getting pretty close to bankruptcy, at the rate they're going now. ","

                                   climbed by 0.9%. “The backdrop for gold today is as bullish as it has been in a long time,” said Mark O’Byrne, research director at GoldCore in Dublin. He expects gold prices to reach $1,400 before the end of the year. With President Donald Trump “in the White House and the political situation in the U.S. and globally more uncertain than it has been in many years, gold will almost certainly continue to see robust safe-haven demand,” he said. “This should push gold higher in the coming months.” Recent military tensions between North Korea and the U.S. and its allies has helped to underpin gold’s haven status as a hedge against a sudden escalation in geopolitical tension. According to media reports Monday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told reporters that Trump’s tweet that leader Kim Jong Un “won’t be around much longer” was a declaration of war, and Japanese leader Shinzo Abe on Monday called a snap general election in a bid to consolidate power in the midst of a diplomatic crisis with North Korea. Read: These are the next risk events for investors now Gold is “coming out of a bear market, and “the technical position looks better and better after gold bottomed in December 2015,” said O’Byrne. “Since then, we have seen a series of higher lows and higher highs.” “Global demand remains robust with strong demand being seen in many sectors—especially in the ETFs and also in Chinese demand, he said. Gold is also considered a counter to what some market participants have described as lofty levels for U.S. equities potentially ripening for a correction.

The two markets often move inversely as a weaker dollar can make commodities pegged to the currency, including most of the world’s gold, more appealing to buyers using weaker monetary units. The dollar strengthened against the euro, which was under pressure after a heavy drop in support for mainstream parties in Germany’s general election on Sunday left the way forward in doubt for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative alliance.

Passive products allow investors to hold all the components of an index like the Russell 2000

That’s in contrast to actively managed funds, where the securities are individually selected by a portfolio manager. The shift away from active and into passive has been dramatic, driven by both the lower cost and historically better performance of passive funds. According to Morningstar, passive funds attracted inflows of $428.7 billion over 2016, while actively managed funds saw outflows of $285.2 billion, a trend that has occurred for nearly 10 years.

According to FactSet, fully one-seventh of the nearly $4.2 trillion in global ETF assets are in funds tracking the benchmark U.S. equity index. The result of that is that passive funds now own an average of 17% of each component of the S&P 500, per Goldman’s data (the range is as little as 10%, and as much as 35%), whereas passive ownership was “a rounding error” a decade ago. Vanguard alone has at least a 5% stake in 468 components of the S&P 500, according to a June report in The Wall Street Journal, up from just three components in 2005. Read more: Investors flock to Vanguard funds, dump Goldman, Wells Fargo, and others Also: Vanguard calls for more diverse corporate boards, better climate-change disclosures As buying and selling index-funds essentially means buying and selling every component of the underlying index, “less trading is stemming from views on company fundamentals,” Goldman wrote. “Passive holders trade stock for different reasons than active managers, and at different frequencies. Passive’s decision to buy or sell stocks is often directed by broader fund flows and larger rebalances and not typically company specific fundamentals.” The investment bank calculated that for the average S&P 500 company, the share of its stock that might trade on fundamental views has dropped to 77% compared with 95% a decade ago. Those figures are based on a measure Goldman calls “passive-adjusted float,” or the number of shares outstanding minus both restricted holdings and passive holdings. “The impact on portfolio construction, alpha and trading are not fully appreciated by investors,” Fogertey wrote. Alpha refers to outperformance over a benchmark. Earlier this month, UBS analysts wrote that worries over the impact passive investing and ETFs would have on price discovery and liquidity were “misguided.” The firm noted that while passive funds comprise 46% of total ETF and mutual fund assets, they only accounted for 8% of the overall global equity market value. “If the investment landscape were limited to ETFs and mutual funds, it may warrant the current level of attention,” they wrote. “However, the investment landscape is far more expansive than just ETFs and mutual funds. There are hedge funds, separately managed accounts, and equities managed by other institutional investors and households that should factor into the analysis.” Read more: Relax, Wall Street: ETFs aren’t the root of all evil Related: Don’t blame ETFs or passive investors for high valuations Nonetheless, the impact of this factor depends on the specific security, as “passive ownership varies in both size and scope even within sectors.” Roughly 30% of the float of energy firm ONEOK

Jeffry Bartash,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 25, 2017 1:00 p.m. ET Economists see small Trump boost, still-low inflation, NABE says By The U.S. economy these days is like an old and reliable car. It’s not going to set any speed records but it’s also not going to break down and leave people stranded. That sums up the latest quarterly outlook by the nation’s most prominent business economists. They predict the U.S. will only grow a touch faster in 2018 — around 2.4% compared to an estimated 2.2% this year. Part of the fuel for faster growth in 2018 are expected tax reductions and spending increases by the Trump White House, according to the National Association of Business Economists. Yet economists also believe there’s just a one-in-four chance of a recession in the next two years, “A large majority of the panel views a near-term recession as highly unlikely,” said Kevin Swift, vice president elect of the NABE. The largely worry-free view of the economy stems from it’s mild rate of growth. The U.S. historically has grown more than 3% a year and at times even faster, but in the absence of such high rates of growth, dangerous imbalances apparently have failed to materialize. The slower rate of growth since the end of the 2007-2009 recession — the U.S. has expanded around 2% a year — also means the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates as high as it normally does. Past recessions have often been caused in part by the central bank raising the cost of borrowing quickly or aggressively. The Fed’s benchmark short-term interest rate, known as fed funds, now ranges from 1% to 1.25%. The NABE predicts the fed funds rate will rise to 2.125% by the end of 2018, but that’s still quite low by historical standards. The more immediate threats to the economy, NABE respondents said, could come from: • A war over free trade that leads to sharp restrictions: • A big reversal in surging U.S. stock markets; • Or tight immigration rules that limit the supply of labor in a time of growing manpower shortages. Inflation is not much of a danger, the NABE said. Economist predict annual prices increases will top out at no more than 1.9% in 2018, using the Fed’s preferred PCE inflation gauge. Also Read: Watch this inflation number to see where interest rates go next The now familiar constraints on the economy’s pace of growth are unlikely to ease much, the NABE said. Worker pay, business investment and productivity should all rise in 2018, but not at a rate strong enough to push U.S. growth above 3%. A lift could come from White House plans to cut taxes and improve public works . But economists are skeptical it will add a big boost — no more than 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points. The last time the U.S. grew at least 3% was in 2005. The current 12-year stretch of sub-3% growth is the longest on record. The flip side is, a recovery now nine years old could end up becoming the longest on record if the economy avoids a downturn in the next two years. The current expansion will turn 99 months old at the end of September. The record is 120 months from 1991 to 2001. ",U.S. economy likely to speed up in 2018 but not shatter any records - MarketWatch
Claudia Assis,09282017,MarketWatch,09212017,"Published: Sept 28, 2017 7:27 a.m. ET Analysts take a deep dive in Tesla’s cash burn By Investors have given Tesla Inc. a vote of confidence despite the Silicon Valley’s car maker billion-dollar cash burn, but a botched Model 3 roll-out could trigger a “moment of panic” in the market, leading to a possible share-price plunge and drying-up of liquidity. That’s from analysts at Bernstein, who took a deep dive into Tesla’s cash burn, which they estimate will have reached a cumulative $10.6 billion by the end of the year. “Bears argue that this level of capital spending is unprecedented and that Tesla will inevitably run out of cash. Meanwhile, bulls argue that Tesla’s spending is par for course among high-growth companies,” the Bernstein analysts said.

Read more: Tesla car population will explode within a few years, Morgan Stanley says They kept the equivalent of a neutral rating on Tesla, with a target price of $265, which would represent a downside around 23% from Wednesday prices. For Tesla, it will all come down to how well the company rolls out the Model 3, the electric sedan the company unveiled in late July. Model 3 deliveries are expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter. Tesla’s $60 billion valuation can be interpreted as a “vote of confidence from the market,” as long as Tesla’s near-team growth stays intact and investors believe profits will follow, the Bernstein analysts said. Investors “will continue to supply liquidity and overlook Tesla’s cash burn, just as they historically did” with Wal-Mart and Home Depot, they said. Related: Tesla will be a money-losing business until 2020, analyst says “However, even if we can disregard Tesla’s cash burn, we continue to worry about the company’s ability to deliver upon its long-term vision of profitability. Specifically, we worry about whether Tesla can successfully build the mass-market Model 3,” the analysts said. That means launching the sedan with good gross margins, good quality, and on time, with gross margins a key element as they set the baseline for Tesla’s future profitability, they said.
