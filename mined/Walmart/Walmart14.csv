,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"Wal-Mart confirmed the latest round of job cuts, which will involve “hundreds” of positions in its international and technology businesses, along with its Sam’s Club warehouse chain. “As we said in January, to fuel our growth and our investments we have to manage our costs and our capital decisions with discipline,” Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said. “This means we will continue to find ways to operate more efficiently and effectively.” He gave no details on the number of positions to be eliminated. The Wall Street Journal first reported the move on Tuesday. Wal-Mart’s job cuts started in 2016 when the retailer said it was eliminating 7,000 back-office positions and moving more of its workforce to the sales floor. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart cut more than a 1,000 corporate positions, mostly in its human resources department. ","

The Bank of Japan’s 2 percent inflation target remains elusive despite more than three years of massive money printing intended to spur economic activity. Aeon’s move adds to headaches for BOJ policymakers, who hoped a solid economic recovery will prompt firms to raise prices and help maintain the bank’s rosy price forecasts this month. “The BOJ’s view is that rising oil prices would help raise consumer prices this year, but these price cuts could be a headwind and might force the bank to lower its price outlook,” said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “We’re still not in a situation where price increases for a wide range of products are widely accepted.” Aeon said on Tuesday it will cut prices of 254 food items and daily necessities at around 400 outlets nationwide by the end of this month. That would follow price cuts on more than 140 items in March, a sign that many retailers consider discounts as the best way to lure households into spending. “For commoditised goods, it’s important to provide them as cheap as possible,” said Soichi Okazaki, who oversees Aeon’s retail outlets. Faced with weak consumption, other retailers are also embarking on price cuts to the dismay of the BOJ. Seven & i Holdings Co said it will slash prices for 61 daily necessities at its 7-Eleven outlets this month. Seiyu, a retailer under the arm of U.S. retailer Walmart , cut prices for more than 200 products from February. Retailers aren’t alone. Some mobile phone carriers have cut bills amid stiff price competition. “The BOJ probably believes underlying price moves are somewhat weaker than expected,” said one official familiar with the central bank’s thinking. The BOJ now projects core consumer inflation to hit 1.5 percent in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2018, and accelerate to 1.7 percent in fiscal 2018. The central bank will review its economic and price projections at its policy meeting on April 26-27. Japan has been mired in deflation for nearly two decades as households sit on a pile of cash on uncertainty over the outlook. The BOJ has deployed massive monetary stimulus since 2013 in hopes of changing the public’s perception that deflation will persist, with little success. Core consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in February from a year earlier. But a separate consumer price index that excludes the effect of volatile fresh food and energy costs rose just 0.1 percent in February, suggesting that weak consumption was preventing companies from raising prices of non-energy items.

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"WELLINGTON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - As China’s middle class develops its taste for imported food and drink, fresh produce suppliers in New Zealand and Australia are topping up nature’s bounty with anti-counterfeiting technology in a bid to protect their growing business from fakes. Suppliers of goods from fruit to wine and lamb are teaming up with makers of tracking systems, codes and powders to combat fakes that cost the global food business billions of dollars. As tech tools become cheaper, services like China’s popular WeChat smartphone app are also being deployed, offering consumers a free scanning ally to work out what’s on Chinese store shelves. “We see the Australian and New Zealand markets setting the tone for the rest of the world when it comes to integrity, safety and quality of food supply chains,” said Maggie Zhou, Alibaba’s Australia and New Zealand managing director, in comments published to mark its project launch at a late March Canberra ceremony. “It was a natural decision to pilot a programme here.” Dislodging counterfeit food, now a well established business of its own, presents no small challenge. Fraud costs the global food industry an estimated $40 billion a year, Alibaba said, citing research conducted by Michigan State University. In China, $1 billion in counterfeited goods was seized in 2014, according to the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition. “Categories that are faked so regularly are the (fresh produce) ones where New Zealand and Australia are strong,” said Mark Tanner, director of Shanghai-based China Skinny, a firm that advises Western businesses operating in China. But firms in Australia and New Zealand are prepared to go to increasing lengths to protect sales they rely on for growth. New Zealand’s total exports to China have quadrupled to NZ$12 billion ($8.62 billion) since 2007, most of them being food and beverage products. Australia agriculture exports to China were worth around A$10 billion ($7.67 billion) in 2016, double the amount five years earlier. Oritain charges customers NZ$300-700 per isotope test product, while for from around NZ$200 a month, Auckland-based Trust Codes supplies a machine-learning algorithm that can pull data from consumers’ phones in China when they scan a product’s encrypted Quick Response, or QR, packaging code. At Auckland manuka honey firm Oceania Natural ONL.NZ, Chief Executive Walker Zhong said he used his knowledge of Chinese consumers’ shopping, social media habits and liking of convenience in building Oceania’s own scanning system at a cost of NZ$1 million. Backed by a Chinese insurer, Oceania Natural’s tool revolves around WeChat - which Zhong knew Chinese consumers would already have on their smartphones - sending an alert if the scannable code on product has been used before, indicating in one step whether it’s genuine. “China consumers...they don’t like to use two steps or three steps to verify your product is genuine,” said Zhong. Pitfalls remain. Packaging can be tampered with, or even faked, and that many exports like meat are still  sent to China in bulk shipments without any packaging for consumers at all. “The only real way of knowing is testing the actual product,” said Sam Lind, operations director at Oritain. “We’re at the whim of counterfeit packaging just like anyone else.” ","

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump told a group of chief executives on Tuesday that his administration was revamping the Wall Street reform law known as Dodd-Frank and might eliminate the rules and replace them with “something else.” At the beginning of his administration, Trump ordered reviews of the major banking rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and last week he said officials were planning a “major haircut” for them. “For the bankers in the room, they’ll be very happy because we’re really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else,” Trump said on Tuesday. “That will be the minimum. But we’re doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some obviously, but getting rid of many,” he said. The White House is not unilaterally able to upend Dodd-Frank’s rules, almost all of which are implemented by independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve. A sweeping change to the law would require congressional action, though in some cases regulators may also have wiggle room to make changes through a formal rule-making process. In February, Trump issued an executive order requiring Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to consult with U.S. regulators and submit a report outlining a proposal for possible regulatory and legislative changes that would help fuel economic growth and promote American business interests. That report, due to be released in June, will likely serve as a blueprint for possible changes down the road. Congressional action on a Wall Street bill is not expected in the near term, as Congress focuses primarily on healthcare and tax reform. On Tuesday, House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling announced that he was planning to introduce a new draft by month’s end of sweeping legislation known as the “Financial CHOICE Act” that would give Dodd-Frank a major overhaul. The new draft of the bill would largely defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s supervisory powers and make the director removable at will. It would also revamp bank stress-testing rules and loosen securities regulations to help companies raise cash. The bill is likely to face an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats are expected to be resistant and a 60-vote threshold is needed to pass legislation. The business leaders are part of Trump’s “Strategy and Policy Forum” that last met with him in February. Trump also reiterated his criticism of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. “NAFTA is a disaster. It’s been a disaster from the day it was devised. And we’re going to have some very pleasant surprises for you on NAFTA, that I can tell you,” he said. ","

,04132017,Reuters,04062017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A sophisticated hacking group that pursues Chinese government interests broke into the website of a private U.S. trade group ahead of Thursday’s summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to researchers. The hackers left a malicious link on web pages where members of the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) register for upcoming meetings, according to researchers at Fidelis Cybersecurity and a person familiar with the trade group. The malicious link deployed a spying tool called Scanbox, which would have recorded the type and versions of software running on the computers of those exposed to it, said Fidelis researcher John Bambenek. Such reconnaissance is typically followed by new attacks using known flaws in the detected software, especially older versions. Scanbox has only been used by groups associated with the Chinese government, Fidelis said, and was recently seen on a political site aimed at Uyghurs, an ethnic minority under close government scrutiny in China. The breach was detected about five weeks ago by a NFTC director who is a customer of Fidelis, the security company said. Both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the NFTC were notified and the malicious link removed, and Fidelis said it had no evidence of NFTC members being infected. The FBI and the NFTC declined to comment. A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Bambenek said he believed the attack was classic espionage related to international trade talks, rather than a violation of a 2015 agreement between former U.S. President Barack Obama and Xi to end spying for commercial motives. The summit starting on Thursday is the first meeting between Xi and Trump, who blamed China on the campaign trail for the loss of many U.S. jobs and vowed to confront the country’s leaders on the matters of trade and currency manipulation. “I think it’s traditional espionage that happens ahead of any summit,” said Bambenek. “They would like to know what we, the Americans, really care about and use that for leverage.” Other security firms agreed that wholesale theft of U.S. intellectual property has not returned. FireEye researcher John Hultquist said heavy industries in Nordic countries have been hacked more often as Beijing switches priorities. “They are certainly taking those resources and pushing them to other places where they can still get away with this behavior,” Hultquist said.

Target Corporation (TGT) has experienced a particularly difficult start to the year after reporting an abysmal fourth quarter. Revenue fell 4.3% year over year to $20.69 billion, but a 100 basis point reduction in gross margins and a 30 basis point reduction in EBITDA margins were the market's biggest concerns. Analysts see the stock as caught between Walmart Stores Inc. (WMT) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN​) in terms of its strategy. On a technical level, Target shares remain near their 52-week lows after making an attempt to breakout higher earlier this month. Relative strength index readings suggest the stock is oversold at 35.63 while moving average convergence-divergence readings showed a modest bullish uptrend. Traders should watch for a breakout from these levels toward R1 resistance and the 50-day moving average at $59.16 if the stock can rebound from its lows. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY​) may have only fallen about 4% so far this year, but the stock also trades near its 52-week low of $37.28. Unlike Target, the company topped fourth quarter estimates with a 0.4% increase in comparable sales, although it expects EPS to fall at a low single-digit pace this year. The company was also boosted by a $1.7 billion share repurchase plan, of which, $171 million was spent during the fourth quarter. On a technical level, the stock remains near its 52-week lows and has experienced troubles breaking out from its 50-day moving average at $39.73. Traders should watch for a breakout from these levels with strong downside protection at prior lows and S1 support at $37.82. A breakout could send shares to R2 resistance and 200-day moving average levels at $42.38. Both RSI and MACD readings remain more neutral than Target, however.

Krystina Gustafson,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"Wal-Mart is eliminating hundreds of jobs in its latest attempt to cut costs as it invests in online. The layoffs span the company's international, technology and Sam's Club divisions. They follow Wal-Mart's decision to eliminate some 1,000 corporate positions earlier this year, including 200 in its e-commerce division. A spokesman for the retailer confirmed the job cuts to CNBC, which had originally been reported by Dow Jones. ""It's really a continuation of what we said back in January,"" Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove told CNBC. ""It's all part of managing our costs and our capital."" Indeed, the company said earlier this year that it was looking at its corporate head count for ways to operate more efficiently. That round of layoffs came a few months after Wal-Mart's investor day, when the retailer said it would invest more of its dollars into digital and slow its physical store growth. In total, Wal-Mart has eliminated roughly 18,000 jobs since early last year, Hargrove confirmed. However, many of the affected employees have been reassigned, he said. Roughly 6,000 of the 7,000 employees who had their back-office positions eliminated were reassigned, Hargrove said. Nearly 65 percent of the 10,000 of the store employees who lost their jobs due to last year's store closures were also retained, Hargrove said. And the company will hire 10,000 workers through new store openings, he said. The Wal-Mart news comes just a few days after a disappointing jobs report that was hurt by retail layoffs. Nearly 30,000 retail workers lost their jobs in March, leading to the worst two months for the industry's job creation since December 2009.

Krystina Gustafson,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"When it comes to where Americans like to shop, one thing is immediately clear: They're after value. According to new data from The NPD Group's Checkout Tracking Service, the largest percentage of Americans spent money at Walmart, McDonald's and Target last year. Some 95 percent of U.S. consumers shopped at one of Wal-Mart's 4,700 stores or on its website in 2016, according to NPD. It was followed by McDonald's at 89 percent and Target at 84 percent. That means more than 5 in 6 U.S. shoppers made a purchase at those chains. Among retailers, Dollar Tree recorded the biggest gains from 2015. It opened nearly 600 stores under that name last year. Chick-fil-A, which is also in expansion mode, was the biggest gainer among restaurants. Despite accounting for more than half of the growth in online spending last year, Amazon barely squeaked into the top 20. Some 42 percent of consumers spent money on Amazon, according to NPD. Amazon tends to attract a higher-income shopper than Wal-Mart, though the expansion of its subscription Prime program to a broader swath of the population has lowered its shoppers' average income. Wal-Mart's place at the top of the list shouldn't come as much of a surprise, given its U.S. division rang up an industry-leading $307.8 billion in revenue last year. NPD's data, collected in collaboration with Slice Intelligence, was pulled from the receipts of more than 4 million shoppers. ",Nearly every American spent money at Wal-Mart last year

Rice upgraded the stock to buy from hold and initiated a price target of $1,100 per share. Shares of Amazon closed Monday up over 1 percent at $907.04 per share. Over the next five years, Rice said he anticipates Amazon to grow its U.S. market share by 16 percent, which would make the company a majority player — dominating more than 50 percent — in retail. Needham estimated Amazon's 2016 market share in the American retail sector to be 34 percent, based on gross merchandise volume.

Krystina Gustafson,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"The retail industry's pain is being felt by its massive workforce. Barely a quarter into 2017, year-to-date store closings have already topped the historical high of 2008, a Credit Suisse report said Thursday. About 2,880 stores have closed year to date, compared with 1,153 at the same time last year. Since 60 percent of store closures are typically announced in the first five months of the year, Credit Suisse estimates there could be more than 8,640 store closings this year. The impact of these closures — a mixture of shrinking store fleets and Chapter 11 filings — is already trickling into the industry's nearly 16 million jobs. Almost 30,000 retail workers lost their jobs in March, and more than 60,000 jobs have been eliminated since January. March's report marked the worst two months for job creation in the retail industry since December 2009, according to the Bespoke Investment Group. The industry's shortfall contributed to the US creating only 98,000 jobs in March, compared with the 180,000 expected. Some 58,500 retail jobs were added from March 2016. ""It's an industry that's in real flux,"" John Challenger, CEO of the Challenger, Gray & Christmas outplacement firm, told CNBC. ""I do think that there are more cuts to come here, particularly in the department store group."" Indeed, the repercussions are far from over. With less than one-third of properties generating 70 percent of total mall value, Cowen predicts some 20 percent of malls will need to close or be repurposed over the next decade. That's even as occupancy rates in the country's malls stood just below a multidecade high at the end of 2016, according to Cowen. While many of the industry's struggles are the result of a shift to online shopping, massive overbuilding has also played a role. The number of U.S. malls has roughly quadrupled to 1,220 since 1970, while, the country's population has grown by less than half that amount over a comparable period. And as parts of that population flee towns with high unemployment or other economic or social shifts, the lowest-tier malls have become less relevant. Whatever the reason, retailers will need to respond to the steady decline in mall traffic, which has fallen every quarter except one since January 2014, according to Cowen. While stores are still a crucial piece of retail — accounting for some 90 percent of the industry's sales — Chen analyzed how many stores several major chains should close over five years' time. Here's what he concluded. Current U.S. store base: 1,013 Cowen estimated right-sized store range: 700 to 800 Percent of stores Cowen estimates could close: 26 percent Penney's said earlier this year that it would exit nearly 140 stores this spring. While Chen said he was encouraged by that action, he expects more closures will be necessary. Current U.S. store base: 666 Cowen estimated right-sized store range: 550 to 600 Percent of stores Cowen estimates could close: 14 percent Like J.C. Penney, Macy's has already taken steps to dramatically reduce its square footage. However, Chen expects the department store will need to close more locations. At the same time, Macy's has runway to grow the footprint of its off-price Backstage concept from seven standalone stores to at least 250, Chen said. Current U.S. store base: 118 Cowen estimated right-sized store range: 118 Percent of stores Cowen estimates could close: None Nordstrom did not succumb to the same overbuilding as many of its lower-price competitors. As a result, Chen expects the chain's store count to remain relatively steady. Meanwhile, he said the company could add another 90 or so stores for its off-price Rack concept. Current U.S. store base: 1,154 Cowen estimated right-sized store range: 1,000 to 1,100 Percent of stores Cowen estimates could close: 9 percent Although Kohl's has more than 1,000 shops, its low presence in malls means it needs to close a smaller percentage of them than some of its competitors, Chen said. CEO Kevin Mansell has said that instead of closing stores, his goal is to shrink Kohl's locations so it stays relevant in the markets where it operates. Current U.S. store base: 4,672 Cowen estimated right-sized store range: 4,850 to 5,050 Percent of stores Cowen estimates could open: 6 percent Wal-Mart has said that it will slow its physical store expansion to invest in digital. However, as it adds smaller stores to its fleet, Chen sees an opportunity for the world's largest retailer to continue growing. Current U.S. store base: 1,802 Cowen estimated right-sized store range: 1,875 to 1,975 Percent of stores Cowen estimates could open: 7 percent Target is opening smaller stores in an effort to reach more urban shoppers. While Chen said that could lead to the closure of some of its larger locations, he expects the chain's overall store count to tick higher. Current U.S. store base: 737 Cowen estimated right-sized store range: 600 to 650 Percent of stores Cowen estimates could close: 15 percent Gap's store closures are already underway. In addition to the contraction Chen expects to continue at the Gap brand, he said its struggling Banana Republic label could stand to lose 35 percent of its store base. Meanwhile, he sees more opportunity for Gap's Old Navy and Athleta brands. Current U.S. store base: 311 Cowen estimated right-sized store range: 175 to 225 Percent of stores Cowen estimates could close: 36 percent Abercrombie will close 60 U.S. stores this year and more will be on the chopping block as its leases expire. Between both its namesake and Hollister brands, Chen said the company could close 180 stores. Current U.S. store base: 812 Cowen estimated right-sized store range: 695 to 745 Percent of stores Cowen estimates could close: 11 percent Chen says fellow teen retailer American Eagle would benefit by shaving its store count. However, the company's intimates label, Aerie, could open some 200 more stores. Current U.S. store base: 324 Cowen estimated right-sized store range: 265 to 315 Percent of stores Cowen estimates could close: 10 percent Moderately priced women's apparel has been a tough spot in retail.

""Getting our community to 100 percent renewable energy is a big goal,'' Ted Wheeler, City of Portland Mayor, said in a statement. ""And while it is absolutely ambitious, it is a goal that we share with Nike, Hewlett Packard, Microsoft, Google, GM, Coca Cola, Johnson & Johnson, and Walmart. We have a responsibility to lead this effort in Oregon.'' Multnomah County is the most populous county in Oregon. Its Chair, Deborah Kafoury, welcomed the news. ""This is a pledge to our children's future,'' she said. ""100 percent renewables means a future with cleaner air, a stable climate and more jobs and economic opportunity.'' Portland is among a number of U.S. cities looking to embrace renewables. Over the weekend Chicago's Mayor, Rahm Emanuel, announced that city buildings there were to be powered by 100 percent renewable energy by 2025. ""By committing the energy used to power our public buildings to wind and solar energy, we are sending a clear signal that we remain committed to building a 21st century economy here in Chicago,"" Emanuel said. Back in Portland, Wheeler noted that tackling climate change would need to be a collaborative effort. ""We don't succeed addressing climate change by government action alone,'' he said. ""We need our whole community: government, businesses, organizations and households to work together to make a just transition to a 100 percent renewable future.''

Mark Fahey,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"The unemployment rate continues to fall and wages continue to rise. That's good news for workers, but not for the companies that are most reliant on labor. Retail companies like Wal-Mart, Staples or Gap are worth $50,000 to $100,000 in market capitalization for each person they employ. That's much lower than average, indicating that those companies would be hit harder by a dollar increase in wages. On the flip side, tech titans Netflix and Facebook are worth more than $10 million for each employee, a figure that suggests to analysts that wage increases will be less of a burden on the companies' bottom lines. Hourly wages rose by 2.7 percent year over year in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics report released Friday. That's slightly less of a gain than last month, but continues the general upward climb over the last few years. Those additional costs have hit wage-sensitive stocks more than others, especially consumer discretionary companies. In the Dow 30, companies like Wal-Mart, McDonald's, IBM, Home Depot, United Technologies and Caterpillar have a lower ratio indicating a higher exposure to wages. Companies like Apple, Exxon Mobil, Microsoft, Chevron, Johnson & Johnson and Chevron are worth almost five times more per employee. Public companies in real estate, energy, utilities, information technology and health care tend to have much higher ratios, while companies in consumer discretionary, consumer staples, industrials and materials are more labor-dependent, according to that metric. In a February research note, Thomas Lee of Fundstrat noted that without Amazon and Netflix, consumer discretionary stocks would be level with the market. Despite that classification, the two companies are far less exposed to wages than the average stock in that sector. If we look at just the top 50 most labor-exposed and 50 least exposed, it's clear that as a group the companies with lower ratios have underperformed, while the opposite group has pushed ahead of the overall index. The FANG companies — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet — as a group score remarkably well by this metric. They're worth five times more per employee than the S&P overall, and exceed even real estate investment trusts and the technology sector as a whole, according to Lee's research. As wage inflation heats up, Lee recommends looking for stocks with similar profiles, which he calls ""alternative FANGs"" — stocks with long-term positive returns and revenue growth and a market capitalization per employee ratio at the top of the stack. While wage inflation does tend to hit some sectors much harder than others, alternative FANGs can be found across every sector. Some of Lee's recommendations include T-Mobile, Stamps.com and Vail Resorts. ",These companies should be worried about wage growth

Mark Fahey,04132017,CNBC,04062017,"Blame it on the bunny. Every year, dozens of companies reference the Easter holiday in their earnings conference calls. From lingerie to soft drinks to airline tickets, companies across the S&P 500 expect to get a basketful of extra revenue from the holiday in late March or early April, but it doesn't always work out. Any company expecting a boost in the first quarter like we saw last year is counting its Easter eggs before they hatch. That's because the holiday doesn't fall in the same quarter every year — instead, it's on the first Sunday after the first full moon occurring on or after the vernal equinox. That means it could be any day between March 22 and April 25. This year, it's April 16. Last year was special, with the holiday falling in March, as it also did in 2013 and 2008. With Easter shifting back to April this year, first-quarter results are going to look weak when compared to last year. Executives will be sure to throw the Easter bunny under the bus. Some companies, like Hershey, mention Easter in nearly every earnings call they hold. That's not surprising, considering that Americans will buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of candy in that single week alone and Hershey owns some of the most popular Easter candy brands. Mondelez and the two largest toy companies are also quick to reference the holiday, along with airlines, hotels and major retailers. But other companies are more surprising. Disney has mentioned Easter more in the last 10 years than any company but Hershey, usually in reference to its theme parks. In its February earnings call, Disney executives said that the Easter shift will cost the company about $50 million in operating income in the next quarter. Guests apparently show up for Easter-themed events. Many people celebrate Easter with a big family dinner, so its inter-quarter shift can have a major impact on food manufacturers. McCormick & Co., for example, which makes spices and dried herbs, blamed the Easter shift for weak consumer sales. ""It does seem that there were some events that would have created a shift versus prior year, timing of Easter being one, weather being another,"" said president and CEO Lawrence Kurzius. ""Lent had a big impact on us. Our business has a very high index to Hispanic consumers, who are more Catholic, the later Easter made all of Lent fall outside of the quarter."" The timing of Easter can also signal the start of a strong sales season for some retailers. Tractor Supply, for example, noted that an earlier Easter is better for the company. ""Compared to some of the other retailers, that shift is less impactful,"" said CFO Anthony Crudele on a 2011 earnings call about the latest Easter since 1943. ""We do believe that it does signal to many of our customers that it's time to get out and work the fields and do their gardening, and the lawn season, so we think that there will be a clear acceleration as we hit that mark."" Alcohol purveyors Molson Coors and Constellation Brands also told investors that Easter could account for higher sales. Easter benefits for the company are stronger in Canada than in the U.S., and even stronger in Europe, because Canada generally has a three-day holiday and Europe has a four-day holiday, according to Molson Coors Global Vice President Dave Dunnewald. Constellation Brands CEO Robert Sands noted that Easter is a time for wine and liquor. ""That's really going to affect the numbers that you're going to be looking at on a short-term basis,"" he said of the shift from March to April on the company's earnings call this month. ""Especially on wine and spirits because it tends to be more of a wine and spirits drinking holiday than a beer drinking holiday."" Shoppers said they were more likely to buy their Easter gifts at discount stores than anywhere else, according to a  National Retail Federation survey, which explains the frequent mentions by companies like Dollar Tree, Dollar General and larger outlets like Target and Walmart. Not only is Easter good for alcohol, but consumers use the holiday as an excuse to stock up on other goods like underwear and cigarettes. Philip Morris International and Altria Group have mentioned the holiday in earnings reports, as have Hanesbrands and L Brands, owner of Victoria's Secret. Other companies that have mentioned Easter are Starbucks, Whole Foods, McDonald's, Thermo Fisher Scientific, News Corp and Coach. In the last 10 years, the holiday has been blamed by companies in every sector but one — telecommunications companies haven't made a peep. Despite all the airing of Easter grievances, the spending is small compared to other major holidays. Surveys of total spending by the National Retail Federation put that number at $18.4 billion for this season. That's somewhere between Mother's Day and Valentine's Day, and about three percent of what the winter holidays bring in. The ""back to school"" sales season brings in four times as much.

Brian Stoffel,04132017,Fool,04062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Tell me if you've heard that one over the past five years. As e-commerce grows stronger each year, investors are shunning traditional retailers in droves. Right? The image many of us have when thinking of big-box retailers. Image source: Getty Images Between the two, which is the better buy today? That's impossible to answer without a fully functioning crystal ball, but we'll do our best to dig deeper by approaching the question from three different angles. There is absolutely nothing more important to investigate than a company's sustainable competitive advantage -- often referred to as a ""moat."" If I could go back in time and talk to my beginning-investor-self, I would make this simple point abundantly clear. That's because a moat represents the special something that separates a company from its competition. Over a long enough time frame, it is what separates the winners from the losers, what keeps customers coming back again and again, and what keeps the competition at bay for years. Wal-Mart's key advantage has always been its scale. No one did a better job at focusing on small, rural communities, buying things in bulk, and lowering overhead costs better than the Walton family. That led to market-thumping returns for decades. But that moat has been mightily disrupted by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). With e-commerce taking more and more of the retail pie every year, the very thing that made Wal-Mart great -- its physical presence throughout the United States and the world -- has become its Achilles' heel. Customers value convenience above all else, and if packages can be delivered right to their front door, then that's what they'll go with. Lowe's has been able to avoid the Amazon bug by nature of its business. It simply isn't practical to deliver most home-furnishing and construction purchases right to your door. In addition, these purchases are usually so large and long-lasting that customers like to see, touch, and try out the things they're buying before handing over their credit card. Perhaps the best proxy for these trends is each store's comps -- or how much comparable-store sales increased in any given year. Comps: A 5-Year HistoryCreate column charts Data source: Company annual reports I simply think that Lowe's wins this battle because its business is more difficult to disrupt with e-commerce than Wal-Mart's. The company's solid position as the No. 2 home-furnishing store in America, the power of its brand, and its scale all offer a wider moat -- in my opinion -- than Wal-Mart has. Most investors, especially those who put their faith behind big-box brand names, like seeing cash returned to them. Of course, there's nothing wrong with that, as dividends are a key reason to invest in such names. But investors should also want their companies to hold on to a hefty stash of cash. That's because every company, no matter what, is going to face difficult economic times. Companies that approach such times with a healthy balance sheet have options: Buy back stock, make splashy acquisitions, or -- most importantly -- outspend rivals to gain market share. Debt-heavy companies are in the opposite scenario -- forced to narrow their focus to meet the demands of their debtors. Here's how Wal-Mart and Lowe's stack up in terms of financial fortitude, remembering that Wal-Mart is valued at over three times the size of Lowe's. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Wal-Mart $6.9 billion $42 billion $13.6 billion $20.9 billion Lowe's $1.0 billion $14.4 billion $3.1 billion $4.5 billion Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, SEC filings. Lowe's is by no means a slouch in this respect, but even after adjusting for the relative size of these companies, Wal-Mart comes out ahead. It has more cash, income, and free cash flow than Lowe's. This decision is very easy. Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Dividend FCF Payout Wal-Mart 17 11 3.8 2.8% 32% Lowe's 21 16 1.2 1.7% 25% Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. This is a much more difficult one to parse. Both companies offer very healthy dividends, but Wal-Mart's is noticeably bigger. Wal-Mart also appears to be cheaper on an earnings and free cash flow basis. But growth rates are much higher at Lowe's. In fact, according to the PEG ratio, Lowe's trades at an astounding 65% discount to Wal-Mart. That's why I'm calling this one a draw. So there you have it: It's a tie. If investors are more comforted by a strong balance sheet and very impressive cash flows, then Wal-Mart is the way to go. If, however, you want to know that a company is less susceptible to disruption in the form of e-commerce, I think Lowe's is a better bet. I always use a company's moat as a tiebreaker if the companies end in a draw, so my vote here would be with Lowe's, but I can't deny the strength of Wal-Mart's cash flow. ","

Rich Smith,04132017,Fool,04062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Up less than 5% in 12 months, shares of retail giant Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) have lagged the rest of the S&P 500 by more than 10 percentage points over the past year. But could happy days be here again? Two analysts think so. This morning, first tiny Telsey Advisory Group announced it is upgrading shares of Wal-Mart to outperform and raising its price target more than 12% to $82 a share. Shortly after, Jefferies & Co. chimed in with an endorsement of its own, reiterating its buy rating on Wal-Mart stock and doubling down on an $86 price target. Here are three things you need to know about that. Image source: Getty Images. Physical retail is a mess. Left and right, we see retail companies filing for bankruptcy (RadioShack, hhgreggg, Payless, and maybe soon Sears as well), or seeking to sell out to avoid it, as Staples is said to be doing. Amazon.com's low prices and ever-quicker delivery options are simply wreaking havoc among the brick-and-mortar crowd. But perversely, that could be good news for companies that manage to survive to pick up the pieces (and the market share) of their fallen rivals. According to Telsey Advisory Group, as the biggest physical retailer in the world, Wal-Mart Stores is one such likely survivor. StreetInsider.com notes that Telsey believes Wal-Mart is ""regaining dominance in the physical retail game"" both at its eponymous retail stores and at Sam's Club warehouse stores as well. This, says the analyst, should help Wal-Mart to grow its profits slightly this year (from $4.38 to $4.40 per share), and lead to even stronger profits growth in fiscal 2018, when Telsey sees Wal-Mart growing earnings 6.6% to $4.69 per share. At the same time, Jefferies argues that investors should not overlook Wal-Mart's substantial online operations. It notes that Wal-Mart's CEO claims the company enjoys ""a multiplier effect"" from selling goods online to folks who can pick up their purchases immediately at physical stores, while those same stores give otherwise online shoppers a chance to try on and try out goods, and buy them in person. Jefferies also believes that Wal-Mart's purchase of Jet.com will improve its online business with ""Smart Cart proprietary technology that adjusts prices in real time based on proximity of product to the shopper and shipping costs."" Both observations tend to support Telsey's finding that Wal-Mart is enjoying ""stronger sales ... in the digital market."" But can any support for all this be found in Wal-Mart's financials? Perhaps -- and perhaps not. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, even as its rivals are flailing, Wal-Mart's U.S. retail stores have enjoyed a combined 16.5% worth of revenue growth over the past five years, while Sam's Club sales are up 6.7%. Profits, however, are lower at both of these two big Wal-Mart businesses over the same period, with the company earning less money from its retail stores -- and its wholesale stores as well -- last year than it did in 2012. Last year alone, total operating profits at Wal-Mart dipped more than 5%, even as sales continued to grow. This may be the cost of doing business in the U.S. (or even remaining in business) for Wal-Mart. Everywhere you look, one competitor (Amazon.com) continues to gain market share even as it becomes more and more profitable, while others (Staples, for example) struggle and look for a buyout, and still others (Payless most recently, and soon, perhaps, Sears) simply throw in the towel go out of business. Yes, Wal-Mart survives -- but is simply surviving a good enough reason to own Wal-Mart stock? I'm not so sure it is. Valued on P/E, Wal-Mart stock currently costs 16.6 times trailing earnings. Even were it earning today what Telsey says it might earn two years from now, the stock's P/E ratio would still be 15.5, which seems a mite expensive for a company growing profits not at all today, maybe a modicum next year, and only 6.6% the year after that. When you get right down to it, even if Telsey is right about Wal-Mart being a survivor, and even if Jefferies is right, too, the stock still doesn't look cheap enough to buy. ","

Daniel B. Kline,04132017,Fool,04062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) Sam's Club has generally followed the same path as its closest competitor, Costco (NASDAQ: COST), when it comes to e-commerce. Both chains have websites, but neither has focused on using its site to drive sales until fairly recently. That has been reflected in the slow e-commerce growth Sam's Club has delivered compared to many pure-digital and even traditional retailers. The warehouse club saw its e-commerce sales contribute roughly 0.8% to comparable-store sales in its fiscal Q4 2017, the same growth it showed in the same quarter last year. Those small increases are reflective of the fact that Sam's Club, like Costco, has always sought to drive members to its stores to shop. The chain has done that by offering a low-cost food court, an ever-changing array of merchandise, product sampling, and of course, low prices. In recent quarters, though, especially over the holiday season, Sam's has followed Wal-Mart's lead and used its website to drive in-store traffic through offering a ""buy online, pickup in-store"" option while also making sure that doing that, and using the store for returns of online purchases, worked smoothly. Now, with the holiday season in the rearview mirror, Sam's Club has been trying a tactic that has worked for both pure-digital and brick-and-mortar retailers to push sales higher. The company has been offering a free collection of sample-size products on its website to any customer who placed an order in April. Sam's Club has traditionally offered samples in its stores. Image source: Wal-Mart. The warehouse club is using a model that online retailers like Birchbox have had success with. That pure-digital company sells $10 monthly subscriptions for which customers get sent five sample-size beauty products each month. The goal is to get people to use the items, like them, and purchase full-size products. That's a concept that physical retailers have used in-store, where small samples are often placed in your bag, and online, where digital customers actually get to pick which products they want to try. The Sam's Club offer, which was sold out as of April 10, used the same marketing tactic. Any member of the warehouse club who placed an order on its website received a ""Tastes & Sips Sampler"" full of snacks and drinks, along with an Easter-themed tote bag. It's not a revolutionary idea, but it's a simple way for Sam's Club to put products into its consumers' hands in order to get them to try them. In many ways it's a digital variant of what the warehouse clubs do in their stores, handing out free samples of everything from entrees to snacks and beverages in an effort to get customers to try, like, and buy the sampled product. By offering the free sample bags (which were also available for purchase for $14.53) Sam's Club has taken a concept familiar to its members and brought it into a digital age. Some consumers, much like they do in the stores, will simply be happy to get something for nothing and won't ever purchase any of the sampled items. Others, however, may find a new favorite. That could lead them back into a Sam's store or to samsclub.com to get more. This is not a revolutionary idea. Instead, it's a smart use of a website that will have multiple benefits for the chain. If the store continues this each month, it should drive digital traffic as consumers rush to buy something to get each month's offering before it has all been claimed. And giving away free stuff should please the recipients. Lastly, the samples themselves should drive sales for at least some of the products in the bags. That could produce an in-store or online sales volume increase, and it can also help the company make decisions about which of the included products to continue to stock as well as which ones would benefit from in-store sampling.

Over 11,000 consumers took part in the annual survey that ranks gas stations in two categories: (1)traditional gas stations and convenience stores and (2) grocery stores and big-box retailers with gas pumps. Returning to No. 1 in its category was good news for Costco, but not everything Market Force found was positive for the warehouse club chain. Price is important, but it's not the only factor when it comes to people deciding where to fill up. Image source: Getty Images. While Costco tops the grocery and big-box category, people still prefer to buy their gas at conventional stations, even though their prices tend to be higher (especially when you factor in loyalty rewards), according to Market Force. ""For their most recent trip to the pump, 71% of drivers visited a gas station compared to 29% who visited a grocer, warehouse club or big-box retailer,"" according to Market Force. ""Other key influencers in choosing a fueling stop are good lighting, fuel quality and payment options."" Among traditional gas stations, QuikTrip ranked as America's favorite, beating last year's winner, the similarly named Kwik Trip, which fell to fifth place. Cumberland Farms came in second, while Sheetz placed third, and Wawa was ranked fourth. While 77% of consumers ranked price as the most important factor when it comes to picking a place to fill up, that was not the only issue that concerned them. Security, fuel quality, easy ways to pay, and ease of entry/exit, were all named as contributing factors to making their gas station choice by over 40% of the 11,000 people surveyed. Costco may have taken the overall title in its category, but it did not receive top marks in all criteria. Market Force noted that the warehouse club chain ""led in most them,"" but tied with Safeway for last in ease of getting in and out and was alone at the bottom when it came to cleaning supply availability, a category that was considered important by less than 6% of those surveyed. Second place Sam's club scored top marks in ease of getting in and out, tied with its sister brand Wal-Mart, while the warehouse club chain ranked second on its own to Costco for fuel quality, price, pump speed, and appearance. Grocery and big-box chains had low overall marks when it came to speed of payment authorization, probably due to the extra time needed to process loyalty cards, according to Market Force. While Costco members may be joining the club in part because of its gas stations, fill-up stops do not generally lead to added visits to the actual stores, according to this data. ""Only 19% said they made an additional retail purchase when they last filled up at a grocer or big-box store, and, of those, most purchased from BJ's,"" wrote Market Force. However, cheaper gas clearly drives customer loyalty, especially when already low prices are enhanced with cash back from rewards credit cards or programs like Costco's Executive Membership, which offers 2% back on purchases up to $750 back a year. To hold onto its top rating, Costco may have to address the ease of getting into and out of its gas stations. That may be a challenge for existing locations since the warehouse club generally offers one-way traffic at its stations, which are often inside its parking lots rather than directly off the street. Still, this is a win for Costco, which has clearly overcome its shortcoming by offering low prices, and easy-to-use (if not easy to enter and exit) stations. Going forward, that should remain a reason consumers join or renew their memberships with the warehouse club. ","

Dubbed the ""Everything Store,"" Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is making that name truer and truer with each passing year. The company is dominating retail sectors ranging from books to electronics to sporting goods and even apparel.  And it's branching beyond retail into areas like video streaming and cloud computing to flex its muscles. But one component of the retail industry has eluded Amazon's grasp: groceries. With annual nationwide sales of groceries in the $800 billion range, it's easy to see why the company covets a piece of that market. Not only can fresh food bring a huge revenue stream into Amazon's fold, as it did with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), but the repetitive nature of grocery shopping also fits within Amazon's overall business model, which favors repeated small purchases over big-ticket one-time purchases like car parts or building materials. Recently, Amazon has intensified its efforts in the grocery space. Last year, the company expanded its AmazonFresh delivery program to a number of new cities and lowered the price from $299/year to $15/month, equal to a substantial drop. In December, it unveiled Amazon Go, a cashierless convenience store that uses cameras, sensors and other technology to charge customers based on what they take out of the store. The store was supposed to open to the public last week, but issues with the technology have delayed that opening. An AmazonFresh Pickup attendant puts groceries in a trunk. Source: Amazon Just last week, Amazon announced a new program called AmazonFresh Pickup at two locations in Seattle where customers will soon be able to order groceries on their phones and then retrieve them at a drive-thru kiosk. In an unrelated move, the company also shuttered its Quidsi subsidisary, the parent of Diapers.com, and said it would move its software development team to ""focus on building technology for AmazonFresh."" Clearly, grocery has become a key focus for Amazon's domestic business. The opportunity is huge, with nearly $1 trillion in annual sales, but the timing of its current push is curious -- Amazon moved slowly with Fresh after first introducing it in Seattle in 2007. The most logical explanation for Amazon's increased fixation on disrupting the supermarket business is that the company needs to continue growing its top line. Wall Street demands growth from nearly every publicly traded company, but Amazon, with its triple-digit P/E valuation and track record of 20% revenue growth or better in nearly every quarter in its history, needs to maintain that growth rate. Without it, the stock would likely plummet unless profits suddenly jumped. Amazon Prime, the $99/year membership program that offers free two-day shipping, video streaming, and a host of other benefits, has proven to be enormously popular, but with roughly half of American households signed up for the service, that growth engine may be fading as Amazon runs out of new customers to convert. The grocery sector is one of the few opportunities with the potential to replace it. With speedy delivery and tens of millions of items available on its website, Amazon has long aspired to be a one-shop for its customers. It's used Prime to further strengthen that bond, persuading customers to shop on Amazon before, or even without, considering any alternatives. But groceries has long been a weakness. Most Americans shop for fresh food multiple times a month, and losing out on that frequent purchase means shoppers depend on rivals like Wal-Mart and Costco, rather than just looking to Amazon for all their needs. Selling groceries also gives Amazon the potential to further bundle services to a membership model as it's tried to do with AmazonFresh, strengthening its competitive advantages. Of all of Amazon's ideas, Amazon Go with its breakthrough technology has the most potential to disrupt the industry, but the recent delays call its future into question. AmazonFresh Pickup seems to be little more than a clone of a service Wal-Mart and Kroger are already providing at hundreds of stores. And the delivery model, for a number of reasons, has just not taken off. Grocery will likely continue to be challenging for Amazon. In addition to the special requirements of handling and delivering perishable goods, consumers often have urgent needs for food, like picking up something for dinner on the way home, and can't always order in advance and wait for it. Consumers have also shown they like to handle and select the produce they buy, creating a need for an in-person visit to the supermarket. E-commerce is slowly influencing the industry as we see with the ""click-and-collect"" model, but without a significant innovation, Amazon is unlikely to see dramatic growth in the space. Its e-commerce strengths have historically been speed of delivery and selection, but those attributes simply aren't as valuable in the grocery industry. ","

The chart below shows why dilution from warrant sales like this are such a problem. Over the last decade, shares outstanding have grown 20 times, and they'll likely grow more in the future.

What Piper discovered was that 60% of respondents indicated that someone in their family belongs to Amazon Prime, which was up from 51% a year ago, and up 2 more percentage points sequentially from fall 2016. As explained in a note on StreetInsider.com yesterday, this implies that Amazon Prime is now subscribed to by somewhere in the mid- to high-60-million households range -- and the service has signed up about 10 million new households over the past year alone (about 20% year-over-year growth). Viewed in that light, Piper's decision to raise its price target on Amazon.com stock from $900 to $1,000 (an 11% increase) might even be called conservative. It certainly looks conservative in light of what Needham & Co. had to say this week. No sooner had Piper's report come out than Needham announced it is upgrading Amazon stock to buy and assigning a $1,100 price target to the stock. Like Piper, Needham cited Amazon Prime as a key factor in its upgrade. But Needham also said it sees Amazon becoming increasingly (and sustainably) dominant in mobile shopping, and in attracting third-party sellers to its marketplace. Currently, Needham says that Amazon.com owns a 34% share of the U.S. retail market -- nearly seven times larger than Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) does. (And recall that Wal-Mart stock itself won two endorsements from Wall Street analysts just last week.) But here's the really astounding part: According to Needham, over the next five years Amazon.com is likely to add 16 more percentage points of market share to its domain, giving Amazon.com a clean sweep of majority market share. That's a simply astounding claim. Within five years, one out of every two U.S. retail dollars could be spent on Amazon.com, instantly turning every other retailer in America into an afterthought. But what about the rest of the world? Simultaneously, back here at home, Needham expects Amazon to keep U.S. revenue growing by expanding its operations in the fields of web services, video streaming, grocery deliveries, home services, and even advertising. While not as big prizes as retail, each of these areas, says Needham, offers Amazon the prospect of ""multi-billion"" dollar total addressable markets. Combined, the opportunities should be multi-multi-billion. So how much are all of these opportunities worth? According to Piper Jaffray, $1,000 a share. According to Needham & Co., $1,100. But who is right? Here's how I look at it. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Amazon.com is currently generating $9.7 billion in positive free cash flow. Analysts who follow the stock -- fully as enthralled with it as are Piper and Needham -- expect to see the company grow that number about 46% annually over the next five years. So using a very basic rule of thumb, 46 times $9.7 billion tells me that $446 billion or so is probably a fair market capitalization for Amazon.com stock. And of course, right now, Amazon's market cap is just $427 billion. Accordingly, I'm broadly in agreement with the analysts who say that Amazon.com stock is undervalued today, and deserves a buy rating. This doesn't necessarily mean that I agree the stock is worth the $474 billion market cap that Piper is projecting, much less the $522 billion that Needham thinks the stock is worth. But would I rule either of those two possibilities out? No, I would not. ","

It shouldn't surprise anyone that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) makes most of its money from the iPhone. After its initial launch in mid-2007, the iPhone gradually replaced the iPod as Apple's biggest revenue driver. Between fiscal 2008 and 2016, Apple's iPhone shipments surged from 11.6 million to 211.9 million. During that period, Apple's annual revenue rose from $32.5 billion to $215.6 billion. The seminal iPhone helped Apple crush former mobile kings Nokia and BlackBerry, sparked a tech shift which turned Microsoft and Intel into underdogs, and made it the most valuable company in the world with a market cap of about $750 billion. Let's take a closer look at how important the iPhone is to Apple, and why its success is also a double-edged sword. Apple's iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. The annual launch of new iPhones remains one of the biggest tech events of the year for consumers, tech journalists, Wall Street analysts, and investors. But demand for the phones has clearly been slowing, due to competition from high-end Android rivals and the saturation of major markets like the U.S. and China. That's why last year's 211.9 million shipments actually represent an 8% decline from the 231.2 million units the company shipped in 2015. However, analysts believe that the tenth-anniversary iPhone 8 -- which will likely feature a glass body, edge-to-edge bezel-less OLED screen, and numerous hardware improvements -- will get growth back on track. Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski believes that iPhone shipments in calendar 2017 will reach 230 million. Last quarter, Apple's iPhone sales grew 5% annually and accounted for a whopping 69% of the company's top line. But it's not just the hardware revenue that matters to Apple -- the iPhone also represents the easiest way to lock users into iOS. After iPhone users start buying apps and media from the App Store and iTunes, they're less likely to leave behind their purchases by switching to Android devices. Image source: Apple. Apple clearly knows that its lock-in strategy works. That's why it boldly launched an ""upgrade"" program which lets people pay for their iPhones on a monthly basis for two years. That plan also gives customers AppleCare+ coverage, and works with all carriers since users are buying an unsubsidized device. After 12 months, users can switch to the latest iPhone to reset the payment process. It's highly unlikely that an Android OEM can launch a comparable ""forever"" plan, since Android users can easily swap between handset brands without losing all their Google Play content. That brand loyalty makes the iPhone an ideal launch pad for Apple's growing Services business, which includes the App Store, iTunes, iBooks, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and Apple Music. CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly stated that Apple plans to grow its software services to offset its gradual slowdown in iPhone sales. Apple's Services revenue rose 18% annually and accounted for 9% of its top line last quarter, but there have been a few speed bumps. Apple claims that Apple Pay's user base tripled over the past year, but Loup Venture recently claimed that just 13% of iPhone users have ever used the service. Wal-Mart still doesn't accept Apple Pay, and the service is still being trampled by Tencent's WePay and Alibaba's AliPay in China. Apple Music hit 20 million paid subscribers at the end of 2016, but questions about the platform's profit margins persist. It's easy to see why the iPhone is a double-edged sword. As long as iPhone sales are rising year-over-year, investors will be happy. But once interest in the iPhone finally fades, Apple needs new products and services to pick up the slack. Mac sales rose and iPad annual sales fell last quarter, but their combined sales only accounted for 16% of Apple's revenues. The Apple Watch still generates so little revenue that it's included in the Other Products category, along with iPods, Apple TV, and Beats audio devices. No one is sure what Apple's next big move will be -- whether it be new hardware products, media acquisitions, or connected cars -- but most investors agree that it needs to reduce the weight of the mighty iPhone on its top line.

"Tyler Crowe, Daniel Miller, and Rich Duprey",04132017,Fool,04062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett is well known for having a penchant for buying and holding stocks over a long time. It was Buffett who said that his favorite holding period is forever. That said, both he and his lieutenants at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) aren't completely averse to selling stocks when their investment thesis doesn't hold up. Since the Berkshire portfolio is typically a place where investors get ideas for their next stocks to buy, we asked three of our contributors to highlight a stock in the Berkshire Hathaway universe that might be the next stock it sells. Here's why they think Monsanto (NYSE:MON), Axalta Coating Systems (NYSE:AXTA), and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) might be next on the chopping block. Image source: Getty Images. Tyler Crowe (Monsanto): If it were any other time, Monsanto would be the kind of stock Buffett would like to hold on to for a long time. While agriculture is a cyclical industry, it is a business that is hard to disrupt, fills an essential need, and requires constant improvement as arable land continues to decline globally. Monsanto's seeds business and its new climate-modeling developments play a critical role in increasing yields, meaning farmers get more bang for their buck. That value proposition for farmers is what makes the company so profitable. For more than a decade, Monsanto has produced remarkable returns on equity. MON Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts. The thing that makes this situation unique, though, is that German company Bayer has offered to acquire Monsanto. The deal from Bayer is an all-cash offer. So, even those owners of Monsanto's stock today won't see their positions roll over into the combined company. Berkshire Hathaway did just pick up shares back in the fourth quarter of 2016, well after the Bayer announcement. At the time the investment was made, though, shares of Monsanto were selling well below the $128-per-share cash offer on the table. It would seem that, if this deal were to go through, Berkshire's purchase was a short-term one poised to take advantage of the market mispricing an asset. If the Bayer-Monsanto deal does fall through, perhaps this will be a stock Buffett hangs on to. After all, Bayer will have to pay a $2 billion break-up fee to Monsanto if the acquisition doesn't close. So, either Buffett is sitting on a stock that will pay a decent cash premium once it gets bought or he hangs on to a company with a decent injection of cash and a strong pipeline of products feeding a must-have industry. Sounds like a win-win situation for Berkshire. Daniel Miller (Axalta Coating Systems): When investors think of a typical stock Warren Buffett would buy, some of the factors that come to mind are consistent revenue growth, competitive advantages, and long-term catalysts. While it's tough to pick a bad stock within Buffett's portfolio, Axalta Coating Systems fails to achieve many of the aforementioned factors. Axalta is a coatings and finishing manufacturer focused on the automotive industry. The company provides a range of performance and transportation coatings for manufacturers of light and commercial vehicles and for collision repairs. The problem, though, is that the company's refinishing business -- which generates roughly 60% of its profits -- could be facing major risks over the long term. If we've learned anything in the automotive industry within the past 18 months, it's that autonomous vehicles are coming as fast as technology allows, with the futuristic goal of making car collisions, and thus Axalta's refinishing business, a thing of the past. That's just the long-term headwind, and unlike most companies that can boast of global growth stories through emerging markets, it's the opposite with Axalta, because as emerging markets become more developed, collision rates decline. On the other side of Axalta's business, supplying coatings for automakers' new light vehicles, the automakers have leverage with massive fleet sizes, which could pressure margins both sooner and later. Already, there are instances of automakers splitting what typically takes four coatings between multiple suppliers to drive prices lower and encourage competition. As you can see in the chart below, Axalta is far from a thriving growth story, and it faces serious secular headwinds over the long term -- this might be a stock Buffett soon decides isn't living up to his standards. AXTA data by YCharts. Rich Duprey (Wal-Mart): Maybe it's too easy to pick Wal-Mart since Warren Buffett is already selling down his stake, but with almost 1.4 million shares left in his portfolio valued at around $100 million, it might make sense for him to completely jettison the whole thing. Wal-Mart has performed appreciably better even as the Oracle was selling down his holdings, going from 13 million shares at the previous report to the current level (Buffett had amassed over 60 million shares back in 2014, but he's been selling it down ever since). In its last financial report, Wal-Mart beat analyst earnings expectations by a penny but fell short on revenue thanks to food price deflation and foreign currency exchange rates. Its e-commerce business also showed marked improvement, with sales rising 29%, but it's had to spend heavily on making acquisitions, such as its $3 billion purchase of Jet.com, to make a dent. And Amazon.com is still the heavyweight in this business. That's likely why Wal-Mart decided to eliminate shipping fees on orders over $35, down from $50. It is trying to compete more directly with the e-commerce king, but the moves are going to come at a cost to margins. It's not going to get any easier going forward, and it will only become more cutthroat as the two compete in more and more arenas. The e-tailer's new Amazon Cash program, allowing those without a bank card to use cash to shop on its site, is yet another assault on Wal-Mart's dominance. When it comes down to it, the Wal-Mart holding won't make a big difference in Buffett's porfolio one way or the other since it's gotten so small, but since it has diminished so much that it now comprises just 0.06% of the total, there doesn't seem to be much reason to hold on to the remainder.

    The Next Stock Warren Buffett Might Sell -- The Motley Fool

  "
Todd Campbell,04132017,Fool,04062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Rapid top- and bottom-line growth, bullet proof balance sheets, and innovation-first management teams make Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Celgene Corp.(NASDAQ:CELG) incredibly intriguing stocks to buy in portfolios. Amazon.com is dominating online retail, yet its sales would need to nearly triple to match bricks-and-mortar giant Wal-Mart Stores, and investments in innovation could help this company become much, much bigger in the coming decade. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. In the past year, Amazon's sales surged 27% higher to $136 billion, and this year, industry watchers think that Amazon's revenue could jump again to $165 billion. Driving the company's growth is CEO Jeff Bezos unwavering focus on new products and services that can make Amazon more meaningful to consumers. Thanks to Bezos vision, Amazon Prime has become a leading source for consumer entertainment, and Amazon's devices, including tablets and, more recently, virtual assistants, are providing increasingly more ways for Amazon to cozy up with consumers. As Amazon introduces increasingly more relevent products and solutions to consumers, and it discovers new ways to deliver those solutions more quickly, I believe its bottom-line will soar. Already, we're seeing evidence of this. Net income grew far more quickly than revenue last year, and as higher revenue is leveraged against fixed costs, that trend should continue. I'm not alone in that thinking. Industry watchers believe Amazon's sales will grow more than 20% in both 2017 and 2018, and they forecast EPS growth will double and triple their sales growth projections, respectively. AUTHOR'S CHART. Facebook can't have any more room for growth, can it? After all, you have to try pretty hard to find someone that's unfamiliar with the social media Goliath. Yet, CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks his company's monthly active users can more than double from about 2 billion today to 5 billion by 2030. Resting on Facebook's laurels won't help him hit that target, so Zuckerberg's committing big money to expanding Facebook's services into adjacent markets, such as messaging, video, search, and gaming. Zuckerberg's acquisition of Oculus VR, and rumors of forthcoming consumer electronics devices suggest that Facebook plans on riding tailwinds associated with next-generation technology too, including the Internet of Things. While those investments ingrain Facebook more deeply into current user's lives, big picture projects, such as delivering Wi-Fi to far flung regions of the world, introduce Facebook to new, heavily populated markets, like Africa. Funding all of these projects isn't cheap, but Facebook's massive size means it's got the financial firepower necessary. The company's sales surged 57% to $26.9 billion in 2016, and momentum has folks pegging revenue of $37.9 billion in 2017. Net income jumped an eye-popping 177% to $10.2 billion in 2016, and if the company hits sales targets this year, EPS could climb to $5.42 from $3.49 in 2016. Only time will tell if Facebook's user base grows the way Zuckerberg hopes it will, but given his track-record, a massive installed base already, and an increasingly attractive income statement, I'm betting on him, not against him. The biotech industry is notoriously hit and miss, but Celgene's track record has undeniably been dominated by the former. Celgene established itself as a biotech leader when it launched the multiple myeloma drug Revlimid in 2005, and today, Revlimid is one of the world's top selling drugs. It's the market-share leading first- and second-line therapy used in the indication, and research that's expanded its use to more patients translated into $7 billion in sales in 2016. Over the years, Celgene's successfully added not one, but three additional blockbusters to its product portfolio. In 2012, it launched the lung cancer and pancreatic cancer drug Abraxane, in 2013, it launched the third-line multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst, and in 2014, it launched the psoriasis drug Otezla. Last year, sales of those drugs totaled $973 million, $1.3 billion, and $1 billion, respectively. Soon, Celgene may be able to count two more drugs as top-sellers. Earlier this year, management reported results from a clinical trial of ozanimod in multiple sclerosis that were impressive, and the FDA is already reviewing a new leukemia drug -- enasidenib -- that Celgene co-developed with Agios. If ozanimod wins FDA approval next year, its arguably best-in-class safety could propel it to one billion dollars in sales quickly. Meanwhile, a decision on enasineb is expected on Aug. 30, and that means Celgene could add a new source of sales as soon as the third quarter of 2016. Given the company's R&D prowess (and its high-profile collaborations), it's not surprising that management's got high hopes for revenue and profit growth. This year, it's forecasting sales will climb 18% to at least $13 billion in 2016. It also thinks EPS will jump 21% to $7.10. That's impressive growth, but even more impressive is management's outlook for 2020. While regulatory rejections or trial failures could derail its forecast, it's targeting sales of over $21 billion and EPS of over $13 that year. With an outlook like that, it seems smart to be shareholder. ","

                                   finished down 1.14 points at 5,877.81. For the week, the Dow industrials declined less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 shed 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.6%. The Labor Department report showed that the U.S. created just 98,000 new jobs in March, marking the smallest gain in almost a year, as hiring cooled. Economists polled by MarketWatch had predicted a 185,000 increase in nonfarm jobs. “This is a disappointing jobs report coming in well below consensus,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Financial Partners. “The jobs numbers are historically lumpy, so it’s possible to look past this month, but it’s a negative sign to be certain and should temper some of the risk-on trades that have tried to resume this week after a month of caution in March.” While the jobs report may have disappointed some, many people had been expecting a slowdown with severe March weather on the East Coast being a legitimate reason for retail and construction hiring to slow, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group, in an interview. “It wasn’t exactly a disaster, maybe it backs off some of the ultrahawks [on the Fed] and we only get two rate hikes this year,” Stone said. Plus, with earnings season ramping up in the coming weeks, many investors want to sit tight until there’s more clarity, he said. In a bright spot for the labor report, however, the unemployment rate fell to 4.5% from 4.7%—the lowest level in almost 10 years. Meanwhile, the military action late Thursday put investors on edge on a day already loaded with market-sensitive events, including President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping’s closely followed diplomatic talks at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Given the number of geopolitical factors, it’s surprise the market was so calm, said Randy Frederick, managing director at Schwab Center for Financial Research.

Market watchers may be betting that the U.S. strike against Syria will be limited and predictable and that it won’t lead to conflict with Syrian ally Russia. “We have been in conflict with somebody since 9/11, so the market has become less reactive to those moves, especially if it doesn’t affect oil,” PNC’s Stone said.

Sara Sjolin,04132017,MarketWatch,04062017,"Published: Apr 6, 2017 6:25 a.m. ET Hint: It’s all about inflation By Stop the guesswork — there’s no longer need to speculate about where European Central Bank interest rates are going, after President Mario Draghi revealed his checklist for future policy moves. In a speech at the Watchers Conference in Frankfurt on Thursday, the ECB chief downplayed expectations of any imminent type of tightening. He reminded people that he and his fellow policy makers look at four criteria before even considering an end to the central bank’s ultra-accommodative policy stance. First: Headline inflation is on a path to levels below, but close to 2% over a meaningful medium-term horizon. Second: Inflation will be durable and stabilize around those levels with sufficient confidence. Third: Inflation will be self-sustained, meaning it will maintain its trajectory even with diminishing support from monetary policy. Finally: It goes without saying that in each case, the relevant metric is eurozone inflation, not the inflation rates of any individual country. Draghi admitted the first goal had almost been met, but said the second still is off target. “For us to be confident in the second criterion — that inflation is not just converging towards our aim, but stabilizing around it — we would need to see signs of such pressures building. But there is so far scant evidence of this,” he said. Over the past month, there’s been lots of chatter about when the ECB would take its deposit rate out of negative territory. That came after Draghi’s somewhat hawkish comments at the bank’s March meeting, as well as after a rapid rise in eurozone inflation to 2% in February. Additionally, there have been calls from German officials for the ECB to tighten its monetary policy, after inflation in that country rose at the fastest pace in four years in February. Against that backdrop, investors started to price in a more than 50% probability of a rate hike by December, up from just 11% about two months ago, according to Bloomberg. Read: Euro bulls just got a wake-up call from the ECB However, since the ECB’s March meeting, eurozone inflation has slipped back to 1.5% and several ECB officials have sought to dampen speculation that rates are about to go up in 2017. “We have not yet seen sufficient evidence to materially alter our assessment of the inflation outlook,” Draghi said in the speech on Thursday. “Hence a reassessment of the current monetary policy stance is not warranted at this stage.” According to the ECB’s current forward guidance, interest rates are expected to “remain at present or lower levels” well past the end of its quantitative-easing program. The €60-billion-a-month bond-buying scheme is slated to run until the end of the year, but economists expect it to be extended into 2018.

,04202017,Reuters,04132017,"(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s bid for clothing retailer Bonobos, which surfaced last week, is the latest step in the company’s attempt to recover lost ground against Amazon.com Inc and others in the rapidly growing online fashion world, analysts and retail consultants said. If Wal-Mart succeeds, the move into fashion also would advance its effort to access younger, millennial customers who usually do not shop on Walmart.com. A Bonobos deal would mark the company’s fourth acquisition of a small online clothing-and-accessories brand since the start of 2017. The bid was first reported by Recode on Friday. Wal-Mart has declined to comment. The move is in keeping with an online strategy led by Marc Lore, the founder and former chief executive of internet retailer Jet.com, who took over Wal-Mart’s e-commerce business in August, after Wal-Mart paid $3.3 billion for Jet. Wal-Mart is the world’s largest brick-and-mortar clothing retailer, with 2016 sales exceeding $23 billion, according to retail think tank Fung Global Retail & Technology. But despite its traditional muscle, the Bentonville, Arkansas, company has been unable to replicate that success online. It has not only struggled to attract the type of affluent young consumers who tend to shop for clothes online but has also faced challenges in persuading well-known apparel brands to sell on its website. Wal-Mart’s online sales account for only about 3 percent of total sales, the company has said. In the second half of this year, it is targeting online sales growth of 20 to 30 percent. In its push for a bigger online presence, Wal-Mart so far has bought ShoeBuy, which specializes in footwear and apparel; Moosejaw, which sells outdoor wear; and ModCloth, an online seller of women’s clothing. In March, Lore said at an industry event that Wal-Mart will make more acquisitions to expand its business rapidly.     Jan Rogers Kniffen, chief executive of retail consultancy J. Rogers Kniffen WWE, said the deals could begin to add up, though so far they are too small to have a material impact on Wal-Mart. “It gives them a totally separate vehicle to grow with fashion brands and to own fashion brands,” he said.    Wal-Mart’s move also aims to stem the loss of market share to Amazon in the highly competitive fashion sector. Amazon leads the U.S. online clothing and footwear market with sales of $13 billion in 2016, up $9 billion from five years ago. It is expected to triple its share of the U.S. apparel market over the next four years, according to data from Euromonitor and Forrester. Macy’s Inc, Nordstrom Inc, Gap Inc, Kohl’s Corp, L Brands Inc and J.C. Penney Co Inc also compete in the segment. Howard Davidowitz, chairman of retail consulting and investment banking firm Davidowitz & Associates Inc, said Wal-Mart’s prior efforts to buy market share through acquisitions have not succeeded. “They have been involved with this strategy for a long time. How has it done? Terribly,” Davidowitz said. “Marc Lore has continued this strategy.”   Lore did not respond to a request for comment. Wal-Mart has been investing in e-commerce for the past 15 years, but it still lags far behind Amazon. In the five years before the Jet.com deal, Wal-Mart acquired more than 15 start-ups. The company has not disclosed what it spent on each deal, but said in January it had spent a total of $3.1 billion on e-commerce and digital projects in its prior four fiscal years. ","

,04202017,Reuters,04132017,"RUSTON, Louisiana (Reuters) - Mini motorcycle and go-kart maker Monster Moto made a big bet on U.S. manufacturing by moving assembly to this Louisiana town in 2016 from China. But it will be a long ride before it can stamp its products “Made in USA.” The loss of nearly one out four U.S. factories in the last two decades means parts for its bike frames and engines must be purchased in China, where the manufacturing supply chain moved years ago. “There’s just no way to source parts in America right now,” said Monster Moto Chief Executive Alex Keechle during a tour of the company’s assembly plant. “But by planting the flag here, we believe suppliers will follow.” Monster Moto’s experience is an example of the obstacles American companies face as they, along with President Donald Trump, try to rebuild American manufacturing. U.S. automakers and their suppliers, for example, have already invested billions in plants abroad and would face an expensive and time-consuming transition to buy thousands of American-made parts if President Trump’s proposed “border tax” on imported goods were to become law. When companies reshore assembly to U.S. soil – in Monster Moto’s case that took two years to find a location and negotiate support from local and state officials – they are betting their demand will create a local supply chain that currently does not exist. Their experience has shown Americans’ patriotic shopping habits have limits, namely when it comes to price. Take Monster Moto’s bikes, which sell for between $249 to $749. Keechle, the CEO, says he can’t raise those prices for fear his price sensitive prospective customers will turn to less expensive rivals made in China. “Consumers won’t give you a free pass just because you put ‘Made in USA’ on the box,” Keechle says. “You have to remain price competitive.” Keeping a sharp eye on labor costs in their factory is one thing these U.S. manufactures can control. They see replacing primarily lower-skilled workers on the assembly line with robots on American factory floors as the only way to produce here in a financially viable, cost-competitive way. It’s a trend that runs against the narrative candidate Donald Trump used to win the U.S. Presidency. Since taking office, Trump has continued promises to resurrect U.S. manufacturing’s bygone glory days and bring back millions of jobs. On March 31, Trump directed his administration to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules in a bid to end to the “theft of American prosperity.” But it’s more complicated on the ground for companies like Monster Moto. “It’s not something that happens overnight,” he said. A White House official said that the Trump administration’s efforts to encourage manufacturers to reshore production will be focused on cutting regulations and programs to provide new skills to manufacturing workers. “We recognize that the manufacturing jobs that come back to America might not all look like the ones that left,” a White House official said, “and we are taking steps to ensure that the American workforce is ready for that.”  In Monster Moto’s cavernous warehouse in Ruston, boxes of imported parts that are delivered at one end then become bikes on a short but industrious assembly line of a few dozen workers. A solitary, long-bearded worker by the name of Billy Mahaffey fires up the bikes to test their engine and brakes before a small group of workers puts them in boxes declaring: “Assembled in the USA.” Helped by that label, Monster Moto has experienced a recent boom in demand from major customers that include Wal-Mart. The company expects to double production to 80,000 units and increase its assembly workers - who make $13 to $15 an hour - to 100 from around 40 in 2017. The most likely components Monster Moto could produce in America first are black, welded-metal frames for bikes and go-karts, but they would have to automate production because human welders would be too expensive. “We can’t just blow up our cost structure,” said Monster Moto President Rick Sukkar. “The only way to make it work in America is with robotics.” When asked about shifting production to the United States from Mexico, Massaro said depending on what happens to trade rules “it would have to be much more of the sort of the automated type manufacturing operations just given… the labor differential there.” That trend is already showing up in data compiled by Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think-tank. According to senior economist Rob Scott, not only did America lose 85,000 factories, or 23.5 percent of the total, from 1997 to 2014, but the average number of workers in a U.S. factory declined 14 percent to 44 in 2014 from 1997. According to Scott, much of the decline in workers was due to automation. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2oaz5mD “We’re going to see more automation in this country because it makes good sense economically for every company,” said Hal Sirkin, a managing director at the Boston Consulting Group. “You can spend a lot of time bemoaning it, but that’s not going to change.” Manufacturers say automated production requires fewer, but more skilled workers such as robot programmers and operators. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) estimates because of the “skills gap” there are 350,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs today in a sector that employs over 12 million people. In Ruston, Mayor Ronny Walker bet on Monster Moto by guaranteeing the company’s lease because he wants to diversify the city’s economy, and envisions suppliers setting up alongside Monster Moto’s assembly plant. “Could it take a long time to bring manufacturing back here? Sure,” he says. “But you have to start somewhere.” ","

Rakesh Sharma,04202017,Investopedia,04132017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs By buying a stake in Plug Power Inc. (PLUG), a company that makes alternative energy technology for materials handling equipment, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) appears to be following the playbook it previously used to enter cloud computing. According to the deal's terms, Amazon will buy $70 million worth of Plug Power's hydrogen fuel cells and other technology this year for use in its fulfillment network, with further potential sales of as much as $600 million. The agreement also allows the Seattle-based ecommerce giant to eventually purchase up to a 23 percent stake in Latham, N.Y.-based Plug Power. (See also: Plug Power Skyrockets on Interest From Amazon.) An article in online publication Greentech Media outlines three compelling reasons for Amazon to invest in Plug Power. First, it will help free up storage space at Amazon's warehouses. This is because Plug Power's product does not require cumbersome battery infrastructure for recharging and can allow the company to recover as much as 10 percent of warehousing space. Second, it could lead to increased productivity at Amazon's warehouses because Plug Power's fuel cells last longer compared with lead acid batteries and do not require frequent replacements during operations. They can also operate in freezing temperatures. Third, the operational simplicity of hydrogen cell recharging will ensure that forklifts use fewer resources and people, leading to an overall savings on the company's balance sheet. (See also: Plug Power Ships First ProGen Fuel-Cell Engines.) According to Greentech Media, Amazon is employing a strategy similar to the one it followed to leap ahead in cloud computing. By becoming a first-mover in adopting fuel cell-powered forklifts, the company will control the levers of future technology. Competitors, such as The Kroger Co. (KR), will have no option but to follow Amazon's lead or purchase services from it, thanks to Amazon's stake in Plug Power. Amazon competitor Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) has been an avid and frequent user of fuel cell-operated forklifts since at least 2006. In fact, Plug Power's shares have bumped up in the past due to large orders placed by the Arkansas-based retailer. However, Wal-mart has not shown much interest in acquiring a stake or purchasing Plug Power outright. Kroger and Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) also own and operate more fuel cell forklifts than Amazon. (See also: Walmart Stock: Analyzing 5 Key Suppliers.) Amazon's move may also be related to its growing interest in managing supply chain and warehousing operations. As the Seattle company’s operational footprint and volume has increased, the complexity of its operations has multiplied. The market for fuel cell-operated forklifts is expected to multiply in the future, and a stake in a leading provider will all but guarantee a supply to Amazon. (See also: Unwrapping Amazon's Moves in Logistics.)

Krystina Gustafson,04202017,CNBC,04132017,"By the time August rolls around, there will be about 350 fewer J.C. Penney, Macy's, Sears and Kmart stores at shopping centers across the U.S. For some of those properties, the loss of these stores could be the final blow that puts them out of business. Yet in other instances, the vacancies will provide landlords an opportunity to reinvent the space for more in-demand tenants — allowing them to charge a higher rent, to boot. From growing retail chains to dining and entertainment, here are some of the tenants who are filling in malls' empty anchor space, according to a new report by JLL. Started in Long Beach, California, back in 1996, Yard House is known for its massive draft beer selection. The restaurant has roughly 70 locations. As part of its expansion, the company has leased space in a former Sears location at the King of Prussia mall near Philadelphia. It opened last month. As seen with Yard House, dining at the mall is no longer limited to a dowdy food court. New York hot spot Nobu is bringing its latest high-end sushi joint to a former Saks Fifth Avenue location at The Galleria in Houston. It is scheduled to open this fall. Once limited to open-air shopping centers, grocers like Wegmans have slowly been creeping into vacant mall spaces. The frequent visits grocery stores generate make them attractive to landlords, and shoppers benefit by being able to consolidate their trips. Wegmans will take over a former J.C. Penney store at Boston's Natick Mall in 2018. As consumers spend more of their discretionary income on experiences, landlords are increasingly recruiting tenants who provide some form of entertainment. Punch Bowl Social is an adult gaming center that brings billiards, darts and bowling together with food and cocktails. Punch Bowl opened in a former Nordstrom space at Indianapolis' Circle Centre Mall last year. The fun isn't limited to adults. KidZania, a recreational learning center that lets children roleplay as a firefighter or chef, will open its first U.S. location next year. Making its debut at the Stonebriar Centre in Frisco, Texas, KidZania will fill a custom new space. Dave & Buster's is another entertainment concept infusing a dose of fun in America's malls. It has opened three locations in former Sears stores, according to JLL. Though a large chunk of vacant space is being filled by nontraditional tenants, up-and-coming retailers are also stepping in. Irish fast-fashion chain Primark is one example, having taken up a portion of the space formerly occupied by Sears at several Northeast malls. Ulta's expansion plan will bring 100 more of its beauty shops to the U.S. this year. This fall, it will take over a portion of a former Sears at College Mall, in Bloomington, Indiana.

Mark Fahey,04202017,CNBC,04132017,"Blame it on the bunny. Every year, dozens of companies reference the Easter holiday in their earnings conference calls. From lingerie to soft drinks to airline tickets, companies across the S&P 500 expect to get a basketful of extra revenue from the holiday in late March or early April, but it doesn't always work out. Any company expecting a boost in the first quarter like we saw last year is counting its Easter eggs before they hatch. That's because the holiday doesn't fall in the same quarter every year — instead, it's on the first Sunday after the first full moon occurring on or after the vernal equinox. That means it could be any day between March 22 and April 25. This year, it's April 16. Last year was special, with the holiday falling in March, as it also did in 2013 and 2008. With Easter shifting back to April this year, first-quarter results are going to look weak when compared to last year. Executives will be sure to throw the Easter bunny under the bus. Some companies, like Hershey, mention Easter in nearly every earnings call they hold. That's not surprising, considering that Americans will buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of candy in that single week alone and Hershey owns some of the most popular Easter candy brands. Mondelez and the two largest toy companies are also quick to reference the holiday, along with airlines, hotels and major retailers. But other companies are more surprising. Disney has mentioned Easter more in the last 10 years than any company but Hershey, usually in reference to its theme parks. In its February earnings call, Disney executives said that the Easter shift will cost the company about $50 million in operating income in the next quarter. Guests apparently show up for Easter-themed events. Many people celebrate Easter with a big family dinner, so its inter-quarter shift can have a major impact on food manufacturers. McCormick & Co., for example, which makes spices and dried herbs, blamed the Easter shift for weak consumer sales. ""It does seem that there were some events that would have created a shift versus prior year, timing of Easter being one, weather being another,"" said president and CEO Lawrence Kurzius. ""Lent had a big impact on us. Our business has a very high index to Hispanic consumers, who are more Catholic, the later Easter made all of Lent fall outside of the quarter."" The timing of Easter can also signal the start of a strong sales season for some retailers. Tractor Supply, for example, noted that an earlier Easter is better for the company. ""Compared to some of the other retailers, that shift is less impactful,"" said CFO Anthony Crudele on a 2011 earnings call about the latest Easter since 1943. ""We do believe that it does signal to many of our customers that it's time to get out and work the fields and do their gardening, and the lawn season, so we think that there will be a clear acceleration as we hit that mark."" Alcohol purveyors Molson Coors and Constellation Brands also told investors that Easter could account for higher sales. Easter benefits for the company are stronger in Canada than in the U.S., and even stronger in Europe, because Canada generally has a three-day holiday and Europe has a four-day holiday, according to Molson Coors Global Vice President Dave Dunnewald. Constellation Brands CEO Robert Sands noted that Easter is a time for wine and liquor. ""That's really going to affect the numbers that you're going to be looking at on a short-term basis,"" he said of the shift from March to April on the company's earnings call this month. ""Especially on wine and spirits because it tends to be more of a wine and spirits drinking holiday than a beer drinking holiday."" Shoppers said they were more likely to buy their Easter gifts at discount stores than anywhere else, according to a  National Retail Federation survey, which explains the frequent mentions by companies like Dollar Tree, Dollar General and larger outlets like Target and Walmart. Not only is Easter good for alcohol, but consumers use the holiday as an excuse to stock up on other goods like underwear and cigarettes. Philip Morris International and Altria Group have mentioned the holiday in earnings reports, as have Hanesbrands and L Brands, owner of Victoria's Secret. Other companies that have mentioned Easter are Starbucks, Whole Foods, McDonald's, Thermo Fisher Scientific, News Corp and Coach. In the last 10 years, the holiday has been blamed by companies in every sector but one — telecommunications companies haven't made a peep. Despite all the airing of Easter grievances, the spending is small compared to other major holidays. Surveys of total spending by the National Retail Federation put that number at $18.4 billion for this season. That's somewhere between Mother's Day and Valentine's Day, and about three percent of what the winter holidays bring in. The ""back to school"" sales season brings in four times as much.

Alex Rosenberg,04202017,CNBC,04132017,"Is volatility about to spike? It's a question frequently asked by anxious investors in times of relative calm. Now there's a new answer. In a recent paper entitled ""Forecasting a Volatility Tsunami"" that was awarded the 2017 Charles H. Dow Award from the Market Technicians Association, Andrew Thrasher argues that it's not low volatility that presages a volatility spike, but a consistent level of volatility. Thrasher, a portfolio manager at the Indianapolis-based Financial Enhancement Group, explained in a interview Monday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" that while ""it's commonly reported that whenever the volatility index gets to a really low level like we've seen this year, it will often mean revert and spike higher ... I thought that seemed way too easy.""  ""So I began to look at the market and look for times of commonality in the VIX before these spikes, and what I found is that when the volatility index contracts, when it has a very narrow range, that is often an environment that predicts large spikes in the 'fear index,'"" he added. Whether the CBOE volatility index is set to rise can be an important question for traders and investors focused on short term investments. The VIX uses the prices of S&P 500 options to predict the magnitude of market moves over the next 30 sessions. Since options are more commonly used to hedge against downside than to speculate on upside, the VIX tends to spike as the market is dropping. Avoiding stocks when the VIX is about to spike, then, could prove highly beneficial. When it comes to predicting these spikes, Thrasher's specific finding is that when the VIX is at a low level, its average peak over the next three weeks is a 24.9 percent rise, while its average trough is a 9.3 percent fall. Meanwhile, when the VIX is trading in a narrow range, its average peak represents a 34.3 percent rise, while its average trough is a 8.7 percent fall. That is to say, the VIX tends to spike higher and fall less after it has been trading in a narrow range than after it has been trading at a low level. Adding to this analysis, Thrasher also examines the VVIX, which is the volatility index of the volatility index (and so measures the expected magnitude of future moves in the VIX). He notes in his paper that ""it appears the combination of the VIX and VVIX are timelier in their production of a signal before spikes within the Volatility Index."" Some caveats may be in order. The sheer volume of market data frequently makes it possible to find spurious signals purely by accident. This is particularly true when second-order data, such as dispersion levels, are added. In general, financial theory would suggest that decisions made purely on public data about price moves should not reliably lead to outperformance. And ironically, Thrasher's indicator actually threw off a false signal just this year. Over the past three months, the VIX saw ""very narrow dispersion,"" which was ""actually one of the longest periods of seeing such a low trading range in several years,"" Thrasher wrote to CNBC. ""However the recent rise in the VIX in April has ended the streak and we are now no longer seeing that environment that precedes spikes."" Still, those who are anxious about a potential ""tsunami"" might indeed do well to heed Thrasher's advice and pay more attention to the volatility of volatility rather than the VIX's absolute level.

"Lewis Braham, special to CNBC.com",04202017,CNBC,04132017,"Stock pickers with seven-figure salaries may view President Donald Trump's opposition to the Department of Labor's new fiduciary rule as a saving grace. In reality, it's just a stay of execution. In the past decade, there's been a seismic shift from active to passive management, i.e., from mutual funds run by ersatz Peter Lynches to index funds and ETFs that track the market. The fiduciary rule, which President Obama first advocated for in February of 2015 and the DOL formally proposed on April 14, 2016, accelerated that trend. If implemented, it would impose ""impartial conduct"" standards on financial advisors requiring they always act in their clients' best interests. That means finding the best investment fund possible, while the older, ""suitability standard"" required only finding an acceptable option for an investor's given risk tolerance. The best option, reams of academic studies have confirmed, is generally the low-cost one. And the lowest-cost funds are index ones. In anticipation of the rule change, assets have flocked to index funds, driven by the cultural shift in the financial advisory community. Flows out of actively managed U.S. equity mutual funds leaped to $264.5 billion in 2016, while flows into passive index funds and ETFs were $236.1 billion, according to data provided by the Vanguard Group and Morningstar. That was the greatest calendar-year asset change in the last decade, during which more than $1 trillion has shifted from active to passive U.S. equity funds. But now, at Trump's behest, the DOL has postponed implementing the fiduciary rule, which was slated to go into effect this April, and is reviewing it. It's possible the rule will be revoked completely, or changed so the impartial conduct standard is significantly weakened.

Investing like Buffet without even knowing it
The Trump trade is now second fiddle in the world Yet money is still flowing in the wrong direction. In the first two months of 2017, active U.S. equity funds lost $30 billion, while passive gained $60 billion. Although the rule may be reversed, that won't change the ongoing shift in the advisory model. ""For some time financial advisers have been shifting from a commission-based structure to a fee-base structure,"" says Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. ""Lower-cost index products fit nicely into that model."" In other words, while in the past advisors might receive a 5 percent commission on the sale of a popular active fund, now they work on a percentage of assets under management, usually 1 percent for a traditional financial planner. As that 1 percent fee is ongoing, as opposed to a one-time commission, buying cheap index funds to go with it makes the financial advice affordable, Rosenbluth says. ""It allows advisors to get paid."" Of course, cheap isn't always good. Active managers have long argued that indexing the market is settling for mediocrity. ""If the average mutual fund is still underperforming the index, mediocrity is still better than below average,"" Rosenbluth counters. Indeed, 67 percent of all active equity funds have underperformed their benchmarks in the past decade through Dec. 31, 2016, according to Vanguard and Morningstar. And that's just for funds that continue to exist. If you account for liquidated funds — what is known as ""survivor bias"" — the lagging number jumps to 86 percent. Part of the problem is that markets may be more efficient than previously. ""It's getting harder and harder for managers to outperform,"" says Thomas Rampulla, head of U.S. Financial Intermediaries at Vanguard. ""There's been a real professionalization of the asset management industry on the active side."" He points out that 50 years ago only about 20 percent of assets were professionally managed, while today 68 percent of assets are. That makes it difficult for professionals to get an edge when they're competing with so many other sophisticated investors. Yet a bigger issue is most managers are still charging too much. One 2016 study by fund company Fidelity found that from 1992 through 2015, active U.S. large-cap stocks funds in the lowest quartile of fees from the largest five fund families beat the benchmark by 0.18 of a percentage point a year on average. Meanwhile, the average active fund lagged the benchmark by 0.71 percent. There may also be a cyclicality to manager underperformance. Brian Hogan, who oversees some $900 billion as president of Fidelity's equity and high-income division, believes the post-2008 financial crisis era has been particularly tough for active managers, as monetary stimulus from global central banks has driven stocks uniformly upward, making it harder for active managers to differentiate themselves. But since the U.S. Federal Reserve ended its stimulus program in October of 2014 and began raising interest rates in 2015, Hogan says the environment has changed. ""That backdrop is becoming very helpful to the active industry,"" he says. ""It's causing there to be less correlation among stocks and more dispersion in their performance. Those are things active managers like to see. I think the next three to five years are going to be really fun for the active industry."" The highest-paid managers better hope he's right, because if the current trend continues, they won't be around much longer.

Brian Stoffel,04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Tell me if you've heard that one over the past five years. As e-commerce grows stronger each year, investors are shunning traditional retailers in droves. Right? The image many of us have when thinking of big-box retailers. Image source: Getty Images Between the two, which is the better buy today? That's impossible to answer without a fully functioning crystal ball, but we'll do our best to dig deeper by approaching the question from three different angles. There is absolutely nothing more important to investigate than a company's sustainable competitive advantage -- often referred to as a ""moat."" If I could go back in time and talk to my beginning-investor-self, I would make this simple point abundantly clear. That's because a moat represents the special something that separates a company from its competition. Over a long enough time frame, it is what separates the winners from the losers, what keeps customers coming back again and again, and what keeps the competition at bay for years. Wal-Mart's key advantage has always been its scale. No one did a better job at focusing on small, rural communities, buying things in bulk, and lowering overhead costs better than the Walton family. That led to market-thumping returns for decades. But that moat has been mightily disrupted by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). With e-commerce taking more and more of the retail pie every year, the very thing that made Wal-Mart great -- its physical presence throughout the United States and the world -- has become its Achilles' heel. Customers value convenience above all else, and if packages can be delivered right to their front door, then that's what they'll go with. Lowe's has been able to avoid the Amazon bug by nature of its business. It simply isn't practical to deliver most home-furnishing and construction purchases right to your door. In addition, these purchases are usually so large and long-lasting that customers like to see, touch, and try out the things they're buying before handing over their credit card. Perhaps the best proxy for these trends is each store's comps -- or how much comparable-store sales increased in any given year. Comps: A 5-Year HistoryCreate column charts Data source: Company annual reports I simply think that Lowe's wins this battle because its business is more difficult to disrupt with e-commerce than Wal-Mart's. The company's solid position as the No. 2 home-furnishing store in America, the power of its brand, and its scale all offer a wider moat -- in my opinion -- than Wal-Mart has. Most investors, especially those who put their faith behind big-box brand names, like seeing cash returned to them. Of course, there's nothing wrong with that, as dividends are a key reason to invest in such names. But investors should also want their companies to hold on to a hefty stash of cash. That's because every company, no matter what, is going to face difficult economic times. Companies that approach such times with a healthy balance sheet have options: Buy back stock, make splashy acquisitions, or -- most importantly -- outspend rivals to gain market share. Debt-heavy companies are in the opposite scenario -- forced to narrow their focus to meet the demands of their debtors. Here's how Wal-Mart and Lowe's stack up in terms of financial fortitude, remembering that Wal-Mart is valued at over three times the size of Lowe's. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Wal-Mart $6.9 billion $42 billion $13.6 billion $20.9 billion Lowe's $1.0 billion $14.4 billion $3.1 billion $4.5 billion Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, SEC filings. Lowe's is by no means a slouch in this respect, but even after adjusting for the relative size of these companies, Wal-Mart comes out ahead. It has more cash, income, and free cash flow than Lowe's. This decision is very easy. Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Dividend FCF Payout Wal-Mart 17 11 3.8 2.8% 32% Lowe's 21 16 1.2 1.7% 25% Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. This is a much more difficult one to parse. Both companies offer very healthy dividends, but Wal-Mart's is noticeably bigger. Wal-Mart also appears to be cheaper on an earnings and free cash flow basis. But growth rates are much higher at Lowe's. In fact, according to the PEG ratio, Lowe's trades at an astounding 65% discount to Wal-Mart. That's why I'm calling this one a draw. So there you have it: It's a tie. If investors are more comforted by a strong balance sheet and very impressive cash flows, then Wal-Mart is the way to go. If, however, you want to know that a company is less susceptible to disruption in the form of e-commerce, I think Lowe's is a better bet. I always use a company's moat as a tiebreaker if the companies end in a draw, so my vote here would be with Lowe's, but I can't deny the strength of Wal-Mart's cash flow. ","

Andrew Tonner,04202017,Fool,04132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The showdown between Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is a veritable clash of retail titans. A perennial leader among the Fortune 500, Wal-Mart consistently generates the most revenue on planet Earth -- among publicly traded companies, at least. In fact, Wal-Mart's $482 billion in sales last year more than doubles the second-largest corporate giant on the list, ExxonMobil. However, Amazon has combined Wal-Mart's appetite for low prices with its uniquely innovative ability to become the retail giant for the digital age. So, which is the better stock to own today: Amazon or Wal-Mart? In this article, both Amazon and Wal-Mart will go through a three-part analysis to get a better sense of which appears to be the better buy today. Each with large finance departments, investors can safely assume that Amazon's and Wal-Mart's current capital structures are in place for a reason. To frame this discussions, here's a cursory snapshot into several of the most important liquidity and solvency metrics for each company. Data sources: Amazon.com and Wal-Mart investor relations, Yahoo! Finance. Figures from Amazon's and Wal-Mart's FY 2016 10-K. Cash from Ops reflects the last 12 months reported. Amazon's $18.2 billion positive net-cash balance clearly jumps out as markedly better than Wal-Mart's negative $36.9 billion in net debt. However, this isn't nearly as glaring an impediment as it might first appear thanks to Wal-Mart's gargantuan operating cash flow, which is roughly twice that of Amazon's. This narrows the difference between the two companies in my eyes, and the difference between their current ratio is negligible enough to not really factor into the discussion. More importantly, both companies are well managed enough to the point they should be able to meet any and all financial obligations while also tapping credit markets to finance any interesting opportunities. That being said, Amazon's slightly more conservative financial structure earns it a win in this analysis of financial strength. Though of course important differences exist between the two, Wal-Mart and Amazon are more similar to one another than they are different today. Wal-Mart is the world's largest retailer -- total sales topped $481 billion last year -- and its entire business revolves around selling all manner of goods to consumers worldwide. Amazon's business mix is only slightly more eclectic. Its AWS reporting segment accounted for about $12.2 billion (9%) of overall sales. The remaining $123 billion (91%) of Amazon's total sales largely reflect its e-commerce operations, although sales of quasi-retail services like its Prime free shipping and online streaming platform are included in that number. The core difference between the two is the method of distribution. Wal-Mart is largely reliant on its brick-and-mortar network of over 11,695 stores, whereas Amazon's sales occur entirely online. Of the two, Amazon is far better aligned with the long-term trends taking place within the retail sector, and Wal-Mart finds itself moving as quickly as possible to catch up with Amazon in this regard. Image source: Getty Images. Wal-Mart remains far behind Amazon, though, in developing its e-commerce capabilities. Case in point: Amazon captured 38% of U.S. e-commerce sales during the 2016 holiday season, compared to just 2.6% for Wal-Mart, according to researcher Slice Intelligence. Wal-Mart has intensified its efforts to narrow the gap with Amazon, mostly notably through its acquisition of e-commerce start-up Jet.com last year. The steep $3.3 billion price was largely seen as an ""acqu-hire"" of Jet's CEO Marc Lore, one of the few to successfully compete head-to-head against Amazon with diapers.com, which Amazon eventually acquired in 2011 after trying to kill the company in a bare-knuckled price war. All of this is to say that Amazon is currently beating Wal-Mart in the all-important e-commerce space. However, Wal-Mart has finally gotten serious and paid-up for the talent required to bring its own sales model into the 21st century. Given Wal-Mart's unmatched leverage with suppliers, the most likely outcome of the e-commerce arms race is that Amazon and Wal-Mart will end this generational growth story roughly as equals. Turning to their valuations, the multiples perfectly capture the difference in investor sentiment between Amazon and Wal-Mart. Here's a quick snapshot of three of the most commonly used valuation metrics for Amazon and Wal-Mart. Data sources: Amazon.com and Wal-Mart investor relations, Yahoo! Finance. Clearly, Amazon is likely to grow far faster than Wal-Mart in the coming years. However, with Wal-Mart's recent moves to narrow the talent gap between itself and Amazon -- the precursor to narrowing the actual business gap -- Wal-Mart's shares look far more compelling from a purely dollars-and-cents perspective. This one is pretty straightforward, although I like both companies' shares, for the record. All of this is to say that both Wal-Mart and Amazon are dominant, world-class companies. By way of metaphor, Amazon is the barbarian at the gate, storming the gates of an industry that Wal-Mart has dominated without equal for years. And even though Wal-Mart has finally gotten serious about e-commerce as well, Amazon's incredible ability to develop unique solutions to capture an ever greater share of the e-commerce world gives it a slight edge over Wal-Mart. Different stocks for companies at different stages of their corporate lifecycles, I like Amazon shares a bit more in this showdown of e-commerce titans. ","

Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) seems to have gone from one catastrophe to the next in recent years. A 2013 data breach affected more than 70 million customers and dampened sales over the subsequent quarters. That was followed by the company's decision to end its ill-fated expansion in Canada in 2015, which resulted in a massive $5.4 billion writedown. More recently, the company's decision to allow transgender customers to use the restroom of their choice prompted a boycott among some of its customers. Image source: Motley Fool. Sales and profits have also fallen in recent quarters, and the stock has gotten punished. TGT data by YCharts While the broad market trades near all-time highs, Target is down more than a third from its 52-week high, and the stock has been one of the worst performers on the S&P 500 over the last year. CEO Brian Cornell took the helm of the big-box chain in August 2014, so he was not responsible for the credit card breach in 2013 or the Canadian expansion, though he did make the decision to pull out of Canada. Still, the stock has fallen about 10% during his tenure, and the company's recent performance has left much to be desired. Beyond the backlash over the company's bathroom policy and the stock's slide, there are other signs that Target may be due for a management change. Here are a few. In recent months, Target has lost its Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Digital Officer, and the head of its grocery division. Over the last two years, the company has also seen the Chief Legal Officer, Chief Merchant, Chief Human Resources Officer, and Chief Stores Officer positions change hands. Only two of the company's 11-member executive team remains from when Cornell became CEO. While rotation among executives can simply signal a company shifting strategy, it's often representative of greater problems, such as disagreements over strategic direction, poor performance, an unpleasant work environment, or even poor compensation. Many of the recent defections correspond with problem areas for Target. Online sales have lagged behind those of peers and growth has slowed, which likely explains the departure of Chief Digital Officer Jason Goldberger, and the company's grocery strategy has long been muddled as well, leading to excess spoilage. Not surprisingly, grocery chief Anne Dament, who was one of Cornell's first big hires, left the company last November after just 18 months in the position. Comparable sales, which strip out the  effects of new stores, are one of the best measurements of a retailer's performance. However, comparable sales at Target have fallen for three straight quarters after seven consecutive quarters of growth. In the key fourth quarter, store-based comparable sales dropped 3.3%, though overall comparable sales were only down 1.5% due to a 34% increase in digital sales. Management's guidance for the current year was also underwhelming. It sees low-single digit decline in comparable sales for 2017 and low-to-mid single digit decline in comparable sales for the first quarter. While the retail sector has struggled with the loss of customer traffic as e-commerce becomes more popular, Target's rivals like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) have managed to deliver consistent comparable sales growth. Wal-Mart has overcome challenges to deliver nine straight quarters of comp sales growth, and the popularity of Costco's membership model has proven to be enduring. Cornell came on to replace former CEO Gregg Steinhafel, whose tenure ended after the data breach disaster. At first, the stock responded favorably to Cornell's strategy, but the recent decline in sales and profits has pushed the stock into the red. Cornell responded to the challenge by introducing a new strategy and financial model at the most recent earnings call. The strategy includes lowering prices to make the store more competitive with Wal-Mart and other peers, a move that will cut into profits. Cornell has said the company needs to do more to fulfill the second half of its slogan, ""Expect More. Pay Less."" At the same time, however, the company plans to refurbish 600 stores and open 100 smaller stores by 2019. In many ways, the strategy mimics Wal-Mart's decision in 2015 to invest in lower prices, higher wages, and cleaner stores, which cost it on the bottom line but has boosted sales. Target doesn't have the same economies of scale or other advantages that Wal-Mart has, though. At the Shoptalk retail industry conference a few weeks ago, Cornell's presentation stood out for being focused on brick-and-mortar retail rather than new technologies. The company's plans to open new stores runs counter to the trend in much of the retail industry, which is either closing stores or scaling back on new locations. Cornell's future with Target may be riding on the outcome of his turnaround strategy. With less than three years at the helm, the board is likely willing to give him some more time to return the company to growth, but if cutting prices and sprucing up stores fails to bring customers in the door, it could be time for the board to show him the door as well.

Amazon is reportedly working out the kinks so it can roll out its cashierless convenience store concept, called Amazon Go, which automatically charges people when they exit rather than make them wait in line to pay. This is a step into the brick-and-mortar world of grocery retailing. It makes sense to try to sell groceries to people this way, as only an estimated 23% of households in the U.S. shopped for groceries online last year, and this channel accounted for just an estimated 4.3% of the total grocery spending in 2016. One estimate puts online sales at only 20% of grocery sales by 2025, so Amazon is smart both to provide people with physical stores where they can buy food (Amazon Go) and to build up the distribution network that supports AmazonFresh, which lets people order groceries online and pick them up in person. AmazonFresh is being tested in Seattle, where it's allowing customers to purchase grocery items online and then select a time for pick-up, which can be in as little as 15 minutes. The customer drives to the pick-up location, where service agents will load the items into the car. This model allows Amazon to build a hyperlocal presence, which will be useful in helping it tap the offline grocery market. Image Source: Amazon. Amazon, however, is moving into a market where it will run into stiff competition from established big-box retailers. Citi Research believes that Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is the best-placed company to take advantage of online grocery retail. Wal-Mart has a solid lead in the online grocery market, as its ""click-and-collect"" model (which lets people order online and pick up in store) is currently present across 600 locations in more than 100 markets in the U.S. Perhaps more importantly, Citi research reported by CNBC showed that Wal-Mart items were much cheaper than AmazonFresh's. However, investors need to understand that the e-tailer doesn't need to become a leader in the online grocery market. Amazon's top line will receive a nice boost even if it corners a small percentage of the market for food-at-home items estimated to be $100 billion  by 2025. And taking away market share from smaller grocery players -- perhaps those in the organic-foods market, where higher prices are more accepted -- is an ideal game plan. This could be a potentially fertile ground for the online retailer, as the global organic-foods market is estimated to grow at 16.6% a year until 2025, putting it at an estimated $456 billion. Even if only a fifth of those sales were made online, that could still be a big market. ","

If you're just getting started as an investor, congratulations! You're taking an important step that will almost certainly pay off over the long term, helping you build wealth to improve your family's life. But it can also be a foreboding experience, and there's a lot to learn. In its purest form, investing is all about finding the right companies, buying a piece of them at a reasonable price, and then holding them for as long as possible while the company does all the work. And while that may seem simple -- and in many ways it is -- it's not always easy to know where to begin. We asked three of our contributors to write about a stock they think is ideal for investing rookies, and they gave us two well-known, dominant companies in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) and a low-cost index fund that is made up of more than 3,000 companies, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEMKT:VTI). Image source: Getty Images. If you're still trying to get your investing legs underneath you, these three stocks are work a close look. Keep reading to learn why we think they're excellent starter stocks for new investors like you. Chuck Saletta (Wal-Mart Stores Inc.): Retail titan Wal-Mart may not immediately come to mind when you're thinking of family-owned businesses, but the Walton family controls about half its shares. In the rapidly changing world of modern retail, that family control can actually be a good thing, as it means the company doesn't have to answer to the short-term whims of Wall Street. Instead, management can focus on making solid long-term investments to help the company thrive for a long time to come. That opportunity for long-term focus as well as Wal-Mart's solid financial position and reasonable valuation make it a great stock for beginning investors to consider buying. It reported over $6.8 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet in its most recent annual report filing. In addition, its debt-to-equity ratio is around 0.6, indicating that Wal-Mart hasn't overextended itself in its search for growth. What Wal-Mart has done in that regard is to make acquisitions like online start-up retailer Jet.com, enabling it to accelerate its steps to remain relevant in the era of online shopping. It has also tried new store formats, though some -- like its tiny Wal-Mart Express format -- haven't necessarily work out as hoped. Trading at around 16 times both past earnings and forward-looking earnings estimates, Wal-Mart won't set the world on fire, but it won't simply fade away either. With an average of around 4.2% earnings growth anticipated annually over the next five years, along with a dividend yield of around 2.8%, investors can modest returns, without exposing themselves to a ton of risk. That balance makes the company a great first stock for new investors. Seth McNew (Walt Disney Co.): For investors just starting out, there's no need to dig deep into the financials of companies you've never heard of to find great long-term investments. Disney is a great stock for investing rookies because the well-known company has an easy-to-understand business with success across multiple industries. For new investors, it's also easy to see what long-term growth drivers are likely to push its stock higher. The four parts of Disney's business are cable networks, theme parks, studio entertainment (i.e., film studios), and consumer products. Disney's stock was pushed lower in 2015 and 2016 as analysts worried about the pressure ESPN, Disney's largest cable network, had been facing amid a changing consumer environment that favored cord-cutting and skinny cable packages without sports included. But over the past year, Disney has demonstrated its ability to offer its cable network programming through streaming devices. That, plus excitement about the new theme park opened in China last year, a hugely successful year of movie releases, and a growing consumer products and licensing segment have pushed Disney Stock up roughly 14% over the past year. Disney is firing on all cylinders right now, and analysts expect its earnings per share to continue to grow at around 10% in each of the next five years. For these and many other reasons, it looks like a great buy-and-hold stock for investors who want to learn more about picking great companies for long-term growth. Jason Hall (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF): I'm a firm believer that individual investors can beat the market. But it takes a lot of discipline, experience, and temperament that beginners, frankly, just don't have. For this reason, a low-cost index fund, such as the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, is an excellent way for new investors to get invested in the stock market as early as possible while they build up the knowledge and experience to be successful at picking individual stocks. Why the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF? In short, because it's proven to be a great way to get solid returns and diversification in a single investment. This index fund, which gives you a stake in more than 3,500 different stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 since Vanguard launched the ETF: VTI Total Return Price data by YCharts. And with an expense ratio of 0.05% -- that's $0.05 per year for every $100 invested in the fund -- it's a low-cost way to get nearly market-average returns. For beginning investors, it's not a bad idea to invest a portion of your portfolio in this fund, at least early in your investing career. Not only will this keep you invested while you become a better investor, but it could also mean you have a bigger portfolio to invest in individual stocks down the road. ","

Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:WFM) stock spiked last week as the activist hedge fund Jana Partners took a stake in the grocer. Image source: Motley Fool. The e-commerce giant revealed its cashier-less Amazon Go store last December, though the convenience store is still only open to Amazon employees, and it's also announced two soon-to-open grocery pickup facilities in Seattle. With a market value of $11 billion following Jana's investment, Whole Foods would be by far Amazon's biggest acquisition -- which was previously the $1.2 billion it paid for Zappos in 2009 -- but it could be a good fit in at least few ways. Both Amazon and Whole Foods target similar customer segments. With its reputation for high-end organic fare, Whole Foods has always catered to a wealthier clientele, and its stores tend to be found in the country's most upscale enclaves. Amazon, with its online dominance and reputation for competitive prices, opens its online doors to all customers, but its exceedingly popular Prime membership program, with its $99 annual fee, courts higher-income Americans. One of the most revealing statistics about Amazon's business came last week when the NPD Group reported that just 42% of American consumers shopped on Amazon last year, despite it being one of the biggest retailers in the country. For comparison, 95% visited rival Wal-Mart and 84% shopped at Target. Therefore, many of Whole Foods' customers are likely to shop at Amazon and vice versa, making the two a logical match. Another advantage such a deal would give Amazon is that Whole Foods stores are mostly located near Amazon's customers, which would give it a valuable real estate footprint as the company seeks to enhance its grocery delivery model and reach its customers in other ways. Amazon isn't alone in its grocery delivery ambitions. A number of start-ups offer delivery from conventional supermarkets, including Instacart, Fresh Direct, Peapod, and others. However, Instacart is generally considered Amazon Fresh's most prominent rival in the area as it just raised $400 million at a valuation of $3.4 billion. A key reason for Instacart's success has been its partnership with Whole Foods, which made a strategic investment in the delivery service for an undisclosed sum a year ago. Buying Whole Foods could help Amazon either sideline Instacart or acquire it if it so wished, which would bolster its position in grocery delivery. Beyond those factors, a combination of Whole Foods and Amazon would yield the usual synergies as Amazon would be able to leverage its distribution network and buying power to help lower prices at Whole Foods, a key obstacle in returning the company to growth. Amazon has given no indication that it might still be interested in acquiring the leading natural foods grocer, though Jana considers it to be among a handful of potential buyers. Whole Foods, as a national chain, would be a better fit for Amazon, but its market cap at $11 billion may make it too costly for the e-commerce leader. One way or another, however, Amazon seems bent on taking over a brick-and-mortar grocery business. A national chain like Whole Foods could help the company accelerate delivery, and give it a physical retail platform to experiment with. As Amazon's grocery ambitions continue to grow, don't be surprised to see it take over a chain like Whole Foods or BJ's in the near future. ","

 ,04202017,MarketWatch,04132017,"Blackstone Group LP agreed to acquire pipeline company EagleClaw Midstream Ventures LLC for about $2 billion in cash, the latest deal in the prolific Permian Basin of West Texas. The transaction, which includes more than 375 miles of natural gas pipes, is expected to close by the end of July. EagleClaw will retain its name and operate as a Blackstone portfolio company, with the leadership team remaining intact, according to a statement Monday. EagleClaw's financial sponsor is a partnership between EnCap Investments LP and Flatrock Energy Advisors LLC, called Encap Flatrock Midstream. Blackstone joins a parade of pipeline buyers in the Permian Basin amid a drilling rebound spurred by higher oil prices. While most producers are targeting oil, it often comes mixed with substantial natural gas. The total number of rigs drilling in the nation's biggest crude field rose to 339 last week, the most in more than two years, according to Baker Hughes Inc. ""Blackstone has a deep understanding of the compelling fundamentals of the upstream and midstream economics in the Permian, an outstanding reputation as an investor in the energy sector and the scale to take EagleClaw to the next level,"" Bob Milam, EagleClaw's chief executive officer, said in Monday's statement. Midland-based EagleClaw had been exploring a sale for months, according to people familiar with the process. Monday's deal follows the announced purchase earlier this month of 500 miles of Permian crude pipelines by NuStar Energy LP and Targa Resources Corp.'s acquisition of pipelines and processing systems in the Permian for as much as $1.5 billion, unveiled in January.

,04272017,Reuters,04202017,［ワシントン　２６日　ロイター］ - トランプ米政権は２６日、法人税減税や海外利益に対する税率引き下げなどを柱とする税制改革案の概要を発表した。 トランプ大統領の就任１００日目を２９日に控え、同政権は極めて重要な改革案と位置づける。ただ、歳入押し上げに向けた具体策に欠ける中、財政赤字の拡大につながる可能性も拭い切れない。 税制改革案は、ムニューシン財務長官とコーン国家経済会議（ＮＥＣ）委員長が発表。ムニューシン長官は「中核となる基本指針」と指摘し、これをたたき台に議会を通過する法案の作成に向けて今後議会とつめていく意向を示した。 同改革案では、公的企業の法人税税率を現行の３５％から１５％に引き下げる。 海外還流利益の税率については、現行の３５％から大幅に引き下げることを検討。ただ、ムニューシン長官は、政権と議会が新たな水準をめぐり意見のすり合わせを行っているとし、明確な数字は示さなかった。 米企業は現在約２兆６０００億ドルの利益を海外に滞留させており、米政府はこうした資金が米国に還流されない限り課税はできない。トランプ政権は還流を促しているが、税率は低水準にとどめることを提案。実施に移されれば歳入が一時的に押し上げられ、インフラ投資の原資に回せるため、民主党の支持を得られる可能性がある。 個人については、税率区分を現在の７区分から３区分（１０％、１５％、３５％）に減らす。 今回の改革案には、減税分を補完する手段として下院共和党が提案した「国境調整税」は含まれない。 ライアン下院議長は国境調整税を提唱してきたが、同改革案を「大変気に入っている」とし、同案に対する楽観的な見方を表明。 ライアン議長のほか、上院のマコネル共和党院内総務を含む共和党幹部は声明で、「トランプ政権が打ち出した指針は（政権と議会が税制改革で協議を進める際の）重要なガイドポストとなる」との見解を示した。 パートナーシップなどを含むパススルー事業体に課す最高税率は現在３９．６％と個人の最高税率と同水準だが、１５％に引き下げる方針。また、米国に拠点を置く企業が海外で稼いだ利益の大部分を法人税の課税対象外とする「地域的な」法人税制度も導入する計画。 米国では、税法の大幅改定権限は議会にある。下院民主党のペロシ院内総務は、「トランプ大統領の税制改革案は詳細に欠け、大企業や富裕層に対する優遇が大きい」と批判した。 また、民主党や財政規律を重視する共和党の一部からは、財政赤字拡大への懸念が浮上した。 ムニューシン長官は質疑応答で、減税分による減収については経済成長に伴う歳入増や法の抜け穴をふさぐことなどによって賄われるとし、「米企業の競争力を世界で最高とすることがわれわれの目標だ」と強調。「大統領は経済成長の効果を企業に対し解き放ちたいとの固い決意がある」と語った。 そのうえで、「全般的な経済計画は大規模な減税と税制改革、規制緩和、通商協定の再交渉から成る。これにより長期間にわたり抑制されていた米国の経済成長に道が開かれる」と述べた。 ＊内容を追加します。 ,"

,04272017,Reuters,04202017,［ラストン（米ルイジアナ州）　１７日　ロイター］ - ミニバイクやゴーカートを製造するモンスター・モトは昨年、組み立て工場を中国から米ルイジアナ州ラストンへと移転し、米国生産に踏み切るという大きな賭けに出た。 だが、同社が製品に「メイド・イン・アメリカ」と表示できるようになるまでには、なお長い道のりを要する。 過去２０年で米国は国内工場のほぼ４分の１を失っており、同社のバイクに使われているフレームやエンジン部品も、数年前にサプライチェーンの移転先となった中国でなければ調達できない。 「今は、アメリカ国内で部品を調達するすべがない」。モンスター・モトのAlex Keechle最高経営責任者（ＣＥＯ）は、同社の組み立て工場を案内しながらそう語った。「しかし、ここに旗を立てることで、サプライヤーも後に続くと信じている」 モンスター・モトの経験は、トランプ大統領と共に、アメリカの製造業を再建しようと臨む米国企業が直面する障害の一例にすぎない。 たとえば、米自動車メーカーとそのサプライヤーは、国外工場にすでに何十億ドルも投資している。仮にトランプ大統領が提案する輸入品への「国境税」が法制化されれば、何千という米国製部品を調達するために、高額で時間のかかる移行作業に向き合わなければならない。 ２年がかりで工場用地を見つけ、州や地方自治体と交渉したモンスター・モトのように、再び生産拠点を米国に戻した企業は、移転による需要により、地元にサプライ・チェーンが構築されることを期待している。 米国製品に対する消費需要の高まりを受け、ウォルマートはモンスター・モトを含めたいくつかの米社と提携し、２０２３年までに米国製品調達を２５００億ドル（約２７兆２０００億円）増やすことを目指している。 ただ、米国人の愛国的な消費習慣にも、価格面での限界があることが彼らの経験から明らかとなった。 モンスター・モトの場合、バイクを１台２４９─７４９ドルで販売しているが、価格に敏感な客がより安い中国製のライバル製品に流れることを恐れ、値上げには踏み切れないと同社のＣＥＯは語る。 「箱に『メイド・イン・アメリカ』と書いてあれば、消費者が（値上げの）フリーパスをくれる訳ではない」と同ＣＥＯは言う。「価格競争力を維持しなければならない」 モンスター・モトのAlex Keechle CEO。ルイジアナ州ラストンで１月撮影（２０１７年  ロイター） 工場の労働コストに目を光らせることは、米国の製造業者にもコントロールできることだ。彼らは、組み立てラインで働く、主に低スキルな労働者をロボットに置き換えることが、米国で生産しつつ、コスト競争力を保ち、商業的に成功する唯一の道だと考えている。 これはトランプ氏が大統領選で勝つために使った説明とは、真逆の傾向だ。 大統領就任後も、トランプ氏は過ぎ去ったアメリカ製造業の栄光を復活させ、数百万の雇用を再創出する公約を掲げ続けている。大統領は先月３１日、「アメリカの繁栄泥棒」に終止符を打つため、貿易ルールを悪用する国の取り締まりを強化するよう、政権に指示した。 だがモンスター・モトのような企業の製造現場では、状況はより複雑だ。 「まるで人々は、製造拠点を地球上のどこかからプラグの様に引き抜き、米国に差し込んでも、万事支障ないと考えているかのようだ」。貨物輸送大手ユナイテッド・パーセル・サービス（ＵＰＳ）のデビッド・アブニーＣＥＯはそう語る。 ＵＰＳは、モンスター・モトが中国製部品をラストンに輸送できるようサプライ・チェーンの再構築を手助けした。「（製造拠点の米国移転は）すぐに実現できることではない」 トランプ政権による製造業の国内回帰に向けた取り組みは、規制緩和と製造業労働者に新たなスキルを学ばせるプログラムの拡充に重点を置く、とホワイトハウスの高官は説明する。 「米国に回帰する製造業の雇用が、前に出て行ったものと全く同じにはならないだろうことは承知している」と同高官は語る。「われわれは、アメリカの労働者が対応できるよう手段を取っている」 ＜ロボットを再び偉大に＞ ラストンにあるモンスター・モトの広い倉庫の様な工場では、数十人の作業員が、短いが複雑な組み立てラインで働き、箱詰めされた輸入部品をバイクに組み立てている。 ビリー・マハフイという名前のひげの長い作業員が、一人でバイクのエンジンをふかしてエンジンやブレーキのテストを行い、その後、数人の作業員が完成したバイクを「米国組み立て」と書かれた箱に入れていく。 モンスター・モトの工場でミニバイクを組み立てるビリー・マハフィさん。ルイジアナ州ラストンで１月撮影（２０１７年　ロイター） その箱書きの効果もあり、ウォルマートなどの大口顧客からの需要が足元で拡大している。同社は、生産を８万台に倍増させ、時給１３─１５ドルで働く組み立て工場の従業員数を、２０１７年の約４０人から、１００人へ増やす予定だ。 モンスター・モトが、アメリカで最初に製造できそうな部品は、バイクやゴーカート用の黒色の金属フレームだ。だがそのために溶接工を雇えばコストがかかりすぎるため、生産を自動化する必要がある。 「コスト構造をぶち壊すことはできない。米国で（フレーム生産を）実現する唯一の方法はロボットだ」と、モンスター・モトのリック・スカール最高執行責任者（ＣＯＯ）は言う。 テレビの箱に表示された「米国組み立て」のマーク。サウスカロライナ州ウィンズボローで２０１４年５月撮影（２０１７年　ロイター/Chris Keane） メキシコから米国への生産拠点の移転について質問されると、マッサーロＣＦＯは、貿易ルールへの改変次第で、「労働条件の格差を考えれば、（米国生産は）オートメーション化された製造作業にならざるを得ない」と述べた。 こうした傾向はすでに、ワシントンを拠点とする経済政策研究所のデータにも表れている。同研究所のシニアエコノミスト、ロバート・スコット氏によると、米国は１９９７年から２０１４年にかけて、全体の２３．５％にあたる８万５０００の工場を失っただけではなく、１工場当たりの従業員の平均人数も１４％減少して４４人となった。 スコット氏によると、従業員の減少はオートメーション化によるところが大きい。 「すべての企業にとって経済的に合理的であり、この国ではさらにオートメーション化が進むだろう。嘆き悲しんでも、状況は変わらない」と、ボストン・コンサルティングのマネージング・ディレクター、ハル・サーキン氏は話す。 生産をオートメーション化すれば、必要な労働者数は減るが、ロボットのプログラマーやオペレーターなど、よりスキルの高い労働者が必要になると製造各社は語る。全米製造業協会（ＮＡＭ）の推定では、こうした「スキル・ギャップ」により、１２００万人以上を雇用する業界内で、３５万の欠員が生まれているという。 ラストンのロニー・ウォーカー市長は、同市の経済の多様化を狙っており、モンスター・モトにリース保証を行うことで、その成功に賭けている。組み立て工場周辺にサプライヤーが移転することを見込んでいるからだ。 「製造業を取り戻すには時間がかかるだろうか。もちろんだ」と、ウォーカー市長は言う。「しかしどこかで始めなければならない」 （翻訳：山口香子　編集：下郡美紀） ,"

Craig Adeyanju,04272017,Investopedia,04202017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon got a 13% increase in overall compensation in the company’s fiscal year 2017, which ended Jan. 31, a Thursday regulatory filing showed. McMillon received a total of $22.4 million in the retailer’s last fiscal year. This compares to the roughly $19.8 million that McMillon received in Wal-Mart’s fiscal year 2016 and the $19.4 million he received in fiscal 2015. The amounts quoted here represent the combined value of the cash and stock that he received. Of the total compensation that McMillon received in fiscal 2017, roughly 6% was his base salary. Another 56% was in the form of performance share units, and about 20% came as an annual cash incentive while roughly 20% was restricted stock. The filing showed that all the listed components of McMillon’s compensation, except his base salary and restricted stock, were at risk, since they depend on achieving certain performance metrics. Wal-Mart gives incentive payouts based on the goals the company set for operating income and sales. The goals have to be achieved for full incentives to be paid. Wal-Mart saw its operating income drop by 5.6% to $22.8 billion in fiscal 2017, less severe than the 11% decline from the previous year. On a constant currency basis, the operating income was $23.4 billion, or a 2.9% decrease. The retailer had an adjusted operating income target of $22.84 billion on a constant currency basis. Wal-Mart recorded a total revenue increase of 0.8%, $485.9 billion, during the year. The retailer also raked in roughly $31.5 billion in operating cash flow, the highest ever the company has recorded. The ecommerce chief of Wal-Mart U.S., Marc Lore, who joined the retailer from Jet.com after the acquisition last year, received total compensation of roughly $243.9 million, about $242.5 million of which was a stock award attributable to the Jet.com acquisition. The filing showed that, excluding the stock award, Lore earned $7.6 million. (See also: Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club Gets Into Wine Business.)

Anmar Frangoul,04272017,CNBC,04202017,"Wal-Mart has launched a ""sustainability platform"" that will invite its suppliers to join the retail giant in pledging to cut greenhouse gas emissions from operations and supply chains.  Known as Project Gigaton, Wal-Mart said on Wednesday that an ""emissions reduction toolkit"" would be given to suppliers, with the aim of slashing one gigaton of emissions by 2030. Wal-Mart said that this was equivalent to removing 211 million passenger vehicles off U.S. roads and highways for one year. ""Through the years, we've seen that integrating sustainable practices into our operations improves business performance, spurs technological innovation, inspires brand loyalty, and boosts employee engagement,"" Laura Phillips, Wal-Mart's senior vice president for sustainability, said on Wednesday.  ""Our suppliers recognize the opportunity to realize those same benefits in their businesses,"" Phillips added. ""By working together on such an ambitious goal, we can accelerate progress within our respective companies and deep in our shared supply chains."" Wal-Mart has big plans when it comes to sustainability. Among other things, it has set itself the goal of being supplied by 100 percent renewable energy and to achieve zero waste across its global operations. It is also a member of RE100, an initiative made up of some of the planet's biggest businesses, all committed to renewable power. The announcement of Project Gigaton was welcomed by environmental organisations.  ""Supply chains are the new frontier of sustainability,"" Carter Roberts, president and CEO of the World Wildlife Fund, said in a statement. The World Wildlife Fund has worked with Wal-Mart on Project Gigaton.  ""The journey products take from source to shelf will collectively shape our planet's future,"" Roberts added, before going on to state that the project was ""a testament to the transformative impact that leaders of industry can have on our greatest common challenges.""

Lauren Thomas,04272017,CNBC,04202017,"Wal-Mart, the big-box behemoth where nearly every American shops, is both the U.S.'s largest private sector employer and a consistent lightning rod for controversy. As the Arkansas-based retailer makes inroads in online retail — reportedly near a deal to buy men's web retailer Bonobos and recently offering discounts for items purchased online but picked up in stores — Wal-Mart's social impact is still a hot topic. The company's supporters point to countless jobs it provides to low-skilled workers while selling affordable goods, but detractors fault Wal-Mart's encroachment on small businesses, and how it treats workers. In a number of different ways, Wal-Mart has attempted to move the needle of public opinion in its favor. Stung by years of worker protests, the retail giant boosted its minimum wage to $10 per hour in 2015 — even as critics insist they could go as high as $15. Separately, the company this weeklaunched a ""sustainability platform"" that aims to curb a gigaton of emissions by 2030. However, Wal-Mart remains dogged by questions about whether it's doing enough to balance business concerns against its commitment to workers and customers. Wal-Mart's chief criticism is in the area of worker pay. In a study last year, the University of California-Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education estimated that an increase in pay to $15 per hour for Wal-Mart employees would mean an additional $4.95 billion in annual income for the company's nearly 1 million hourly employees. Additionally, a 2015 University of New Hampshire survey found that nearly three-quarters of those polled oppose a broad minimum wage mandate of $15 per hour. Echoing a frequent critique of the minimum wage policy, the survey found that five out of six economists believed it would have negative effects on youth employment levels. Supporters of a higher minimum wage, however, remain undeterred. ""Wal-Mart's business model is pretty simple,"" said Amy Traub, an associate director of policy and research at equality advocacy group Demos, at a recent debate hosted by Intelligence Squared U.S. (IQ2) in New York. ""The company pays its workers poverty wages. It offers few benefits, and it manipulates workers' hours and understaffs its stores,"" Traub said. ""That low-wage business model serves one purpose: It's so the company can maximize profits that go to some of the wealthiest people on the planet."" Other retailers have shown they can pay workers a living wage, offer good benefits and fair schedules, and still turn a profit, Traub added, citing Costco and grocer Trader Joe's as examples. She charged Wal-Mart with adding to the problem of stagnant working-class wages by wielding its ""tremendous influence throughout the service sector."" Author Nelson Lichtenstein, also a participant at the IQ2 debate, linked Wal-Mart's wage and business policies to the populist wave that's reshaped the political landscape. ""I would say that part of the reason for the political turmoil we're in right now is that for many, many people in the white working class, the sense of predictability has fled from their lives, and Wal-Mart and other competitors who follow the 'Wal-Mart model' are responsible for that,"" Lichtenstein said. In order to ramp up its online presence and hold the line on costs, Wal-Mart recently said it would slash hundreds of jobs. In total, Wal-Mart has eliminated about 18,000 jobs since early last year, a company spokesman confirmed to CNBC. 'Robot full-employment act' A few observers have questioned the impact of a higher minimum wage on job creation. In December, the White House Council of Economic Advisors compared employment data for all of the states that raised the minimum wage since the 2009 recession with those that didn't, and found ""substantial wage increases with no discernible impact on employment levels or hours worked."" Still, not everyone agrees a wage hike would a good idea for Wal-Mart, or serve as a cure-all for the battered retail sector's woes. ""No one comes close to Wal-Mart in combating poverty,"" John Tierney, a contributing editor at Manhattan Institute's  City Journal, said at the IQ2 debate, arguing the company is already doing its fair share and more. Richard Vedder, an economist and author of ""The Wal-Mart Revolution,"" said at IQ2, ""Wal-Mart lifted many Americans out of poverty by providing goods at lower prices; it has done so by paying billions of dollars, at least $6 billion every year, in federal income taxes, and more billions in sales and property taxes."" Tierney and Vedder both argued that Wal-Mart actually doesn't make enough profit to raise its wages much higher without sacrificing its bargain prices. Given the rise of automation in retail, Tierney suggested that the demand for higher wages could hasten the demise of low-skilled jobs. ""My reaction when I see these living-wage laws of $15 to $20 an hour, I think they should be renamed 'the robot full employment act,'"" Tierney said. ""I mean, if Wal-Mart starts paying its cashiers $20 an hour, people are going to start shopping at places that don't have cashiers ... it's nice to raise people's wages, but you're going to put them out of work."" ",Wal-Mart still front and center of debate over minimum wages

James Fontanella-Khan,04272017,CNBC,04202017,"Albertsons, the US supermarket operator controlled by buyout group Cerberus Capital Management, is exploring a takeover of high-end grocer Whole Foods, according to two people briefed about the matter. The US private equity group that backs Albertsons has had preliminary talks with bankers about making a bid for Whole Foods, said one person close to the buyout firm. No formal bid has yet been made, according to both people briefed on the situation. Albertsons' interest comes two weeks after Jana Partners, the activist investor, revealed it had built a 9 percent stake in Whole Foods and raised the possibility of a sale of the grocer, which has a market value of $11.4bn. A deal would be one of the largest take-privates in recent years, the people said. More from Financial Times: Macron and Le Pen go to second round of French presidential pollBrussels pressed to rethink Turkey ties Emmanuel Macron's rapid rise in politics — the FT's coverage Whole Foods has hired Evercore to advise them on a strategic review of their business operations, which could include exploring a sale, said one person close to the company, based in Austin, Texas. Cerberus has been actively looking for deals to further expand its supermarket business. Bloomberg reported in March that Albertsons had held preliminary talks to merge with Sprouts Farmers Market, an organic food retailer.However, talks between Albertsons and Sprouts have not proceeded, according to two people briefed about the matter, prompting Cerberus to take a serious look at Whole Foods, which is significantly larger. A bid for Whole Foods would come less than three years after Albertsons acquired Safeway for $9bn in a deal that turned the Boise, Idaho-based group into the third largest supermarket chain in revenue terms behind Walmart and Kroger. In 2015 Albertsons, which operates about 2,200 stores, shelved a plan for an initial public offering because of market jitters. Cerberus is likely to team up with other investors to carry out a successful deal given Whole Foods' size. Albertsons, like Walmart and Kroger, has been under enormous pressure in recent years as a price war between grocers has negatively affected their top and bottom lines. Whole Foods has also felt the pressure from several fronts, including traditional supermarkets' improved organic offerings, small retailers such as Trader Joe's and Sprouts competing directly, and food retailers such as Amazon and Fresh Direct trading online. Jana told the Whole Foods management earlier this month that it wanted a ""review of strategic alternatives, particularly in light of [Whole Foods'] apparent unwillingness to engage in discussions with third parties regarding such alternatives"". Some analysts said Albertsons' interest in Whole Foods could spark a bidding war if other supermarket chains indicated they would also like to buy the high-end grocer. Evercore and Albertson declined to comment. Cerberus and Whole Foods did not immediately return a request for comment. ",Albertson explores bid for high-end grocer Whole Foods
Krystina Gustafson,04272017,CNBC,04202017,"By the time August rolls around, there will be about 350 fewer J.C. Penney, Macy's, Sears and Kmart stores at shopping centers across the U.S. For some of those properties, the loss of these stores could be the final blow that puts them out of business. Yet in other instances, the vacancies will provide landlords an opportunity to reinvent the space for more in-demand tenants — allowing them to charge a higher rent, to boot. From growing retail chains to dining and entertainment, here are some of the tenants who are filling in malls' empty anchor space, according to a new report by JLL. Started in Long Beach, California, back in 1996, Yard House is known for its massive draft beer selection. The restaurant has roughly 70 locations. As part of its expansion, the company has leased space in a former Sears location at the King of Prussia mall near Philadelphia. It opened last month. As seen with Yard House, dining at the mall is no longer limited to a dowdy food court. New York hot spot Nobu is bringing its latest high-end sushi joint to a former Saks Fifth Avenue location at The Galleria in Houston. It is scheduled to open this fall. Once limited to open-air shopping centers, grocers like Wegmans have slowly been creeping into vacant mall spaces. The frequent visits grocery stores generate make them attractive to landlords, and shoppers benefit by being able to consolidate their trips. Wegmans will take over a former J.C. Penney store at Boston's Natick Mall in 2018. As consumers spend more of their discretionary income on experiences, landlords are increasingly recruiting tenants who provide some form of entertainment. Punch Bowl Social is an adult gaming center that brings billiards, darts and bowling together with food and cocktails. Punch Bowl opened in a former Nordstrom space at Indianapolis' Circle Centre Mall last year. The fun isn't limited to adults. KidZania, a recreational learning center that lets children roleplay as a firefighter or chef, will open its first U.S. location next year. Making its debut at the Stonebriar Centre in Frisco, Texas, KidZania will fill a custom new space. Dave & Buster's is another entertainment concept infusing a dose of fun in America's malls. It has opened three locations in former Sears stores, according to JLL. Though a large chunk of vacant space is being filled by nontraditional tenants, up-and-coming retailers are also stepping in. Irish fast-fashion chain Primark is one example, having taken up a portion of the space formerly occupied by Sears at several Northeast malls. Ulta's expansion plan will bring 100 more of its beauty shops to the U.S. this year. This fall, it will take over a portion of a former Sears at College Mall, in Bloomington, Indiana.

Krystina Gustafson,04272017,CNBC,04202017,"As Macy's looks to turn around its business and end a two-year streak of same-store sales declines, Executive Chairman Terry Lundgren said a merger or acquisition could eventually be on the table. ""We look all the time,"" Lundgren, who ended his stint as CEO last month, told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" ""I think there's some great valuations in stock prices of companies that are well funded and that look like they have a runway for success in the future."" The question is whether those companies would be the right fit for Macy's, Lundgren said. He added that the retailer has no acquisitions on its plate at this time, noting it has historically been conservative in snatching up new retail brands. The company's last acquisition was roughly two years ago, when it bought beauty retailer Bluemercury for $210 million. Lundgren, who previously served as the chain's CEO for more than a decade, added that recent speculation about a potential deal with Canadian department store operator Hudson's Bay was ""overblown."" Those reports had indicated that Hudson's Bay had approached its much-larger competitor, and had its sights set on Macy's real estate. M&A activity in the retail space has heated up recently, as traditional chains look for ways to compete with online retailers like Amazon. Wal-Mart acquired Jet.com last year and has since been on a buying binge in the e-commerce space. And earlier this week, Re/Code reported that Petsmart would acquire digital pet store Chewy.com for $3.35 billion.

""I'm not saying pull out of the market — I'm saying that it looks dangerous now,"" the Yale economics professor said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""But it could keep going up."" After all, ""if you go back to 1998, you'll find that the CAPE ratio was about the same as now, and it kept going up for two more years. It got up to something like 45 in the year 2000. So we could go back up there. And we're in an oddball-enough mood now that we might,"" Shiller said, referring to excitement surrounding President Donald Trump. ""The magic of the Trump story is that it gets stronger than any other news. It pushes everything else aside, partly business people identify with Trump [and have] an urge to gamble on this guy,"" he told CNBC in a phone interview. While Trump is rarely likened to the man known as ""Silent Cal,"" Shiller finds the historical comparison useful. ""I'm reminded of Calvin Coolidge, who become president in 1923, and the market started going up, and there were people saying that valuation ratios were getting too high — for years! Eventually, as you may have heard, it crashed."" A further rally followed by a crash, then, is certainly a potential outcome. Although as Shiller also makes clear, investors shouldn't obsess over the level of the CAPE ratio. ""The idea that these ratios represent forecasts for the underlying value is just not right,"" he said. They mostly shed light on ""psychological narratives."" In addition, some have questioned the CAPE ratio's usefulness in a period of prolonged low interest rates and evolving accounting standards. Still, most valuation metrics do show that stocks are relatively expensive as compared with historical precedents. So where does that all leave investors? ""I don't like to worry too much,"" Shiller said. But ""it's a good time to look at one's portfolio and ask if it's diversified enough.""

"Cinthia Murphy, ETF.com",04272017,CNBC,04202017,"Buying long-dated U.S. Treasury ETFs was a pretty unpopular idea late last year. That tide now seems to be turning. You could say a lot has changed in a few short months. Last fall, investors were faced with the end of the 30-year bond rally, and interest rates were expected to rise again, putting pressure on the value of bonds. More importantly, a new U.S. administration was coming in, with the promise of pursuing domestic growth policies that would fuel a stock market rally. It was all about risk-on. A fund like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) bled more than $850 million to net redemptions in less than two months following November's presidential election. As money was coming out of the fund, TLT was dropping — to the tune of some 8.3 percent in losses in that same period. More from ETF.com:Should you sell in May and go away?'SHE': Gender diversity and smart beta meetNiche China ETFs outperform giants Here's a look at the performance of TLT in the past year (relative to the S&P 500) — note the plunge following the U.S. presidential election in November. There was a huge divergence in direction: Coming into 2017, speculators mounted a short position in U.S. Treasury futures that hit a ""historic high"" in the first quarter of this year, according to  DoubleLine's latest quarterly report. By mid-March, 10-year Treasury yields closed at a high of 2.61 percent — its highest closing level since September 2014. And now, a month later, yields on 10-year Treasuries are testing the 2.2 percent level, down more than 40 basis points from their March high (bond yields fall when prices rise). TLT has seen net creations of more than $700 million year-to-date, half of which has come in the last month alone as the fund rallied some 5.5 percent. Year-to-date, TLT now has gains of about 4.1 percent. What's happening The risk-off trade is popular again. Here's why: That euphoria over the prospects for regulatory reform and U.S. growth is now being discounted by the market. Confidence in the government's ability to actually implement reform and effect change is fading ever since the administration failed to revamp health-care regulation. That has contributed to a weakened dollar. Mounting geopolitical risks is another key driver of demand for long-dated Treasuries. President Trump's growing focus on foreign policy, and his recent actions with regard to Syria and North Korea, have investors increasingly on edge. Guggenheim's CIO Scott Minerd said Monday the drop in yields and rising demand for bonds result from ""[Washington] D.C.'s struggle to pass pro-growth policies and rising geopolitical/military risks."" Massive short-bet unwinding According to Minerd, we could see 10-year Treasury yields drop to 1.5 percent ""or lower"" by this summer if this trend stays in place. That would amount to a 32 percent decline in rates from current levels, and the lowest yields we've seen since last summer. Minerd isn't alone. DoubleLine's Jeffrey Gundlach had been calling for a drop in yields and a test of the 2.2 percent level since earlier this year. The unwinding of that massive short position has something to do with it. ""With investors piling on to a one-sided trade, an unwinding of these positions could only add to demand,"" reads DoubleLine's most recent report. ""As investors began to take down short positions through March, we have also kept an eye on inflation as it appears to be peaking out over the month of April, especially as the base effects from energy begin to roll off."" Inflation peaking The firm's prediction includes inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, peaking around 2.9 percent before turning lower into the summer months, ""a move that could also be supportive of lower rates over the near term."" What could push yields higher instead? A rate hike in June, if it's accompanied by strong GDP data, DoubleLine said. The Federal Reserve raised rates again in March, and the market expects at least two more rate hikes this year. It remains to be seen whether June will bring one of them — the market is currently pricing a 50 percent chance. TLT tracks a market-weighted index of U.S. Treasury bonds with remaining maturities of 20 years or more. The longer-dated the bond is, the more sensitive it is to interest-rate hikes. TLT has effective duration of about 17.5 years. The ETF has $6.1 billion in assets and is the biggest and most liquid long-term U.S. Treasury fund on the market.

Adam Levy,04272017,Fool,04202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has been on a buying spree since last summer, when it bought Jet.com for $3 billion. It's since snatched up several smaller e-commerce websites for less than $100 million each. Most recently, it's been in talks to buy upscale men's clothing retailer Bonobos for $300 million. Despite the somewhat higher price tag, it follows the same strategy as Wal-Mart's other recent acquisitions. Wal-Mart is buying up retailers selling for a relative bargain. For example, just last year Bonobos was seeking funding at a $500 million valuation, but those talks seem to have fallen through. Wal-Mart could be getting 40% off retail for the retailer. But Wal-Mart's new e-commerce acquisition strategy is very similar to its old acquisition strategy with Wal-Mart Labs. Between 2011 and 2014, Wal-Mart acquired 15 small companies tied in some way to e-commerce. The other thing most of them had in common was that they were selling for a bargain after failing to attract a new round of venture funding. None of them managed to significantly accelerate Wal-Mart's growth in e-commerce. Will this new strategy prove any more successful? Image source: Wal-Mart. One key difference in Wal-Mart's new acquisition strategy is that the online stores it's buying up will contribute sales directly to Wal-Mart's online sales. Its previous acquisitions largely supported backend technology for growing e-commerce sales organically. Additionally, Wal-Mart's acquisitions are focused specifically on the high end of the market. Wal-Mart's head of e-commerce Marc Lore said the company is specifically pursuing retailers ""in the categories where they are long-tail, high-margin products and harder-to-crack brands."" Wal-Mart has failed to attract those kinds of brands to its flagship store because it's often associated with lower prices and lower quality. Buying up companies like Bonobos or Modcloth will help Wal-Mart sell higher-quality goods at a higher margin. Growth through acquisition isn't a bad strategy. The problem with Wal-Mart's strategy, however, is that these companies are selling for a bargain precisely because their growth is slowing. As such, if Wal-Mart wants its e-commerce sales to keep growing a year from now, it'll have to keep buying up these small e-commerce retailers. On top of that, Wal-Mart could face backlash from these small boutique retailers' loyal customer bases. Numerous consumers threatened to take their business elsewhere on social media since reports surfaced of Bonobos' potential acquisition. What's more, some of the top talent from these companies, such as Bonobos founder Brian Spaly, have already left to go onto more promising projects. So, Wal-Mart won't gain the advantage of bringing on a lot of great talent to support growth of its main e-commerce platforms, either. There's a limit to the number of deals Wal-Mart can find. If it really wants to grow e-commerce, it needs to look for businesses that are selling at a premium because their growth is accelerating. It would cost more upfront, but it would set Wal-Mart up to keep growing e-commerce sales into the future. Jet.com is one such acquisition, which is why it was one of the biggest e-commerce acquisitions in history. By comparison, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been willing to spend big on its acquisitions. It bough Quidsi (diapers.com, soap.com) for $545 million, Zappos for $1.2 billion, Audible for $300 million, and most recently Souq.com (a Middle Eastern marketplace) for $650 million. While its acquisitions don't always work out (it recently shuttered Quidsi), Amazon's willingness to spend has resulted in better growth than Wal-Mart's. In effect, Wal-Mart's new acquisition strategy suffers from the same problem that plagued its old one: The companies it's buying don't support long-term growth. Wal-Mart is spending hundreds of millions on companies that could just cause more headaches than revenue growth down the line, especially as it has to manage a growing basket of brands. Investors should look for commentary from management during Wal-Mart's earnings call about how much e-commerce sales growth is coming from these kinds of acquisitions. In all likelihood, though, management will keep that information close to its vest. ","

Jeremy Bowman,04272017,Fool,04202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The world's largest retailer is flexing its muscles once again. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT), after years of losing market share to rivals like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Costco Wholesale, and dollar store chains, has recommitted to offering the lowest prices on groceries. As part of its strategy to bring customers back into stores and drive sales growth, Wal-Mart is focused on reclaiming its reputation for rock-bottom prices, the bedrock of its ""Save Money. Live Better"" slogan and ""Everyday Low Prices"" promise. Image source: Wal-Mart The move comes as prices at the supermarket are already falling due to food deflation, which has squeezed rivals like Kroger Inc (NYSE:KR), which saw a streak of 52 consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth come to an end last quarter.  Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has put up ten straight quarters of comparable sales growth thanks to efforts to clean up stores and become more price-competitive. Those decisions have cut into profits, but have led to a comeback in Wal-Mart stock, which is up 12% in the last three months. For years, Wal-Mart opened stores across the country, part of a decades-long land grab that propelled the retailer to become the world's biggest company by sales. But the rise of e-commerce and Wal-Mart's own saturation in the U.S have forced the company to shift its strategy. The retail giant has dramatically scaled back its new store openings, choosing instead to invest in improving stores with higher wages, better conditions, more competitive prices, and innovations like online grocery pickup. The company has also aggressively pursued e-commerce acquisitions, in particular by purchasing Jet.com last summer for $3.3. billion. But Wal-Mart also has an edge over rivals like Kroger as it lowers prices. As the biggest retailer in the country and the biggest grocer, Wal-Mart has economies of scale that no other company can match, and greater buying power than any competitor. In addition to slashing prices, Wal-Mart is also squeezing suppliers. At a recent presentation to key vendors, Wal-Mart said it wanted to have the lowest prices on 80% of its products. In order to do that, it's asking those consumer products makers to find a way to shave 15% off of their prices by doing things like cutting back on marketing expenses. In exchange, Wal-Mart is promising increased distribution and other strategic assistance -- but said it would punish brands that resisted it by limiting placement and pushing its own private brands in those categories. In addition to its ability to pressure suppliers, Wal-Mart also has better profit margins than its grocery rivals like Costco, Kroger, and Amazon, even after its recent investments, so it can cut prices more easily than its rivals can. After blockbuster growth for 20 years, Amazon is now bending the retail rules to its desire. Thanks to its Prime membership program, the company's retail sales continue to soar as customers have embraced the convenience of online shopping, especially with the free two-day delivery shipping that comes with Prime. Amazon once built its reputation on low prices, but has increasingly made convenience its greatest proposition while still pushing the perception that it's the lowest-price vendor. This creates an opening for Wal-Mart. The company has been stepping up its challenges to Amazon by offering free two-day shipping on orders over $35, and now discounting some online-only items when shoppers pick them up in stores. Re-establishing itself as the low-price leader may be the best way the company can stave off Amazon as the e-commerce giant focuses on convenience and speed of delivery. Consumers still largely prefer to shop for groceries in-store rather than online, and the frequency of grocery trips means it's a significant driver of customer traffic. Therefore, bringing in more grocery sales should boost sales in other departments as customer traffic increases. Amazon still has plenty of momentum, but Wal-Mart's efforts seem to be reminding the market that it still has its own set of competitive advantages. If it keeps up these tactics, the stock should continue to move higher. ","

For Costco (NASDAQ:COST), success or failure comes down to driving membership sales. Since the chain makes about 75% of its profit from membership fees, it can afford to price its merchandise and services below rival retailers. That's a huge advantage that drives traffic to its stores while reinforcing the value of being a member. If a customer regularly buys an item from the retailer, whether it's breakfast cereal, aspirin, single-serve coffee pods, or even something needed less often like a hearing aid, car tires, or eyeglasses, they become more likely to renew their membership. The biggest driver of that loyalty may be Costco's gas stations, where the chain prices its gasoline dramatically cheaper than its direct competition. In fact, according to new research from CSP Daily News, which partnered with Oil Price Information Service (OPIS), Costco not only has cheaper gas than stations it directly competes with, but it's also less expensive than other warehouse club chains. Low gas prices are a major part of the fuel that powers Costco's engine and likely a key factor in both attracting members and keeping people renewing their memberships. Costco offers cheaper gas than its rivals. Image source: Getty Images. OPIS uses the term ""price differential"" to show how gas at a brand's typical store is priced relative to its direct competition, according to CSP. That differential is then measured in cents per gallon (CPG) and the three major warehouse clubs -- Costco, Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) Sam's Club, and BJ's -- ranked Nos. 1, 3, and 4, respectively, in terms of having the biggest price differential. BJ's came in fourth place on CSP's Fuels 50: 10 Low-Price Leaders list, scoring a 10.91 CPG price differential while Sam's Club took second place at 11.47 CPG. Costco blew its two rivals out of the water, delivering a 20.88 CPG differential, a large enough difference that consumers likely notice and it may be the deciding factor to go with one chain over the other. OPIS Global Head of Energy Analysis Tom Kloza explained that Costco has ""the greatest ability to buy cheap and smart."" He added that the company's 500 gas stations made over $9 billion in 2016 fuel sales in 2016. ""We all know if there was a market-efficiency rating for Costco, it would be off the charts,"" Kloza was quoted as saying. ""Fuel serves as a lure to sell memberships, where the real money is made. Gas is the magic elixir for that company. It really props up the frequency -- and for Costco, it's all about the frequency."" The more a shopper visits Costco (or any other warehouse club), the more likely he or she is to see value in being a member. Gas is a recurring purchase that brings people to Costco and once they are there, in at least some cases, a member will park, enter the store, and make other purchases. Costco has made a strategic decision to use gasoline as a lure, a perk designed to attract and retain members. It's doing so more aggressively than even BJ's or Sam's Club -- a smart decision since consumers cannot gas up their cars on the internet. Cheap gas on its own likely keeps some people renewing their membership year after year while it's an important piece of the puzzle for others. ","

Amazon is reportedly working out the kinks so it can roll out its cashierless convenience store concept, called Amazon Go, which automatically charges people when they exit rather than make them wait in line to pay. This is a step into the brick-and-mortar world of grocery retailing. It makes sense to try to sell groceries to people this way, as only an estimated 23% of households in the U.S. shopped for groceries online last year, and this channel accounted for just an estimated 4.3% of the total grocery spending in 2016. One estimate puts online sales at only 20% of grocery sales by 2025, so Amazon is smart both to provide people with physical stores where they can buy food (Amazon Go) and to build up the distribution network that supports AmazonFresh, which lets people order groceries online and pick them up in person. AmazonFresh is being tested in Seattle, where it's allowing customers to purchase grocery items online and then select a time for pick-up, which can be in as little as 15 minutes. The customer drives to the pick-up location, where service agents will load the items into the car. This model allows Amazon to build a hyperlocal presence, which will be useful in helping it tap the offline grocery market. Image Source: Amazon. Amazon, however, is moving into a market where it will run into stiff competition from established big-box retailers. Citi Research believes that Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is the best-placed company to take advantage of online grocery retail. Wal-Mart has a solid lead in the online grocery market, as its ""click-and-collect"" model (which lets people order online and pick up in store) is currently present across 600 locations in more than 100 markets in the U.S. Perhaps more importantly, Citi research reported by CNBC showed that Wal-Mart items were much cheaper than AmazonFresh's. However, investors need to understand that the e-tailer doesn't need to become a leader in the online grocery market. Amazon's top line will receive a nice boost even if it corners a small percentage of the market for food-at-home items estimated to be $100 billion  by 2025. And taking away market share from smaller grocery players -- perhaps those in the organic-foods market, where higher prices are more accepted -- is an ideal game plan. This could be a potentially fertile ground for the online retailer, as the global organic-foods market is estimated to grow at 16.6% a year until 2025, putting it at an estimated $456 billion. Even if only a fifth of those sales were made online, that could still be a big market. ","

Kline,04272017,Fool,04202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime continues to grow in the United States. In fact, according to data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), membership to the program that costs $99 a year or $10.99 a month has doubled in the United States over the last two years. The research firm estimates that Amazon now has 80 million U.S. Prime members. That's an increase from an estimated 58 million members at the end of the same period in 2016, or 38% growth in a single year. Amazon itself does not provide a Prime enrollment count. ""While slower growth is expected as it reaches natural limits, Amazon had a surprisingly strong quarter,"" according to CIRP founder Josh Lowitz, who was quoted in a press release. ""Membership grew 8% in the most recent quarter, compared to 7% growth on a smaller base in the year-ago quarter ending in March 2016."" Amazon has its own fleet of planes. Image source: Amazon. While Amazon has expanded Prime's offerings to include its streaming video and audio services, its core benefit remains free two-day shipping. That's a perk that not only draws people to the service, it encourages them to use it. Because of that, Prime members spend an average of $1,300 a year compared to the $700 annually spent by Amazon customers who do not join Prime, CIRP reported. About 60% of Amazon's total customer base in the U.S. pays for Prime, according to CIRP. The service's continued growth has likely been fueled by the online retailer offering the option to pay for it monthly, rather than plunking down $99 all at once. Of course, $10.99 times 12 equals $133.88, so not paying up front will cost you quite a bit more, but clearly that works for some people. Just over one quarter (26%) of U.S. Prime members have opted for the monthly charge, according to CIRP. That payment option has been around for just over a year. ""We think that the monthly membership option appeals to the later Prime adopters, with a smaller, potentially temporary commitment, that ultimately yields a long term commitment,"" said Lowitz. ""With smaller dollar, single month decisions, the new plan winds up helping with retention rates, which already average 85% for a member renewing after their first year."" The more a person takes advantage of using his or her Prime membership for free shipping, the better value it becomes for him or her. That encourages people to shop on Amazon whenever possible, which makes it hard for any broad retailer to compete with the company. Because of that, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon's closest competitor, dropped its own $50-a-year Prime-like ShippingPass program and now offers free two-day delivery on any qualifying order over $35. That's a bold, expensive bet by Wal-Mart to try to get non-Prime members to shop on WalMart.com, and perhaps to convince Prime members they don't need to pay a fee for free shipping. The problem for Wal-Mart is that being able to order pretty much anything you want for two-day delivery without having to hit a price threshold makes Prime very attractive. In addition to not requiring a minimum order, Prime also has over 50 million available items while Wal-Mart's free shipping offer only has a little over 2 million. Amazon has also tied some customers to the Prime ecosystem by adding further convenience with its DASH, single-click, Internet-connected ordering buttons and by enabling purchasing through voice command with its Alexa-equipped devices. DASH buttons go near where consumable items are used, allowing consumers to place orders for things like dish-washing liquid or toilet paper before they run out. Alexa is in Amazon's Echo family of devices, which can be addressed with simple voice commands that can make buying as simple as talking. Prime growth may level off and even stop at some point as Amazon saturates the U.S. market. It's hard, however, to envision a scenario where Wal-Mart, or any other competitor, takes away a meaningful chunk of business or consumers start opting to not renew Prime. Amazon has set the standard for reliable two-day shipping and for having a wide selection of available items. It has also continually sweetened the deal for Prime members with added perks like its video and audio services as well as a number of lesser-known add-ons including unlimited photo storage, one- or two-hour delivery in some markets, and many more.

Longtime Fool readers are no doubt familiar with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company revolutionized the book distribution business, then most of retail, then logistics, then corporate infrastructure with its cloud business; it is currently setting its sights on India, TV and film, drones, artificial intelligence, and just about everything else under the sun. Since the company is in so many industries and has a high-profile CEO who now owns a newspaper and a rocket business, it can be easy to get caught up in the daily headlines. Still, with the company at all-time highs, current and prospective investors may want to step back and appreciate the big picture. Here are a few charts that show why Amazon is amazing. Image source: Getty Images. The following chart looks unlike any other company I've come across, except for Netflix. That should terrify any retailer, especially those who have traditionally, you know, delivered profits, buybacks, and dividends to investors. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos once said, ""Your margin is my opportunity,"" and he wasn't kidding: AMZN Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts. As you can see, Amazon has never indulged shareholders with GAAP profits. Therefore, it never has to take them away. This freedom from margins means that Amazon can go into just about any business it wants and disrupt it from below. Given that the company is branching out into basically anything related to retail or technology, it's a wide-open space Amazon can explore, equipped with the fastest horse. The next chart shows Amazon taking sales from mall-based and other power-center retailers (Wal-Mart is left off since its $450 billion sales would skew the chart). As you can see, competitors' lines are relatively flat: AMZN Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts. Meanwhile, Amazon seems to be soaking up the extra sales, as the undisputed leader in e-commerce. While other stores are also investing in omnichannel and boosting their own online strategies, they're all playing catch-up. Now Amazon is contemplating opening brick-and-mortar stores, taking on legacy retailers on their home turf: the in-store experience. Given Amazon's rabid focus on customer satisfaction, you can bet there will be something interesting about the Amazon bookstore coming to a town near you. Amazon now has a cash cow, and it's scary: AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a small business relative to the retail segment, but it is growing like wildfire and earns 26% operating margins. In the most recent quarter, AWS grew a whopping 47% and now sports a $14 billion run rate: Data: Synergy Research. Chart by Author. As the chart above shows, AWS is the dominant first-mover in the industry. And while the secret is out that cloud computing is the future, competitors have not made a dent. The industry seems to be coalescing around AWS and services from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and IBM (NYSE:IBM). This is leading to what is known as an oligopoly with a strong secular tailwind -- a profitable combination indeed. According to Gartner, the IaaS (infrastructure as a service) industry is set to grow 37% this year, and will continue torrid growth for the foreseeable future. If AWS can just maintain its share, Amazon looks like it will have even more cash to deploy into new markets and opportunities. Bottom line: Amazon's unique record of reinvestment and experimentation is a formidable advantage, and it is not slowing down. ","
      
    3 Charts That Show Why Amazon is Amazing -- The Motley Fool

Jeremy Bowman,04272017,Fool,04202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Activist hedge fund Jana Partners took a stake in Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:WFM) earlier this month, wondering who might want to buy the natural grocery chain. Amazon, which is aggressively pursuing a number of options in the grocery space, reportedly considered making a play at Whole Foods last fall but decided against it. News outlets now say that Amazon is considering a deal with BJ's Wholesale Club in the $4 billion range. And a Credit Suisse analyst made a pitch for Kroger to take over Whole Foods, saying the country's largest traditional grocer could pay in the range of $40-$45 per share for the organic grocery chain. Kroger, which owns a number of banners, including Ralph's, King Sooper's, and Harris Teeter, may seem like the most logical suitor for Whole Foods, as the company has a strong track record of acquisitions and has the size to absorb Whole Foods and benefit from potential synergies. However, there are a number of reasons why a deal would not make sense for Kroger. Image source: The Motley Fool. Whole Foods has posted six straight quarterly declines in comparable sales, and foresees no immediate end to the streak, as the company is forecasting a same-store sales drop for its current fiscal year. Kroger is a big reason for the recent struggles that have punished Whole Foods' stock price and opened the door for an activist investor like Jana to come in. Kroger, and other rivals like Costco and Trader Joe's, have poached Whole Foods customers by aggressively expanding into organic foods and undercutting Whole Foods on price. Kroger launched its own in-house organic brand, Simple Truth, in 2013, and grew to more than $1 billion in sales in just two years. Considering Whole Foods' own revenue is just around $16 billion, that move alone has likely pinched it, and Whole Foods has not found an adequate response to its new competition. Why would Kroger want to spend $12 billion or more on a rival it's already beating? Whole Foods has only around 500 locations, but unlike most grocery banners it has a national footprint. The company targets upscale neighborhoods across the country, and many of its stores compete directly with Kroger brands. According to Credit Suisse analyst Edward Kelly, about 60% of Whole Foods stores are located within 10 miles of a Kroger banner. Kelly sees this as a positive for a merger, as it would create marginal savings on distribution -- but with Kroger already taking sales from Whole Foods, buying stores whose sales it can just pilfer with its own nearby locations seems like a mistake. Furthermore, despite already having 2,800 locations nationwide, Kroger still has plenty of white space in the U.S., notably in the Upper Midwest, Florida, and the Northeast. Those states where it is not represented make up more than a quarter of the U.S. population. Acquiring a banner in one of those regions, like Fairway, Acme, or Publix, would make a lot more sense than taking over Whole Foods. Such a deal would help Kroger avoid overpenetrating states like Colorado, its most densely populated market, where it already has one store for approximately every 38,000 people. Colorado is also one of Whole Foods' most densely penetrated markets, with 20 stores in the Rocky Mountain state, and the company recently said it would close two of its locations there, a sign it may have overexpanded. Kroger isn't exactly without its own problems. Its own stock dipped when the company recently posted its first decline in comparable sales in thirteen years due to food deflation and pressure from Wal-Mart, and the company is busy making investments in lower prices to expand its Clicklist grocery pick-up program, and to remodel and integrate its recent acquisition of Roundy's. With just $322 million in cash on its balance sheet and $14 billion in debt, Kroger isn't exactly well positioned to absorb a major acquisition like Whole Foods, and using its stock to pay for such a deal seems ill-advised as shares have fallen more than 25% since their peak at the end of 2015. Whole Foods also carries a much higher earnings multiple than Kroger, meaning the company would lose out twice in a stock-based deal, paying nearly twice as much for Whole Foods' earnings. For now, Kroger would be better off focusing its attention on shoring up its own business than taking on another banner. If the company becomes interested in making another acquisition, it would be better off focusing on new markets rather than absorbing a company with which 60% of its stores already overlap. Who knows if Whole Foods will wind up in someone else's hands -- but Kroger's management should know better. ","
      
    Kroger Has No Business Buying Whole Foods -- The Motley Fool

Brian Stoffel,04272017,Fool,04202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The past few weeks have seen shares of Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM) advance over 25% on speculation that the company might sell itself. Jana Partners took an 8.8% position in the company, and there are rumors that Amazon and Kroger (NYSE:KR) could be potential suitors. It wouldn't be shocking to see such a move. Over the past decade, the industry has seen massive consolidation: Harris Teeter, Roundy's, Safeway, and Supervalu's grocery stores have all gone private or been acquired. And they all went for premium prices. Image source: Pixabay But an acquisition is far from a sure thing. And potential acquirers and shareholders alike have a host of issues to worry about. These are the three biggest. Let's go back 10 years. In 2007, some chains were dipping their toes in the organic pool, but tepidly. Then, the Great Recession hit and all the interest in the niche went out the window. While Whole Foods had its own struggles, it was a huge benefactor: it had the entire organic sandbox to itself. Data source: Annual Reports That success, however, didn't go unnoticed. Competition soon followed: Costco, Wal-Mart and -- most importantly with its private label -- Kroger all became huge vendors of organic fare. Just as importantly, they were doing it cheaper than Whole Foods. Back in 2011, while Whole Foods had a reputation for high prices, it still offered organic goods for less than the competition. But just two years later, that advantage had vanished into thin air. The problem was simple: commoditization. There's nothing Whole Foods does that other grocers can't. As demand for organic goods has grown, more and more farmers around the world have signed on. But they aren't all beholden to Whole Foods, and if the Krogers of the world can offer the same thing for less money -- and they have far more convenient locations to shop at -- then Whole Foods is plumb out of luck. That's exactly what's happened at the company. Data source: Annual Reports In the fact, one recent analyst estimated that Whole Foods had lost 14 million customers over the past 18 months, mostly to Krogers. Whole Foods rightly earned the ""Whole Paycheck"" moniker. For a long time, that wasn't a bad thing: the company enjoyed profit margins other grocers could only dream of. After the cost of goods, employee salaries, real estate, electricity, and everything else involved in running a store are factored in, the average grocer will be lucky if it can pocket $0.02 for every dollar spent as profit -- a 2% margin. But Whole Foods routinely doubled that mark. Once competition came in, however, the company got serious about ""investments in price."" That's Wall Street talk for simply lowering the prices of your goods. When you combine that dip with slower traffic, this is what happens to your profit margins. Data source: Annual and quarterly reports. MRQ=Most Recent Quarter In essence, this means that the amount of cash Whole Foods gets to keep as profit has dipped over 50% since 2013! At the same time, management has made odd long-term financial decisions. After eschewing debt following the Great Recession, the company decided to take on $1 billion in low-interest loans. Obviously, that could help expand the pace of store openings, and perhaps be used for nationwide marketing. Instead, it was used for dividends and share buybacks. Even as a former shareholder, that was a real head-scratcher. It seemed the company was more focused on propping up the stock for the short-term than in creating long-term value. Perhaps there was dissent in the C-Suite over this, because shortly thereafter co-CEO Walter Robb stepped down. That left founder John Mackey (who is also on The Motley Fool's board of directors) as the lone CEO. Since then, he has signaled that instead of trying to gain market share at all costs, Whole Foods would return to focusing on high-end clients. That's probably a good move, as it's the one area where Whole Foods' brand name can function as a moat and differentiator from the competition. Under normal circumstances, I might even consider buying shares. I like the new focus, and the fact that Mackey is calling the shots. However, shares are simply too expensive: they trade for 27 times future earnings, and 29 times trailing free cash flow. For a company with negative comps, that's far too much. Shareholders might luck out if potential suitors see the situation differently, but if that doesn't happen, there's still a host of problems to worry about as the company undergoes its transition to Whole Foods 2.0.

Rex Nutting,04272017,MarketWatch,04202017,"Published: Apr 27, 2017 9:38 a.m. ET Trickle-down economics has failed to deliver stronger growth By In his desperation to show everyone what a productive 100 days he’s having, Donald Trump is rushing out a tax-cut plan that’s still in the rough-draft stage. It’s so poorly thought out that even tax-cut-loving congressional Republicans like Paul Ryan are aghast. That’s not to say that some kind of big tax cut won’t get through Congress this year; it’s that this plan cooked up by Trump’s Wall Street financiers — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and economic adviser Gary Cohn — is laughably tone deaf to the economic, political and procedural realities. That’s what you get when you fill an administration with people who have zero experience in running a government or in getting legislation through the complex gauntlet of Congress. There’s a reason that Paul Ryan was supposed to take the lead on tax policy — he knows the ropes. The Mnuchin-Cohn-Trump plan fails on so many levels. Its rosy economic assumptions have been disproved countless times. It would shower trillions of dollars on the very few people who are already sitting on trillions of dollars. It would create huge incentives for the wealthy to evade paying taxes. It would cripple the federal government’s ability to pay for the goods and services people want and need. It would violate pledges made by both Trump and Mnuchin that the benefits of tax reform would be focused on the working people of this country. And it would drive the federal deficit higher, and would thus be almost impossible to pass given the budget constraints Congress has imposed upon itself. Also read: The failure of supply-side tax cuts Other than that, it’s a great plan. The central deceit of the Mnuchin-Cohn tax plan is it’s based on the delusion that cutting taxes for the “job creators” will unleash a flood of economic growth. Mnuchin, fresh from his second career of producing Hollywood fantasies, is now promoting a sequel to the failed “Trickle-Down Economics” franchise of the 1980s and 2000s. The Laffer curve might have made sense in 1962 when John F. Kennedy cut the top marginal tax rate from 91% to 70%, but since then cutting taxes on the rich has never stimulated the growth that was predicted. To get some political cover, the Mnuchin tax plan tries to give everyone some tax relief, but the benefits are highly skewed to the top 1%. And that leads to the second deception in the administration’s plan: major middle-class tax relief. After 36 years of tax cuts, there’s not that much left to cut, at least on the income-tax side. About 40% of families pay nothing, or get more back than they pay in federal taxes. Families in the middle fifth (by definition, the middle class) pay an effective income-tax rate of less than 3%. These families pay much more in payroll taxes, excise taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, and state income taxes than they do in federal income taxes. The federal income tax really only starts to bite hard when you get to the top 20% (who pay an effective rate of about 16%, or to the top 1% (which pays 24%). Which only makes sense, because these are the lucky few who have money. Mnuchin promises the tax revenue that would be lost by lowering the tax rate for business income to 15% would be magically offset by the revenues produced by higher growth. He says sustained 3% growth is “absolutely” within reach, but his assumptions fail the smell test. Mnuchin can’t even talk about his plan with a straight face. Getting to 3% growth and staying there would require a burst of productivity growth that’s never been seen in this country before. The administration is banking on tax cuts and deregulation to deliver that productivity revolution, but there’s no historical evidence that either policy can deliver the magnitude of investment that would be needed. Also from Rex Nutting: The only way to get to 3% growth is to hire more Mexicans The fact is, corporations aren’t constrained currently by the supply of capital. They have plenty of capital, either sitting on their books or cheaply gotten in the financial markets. But they are not investing very much, not because taxes are too high or because regulations are crippling them, but because they don’t see demand growing. America’s two biggest long-term economic problems are that we have too much idle capital and too much inequality. The Mnuchin-Cohn-Trump plan to fix those problems is to give more capital to those who are idly sitting on it now, and to increase the gap between the ultra-rich and everyone else. Nobody thinks the tax code is perfect. There is plenty of room for discussion and compromise on real tax reform that would simplify the process and get rid of some of the many distortions in the tax code. The corporate tax code in particular is a total mess — yet Mnuchin and Cohn offered up zero examples of corporate tax loopholes that should go. Here’s a bipartisan idea to reform the corporate tax code. But as long as the people of this country demand Social Security, health care, a strong military, public investment in education, new technologies and infrastructure, and all the other public goodies, we’re going to have to figure out how to pay for it. And that means the ultra-rich will have to keep paying, because that’s where the money is. ",Trump rushes out a tax plan based on a deception - MarketWatch

Mayumi Negishi,04272017,MarketWatch,04202017,"Published: Apr 27, 2017 8:18 a.m. ET By TOKYO--In a sign of how Amazon.com Inc. is reshaping online shopping globally, Yahoo Japan shares plummeted Thursday after it warned of a big increase in marketing costs as it struggles to compete with the Seattle juggernaut. Yahoo Japan, a joint venture between SoftBank Corp. and Yahoo Inc., is the country's biggest search portal but has been squeezed in e-commerce as Amazon benefits from years of aggressive investment in Japan, including splurging on warehouses and robots to launch its Amazon Prime same-day delivery services. Amazon's net sales in Japan, its biggest overseas market after Germany, rose more than 30% to nearly $11 billion in 2016. Japan accounts for nearly 8% of its total sales and almost a quarter of its international sales. Yahoo Japan scrapped vendor and transaction-based fees in 2013 in a bid to woo more sellers. Its revenue from ads on its shopping site for the business year ended in March was $155 million. Bigger local rival Rakuten Inc.'s e-commerce sales in Japan totaled $2.8 billion last year. ""We are at a critical juncture,"" Yahoo Japan President Manabu Miyasaka said after the company announced it would raise its marketing budget for this business year by 44% to $458 million, helping squeeze profit by as much as $270 million compared with the year just ended. ""We need to be aggressive."" Following the announcement, its share price dropped 10%. Yahoo Japan had a reputation for double-digit profit margins through 2015, but the company is facing tapering revenues from ads and its auction site. The earnings downgrade represents a permanent shift in operating-profit margins, said Macquarie's David Gibson, who cut the stock from ""Outperform"" to ""Neutral"" following the announcement. Even analysts with Buy recommendations say it may take time for the marketing push to make an impact in revenue. Yahoo Japan's scrapping of fees charged to vendors sent prices lower and demand higher throughout the online-shopping sector. But the fight for consumers is now also being complicated by a dire shortage in delivery services, the result of a tight labor market. A jump in parcel volume and a controversy over unpaid overtime to drivers has forced courier Yamato Transport Co. to consider halting same-day delivery service for Amazon. Another drag on Yahoo Japan's stock are questions about what will happens to the shares owned by Yahoo Inc. after Verizon completes its purchase of Yahoo's core internet operations. That 35.6% stake in Yahoo Japan will fall into the hands of a holding company called Altaba. Mr. Miyasaka said the strategic relationship that existed between Yahoo and Yahoo Japan wouldn't change.

                                   and other companies as needing to do to remain in what he calls “day 1” mode. By examining the flaws he sees in “day 2” companies, it can be inferred that “day 1” companies remain relevant and are able to adapt to change. He suggested four essentials: customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends and high-velocity decision-making. It’s a compelling read, but I would like to push this further. The way I read it, the Amazon founder and CEO encourages others (and certainly his team) to individually and institutionally apply strategic thinking that focuses on how to uniquely deliver more value to your customers, and, in doing so, embrace external trends with a strong bias toward action and a desire to avoid getting weighed down by processes. That inspires a provocative question: Can large companies be successful with less process and more delegated strategic thinking? It wasn’t until the late 1970s, more than 50 years after McKinsey started to consult companies to help them improve performance, that the firm established a functional practice focusing on strategy. In launching the new practice, its new leaders undertook an ambitious research to study how leading companies develop their strategy. In a fascinating paper by a previous generation of McKinsey members published in 1978, long before Amazon existed, we suggested such an approach can be highly effective — i.e., driving creative strategic thinking without a comprehensive top-down planning regime (which has been adopted by most companies ever since). To underscore how companies, and not only Amazon, can be successful that way, I slightly simplify, adapt and focus on a few of the findings, which was republished in an article in the year 2000, “Think Strategically.” Read: How Amazon will become the first $1 trillion stock Interestingly, formal strategic planning wasn’t so common in the 1970s. The authors noted that many companies enjoyed considerable success without advancing beyond the rudimentary levels of strategic development. Annual budgeting was the dominant and often the only formal planning process. The point wasn’t that most companies didn’t have a strategy. Rather, the quality of the strategy of a company without a formal process depended largely on the vigor of its CEO and other top executives. Do they have a good feel for the competition? Did they know their own cost structures? If the answer to such questions was yes, then perhaps there was no advantage to formal strategic planning. In reality, the authors noted, when companies start to manage a more complex portfolio of activities, the informal approach is unlikely to work at a corporate level. Digging deeper, they discovered that successful companies managed to carefully and thoroughly link strategic and operational decision making absent the process but with the prevalence of five management attributes: The authors said that fostering and rewarding widespread strategic thinking does not mean that every manager is expected to become a brilliant strategic thinker. They proposed four rules to what strategic thinking should be (the bold part is unedited, as written nearly 40 years ago): Strategic thinking seeks hard, fact-based, logical information. Strategists should be uncomfortable with vague concepts like “soft synergy,” and not accept generalized theories of economic behavior. They should try to understand the underlying specific dynamics relevant for their business in unbiased way. Strategic thinking questions everyone’s unquestioned assumptions. Where competitors may see constraints, creative strategic thinkers will seek opportunities.

                                   first found business opportunities where their competitors thought the opportunities weren’t viable. Strategic thinking is characterized by an all-pervasive unwillingness to expend resources. A strategist is always looking for opportunities to win at low or, better, no cost. Strategic thinking is usually indirect and unexpected rather than head-on and predictable. The authors cite what is often seen as the origins of strategy to illustrate this point with a quote from Basil Henry Liddell Hart about military strategy: “In strategy, the longest way around is often the shortest way home.” No large company can completely avoid bureaucracy or fully trust its middle management to think strategically all, or even most, of the time. Yet it’s rare and refreshing to see companies of significant size boldly pursue a recipe that was once more common — unleashing and harnessing the full scope of its talent to think strategically, on day 1 and ideally every day of the week.

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"The International Organization for Standardization (ISO)  developed the so-called anti-corruption compliance program and Wal-Mart is hoping to be the first U.S. company to get certified under it, said Jay Jorgensen, Wal-Mart’s executive vice president and global chief ethics and compliance officer. “We have begun looking for a company that would certify us,” Jorgensen told the Thomson Reuters Financial and Risk Summit in New York. The ISO is the world’s largest developer and publisher of international standards. Jorgensen added that Wal-Mart was interested in seeing the program develop in the United States, with the government laying out its own anti-corruption compliance framework or adopting ISO standards to help protect companies that follow it and defend themselves if something goes wrong. Jorgensen also shared a recent development in which federal agencies have contacted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer about compliance programs. “Over the past couple of months ... some of the federal agencies have reached out to say ‘hey do you have any feedback for us, anything we are doing is unreasonable?,’” Jorgensen said. Wal-Mart has given feedback to federal agencies and will continue doing so and the company would also be open to speaking with state regulators about compliance, he said. Jorgensen cited an example of how a broken baby shampoo bottle in California is treated as hazardous waste that retailers have to dispose off through an incinerator. “We would love it if California would say ‘hey we would like some feedback,” Jorgensen said. Jorgensen, who joined Wal-Mart in 2012, has been instrumental in revamping Wal-Mart’s compliance systems around the world and building a dedicated ethics and compliance team. That team has a staff of over 2,300, including over 500 in the United States and over 1,800 in international markets. Since 2013, Wal-Mart has invested more than $141 million in global ethics and compliance systems, Jorgensen said. More recently, Wal-Mart has created licensing teams that monitor the more than 56,000 licenses and permits Wal-Mart needs to operate in global markets using a centralized licensing system that reduces the error of wrongdoing and increases transparency, he said. For the last four years, the Wal-Mart board’s compensation committee has conditioned a portion of its most senior executives’ compensation on making adequate progress toward annual compliance goals. In its latest compliance report, Wal-Mart said it has achieved over 200 of these board-level objectives, including over 60 that relate specifically to its anti-corruption program. Wal-Mart’s ethics and compliance system came into focus after a New York Times report in 2012 found Wal-Mart had engaged in a multi-year bribery campaign to build its Wal-Mart de Mexico business. This was followed by an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into potential misconduct by Wal-Mart, including violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in some overseas markets including China, Brazil, India and Mexico. In October, Wal-Mart rebuffed a proposal by U.S. prosecutors to pay at least $600 million to settle a corruption probe into the company’s practices in markets including Mexico, India and China. So far Wal-Mart has spent about $800 million on legal fees and an internal investigation into the alleged payments and to revamp its compliance systems around the world. ","

Variety urged U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle in Raleigh, North Carolina to order Walmart to pay treble damages for selling barbecue grills the judge previously found willfully infringed on Variety’s “Backyard BBQ” trademark. If granted, Variety’s motion would put Walmart on the hook for $98 million in damages. To read the full story on WestlawNext Practitioner Insights, click here: bit.ly/2p2BNP7 ","

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese consumer backlash against genetically modified (GMO) crops is beginning to dent demand for soy oil, the nation’s main cooking oil, and could spell crisis for the multi-billion-dollar crushing industry, which depends on GMO soybeans from the United States and elsewhere. Soyoil sales account for about 36 percent of cooking oils used in Chinese kitchens, more than three times the next highest, and most of it is made from imported soybeans, which are nearly all genetically modified. The Chinese government says GM foods are as safe as conventional foods, but wealthier urban consumers are replacing soyoil with sunflower, peanut or sesame, all free of biotech raw materials. A Nielsen survey last year showed about 70 percent of consumers in China limited or avoided at least some foods or ingredients, compared with a global average of 64 percent, with 57 percent naming GMOs as undesirable. “Everyone says soyoil has GMOs,” said Mr Liu, a 70-year-old Beijinger, shopping with his wife in Walmart. “Better not eat too much. Apparently they’re not safe. It’s like those hormones. I’m just as afraid of eating GMOs as hormones.” That sentiment is already hurting retail sales. Supermarket sales of soy oil fell 1 percent last year to 35.7 billion yuan ($5.19 billion), data from Euromonitor shows, versus growth of between 2 and 6 percent for alternatives. “Non-GMO oil is gradually replacing (soy oil),” said Johnny An, supply chain director at food-service firm Aramark, which serves meals in banks, government offices and schools in more than 60 Chinese cities. A few years ago, 10-20 percent of Aramark’s customers asked for GMO-free oil, he said. Now it’s more than half. The mood is causing headaches for crushers, said Paul Burke, Asia director at the U.S. Soybean Export Council, forcing them to find new markets for their soyoil, though it had not yet had a noticeable impact on bean imports, as demand for soymeal used for animal feed, the larger byproduct of soybean crush, is still robust as China expands its livestock industry. The Nielsen survey found that more than four in five Chinese shoppers would be prepared to pay more for GMO-free products, and a 5-litre bottle of GM-free soy oil already sells at a 20 percent premium to GMO oil, but that isn’t translating into a boon for the nation’s soybean crushers. China is the world’s top soyoil consumer - it will use 16 million tonnes this year - but the crushers rely on the United States and Brazil, which grow GM-soybeans, for 86 percent of China’s 84 million tonnes of soybean imports. In China, which does not permit planting of GMO soybeans, labor costs are high and productivity low on small farms, making non-GMO beans costly to grow. They sell for a third more than non-GMO beans planted elsewhere. Processors such as China Agri Industries, a unit of food and grains trader COFCO and one of the country’s top crushers, told Reuters it needs to improve its sourcing of non-GMO materials, to meet “escalating market demand”. In the meantime, processors are losing money as increased competition with other edible oils and a ballooning glut has pushed soyoil futures in China down 18 percent so far this year to multi-year lows. Some crushers are taking radical steps to find more GMO-free beans. Henan Sunshine Oils and Fats wants to buy as much as 15,000 hectares of land in Ukraine to grow and process crops such as non-GMO soybeans, rapeseed and sunflowers, said Yang Renyi, group vice-president and general manager of the international affairs department. That would be a very large plot; in the United States, the largest farms average around 1,052 hectares. Yang’s team made two trips to Ukraine last year to look into the feasibility of producing, storing and processing oilseeds there. “If we managed to get a large area of land to grow oilseeds, we possibly will spend at least 200-300 million yuan there,” said Yang. Non-GMO oils - mainly rapeseed and sesame - already account for a fifth of the firm’s sales since it started marketing the new offering late last year, he added. The shift in attitude against GMOs in China has been fueled by social media and campaigning by high-profile personalities. The agriculture ministry has sought to assuage consumers’ fears, launching education campaigns and banning advertising that promotes non-GMO products as healthier. But years of food scares have shaken consumers’ faith in Beijing’s ability to guarantee the safety of the nation’s food supply. Cooking oil is a particularly sensitive topic after a scandal over the use of recycled oil known as gutter oil, a few years ago, so shoppers are wary. “Before everyone said soybean oil has GMOs, now the advertising is all about non-GMO soyoil. But we still don’t buy it,” said Maxine Li, a 28-year old bank worker, shopping at the same Walmart. “We think peanut oil is a bit healthier.” For a graphic on retail sales of edible oils in China, click: reut.rs/2q9CQwc For a graphic on China edible oil production, consumption, imports and stocks, click: reut.rs/2oNTwW7 ","

Craig Adeyanju,05042017,Investopedia,04272017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), in conjunction with Ria Money Transfer and American Express, this week announced plans to make it cheaper for its customers to transfer money via its Walmart2Walmart money transfer service. (See also: Wal-Mart CEO's Compensation Increases to $22.4M.) The Walmart2Walmart service,  powered by Ria, was launched three years ago this week. To celebrate the third anniversary, Wal-Mart introduced new fees that, according to the retailer, will allow customers save between 20% and 90% on domestic money transfers compared to what Western Union Co. (WU) offers. In addition, the retailer is partnering with American Express to launch the Bluebird2Walmart money transfer service, a service that would allow Bluebird account holders to send money digitally for a recipient to pick up cash at a Wal-Mart store. Bluebird is an online checking account alternative offered by American Express. The Bluebird2Walmart service, due to launch in May, is also powered by Ria. The retailer reiterated that the cost of the Bluebird2Walmart service is similar to the new Walmart2Walmart prices. This announcement represents the second time this year that Wal-Mart has made moves to bolster its money services business. In March, the retailer rolled out improvements to the Walmart App, allowing its money services customers to enter their transaction details digitally. Customers were previously required to fill out paperwork at stores. It also introduced an “express lane” to allow its money-services customers complete their transactions faster. In its fiscal year 2017 10-K filing, Wal-Mart noted that other services, including fuel and financial services, offered in the U.S. account for less than 1% of its annual net sales. Given the insignificant contribution of its money services to its top line and the stiffening competition in the retail space, Wal-Mart is likely offering lower-cost money transfer to attract more foot traffic and accumulate data. Earlier this year, the retailer announced a partnership with CarSaver to sell cars. The peak revenue Wal-Mart can garner from the car sales partnership is also insignificant.

Tae Kim,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"Pacific Crest lowered its rating on Amazon to sector weight from overweight, citing increasing competition and ""moderating"" growth rates in its businesses.The company's shares are up 4 percent in Friday premarket trading after it reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings Thursday after the market close.  ""Amazon's 1Q17 results were impressive. However, the stock is approaching our $961 target and stepped-up competition may dampen near-term upside,"" analyst Edward Yruma wrote in a note to clients Thursday titled ""As good as it gets (for now)."" ""1P [first party] growth rates point to moderating sales growth, and retail competition is intensifying. Nevertheless, we remain constructive long term and would look for a more-attractive entry point,"" he added. First party represents the e-commerce business where Amazon sells products directly to customers. The internet company also has a third-party business, where other firms can sell goods on Amazon's website.The analyst cited how Amazon's first-party sales grew 16 percent in the first quarter compared to 16 percent in the fourth quarter and 21 percent in 2016's first quarter. In addition, Amazon Web Services [cloud computing] growth slowed in the first quarter to 43 percent from 47 percent in the fourth quarter, while Microsoft's cloud business grew 93 percent in the March quarter. Wall Street downgrades are a rarity for a beloved stock like Amazon. In fact, it hasn't received a downgrade from a major sell-side firm in over a year until Raymond James lowered its rating earlier this week, according to Street Account. Just seven of 40 analysts have hold ratings on the internet retailer, while 33 rate it buy or overweight, according to FactSet. No analysts have a sell rating.The analyst retracted his previous $961 price target for Amazon, which represented 5 percent upside from Thursday's close. He did not provide a new target. Amazon is one of the market's best performing stocks, with its shares up 22.5 percent this year through Thursday compared with the S&P 500's 7 percent return. The stock is also up 53 percent in the past 12 months. ""Moderating 1P and 3P trends could be a headwind for revenue and profitability growth. We believe that Walmart's aggressive stance in e-commerce makes it a much more formidable competitor,"" he wrote. ",Amazon downgraded after strong earnings because this is ‘as good as it gets’
Alex Rosenberg,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"When asked if stocks are overvalued, Nobel laureate Robert Shiller supplies a simple answer: ""yes."" But that doesn't mean equities are set to dive. Evidence that stocks may be richly priced is easy to find. Shiller's cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, which compares the current value of equities to inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years, is at levels not seen except for the years surrounding 1929 and 2000. And at 29, the ratio is higher than its highest level before the Great Recession. Still, Shiller makes it clear this doesn't necessarily suggest that investors should sell stocks. ""I'm not saying pull out of the market — I'm saying that it looks dangerous now,"" the Yale economics professor said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""But it could keep going up."" After all, ""if you go back to 1998, you'll find that the CAPE ratio was about the same as now, and it kept going up for two more years. It got up to something like 45 in the year 2000. So we could go back up there. And we're in an oddball-enough mood now that we might,"" Shiller said, referring to excitement surrounding President Donald Trump. ""The magic of the Trump story is that it gets stronger than any other news. It pushes everything else aside, partly business people identify with Trump [and have] an urge to gamble on this guy,"" he told CNBC in a phone interview. While Trump is rarely likened to the man known as ""Silent Cal,"" Shiller finds the historical comparison useful. ""I'm reminded of Calvin Coolidge, who become president in 1923, and the market started going up, and there were people saying that valuation ratios were getting too high — for years! Eventually, as you may have heard, it crashed."" A further rally followed by a crash, then, is certainly a potential outcome. Although as Shiller also makes clear, investors shouldn't obsess over the level of the CAPE ratio. ""The idea that these ratios represent forecasts for the underlying value is just not right,"" he said. They mostly shed light on ""psychological narratives."" In addition, some have questioned the CAPE ratio's usefulness in a period of prolonged low interest rates and evolving accounting standards. Still, most valuation metrics do show that stocks are relatively expensive as compared with historical precedents. So where does that all leave investors? ""I don't like to worry too much,"" Shiller said. But ""it's a good time to look at one's portfolio and ask if it's diversified enough.""

Rebecca Ungarino,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"Talk about low-energy stocks. The energy sector has the highest valuation in the S&P 500, even though it's the market's worst performer this year. WTI crude oil has lost 10 percent this year and the sector is down nearly 11 percent, and some strategists see further downside. ""I do think it's going to be a challenging road for oil, and we seem to just continue to be on a roller coaster that bottoms at $40, and tops out at $55. And we can't seem to get off of this roller-coaster ride,"" Gina Sanchez, CEO of Chantico Global, said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" At nearly 28 times forward earnings, the sector's forward price-earnings ratio is significantly above the second most richly priced sector, consumer discretionary. Its trailing price-to-earnings ratio is 33 times, second only to real estate among the 11 sectors. This high price as compared with expected earnings comes despite a major comeback for energy profits; the sector is on track to report 790 percent net income growth this quarter from the first quarter of 2016, according to FactSet estimates. Energy is also reporting the highest year-over-year earnings growth of any sector, according to FactSet. Buying energy stocks is difficult at this juncture given how much the price of oil has vacillated this year, Sanchez said. Crude oil has bounced around a range of roughly $47 to $56 a barrel, and in Tuesday trading dove beneath its 200-day moving average to its lowest level in five weeks as higher output in the U.S., Canada and Libya pressured the price. This comes even as Russia and major OPEC member countries have lowered production. Oil prices just ""aren't cooperating,"" Sanchez said. ""We are probably going to see OPEC cuts hold, but we are seeing less and less compliance, and that's going to be a challenge."" One popular exchange-traded fund that tracks energy stocks, the XLE, has fallen this year along with the sector. It closed at 67.31 on Tuesday. ""It's not pretty here in the short term,"" Rich Ross, Evercore ISI's head of technical analysis, said Tuesday on ""Trading Nation,"" examining a chart of the ETF. However, Ross said, absent a break below 65 — a key level of support the XLE held last year — he wouldn't write off energy and crude because he is more optimistic about fundamentals than he is of the charts. Sanchez said she could become more bullish. ""Geopolitical tension tends to buoy the price of oil; in fact, it will cause oil price spikes. That's certainly nothing that anybody's hoping for,"" but it would be something that she is watching when considering the future of energy stocks and oil.

"Mitch Goldberg, president of ClientFirst Strategy",05042017,CNBC,04272017,"President Trump is the one who said the stock market is a good way to judge his success. He's off to a good start. The major averages are up nicely since the November election and in the first 100 days of his administration. Now the decision for investors is straightforward: Do you lock in gains now or do you let them ride? Only you — or yourself in conjunction with a financial advisor — can answer that because it's really based on your own personal situation: your risk tolerance, time horizon and financial goals. But for those who feel it's time to be decisive, here are the pros and cons to consider over the weekend. Saturday is the 100-day mark for the Trump administration. More from ETF Strategist:The trade that shows Musk's energy agenda is fine under TrumpThis the only obituary of active management you need to readA Tesla gamble too many ETFs aren't willing to take Investors should in the least accept that some of the recent stock market gains are owed to these expectations. There is a possibility that if these expectations aren't met, stocks retreat. Then there is the geopolitical stage, featuring North Korea, Iran and Russia. Investors won't gain by trying to predict the fate of tax reform, or the planet. But here are three  questions investors can ask themselves in order to determine whether or not it's time to lighten up on stocks. This depends on your appropriate asset allocation of stocks, bonds and cash. You should have cash on hand for a rainy day, bonds for income and stability, and stocks for long-term growth which you are willing to hold onto even when they're down. If you are much more concentrated in stocks — rather than bonds and cash — than you were a few years ago, then it is a smart idea to consider rebalancing. Did you binge on dividend-paying stocks and under-invest in bonds because you were chasing more yield in the form of dividends? Do you own some of the big tech names such as Apple and Facebook and now these are outsized positions in your portfolio? There are an awful lot of investors who are invested a lot more aggressively than they should be. If rebalancing is the right thing for you to do, then it is time to get more skeptical about whatever is over-allocated in your portfolio, but that doesn't just mean stocks. Investors also need to consider if they are potentially over-allocated to bonds or cash. If you're invested in individual stocks, those should be in different sectors. Having a portfolio that consists of Amazon, Facebook and Adobe Systems could be a hugely winning combination. But if those represent 20 percent to 30 percent of your stock holdings, then I'd say you're over-concentrated in technology. Back in 1999, WorldCom and Lucent were among the most widely held stocks. The first one went to zero and the second one went below $1. With the proliferation of exchange-traded funds, it is surprising to me that so many investors consider themselves properly diversified by investing all of their stocks in the S&P 500 index tracking ETFs. That would mean you have money in large-capitalization stocks with a heavy bent toward the biggest ones in the index, ignoring the many other sectors and strategies at your disposal today. Over the long term, your answers to these questions will have a much bigger impact on your ability to reach your financial goals then worrying about the first 100 days of the new administration, which most of us will forget over the next 100 days.

The world's largest retailer is flexing its muscles once again. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT), after years of losing market share to rivals like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Costco Wholesale, and dollar store chains, has recommitted to offering the lowest prices on groceries. As part of its strategy to bring customers back into stores and drive sales growth, Wal-Mart is focused on reclaiming its reputation for rock-bottom prices, the bedrock of its ""Save Money. Live Better"" slogan and ""Everyday Low Prices"" promise. Image source: Wal-Mart The move comes as prices at the supermarket are already falling due to food deflation, which has squeezed rivals like Kroger Inc (NYSE:KR), which saw a streak of 52 consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth come to an end last quarter.  Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has put up ten straight quarters of comparable sales growth thanks to efforts to clean up stores and become more price-competitive. Those decisions have cut into profits, but have led to a comeback in Wal-Mart stock, which is up 12% in the last three months. For years, Wal-Mart opened stores across the country, part of a decades-long land grab that propelled the retailer to become the world's biggest company by sales. But the rise of e-commerce and Wal-Mart's own saturation in the U.S have forced the company to shift its strategy. The retail giant has dramatically scaled back its new store openings, choosing instead to invest in improving stores with higher wages, better conditions, more competitive prices, and innovations like online grocery pickup. The company has also aggressively pursued e-commerce acquisitions, in particular by purchasing Jet.com last summer for $3.3. billion. But Wal-Mart also has an edge over rivals like Kroger as it lowers prices. As the biggest retailer in the country and the biggest grocer, Wal-Mart has economies of scale that no other company can match, and greater buying power than any competitor. In addition to slashing prices, Wal-Mart is also squeezing suppliers. At a recent presentation to key vendors, Wal-Mart said it wanted to have the lowest prices on 80% of its products. In order to do that, it's asking those consumer products makers to find a way to shave 15% off of their prices by doing things like cutting back on marketing expenses. In exchange, Wal-Mart is promising increased distribution and other strategic assistance -- but said it would punish brands that resisted it by limiting placement and pushing its own private brands in those categories. In addition to its ability to pressure suppliers, Wal-Mart also has better profit margins than its grocery rivals like Costco, Kroger, and Amazon, even after its recent investments, so it can cut prices more easily than its rivals can. After blockbuster growth for 20 years, Amazon is now bending the retail rules to its desire. Thanks to its Prime membership program, the company's retail sales continue to soar as customers have embraced the convenience of online shopping, especially with the free two-day delivery shipping that comes with Prime. Amazon once built its reputation on low prices, but has increasingly made convenience its greatest proposition while still pushing the perception that it's the lowest-price vendor. This creates an opening for Wal-Mart. The company has been stepping up its challenges to Amazon by offering free two-day shipping on orders over $35, and now discounting some online-only items when shoppers pick them up in stores. Re-establishing itself as the low-price leader may be the best way the company can stave off Amazon as the e-commerce giant focuses on convenience and speed of delivery. Consumers still largely prefer to shop for groceries in-store rather than online, and the frequency of grocery trips means it's a significant driver of customer traffic. Therefore, bringing in more grocery sales should boost sales in other departments as customer traffic increases. Amazon still has plenty of momentum, but Wal-Mart's efforts seem to be reminding the market that it still has its own set of competitive advantages. If it keeps up these tactics, the stock should continue to move higher. ","

Few retailers have catered more to the unbanked than Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Whether it's a dislike of banks, a distaste for their fees, or some other reason, a sizable portion of U.S. households have chosen not to have a checking or savings account at a financial institution, and Wal-Mart has ensured they have a place to go.

Moreover, almost 20% of households, or 24.5 million households in the country, are ""underbanked"" -- they have a checking or savings account, but also used other non-bank services for their banking needs. While conventional thinking has led us to believe that banks are the be-all, end-all of finance, it also shows that a huge swath of the population has a high level of distrust of or dissatisfaction with traditional financial institutions. Wal-Mart offered them a better option. It had once tried to enter the banking industry by applying for an industrial loan corporation charter, or ILC, that would have allowed it to establish a low-cost financial-services arm similar to ones that Target, GE, and others operate, but banks raised a hue and cry against Wal-Mart, and the retailer subsequently withdrew its application. Today, Wal-Mart helps the unbanked by offering an entire suite of financial services, which, in addition to the services mentioned earlier, also lets customers cash payroll and government checks, get prepaid debit cards, and print personal and business checks. Its Bluebird financial accounts, arranged through American Express, essentially allow customers to bank without a bank. Image source: Wal-Mart. Although these financial services total less than 1% of Wal-Mart's annual net revenues, that's still more than $4 billion worth of financial business being conducted, and it recently noted that the volume of money services transactions it's making can be measured ""with a B."" It's no wonder Amazon.com is looking to get in on the action. Amazon Cash isn't yet so grandiose as a Wal-Mart Money Center, but it is specifically targeted to the unbanked consumer and may provide a platform for future expansion. Amazon customers won't need a checking account to deposit between $15 and $500 in cash into an Amazon account. Instead, they can go to one of 10,000 retail stores from the likes of CVS, Speedway, Sheetz, and others and simply present a barcode from Amazon that they've either printed out or downloaded to a smartphone. There are also no fees to use the service. This is big because these are customers that have arguably been ignored previously by the e-tailer. Typically, you need a bank account to access Amazon services, and often it pays to be a Prime member. Not so with Amazon Cash, which is open to anyone. Image source: Getty Images. As Wal-Mart and Amazon continuously clash for retail dominance, every consumer becomes more valuable. By making its platform more accessible, Amazon can siphon off additional customers, and because Amazon Cash will be available both on smartphones and via analog means -- such as printing out a barcode -- the retailer is able to include the third of unbanked adults who don't yet have a smartphone. Initially, it would seem Wal-Mart won't lose many customers to Amazon because money deposited at the e-commerce leader can only be spent on Amazon. Even PayPal, which has its own online cash service, is open to use at thousands of retailers, while Wal-Mart customers have an array of financial services available to them at its brick-and-mortar stores, and soon via mobile phone. Yet Amazon is only just tapping into this demographic. It's easy to see that if the unbanked increasingly use the service, Amazon will make more options available, including varied financial services. This is just the first skirmish between Amazon.com and Wal-Mart for the loyalty -- and wallets -- of the unbanked. It definitely won't be the last.

    The Next Battleground for Amazon and Wal-Mart: The Unbanked -- The Motley Fool

Asit Sharma,05042017,Fool,04272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Leawood, Kansas-based transactions-giant Euronet Worldwide (NASDAQ:EEFT) reported first quarter 2017 results on April 25th. In what's typically a muted quarter, the company displayed decent revenue growth and marginally lower earnings versus the first quarter of 2016. Management also provided perspective on the company's attempt to purchase Moneygram International Inc (NASDAQ:MGI), a proposal which appears to have failed following a sweetened offer from China's Ant Financial. We'll delve into the quarter's details, as well as the implications of the Moneygram deal after a brief look at headline numbers directly below: Data source: Euronet Worldwide. Image source: Getty Images. Euronet's pursuit of Moneygram provided an intriguing background to earnings. Euronet had put forward an unsolicited offer for Moneygram in March as the company was evaluating a takeover bid from Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba Holding Group Ltd. (NYSE:BABA). In mid-April, Ant Financial raised its original offer by a third, to $18 per share in cash, which exceeded Moneygram's offer of $15.20 per share by 18%. Moneygram's board then rejected Euronet's proposal and is proceeding with the Ant transaction. During Euronet's earnings conference call with analysts, CEO Mike Brown made two pertinent points regarding the company's failure to acquire Moneygram. The first placed some perspective on the lost deal: ...but if you add up ourselves and MoneyGram and Western Union, the three of them control less than 25% of the world's remittance. So, therefore, 75% is up for grabs and that's what we've been focusing on; that's how we've gotten stronger and stronger and bigger and bigger over the last year as we really focus on the rest of those people. The second point relates to future acquisitions should Euronet not propose a third bid for Moneygram. Unless the transaction with Ant Financial runs into compliance problems with U.S. or European regulators, Euronet looks increasingly set to walk away. This is a big one; this would have taken all our powder and then some. And if it doesn't go, then we've got a whole lot left as you suggest... we've actually been evaluating several other acquisitions alongside the MoneyGram one during this entire time. So we're not really serial thinkers. You never know when the good one is going to pop up. So you've got to kind of run [a] parallel process [and] be looking at 2 or 3 all the time, all the time. Euronet has enjoyed success in recent years by pursuing a number of very strategic acquisitions, from its money-transfer acquisition of RIA in 2006 to its expansion into currency exchange via the 2015 purchase of currency platform XE. Such purchases are essential to expanding the company's total annual transaction volume. Regardless of the outcome of the Moneygram bid, management is signaling that Euronet is set to enter another stretch of acquisitions. Investors shouldn't be surprised to see more merger activity announcements from Euronet in the coming quarters. ","

Keith Speights,05042017,Fool,04272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett didn't amass his huge fortune by making a lot of mistakes. But he readily admits to making some over the years. Failure can be a great teacher. Just as we can (and should) learn from our own mistakes, we can also learn from the mistakes of others. Here are seven lessons from the Oracle of Omaha's blunders that will help you become a better investor. Image source: The Motley Fool. In his 2013 letter to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) shareholders, Buffett told the story of the time he bought $2 billion of debt of Energy Future Holdings. The company was formed in 2007 with the goal of finalizing a huge leveraged buyout of electric utility assets in Texas. Buffett's biggest regret about the deal was that he made it without consulting his longtime partner, Charlie Munger. Few people are fortunate enough to have someone like Charlie Munger to go to for counsel. But we can all strive to avoid what Warren Buffett did: He made the decision too quickly. It's better to add a little distance before finalizing your decision on an investment -- even if it's much smaller than Buffett's $2 billion mistake. Buffett wrote to Berkshire shareholders in 2015 about his track record with the company's manufacturing, service and retailing operations. Most made solid returns, but not all of them. In most of the cases where business weren't performing as well, he admitted to being wrong in his evaluation of the business or the industry in which it operates. Perhaps the biggest example of Warren Buffett being wrong in his assessment of an industry was with Berkshire Hathaway itself. He had the opportunity to sell his stock of what was then a textile manufacturer and make a nice profit. But instead, Buffett kept on investing more into what he later confessed was a dying business. In 1985, Berkshire's textile operations were finally shut down. No one will get it right all the time, of course. But make sure you don't have blinders on when it comes to buying a stock. Research not only the company but the industry as well. On a somewhat related note, Buffett noted in his 2014 shareholder letter that one of his ""most gruesome"" mistakes was not checking out the competition for Dexter Shoes before buying. When he bought the company in 1993, everything looked great. What Buffett didn't realize at the time, though, was that foreign competition was about to rear its head. The initial $443 million investment on Dexter Shoes fell to zero. Regardless of what stock you're buying, what industry it's in, or the size of the investment, check out the competition. The landscape is littered with companies that used to be solid but ultimately couldn't compete against better, faster, and/or cheaper rivals. To make matters worse with the Dexter Shoe deal, Warren Buffett used Berkshire Hathaway stock to fund the transaction. The shares that he gave in exchange for Dexter would have been worth $5.7 billion when Buffett wrote the 2014 letter. (Berkshire's stock has gone up more than 40% since the beginning of 2014, so the snafu looks even more disastrous now.) There's an important lesson for average investors: Don't invest money in a stock that is better deployed elsewhere. Sometimes the worst thing in the world you can do is to sell a winning stock to buy shares of a company that you think might perform well. If a stock is making solid returns and its business fundamentals are solid, hold on to it. Berkshire Hathaway bought General Reinsurance Corporation in 1998. Shortly thereafter, Warren Buffett began to doubting his decision. There were problems that caused outside observers to think that the billionaire had blundered big-time. But Buffett's mistake wasn't in buying General Re; His mistake was in second-guessing himself. General Re turned out to be, in Buffett's words, ""a gem."" Luckily, he didn't sell the company before re-evaluating. Perhaps the best lesson to learn from this is to not second-guess your decisions too much. Give some time for the stocks you've picked to either pan out -- or not. Image source: Getty Images. Contrary to what some might believe, Warren Buffett isn't a buy-and-hold-forever kind of guy. He sells stocks routinely. In 2013, Tesco was listed among Berkshire Hathaway's largest holdings. A year later, the food retailer wasn't on the list at all. Buffett confessed to making a mistake with Tesco by ""dawdling"" when he should have sold earlier. (Charlie Munger, by the way, refers to waiting too long to sell as ""thumb-sucking."") Tesco had management problems and accounting problems that seemed to worsen every month. Buffett's quote about this situation is classic: ""In the world of business, bad news often surfaces serially: You see a cockroach in your kitchen; as the days go by, you meet his relatives."" What's the moral of the story? When it's time to sell, sell. Speaking of dawdling, Warren Buffett's biggest mistakes of all were procrastination of a different kind. In 2014, he told shareholders that almost all of his most colossal errors were in not buying a stock when he should have. Buffett specifically referenced his regret in not buying Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock years earlier. He even mentioned the giant retailer in his 1990 letter to shareholders, referring admiringly to how Walmart's low operating costs allowed it to sell at prices that competitors couldn't match and therefore constantly increase market share. But Buffett didn't buy Walmart stock until 2005. Berkshire has since sold off most of its shares in the retailer. This mistake is probably the biggest mistake made by every investor. Don't dawdle or thumb-suck when it's time to buy a stock. Warren Buffett estimates that Berkshire's value would be worth at least $50 billion higher if it had seized opportunities earlier on. It's probably not nearly that amount, but you could be leaving money on the table, too, by not buying stocks when you should. ","

Timothy Green,05042017,Fool,04272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend investors looking for high yield stocks should look into these top companies: NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) With quarterly reports scheduled to release in May, these companies deserve special attention. Shares of NVIDIA soared last year as the company's gaming business exploded, but the graphics chip specialist now needs to prove that it can sustain that rapid growth. Cisco stock is near its decade high even as its core business stagnates, and the company will need to convince investors that its software and services strategy can drive growth once again. And Wal-Mart, after a string of aggressive e-commerce moves, faces the challenge of catching up to Amazon while maintaining the bottom line. Here's what to look for in these three upcoming earnings reports. The big question going into NVIDIA's first-quarter earnings report on May 9 is whether the company can sustain the incredible growth of its gaming business. While NVIDIA's enterprise and automotive businesses garner plenty of headlines, the gaming business has been the main driver of the recent surge in revenue and profit. Image source: NVIDIA. During the fourth quarter, gaming revenue surged 66% year over year to $1.35 billion, driven by both strong sales of the company's GeForce graphics cards and revenue from the Nintendo Switch. NVIDIA expects a sequential decline in revenue during the seasonally weak first quarter, but its guidance still calls for a solid year-over-year revenue increase. Advanced Micro Devices will be launching its Vega high-end GPUs in the next two months, providing some competition for NVIDIA, which has dominated the high-end portion of the market for the past few years. NVIDIA's second-quarter guidance may provide some clues as to how big of a threat NVIDIA views AMD. NVIDIA's stock has surged over the past year, up nearly 200%. The elevated stock price comes with lofty expectations, and any sign that NVIDIA's gaming business is slowing down could lead to a steep decline. The story at Cisco, the dominant networking hardware company, is one of reinvention. The company is pushing both software and services as it aims to diversify away from its core business. Acquisitions have been a key tool, and Cisco has shown that it's willing to pay a high price to build out its software portfolio. The $3.7 billion purchase of AppDynamics in January and the recent $610 million purchase of networking start-up Viptela are just two examples. The networking giant will report its fiscal third-quarter results on May 17. Analysts are expecting a slight decline in revenue and a slight increase in adjusted earnings per share, with the smaller growth businesses not quite offsetting sluggishness elsewhere. Both the switching and routing segments posted year-over-year revenue declines during the second quarter, while service revenue jumped 5% and security revenue soared 14%. The third quarter will likely look similar. Despite Cisco's stagnating revenue, the stock is near its highest level since the dot-com bubble nearly two decades ago. Investors may be buying into the company's software story, and Cisco's cash-rich balance sheet gives it plenty of ammunition to continue to make acquisitions. There likely won't be too many surprises in Cisco's third-quarter report, but expect management to talk up the software business. Wal-Mart is no longer sitting idly by as Amazon scoops up an increasing percentage of retail sales. The company's e-commerce operations are now led by Marc Lore, who was the CEO of Jet.com prior to its acquisition by Wal-Mart for $3.3 billion. It now offers free two-day shipping on orders over $35, free pickup of online grocery orders, and discounts on certain online items that are picked up in-store. Wal-Mart will report its first-quarter results on May 18, and e-commerce sales growth will be a closely watched number. It managed to grow online sales by 29% year over year during the fourth quarter, a pace it will need to maintain to have any chance at catching up with Amazon. Amid the e-commerce push, the stores are performing well. Wal-Mart has racked up a long streak of comparable-sales growth in the U.S., and it will look to continue that growth by focusing on offering the lowest prices. Its goal is to offer prices that are 15% lower than its competitors 80% of the time, a move that targets both brick-and-mortar retailers like supermarkets and online retailers like Amazon. This focus on e-commerce and low prices won't be cheap, and investors should expect earnings to continue to lag revenue as the company builds up its online business. Analysts are expecting a slight increase in revenue and a slight decrease in earnings for the first quarter, a trend that will likely persist for the rest of the year. ","

Daniel B. Kline and Sarah Priestley,05042017,Fool,04272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With all-too-frequent news of store closings and bankruptcies for physical retail chains like Wet Seal and Sports Authority, it can be easy to buy into the myth that e-commerce is replacing physical retail -- but that's far from the whole story. A full transcript follows the video. Kline: If you're a Sears investor, don't believe anything they're saying. It's a bit of a shell game. Vince and I have talked about this at least four or five times. If you have $2 billion in assets and $8 billion in debt, you might be able to use your assets for a certain amount of time to forestall your debt. But if you haven't fundamentally changed your business, which they have not, then you're in real trouble. Macy's is a different story. Macy's is a profitable company that's not as profitable, that's struggling. I would look at, are there really new ideas? Are they doing things differently? Are they making bold changes? I would like to see Macy's testing 10 concepts that seven of them sound crazy to see what they are. Maybe they're renting out birthday party clowns in one store, and they are putting an upscale cafes, which I think some Macy's actually have. But, find different things, try different things. Also realize that if you're Macy's, the negativity is partially because you are a publicly traded company, which is expected to grow, grow, grow. As a private company, which could happen, there has been some interest in buying them, they're a stable business that just needs to pivot. They're not a failing business the way Sears is.

Chris Neiger,05042017,Fool,04272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. This year has already been fraught with bankruptcy news. Over the past few months, nine major companies have filed for bankruptcy. Topping the list for 2017 are hhgregg, RadioShack (for the second time), Wet Seal, The Limited, and others. While these companies are in the middle of the bankruptcy process, they're following in the unfortunate footsteps of many recognizable retail brands before them. Here are five major retailers you probably know that have all gone under during the past 10 years: Image source: Circuit City Corporation. But the company faced increasing pressure from Best Buy, big-box stores like Walmart, and online sales from Amazon. After a series of failed strategy changes, the company ultimately filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and closed its doors the following year. Circuit City left a pile of assets after its demise, to the tune of $3.4 billion. Image source: Getty Images. Linens & Things was a key player in the housewares market. In its prime, the company had more than 500 stores across the U.S. Unfortunately, massive cutbacks in consumer spending caused problems for the company, and it filed for bankruptcy in 2008. Just two years earlier, the private equity firm Apollo Management bought the company in an attempt to turn it around. In the end, Linens & Things closed up shop with $1.7 billion in assets. Image source: The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. The grocery store chain, often referred to as A&P, limped along for several years by filing for bankruptcy twice. The company had been in business since 1859, starting just a couple of years before the Civil War, but was forced to close its last store in New York City two years ago. A&P met its match among rising competition in the grocery-store market, and after more than 150 years in business, the company shuttered its doors and sold off $1.6 billion in assets. Image source: Getty Images. E-commerce claimed another victim last year when Sports Authority filed for bankruptcy. The company had a total of 463 locations across the country, but couldn't keep up with increasing competition, high leadership turnover, and instability from past mergers. Sports Authority had $1.3 billion in assets at the time of its Chapter 11 filing -- the same amount the private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners paid for the company back in 2006. Rival Dick's Sporting Goods swept in and bought the Sports Authority's intellectual property -- mainly customer information -- for about $15 million. Image source: Getty Images. It was just two years ago when Radio Shack first filed for bankruptcy, with about $1.2 billion in assets. Sprint (NYSE:S) and the hedge fund Standard General took over about 1,700 of the company's once 4,000 stores, and tried to keep the company afloat.. But Sprint announced last month that it will close the remaining stores and convert several hundred of them to Sprint stores. After nearly a 100-year run in the retail business, RadioShack may finally be seeing its end this time around. ","

Elizabeth Warren is ‘not big for’ the gun group, says President Trump By President Donald Trump offered a look ahead to the 2020 election during a speech to the National Rifle Association on Friday, telling members of the organization that it could be “Pocahontas” on the ballot for Democrats. For those who may have deleted that reference from memory, it’s an unmistakable slap at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite among liberal Democrats and a favorite Trump target. Trump used the moniker for Warren — who has claimed Cherokee and Delaware heritage, citing only family lore — during the campaign. Warren has blasted Trump over his failure to release his tax returns, among other things. As recently as last week, she dodged a question on whether she would run for president in 2020, telling the “Today” show: “I am running — in 2018, for senator from Massachusetts.” Also read: Elizabeth Warren says Obama got it wrong: It’s worse than Americans realize.

Rachel Koning Beals,05042017,MarketWatch,04272017,"Published: May 4, 2017 5:36 a.m. ET Realistic looking toy guns have become a problem for law enforcement By It’s not just real gun violence that’s killing people. Highly detailed realistic toy guns are increasingly putting the public and law enforcement in danger. That’s according to at least one major metropolitan police union, prompting its officers to go after the toy companies themselves. The Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association, through its lawyer, said this week it plans to file a federal lawsuit in the coming months against toy gun manufacturers. The realistic look of toy guns has been a supercharged issue since the 2014 shooting death in Cleveland of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. In that case, police were called to a recreation center after a witness saw Rice playing with what turned out to be a toy gun that shoots pellets. One of the responding officers shot and killed Rice within seconds of arriving at the scene. And it was the genuine look of the toy that in part prompted prosecutors not to charge the officers. (The city of Cleveland has agreed to pay Rice’s family $6 million.) The quick shooting was also one of many high-profile, officer-involved deaths that have exposed the sometimes tumultuous relationship between police forces and minorities in the communities they serve. A Washington Post study released in December, drawing from a national database of fatal police shootings, found that from 2015 to the point in 2016 when the study was conducted, police had killed 86 people in the U.S. who were brandishing guns that looked real but were fake. Read: Cleveland to pay $6 million to settle Tamir Rice wrongful-death suit Such action by a police union appears to be rare. The Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association hopes that other major police unions, including Columbus and Dallas, will join in its suit, the association’s attorney, Henry Hilow, told Cleveland’s News 5. He said the civil lawsuit will not seek financial damages, rather design restrictions. (Hilow did not say which toy companies would be targeted by the lawsuit or when exactly the lawsuit will be filed.) In Columbus, in 2016, 13-year-old Tyre King was shot and killed by officers after the teen, according to the police account, pulled a gun from his waistband that officers said looked much like their own department-issued Smith & Wesson

                                   semiautomatic pistol, complete with laser sight. It turned out to be a BB gun. The Washington Post’s count of these types of incidents even included a senior citizen in a motorized scooter shot while “waving” a pellet gun, the report said. Often, the shootings happened at night and, according to police reports, because the fake guns were pointed at officers. The Toy Industry Association was not immediately available for comment. It previously released a lengthy statement stating that toys themselves do not promote aggressive behavior. “Quite often, military and other role-play items may help kids work through or cope with what is happening in the world around them through play rather than through outwardly aggressive behavior,” it said. “There have been a number of unfortunate incidents where items have been mistaken by law enforcement for real guns, often resulting in tragedy ...Toys are subject to stringent federal marking requirements that mandate the use of brightly-colored markings; these other items are not.” The National Rifle Association (NRA), a pro-gun lobby, through an education arm, says parents have the responsibility to teach their children the difference between a toy gun and a real gun, and the difference between “pretend” and real life. The group argues that realistic-looking guns add to the element of play. And, authenticity overall teaches juveniles to respect guns, the NRA has said. Don’t miss: This is how much gun injuries cost the U.S. every year But other groups, including Moms Demand Action, have been critical of the NRA’s reluctance to get behind design restrictions for toys and for the more sophisticated air guns that do fire projectiles — for instance, laws that require toys to be only brightly colored or include other noticeably distinguishable features, such as fluorescent strips. Federal statutes do mandate that air guns have an orange plug inserted in the gun’s barrel, but they can be removed. State laws on air gun regulation tend to vary widely, with some states treating them as regular firearms. The NRA has said that brightly colored air guns may cause children to respect them less than they do real guns, which could pose dangers. “Just like real” was the convincing tag line on most toy gun ads from the 1940s to 1980s.

Robert Wall,05042017,MarketWatch,04272017,"Published: Apr 28, 2017 1:04 a.m. ET By LONDON -- France's Thales SA on Friday said it is acquiring a U.S. big-data analysis firm amid a wider push by U.S. and European aerospace and defense companies to capitalize on the vast amount of information their sophisticated systems collect. Thales said it will pay as much as $215 million for San Mateo, Calif.-based Guavus, a 250-person business with more than $30 million in expected 2017 sales. Boeing Co., the world's largest plane maker by deliveries, last year agreed with Microsoft Corp. to jointly work on data analysis tools for commercial aviation. British aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC signed a similar agreement with Microsoft. Thales, which makes items such as satellites, missiles, submarines and rail signaling equipment, has undertaken a string of technology deals. It acquired LiveTV in 2014 from JetBlue Airways Corp. to boost its in-flight entertainment portfolio and last year bought an optics business from Switzerland's Ruag Holding AG to augment its satellite activities. Guavus has some of the biggest U.S. telecommunications companies as its customers, Thales said, and handles about 5,000 terabytes of data a day, roughly the data of 3 million feature films. Philippe Keryer, Thales executive vice president for strategy, research and technology, said in an interview that the company plans to use Guavus's know-how in analyzing data in real-time across its products. The ability to rapidly sift through huge volumes of data could help intelligence analysts find key information in spy-satellite photos. The system should also make it easier to spot cybercrime by examining computer logs in real-time, Mr. Keryer said. Thales set out last year to expand its data analysis capability and evaluated several businesses for potential acquisition or partnerships. It opted for Guavus after running trials in real-world scenarios, Mr. Keryer said. The acquisition, which is scheduled to close in the third quarter pending regulatory approvals, would also help broaden the French company's overseas footprint. Guavus also has operations in Canada and India. Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com ",Thales to buy U.S. data analysis firm Guavus - MarketWatch
Mike Colias,05042017,MarketWatch,04272017,"Published: Apr 28, 2017 8:41 a.m. ET By General Motors Co.'s first-quarter net income rose 34%, as strong sales of pickup trucks and SUVs in the U.S. continue to offset softening in the car market and troubles in regions like South America. GM on Friday reported net income of $2.6 billion for the January-to-March period, a record for the quarter and up from $2 billion a year earlier. The nation's largest auto maker by sales posted first-quarter operating profit of $1.70 per share, breezing past Wall Street expectations of $1.47 per share. Revenue rose 11% to $41.2 billion, topping analysts' forecasts of $40.3 billion, as GM grew both sales and pricing on trucks and large sport utilities in North America, its most profitable vehicle lines. GM continues to cash in on brisk demand for pickup trucks and SUVs, stoked by sustained low gas prices and steady economic growth. Profits from China remained steady as sales improved after a sluggish start to the year, while GM's sales mix in the world's largest car market tilted toward higher-priced SUVs, Buicks and Cadillacs. The company continues to lose money in Europe, a region it will exit later this year upon the expected closure of the sale of its Opel division to French car maker Peugeot. GM's first-quarter loss in Europe was $206 million, versus just $6 million a year earlier, amid exchange-rate pressure stemming from Brexit. Losses in South America widened to $115 million, from $67 million, as conditions in Brazil remain difficult despite GM's expectations for improved performance in the region this year. GM continues to generate the bulk of its profits in North America, where it is commanding high prices for pickup trucks and big SUVs like the Chevrolet Suburban even as pricing erodes on passenger cars and smaller SUVs industrywide. GM's average prices in the U.S. slipped overall in the first quarter compared with a year ago, but the average price of a GM pickup truck -- its biggest profit generator -- edged up nearly $700, to $42,650, a spokesman said. GM's North American operating profit rose 49% to $3.4 billion, also a record for the quarter. The company's operating profit margin in the region rose to 11.7%, from 8.7% a year earlier, partly from cost reductions. GM benefitted from production increases in North America to build stocks head of planned factory down time later this year related to the launch of some redesigned models. Inventory on dealer lots swelled to a 98-day supply at the end of March, versus 71 days a year earlier. Finance chief Chuck Stevens acknowledged that the build-ahead helped GM's bottom line during the quarter but said inventory will return to normal levels in the second half of the year. He also downplayed rising incentives by GM and other auto makers, saying the prices customers are paying haven't eroded. ""Clearly it's a more competitive market,"" Mr. Stevens told reporters at GM's headquarters Friday. ""Transaction prices continue to remain strong."" GM said sales slipped in China during the quarter, but the company was able to offset the volume drop by selling a richer mix of SUVs and more Cadillac and Buick models, which carry higher-than-average prices. Equity income from its Chinese joint ventures totaled $504 million, versus $518 million a year earlier. GM shares rose nearly 2% in premarket trading Friday. The U.S. auto industry -- long a cyclical business -- has been riding an unprecedented seven-year run of rising sales since the end of the financial downturn, driven by tame gas prices, wage growth and pent-up demand from buyers who put off vehicle purchases amid economic uncertainty. Still, GM shares have been stuck in neutral for much of that run. Despite two straight years of record profits, reinstating a common-stock dividend and billions in stock buybacks, the stock has struggled to stay above the $33 IPO price from 2010. The lethargic stock price has drawn interest from activist shareholders including Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn, who has nominated a slate of three directors and is pushing a plan to divide GM's shares into two classes, separating its dividend from its operations. GM is urging shareholders to vote down the proposal at the annual meeting, likely in June, claiming it would harm the company's investment-grade credit rating. Analysts typically point to concerns about a sales peak and whether GM can sustain strong profitability if U.S. auto sales turn sharply lower. Industry sales are slipping -- they're projected to decline for the fourth straight month in April -- though few analysts expect a steep decline in coming years.

""That would result in about 650,000 to 700,000 people losing insurance coverage in 2017, and we would not participate in Marketplace in 2018, resulting in over 1 million Americans losing health insurance coverage,"" the letter -- first reported by news outlet Axios -- said.

Molina, which described itself as one of the largest participants in the ACA's marketplaces, is one of the few health insurers to make money on the exchanges. In the Thursday letter, the company directly refuted a claim made by President Donald Trump that the payments amounted to ""bailing out insurance companies.""

Mayumi Negishi,05042017,MarketWatch,04272017,"Published: Apr 27, 2017 8:18 a.m. ET By TOKYO--In a sign of how Amazon.com Inc. is reshaping online shopping globally, Yahoo Japan shares plummeted Thursday after it warned of a big increase in marketing costs as it struggles to compete with the Seattle juggernaut. Yahoo Japan, a joint venture between SoftBank Corp. and Yahoo Inc., is the country's biggest search portal but has been squeezed in e-commerce as Amazon benefits from years of aggressive investment in Japan, including splurging on warehouses and robots to launch its Amazon Prime same-day delivery services. Amazon's net sales in Japan, its biggest overseas market after Germany, rose more than 30% to nearly $11 billion in 2016. Japan accounts for nearly 8% of its total sales and almost a quarter of its international sales. Yahoo Japan scrapped vendor and transaction-based fees in 2013 in a bid to woo more sellers. Its revenue from ads on its shopping site for the business year ended in March was $155 million. Bigger local rival Rakuten Inc.'s e-commerce sales in Japan totaled $2.8 billion last year. ""We are at a critical juncture,"" Yahoo Japan President Manabu Miyasaka said after the company announced it would raise its marketing budget for this business year by 44% to $458 million, helping squeeze profit by as much as $270 million compared with the year just ended. ""We need to be aggressive."" Following the announcement, its share price dropped 10%. Yahoo Japan had a reputation for double-digit profit margins through 2015, but the company is facing tapering revenues from ads and its auction site. The earnings downgrade represents a permanent shift in operating-profit margins, said Macquarie's David Gibson, who cut the stock from ""Outperform"" to ""Neutral"" following the announcement. Even analysts with Buy recommendations say it may take time for the marketing push to make an impact in revenue. Yahoo Japan's scrapping of fees charged to vendors sent prices lower and demand higher throughout the online-shopping sector. But the fight for consumers is now also being complicated by a dire shortage in delivery services, the result of a tight labor market. A jump in parcel volume and a controversy over unpaid overtime to drivers has forced courier Yamato Transport Co. to consider halting same-day delivery service for Amazon. Another drag on Yahoo Japan's stock are questions about what will happens to the shares owned by Yahoo Inc. after Verizon completes its purchase of Yahoo's core internet operations. That 35.6% stake in Yahoo Japan will fall into the hands of a holding company called Altaba. Mr. Miyasaka said the strategic relationship that existed between Yahoo and Yahoo Japan wouldn't change.

Tomi Kilgore,05042017,MarketWatch,04272017,"Published: Apr 27, 2017 4:23 p.m. ET What’s good for American Airlines employees and customers can be bad for investors By American Airlines Group Inc.’s stock took a dive Thursday, a stark reminder that what might be good for employees and customers can be upsetting for investors. The airline industry has been tumbling down a public relations sinkhole the past couple of weeks, starting with the United Airlines passenger that was dragged forcibly off a plane, followed by an American Airlines flight attendant nearly coming to blows with a passenger and after reports surfaced Thursday about a man being booted from a Delta Air Lines plane after using the bathroom while the plane was delayed on the tarmac. American Airlines has tried to make amends, by announcing a significant pay raise for flight attendants and pilots , to take base pay rates to industry highs, years ahead of when union contracts would become amenable. “This is a program for everyone at American and these adjustments reflect a real philosophical change that is an important trait of the new American,” Chief Executive Doug Parker wrote in a letter to employees late Wednesday.

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday ordered Wal-Mart Stores Inc Chief Executive Douglas McMillon to submit to questioning in a lawsuit by shareholders hoping to learn what he knows about suspected bribery by the world’s largest retailer in Mexico. U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Arkansas,  said McMillon’s “direct and personal involvement” in matters underlying a class-action lawsuit justified requiring him to sit for a deposition by the shareholders’ lawyers. McMillon had been president of Wal-Mart International during a period when shareholders led by a Michigan pension fund said the retailer concealed suspected bribery by its Wal-Mart de Mexico unit to government officials, to speed up store openings. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer had argued that McMillon lacked the “unique or special knowledge” to justify burdening him with a deposition. But the judge said McMillon, who became chief executive in February 2014, took part in several meetings, saw dozens of communications, and had certified many public statements by Wal-Mart about the alleged bribery. “It appears to the court that McMillon has unique knowledge of relevant issues in this litigation that only he can explain,” Hickey wrote. A deposition could last four hours, she added. Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said: “We are reviewing the order and contemplating our next steps.” Jason Forge, a lawyer for the lead plaintiff City of Pontiac General Employees’ Retirement System, said in an email: “We’re determined to try this case in court.” Wal-Mart’s market value slid $17 billion over three days in April 2012 after the New York Times reported the alleged bribery and said it had been first discovered internally in 2005. Shareholders accused Wal-Mart and Mike Duke, who preceded McMillon as chief executive, of downplaying the scheme even after learning about the Times’ investigation. The class period runs from Dec. 8, 2011 to April 20, 2012. Earlier this week, Bloomberg News said Wal-Mart may pay about $300 million to settle a U.S. government probe into suspected bribery in Mexico, India and China, citing people familiar with the matter. A $300 million payment would represent about one week of profit for Wal-Mart. The case is City of Pontiac General Employees’ Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Arkansas, No. 12-05162. ","

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"WHEATON, Ill. (Reuters) - German grocery chain Aldi Inc is trying to beat the world’s biggest retailer at its own game: low prices. His strategy, previously unreported, centers on adding more private-label goods, which are a retailer’s in-house brands, to win over price-sensitive customers, and a massive expansion to further disrupt a U.S. grocery sector that has seen 18 companies go bankrupt since 2014. Hart’s plan calls for spending $1.6 billion to expand and remodel 1,300 U.S. stores, and open 400 new stores mainly in Florida, Texas and on both coasts by end of 2018. He also pledged Aldi will be willing to change prices more frequently to respond to rivals if needed. “We are re-merchandising, remodeling, enhancing our product range and are focused on gaining volume so more customers start their shopping at Aldi and we are able to complete their shopping lists moreso than we have in the past,” said Hart, who added Aldi’s U.S. sales have doubled in five years. Though it only accounts for only about 1.5 percent of the U.S. grocery market, Aldi is growing at 15 percent a year, whereas Wal-Mart currently controls about 22 percent of the market and its U.S. sales are estimated to grow about 2 percent this year, according to analysts. Aldi's growth potential has competitors taking notice. Reuters reported in February that Wal-Mart is running price tests in 11 states, pushing vendors to undercut Aldi and other rivals by 15 percent and is expected to spend about $6 billion to regain its title as the low-price leader. “We have not seen anything like this in the grocery sector in the United States before,” said Scott Mushkin, managing director of Wolfe Research and a leading pricing analyst. Such heated competition risks a dangerous race to the bottom that could result in more retailers shutting their doors. “Given Aldi’s expansion, Lidl’s entry, Wal-Mart’s response and Amazon’s growing ambitions in this space, it is fair to expect a significant acceleration in the bankruptcy and liquidation cycle in this sector over the next few years,” said Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. For more on Wal-Mart’s stock performance vs Amazon, click [L1N1IC270] Aldi, has a simple strategy to win more customers: everyday low pricing, according to Hart. “We don’t confuse our customers with yo-yo discounts, sales, coupons and loyalty cards that require membership fees,” he said. Four analysts and consultants contacted by Reuters confirmed Aldi now offers the lowest prices in private label consumer products in the states it operates, although they did say Wal-Mart is gaining ground in the states they are conducting price tests. Depending on the product, Aldi’s prices are cheaper than most rivals’ private label items and even most branded items, analysts said. Hart said the 21 percent difference in price is calculated by monitoring competition on a basket of groceries. Aldi counts on its no-frills shopping experience to help keep costs low, and limits much of its inventory to items that sell in huge volume. But its focus on offering far more private label items than branded products is central to allowing Aldi to adjust pricing whenever it chooses, Hart said. Aldi and Wal-Mart do no break out the figures, but analysts including Mushkin and Flickinger say Aldi carries about 1,200 stock keeping units (SKUs) or type of products, 90 percent of which are private label. Wal-Mart stocks about 30,000-40,000 SKU’s of products similar to ones Aldi sells, and only 30 percent of that are private labels. A Wal-Mart spokesman declined comment, saying the company would not comment on a competitor’s strategy. P&G and Unilever did not respond to Reuters requests seeking comment. But the explosive growth in private label products is on the radar of Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon. Last month he told analysts that private label goods will play an even more important role as the widespread availability of branded products online will compress those products margins over time. “Aldi is disrupting the sector the way Wal-Mart did when they started,” said Strategic Resource Group’s Flickinger. Aldi’s aggressive push to remodel its stores will allow it to add new private label merchandise in rapidly growing categories like fresh food. “The remodels are aimed at increasing our volumes which means more purchasing power that will help us lower prices further,” said Scott Patton, Aldi’s vice president of corporate buying. At a recent visit to an Aldi store in Wheaton, Illinois Reuters found newer-looking shelves, wider aisles and brighter lighting than a typical Aldi store. There was also a bigger assortment of fresh, organic, gluten-free products and antibiotic-free meats versus what it stocked earlier - categories Aldi said is growing the most rapidly at its stores. For example, its Simply Nature range of private-label products grew 53 percent to $300 million in 2016 from a year ago. Aldi has also opened stores close to Wal-Mart's supercenters to benefit from its budget-conscious shoppers. Its total store count of 2,000 stores by the end of next year will be about 42 percent of Wal-Mart's U.S. store base. ","

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"The deal, which would mark a significant concession by the U.S. government, was being finalized and could change, the Bloomberg report said. In October 2016, Wal-Mart rebuffed a proposal by U.S. prosecutors to pay at least $600 million to settle the same corruption probe. Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Hitt declined to comment on the story. Last week , Wal-Mart told Reuters it  was considering getting certified under a new international program that could help companies defend themselves against isolated cases of corruption or poor business practices. The proposed resolution would require a guilty plea by at least one Wal-Mart subsidiary, but the parent company would not be charged, the report said. The U.S. Department of Justice has been conducting a long-running investigation into potential misconduct by Wal-Mart in some overseas markets, including China, Brazil, India and Mexico. Wal-Mart’s ethics and compliance system came into focus after the New York Times reported in 2012 that Wal-Mart had engaged in a multi-year bribery campaign to build its Wal-Mart de Mexico business. So far Wal-Mart has spent more than $800 million on legal fees and an internal investigation into the alleged payments and to revamp its compliance systems around the world. ","

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Giant U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Wednesday it is looking into the origins of a note describing forced labor conditions in China that a customer claimed to find in a purse bought at a store in Arizona. The note detailed long hours, beatings and malnourishment of workers at a prison in the Chinese region of Guangxi, according to the customer’s family who contacted local media. Similar notes found by customers in imported merchandise have raised questions about forced labor used in supply chains making brands sold at major retail stores. Globally, nearly 21 million people are estimated to be victims of forced labor, according to the International Labour Organization. Wal-Mart on Wednesday said it was investigating. “We’re making contact with the customer and appreciate her bringing this to our attention. With the information we have, we are looking into what happened so we can take the appropriate actions,” Ragan Dickens, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said in an e-mail to the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The customer told local media late last month that the note was hand-written in Chinese but she had it translated into English three times. According to KVOA.com News in Tucson, Arizona, the note read, in part: “Inmates in the Yingshan Prison in Guangxi, China are working 14 hours daily with no break/rest at noon, continue working overtime until 12 midnight, and whoever doesn’t finish his work will be beaten. Prisoners are treated worse than “horse cow goat pig dog,” it read. Wal-Mart’s website details the company’s efforts to keep its supply chains free of forced labor and human trafficking. “We are working to improve transparency, empower workers and drive compliance,” it says. In a similar case, in 2014 a woman found a message in a Saks Fifth Avenue shopping bag from a man saying he was forced to work long hours at a Chinese prison factory. The worker was tracked down, and the note deemed legitimate. He was later released. In 2012 a Kmart shopper reported finding a letter at his local U.S. store from a worker also describing harrowing work conditions in China. ","

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"But a new tactic by Amazon to block these programs - known commonly as robots or bots - thwarted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer. Its technology unit, @WalmartLabs, was unable to work around the blockade for weeks, forcing it to retrieve Amazon’s data through a secondary source, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. The previously unreported incident offers a case study in how Amazon’s technological prowess is helping it dominate the retail competition. Now the largest online retailer in the world, Amazon is best known by consumers for its fast delivery, huge product catalog and ambitious moves into areas like original TV programming. But its mastery of the complex, behind-the-scenes technologies that power modern e-commerce is just as important to its success. Dexterity with bots allows Amazon not only to see what its rivals are doing, but increasingly to keep them in the dark when it undercuts them on price or is quietly charging more. “Benchmarking against Amazon is going to become hard,” said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon manager who now sells pricing software to retailers as chief executive of Mountain View, California-based Boomerang Commerce. A Wal-Mart spokesman declined to discuss the January episode but said the company improves its technology regularly and has multiple tools for tracking items. He said the company offers value not only through pricing but from discounts for in-store pickup and other benefits. A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is aware of competitors using bots to check its listings and denied any “campaign” to stop them. “Nothing has changed recently in how we manage bots on our site,” she said. Still, she said, “we prioritize humans over bots as needed.” Bots can slow down a website, a big motivator for retailers to block them. Reuters interviewed 21 people familiar with bots and how they are deployed, including current and former Wal-Mart employees, former Amazon employees and outside specialists. Many spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issues publicly. Most pointed to Amazon's leadership in the burgeoning bot wars. The company’s technological edge has been good for its profit margin, and it’s proving a winning formula for investors. Shares of the internet powerhouse have risen about 15-fold since the market’s bottom in March 2009, while the S&P 500 has more than tripled in value. Amazon hit $100 billion in annual sales in 2015 - faster than any company in history, it said. Bot-driven pricing has represented a massive change for the retail industry since Amazon helped pioneer the practice more than a decade ago. Traditionally, brick-and-mortar stores changed prices no more than weekly because of the time and expense needed to swap labels by hand. In the world of e-commerce, though, retailers update prices with ease, sometimes multiple times a day, helped by algorithms that consider inventory levels, sales forecasts and rivals’ pricing data. To stay in the game, companies such as online wholesaler Boxed, based in New York, depend on a variety of methods including bots to ensure they do not lag others’ price moves for even 20 minutes. “That’s like a lifetime during Christmas,” said Chief Executive Chieh Huang, whose company sells bulk staples like toilet paper and pet food. “If we’re not decently priced, we’ll see it almost immediately” in sales declines. In e-commerce, though, the use of bots has developed into a cat-and-mouse game. Companies try to thwart the practice on their own websites while aiming to penetrate their competitors' defenses. Third-party services abound to help less-savvy retailers. To protect data from rivals, some retail websites use what’s known as a “CAPTCHA” - typically a distorted string of letters and numbers that humans can read but most bots can’t. Amazon shies away from the practice because it annoys some customers. For merchants seeking to evade such defenses, disguising their computer programs as real shoppers is key. Some pricing technology experts have programmed computer cursors to meander through a Web page in the way a person might, instead of going directly to the prized data. Another technique is to use multiple computer addresses so that retailers cannot track a barrage of clicks to a single source. “It is an arms race,” said Keith Anderson, a senior vice president at e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, based in Ireland. “Every week or every month, there’s some new approach from both sides.” Amazon’s maneuver that halted Wal-Mart in January took aim at a specialized Web browser called PhantomJS. Unlike, say, Internet Explorer, this browser is designed specifically for programmers - a telltale clue that its users are not typical shoppers. Amazon put up a digital curtain to hide its listings from PhantomJS users, according to three people familiar with the situation. It was unclear how the move, which was not aimed at Wal-Mart in particular, affected other companies. Tests conducted in recent weeks for Reuters show that among major U.S. retail chains, Amazon had by far the most sophisticated bot detection in place, both for its home page and for two popular items selected by Reuters because they change price frequently - a De’Longhi coffee maker and a Logitech webcam. The tests were run by San Francisco-based Distil Networks, which sells anti-bot tools. In one of the tests, Distil programmed bots to hit each retailer’s website 3,000 times, but slowly enough to mimic a person clicking through listings. This tricked most retail behemoths, but not Amazon. Blocked bots would not have seen, for instance, that Amazon’s price for the De’Longhi espresso machine changed four times in a single 24-hour period starting on the morning of April 25, according to price tracking website camelcamelcamel.com. During that time, the price swung by more than 10 percent, from a low of $80.06 to $88.16. Despite Amazon’s capabilities, the sheer volume of crawling on its site is staggering. At times, as many as 80 percent of the clicks on Amazon product listings have been from bots, people familiar with the matter say, compared with just a third or more of the traffic on other large sites. In addition to rivals seeking price data, that traffic includes bots from university researchers studying competition, search engines, advertising services and even fraudsters trying to break into Amazon accounts. For Wal-Mart, a small group in Silicon Valley directs its automated pricing strategy while dozens of engineers in India and around the world handle the code, current and former Wal-Mart employees said. Amazon had about 40 engineers who would covertly extract and organize rivals’ data with bots as of several years ago, one of the people interviewed said. Amazon did not discuss the size or structure of its teams working with bots. According to one U.S. patent application, Amazon is working on encryption technology that would force bots, but not humans, to solve a complicated algorithm to gain access to its Web pages. [For full patent record - click tmsnrt.rs/2qXbYwp] “Amazon has both the competency to detect bot traffic and the wherewithal to do something about it,” said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group. That “isn’t the case for most retailers.” ","

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday wholesale inventories rose 0.2 percent after increasing 0.3 percent in February. The department reported last month that wholesale inventories slipped 0.1 percent in March. Auto inventories increased 1.9 percent. Wholesale stocks of electrical goods surged 2.3 percent, the biggest gain since January 2015. Professional equipment inventories rose 1.0 percent in March. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product - wholesale stocks excluding autos - were unchanged in March. A report last week showed inventories at factories were flat in March after rising 0.2 percent in February. Inventory investment subtracted 0.93 percentage point from GDP in the first quarter, helping to hold down the economy to a 0.7 percent annualized growth pace, the weakest performance in three years. Inventories had contributed to GDP growth for two straight quarters. Sales at wholesalers were unchanged in March after climbing 0.7 percent in February. Sales of electrical goods fell 0.3 percent while those of professional equipment tumbled 1.8 percent. At March’s sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.28 months to clear shelves, unchanged from February. The ratio has declined from 1.36 months in January and February last year, which was the highest since January 2009. ","

On Wednesday, Jet.com — which Wal-Mart acquired for $3.3 billion in 2016 — is beginning testing a temporary grocery concept in New York in partnership with Rachel Shechtman's Story retail store. In buying the e-commerce company last year, Wal-Mart has hoped to beef up its online ordering offerings, bringing in Jet's co-founder and CEO Marc Lore, who now leads all of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations. Jet wasn't immediately available to comment. ""What's fresher than fresh?"" Story wrote in release announcing the partnership with Jet. ""Having healthy produce dropped at your door — and you don't even have to be home to receive it. This is the magic of Jet.com."" Jet will sell select grocery items at the New York Story location for six weeks. There also will be a number of in-store events with chef Mario Batali and makeup guru Bobbi Brown, among others. Shechtman, a former brand consultant for Kraft and TOMS shoes, founded Story in 2011. The 2,000-square-foot ""start-up store"" in Manhattan features a rotating line-up of merchandise, which changes every four to eight weeks, the company says. Jet's physical debut comes at a time when e-commerce giant Amazon has been investing more in its AmazonFresh business, and testing brick-and-mortar locations to expand its reach. One store concept, called AmazonFresh Pickup, is a drive-in-type grocery store for Prime members that lets users shop online, reserve a time to pick up the groceries and have them loaded into their car at the store. Amazon also plans to boost the number of physical book stories it operates, and is testing a smart convenience store, Amazon Go, near its Seattle headquarters. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart has been rapidly expanding its own online grocery business and concentrating on the so-called click-and-collect model, which allows consumers to pick up their orders at stores. Last year, Wal-Mart announced a partnership with Uber and Lyft to delivery groceries to customers' homes. While e-commerce is the fastest growing portion of the food retail business, few shoppers buy their groceries online. Wells Fargo Zachary Fadem estimates that just 1 to 2 percent of total grocery spending occurs online. Since Lore's arrival at Wal-Mart, the big-box retailer has been beefing up its digital operations, recently adding to its portfolio women's clothing retailer Modcloth, for $150 million, and outdoor recreational retailer Moosejaw, for $50 million.

Sarah Whitten,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"Each year Lego creates more than 40 products and buildable figures for every one of its licenses. With its legions of fans, ""Star Wars"" ranks among Lego's top five licenses. These products begin to take shape one to two years before their release to toy stores. While Lego declined to provide specific detail about Star Wars sales, across the industry, more than $760 million worth of Star Wars toys were sold last year, topping 2015 sales by $60 million, according to the NPD Group. Rob Johnson, a business and marketing manager at Lego who has been with the company since 1988, shared a series of prototype images of one of the company's ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" kits during Star Wars Celebration in Orlando last month — Rey's speeder. Johnson, who worked as a senior art director for Lego's Star Wars division before moving into marketing, gave fans quite a bit of insight into how these toys go from concept art to store shelves. Here's an inside look at how it was done. Lego product designers head to Pinewood Studios in London to see the sets and models from ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens."" The designers sketch various vehicles and set pieces to bring back to the team. In the case of Rey's speeder, the designers noted the color, shape and important features so that the builders could begin creating prototypes. In this particular sketch, the product designer compared the vehicle to an upright version of Luke's speeder from ""A New Hope,"" and said the shape was reminiscent of an early 20th-century tractor. To begin, designers free-build, taking Lego pieces and fitting them to get the basic shape of the vehicle. Johnson said the team tries to find the right balance between accuracy to the set pieces and build-ability. Lego's target audience for these toys are children ages six to nine years old, so the builds cannot be too technical. This particular prototype is a first pass at capturing the shape of the front end of Rey's speeder. Designers don't pay too much attention to color yet and use already-developed Lego pieces. In the future, they may need to design special pieces just for this product. Once the builders start to feel comfortable with the preliminary shape, they will begin to add features to the piece, like seats or engines. Rey's speeder now has a longer nose, more like the actual movie prop, and designers test out how the engines should look. They will create dozens of different speeder designs like the one below, each with a slightly different shape, until they find the one that is just right. For Lego, these kits aren't just models to be built and placed on the shelf. They want kids to play with them. Johnson said the team likes to add ""play value"" to each kit to enhance the experience. In the case of Rey's speeder, the builders wanted to create built-in storage so the young scavenger would have a place to put all her loot. The design team added hinges to the panels of the toy that would allow for the section to open and for little Lego bits, or whatever else, to be placed inside. Once the team builds the ""play value element,"" sometimes the shape of the design has to adapt to the new pieces. The toy will go through several more prototypes before becoming the final product. The white brick in the center speeder is a placeholder piece. It signifies that the designer needs to create a new element, one that Lego doesn't already have a brick shape for. Engineers will use graphic prototype machines that take digital designs and make them into a physical piece. Johnson said this process is called rapid prototyping. The handwriting on the left speeder tells designers what color the piece should be, Johnson said. Once the designers settle on a final design, all the necessary pieces are placed onto Lego boards. These boards denote every single piece in its correct color and shape that will be needed to assemble Rey's speeder. The boards act as a reference for designers and the packaging team. With so many projects occurring simultaneously, having these reference boards ensures that there is no miscommunication as the product transitions from one team to another. Before the kit is complete, the team must also design the characters. While the face and body pieces will only require a decal change, the hair and headpieces must be hand sculpted. The sculptors create these molds at a three-to-one scale, and the final design is shrunk down to the proper Lego size. ""It's hard to sculpt at the actual size,"" Johnson said. These artists use Sculpey clay and created Rey's signature hair and head wrap. This is the final Lego product. The speeder has all of its proper decals, accessories and, of course, its figures. The lower engine twists to open up the two sides of the speeder and reveal the storage area. The final product also includes a full console, with lever controls and a clear windshield. The product retails for about $20. ",From concept art to store shelves: How Lego creates its 'Star Wars' toys
Jason Del Rey,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"When the investment arm of Amazon's Alexa division led a $5.6 million investment in his startup, Nucleus founder and CEO Jonathan Frankel was ecstatic. Just a year later, he's furious instead. On Tuesday, Amazon announced its latest voice-controlled device — the Echo Show — which does all the things that other Alexa gadgets do, plus a few important new capabilities. Namely, the gadget can serve as a home intercom system and video-conferencing tool like FaceTime or Skype, because it comes with the combination of a touchscreen and video camera. That's bad news for Frankel, since the  Nucleus product is basically the same thing: An Alexa-powered  tablet computer designed to be a dead-simple home intercom system and video conferencing tool, too. But to make matters worse, Amazon's launch video focused a ton on the communication features at the core of Nucleus' vision, rather than the e-commerce, smart-home or entertainment capabilities that the Echo Show also possesses. ""The degree to which communication is a core functionality of the device is pretty astonishing,"" Frankel said in an interview with Recode on Tuesday afternoon. ""Their thesis is what our thesis was: Communication is that Trojan horse to get those devices throughout the home and throughout the extended family's home."" ""The difference is,"" he added, ""they want to sell more detergent; we actually want to help families communicate easier."" Frankel knew this outcome was a possibility, since an Echo with a screen had been rumored for some time; Recode reported in March that  intercom and voice-calling features were coming, too. But he's still surprised by the brazenness with which Amazon has gone after one of its own portfolio companies. ""They must realize that by trying to trample over us — a premiere partner in the Alexa Fund ecosystem — that they are going to really cripple that ecosystem and put a warning out for others,"" Frankel said. ""If they're really willing to threaten that,"" he added, ""it must be a huge opportunity."" An Amazon spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment. More from Recode: Elon Musk really wants to remind you that Tesla's new Model 3 is not as good as the Model S Alphabet says the executive at the center of its lawsuit against Uber had a deal before he left the company Facebook's business isn't slowing as fast as Wall Street expected For would-be Amazon partners, this is just the latest cautionary tale about the risks of doing business with the online retail giant: No matter what the company says, there are no equal partnerships when Amazon is involved. The move will also likely deal a blow to the Alexa Fund, the investment vehicle through which Amazon has been supporting startups building products and services to be controlled by voice. So what comes next for Nucleus? Frankel says his startup will continue — at least for now — selling its product on Amazon. It is also sold on Lowe's websites and in its stores. And Nucleus now has added incentive to land new partnerships with some of Amazon's tech and retail competitors — think Google, Walmart or Target — which Frankel believes have good reason to be more nervous than ever about Amazon's increasing foothold inside American homes. ""We have the resources and the thinking to help some of these retailers fight back,"" he said. ",Amazon invested millions in the startup Nucleus — then cloned its product for the new Echo
Anita Balakrishnan,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"The technology sector's rollicking rally this year has been helped, in part, by the market power the companies have, according to technology investor Jason Calacanis. While stocks pulled back from record highs on Wednesday, the Nasdaq 100 has climbed more than 16 percent so far this year, while the S&P 500 Information Technology sector has jumped more than 17 percent — far more than any other S&P grouping. Markets may have risen broadly, but companies like Facebook and Google have also made plenty of money. Both companies reported better-than-expected earnings in the first quarter, shaking off controversies around ""fake news"" and extremist content. Research firm eMarketer estimates that Google will account for 40.7 percent of percent of U.S. digital ad revenues in 2017. Facebook, eMarketer predicts, will capture 39.1 percent of the display ad market. ""If you look at Google, they have just an amazing monopoly when it comes to search advertising,"" said Calacanis, a media entrepreneur and early Uber investor. ""And they know exactly how to avoid triggering what would look like a monopoly. So they've always kept an anemic, incompetent competitor alive. So Google had Yahoo. They could have bought it, they could have taken over their advertising revenue. Suspiciously, they didn't."" Google has what Calacanis referred to as ""moats,"" borrowing from a phrase used by famed investor Warren Buffett: Well-known brand names that make it difficult for them to succumb to competitive forces. ""Google's moats are transcendent now: Chrome, Android,"" Calacanis said. ""It's amazing the monopoly they've built that doesn't look like a monopoly."" The market power behind the tech giants has caught the eye of regulators abroad. In Europe, Google's aggregation of content, WhatsApp's encryption,  Apple's low taxes and Amazon's payments to publishers are just a few of the issues that have sparked a regulatory crackdown. ""Facebook, they've always had, or [CEO Mark] Zuckerberg's referred to it as, 'the clown car:' the incompetent Twitter, which can't seem to get out of its own way,"" Calacanis said. ""These are perfect little companies to keep on the side. Don't buy them. Let them be independent. So when the anti-trust people come, you can say, 'Look, no, there's options here.'"" U.S. regulators have their fair share of spats with technology companies, but the debate wages on as to whether these companies cause any economic losses or harm to consumers since they lower prices for some services. ""They're not going to try to compete with the global user base in the same way Facebook is obsessed with having everybody,"" Calacanis said.  ""Snapchat is going to really get themselves into trouble if they get into Yahoo's big problem, which was a constant comparison to .... Google. Snapchat has to establish they are something different."" ",Jason Calacanis: Tech sector has built a monopoly
Evelyn Cheng,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"Industrial giant Caterpillar is on the cusp of a big year of earnings growth and potential new business strategy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said Thursday. BofAML upgraded the stock to buy from neutral and raised its price target to $120, nearly 20 percent above where Caterpillar closed Wednesday. The stock, which traded flat Thursday morning, is up 8.2 percent this year, already beating the S&P 500. ""CAT is set up to beat all year long,"" research analysts Ross Gilardi, Michael Feniger and Natalie O'Dea said in the note. They said the consensus estimate for second-quarter adjusted earnings is $1.10 a share, flat from the prior year and down 14 percent from the first quarter. Such a decline is historically rare. Since 1995, Caterpillar's second-quarter earnings have rose an average 35 percent from the prior quarter and only fallen twice, in 2011 and 2015, the BofAML analysts said. They expect second-quarter earnings of $1.28 a share.

Jeff Brown,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"Fixed-income investors can earn yields of nearly 10 percent, perhaps more, if they can overcome a 10-year aversion to mortgage-backed securities that were blamed for the financial crisis. These high yields are offered by mortgage real estate investment trusts, or mREITs, a subset of the REIT universe. mREITs invest in mortgage-backed securities and other loans to homeowners and businesses, while equity REITs, the more common variety, own actual real estate — commercial, residential and industrial properties. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) says yields on the 34 mREITs averaged 9.87 percent at the end of the first quarter, compared to 4.01 percent for equity REITs. Brad Case, senior economist at NAREIT, says with mREITs currently yielding in excess of 7 points more than 10-year Treasury notes, they can be expected to return 8.9 percent a year over the next three years, based on patterns dating back to 1990. mREITs can be a good choice for investors seeking steady income, as dividends from borrowers' payments are distributed to investors monthly rather than the longer intervals used by many fixed-income investments, says Allen Shayanfekr, co-founder of Sharestates, a real estate crowdfunding site. Exchange-traded funds that specialize in mREITs, such as Market Vectors Mortgage REIT Income ETF (MORT) and iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped (REM), are yielding 7.05 percent and 8.92 percent, respectively. ETF flows data shows that broad REIT funds are more popular. In the past one-year period, the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) and iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (IYR) have taken in $3.3 billion and $864 million, respectively. REM has taken in $348 million and MORT only $31 million, according to XTF.com. There are risks, of course. mREIT dividends come from borrowers' loan payments, so a rise in defaults could drive yields down, taking mREIT shares down as well. But advocates note that the economy is far healthier than in the financial crisis, when mortgage securities got a black eye. Loan defaults and unemployment have fallen, and home prices have gone up — reducing default risk. Noted bond investor Jeff Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital is among the big names in the market who find mortgages attractive relative to other income opportunities. ""The market is stronger today than it was in the peak before the financial crisis,"" Shayanfekr says. However, he added that investors focused on long-term growth might do better in equity REITs, to profit from rising property values in addition to earning rental income. More from ETF Strategist: 'Market crack': Leveraged ETFs ratchet up the risk again ETFs are taking in more than $1 billion a day this year The death of active funds explained in one article Another hazard is ""prepayment risk"" when borrowers refinance their loans, stopping interest income on the old loans and returning investor's principal early — typically at a bad time to reinvest because yields are down. But prepayments are a major hazard only when interest rates are falling, and most experts think rates will continue to climb slowly, keeping this risk low. Liquidity risk, or the prospect of not being able to buy or sell when you want to, is another concern, especially for investors trading in small volumes, says Steven N. Violin, senior vice president and portfolio manager at F.L. Putnam Investment Management Company in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Also, many mREITs bet on the spread between short- and long-term loan rates and use leverage to amplify results, making them especially hazardous if things go wrong. Then there is interest-rate risk, when older, interest-paying securities lose value because investors prefer newer ones with higher yields. ""In today's market we are primarily concerned about interest-rate risk and particularly how companies will fare in a 'bear flattening' of the yield curve, where short-term interest rates rise faster than long-term rates,"" Violin said. ""This can be something of a double whammy for mREITs, as it hurts asset values as well as dividends."" But many mREIT advocates say the danger is not serious if rate increases are gradual and don't go too high, since mREITS will gradually replace older securities with newer ones that are more generous. The Federal Reserve has said it will raise rates, but slowly and modestly. Among individual mortgage securities, the yields can go significantly higher than the ETFs that invest in dozens of mREITS. Some examples of publicly traded mREITS with double-digit yields, from REIT.com: ""Mortgage REITS are generally stable investments in a rising interest-rate market,"" Shayanfekr said. But that doesn't guarantee good times, as the expected rise in mREIT yields can be dampened if higher mortgage rates cut the pace of lending, causing a shortage of new loans with higher yields. ""As rates increase, it's true that the overall yield will increase, but you'll also see a decrease in home values and likely fewer qualified borrowers, meaning less mortgage loan product,"" he said. Investors can protect themselves from interest-rate risk by purchasing mREITs that invest in adjustable-rate loans, since interest rates on those will go up as rates rise, increasing the mREIT yield. Examples include issues among commercial REIT and residential mortgage REIT niches: ""Rising home-loan rates tend to benefit mREITs that hold floating-rate loans,"" Violin said. ""We prefer the commercial real estate loan segment in particular, where floating-rate securities are more readily available and yields seem relatively attractive in some sub-segments."" Christopher Dukes, president of Dukes Wealth Management, based in Culver City, California, is also a fan of mREITS containing floating-rate loans but prefers those that own residential rather than commercial loans, because he finds residential loans can adjust to rising rates more quickly. ""I've seen returns in the 5-6.5 percent range in early 2017,"" he said. ""Given that many fixed rate investments pay considerably less, this asset class is a nice addition for someone looking for income. ... Investors should expect a five to seven-year time frame to maximize return on their investment."" Dividend stocks have always been safe havens in a volatile market, but they're tanking in 2018.

For decades, really since delivery services like milkmen largely went away, most Americans have shopped by making a list, then going to the supermarket to get what they need. It's an imperfect system because different consumables get used up at varying rates. That leads to either a need to make more visits, or going without until your weekly shopping trip comes around, or you build up enough demand to make an extra trip. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has begun tackling this problem and putting at least a partial end to the shopping list with its Dash buttons. These are small, Wi-Fi-connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices that have one function: ordering a specific item. In general, they are placed near that item -- perhaps a Tide Dash button would be stuck on a wall near your washing machine -- and when you're close to running out, a simple press of the button places on order with Amazon for two-day delivery for Prime members. There are hundreds of Dash buttons for everything from toilet paper to Red Bull, trash bags to Pop-Tarts. It's a simple system where a second order cannot be placed until the first has been delivered, and the consumer can set exactly what he or she wants to be ordered when setting up the device. Amazon charges $4.99 for each Dash button, but gives consumers a credit for that same amount once they place their first order. It's a smart way to not only to save customers from having to run to the store because they run out of something, but to tie them to Amazon. That's something Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has taken notice of, and the company has filed a patent for its own Dash-like device. The brick-and-mortar retail giant is not merely copying its online rival, it also has an added twist. Amazon's Dash buttons allow for easy ordering. Image source: Amazon. While Amazon's Dash button requires someone to actually press it in order to place an order, Wal-Mart's proposed system would be passive. Roughly, according to the patent filing, the consumer would configure the device, which would then track usage patterns. It would then be mounted in or on the item being tracked and could place an order for replenishment when the consumer-set standard is met. The system will use Bluetooth, radio frequency, infrared, NFC, or other technology to track how much product is being used. Wal-Mart called the technology a subscription system in the patent application, but unlike a traditional subscription, the next order would not come at a predetermined date, but when it's actually needed. That not only takes some of the work out of the process for the consumer, it creates a flow of orders to Wal-Mart. The patent notes that this type of tracking may also create opportunities for cross-selling. For example, if the device knows how much toothpaste you use, it may also be able to tell you when you need a new toothbrush. Dash buttons are obtrusive. They have product logos on them and few people would want to place them in visible parts of their home. That limits their use to places like laundry rooms and perhaps inside various cabinets, hidden from view. Wal-Mart, if it can create the device in the patent, while also making it small and near-invisible, may have a better solution. Its idea takes Amazon's IoT button and makes it something consumers don't have to think about. If it works, Wal-Mart will have an IoT device that can make sure you never run out of whatever it is you worry about not having. That's a big step ahead of what Amazon offers, and it could, should it become a reality, win the company some automated business. ","

Matthew Cochrane,05112017,Fool,05042017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In March, PYMNTS.com released a startling study about consumer habits and the use -- or lack thereof -- of mobile wallets to facilitate point-of-sale (POS) transactions. According to the study, which specifically looked at the usage rates of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay, Samsung's Samsung Pay, Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) Walmart Pay, and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android Pay, less than 5% of the customers with the capability to use these mobile wallets did so, even when the merchants where the purchases were being made accepted that form of payment. All of the reported stats from the survey revealed strengths and weaknesses for each of these players. Apple Pay had the most respondents who had utilized the service at least once (22%). Samsung Pay (15%) and Android Pay (10%) notched fewer consumers trying their services. Image source: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Each of these companies seems to have a different strategy for boosting their mobile wallet engagement. Apple has been focused on opening new markets and points of acceptance for Apple Pay. In the company's 2017 second-quarter conference call, CEO Tim Cook welcomed the Taiwan and Ireland markets to Apple Pay, bringing the total number of global markets accepting the mobile wallet to 15. Apple Pay now has more than 20 million retail locations that accept it as a method of payment. Image source: Apple Inc. During the same conference call, Cook stated transaction volume for Apple Pay had increased 450% over the past year, proving that this strategy has shown some measure of success. While the usage rate remains dismally low, this plan at least addresses one of the primary shortcomings holding mobile wallet usage back, according to the study. A great deal of confusion still exists regarding which retailers support these mobile wallet platforms. According to the survey, 21.6% of customers with an iPhone didn't use it to make a transaction because the retailer didn't accept it or they didn't know whether it did. Wal-Mart does not face these same issues. Since June 2016, when Walmart Pay was expanded to all domestic Wal-Mart locations, American consumers have known that the wallet would be accepted while they were shopping at one of the stores. However, the giant retailer faces another challenge with its customer base. Fully 55.8% of Wal-Mart customers in the survey either wanted to use cash, were not comfortable with the platform, or simply flat out stated they didn't want to use a mobile payment method. Educational and promotional material inside the stores might go a long way toward easing the concerns of these customers. Android Pay recently entered into a partnership with PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) in hopes of encouraging user engagement. This agreement allows Android Pay users to link their PayPal accounts to Android Pay, allowing PayPal's 203 million active account holders to make purchases both in-app and at the point-of-sale with their PayPal accounts via Android Pay. These efforts might encourage some user growth and increase engagement with the platforms to some extent, but PYMNTS.com CEO Karen Webster believes they miss the larger point. In the press release accompanying the study, she was quoted as saying, ""The lesson, though, isn't that wallets are dead but that the providers, and innovators, really need to focus on features -- or something -- that will get consumers, and merchants, excited."" Webster might have a point. For every mobile wallet included in the survey, a double-digit percentage of those surveyed said they preferred to use a different payment method because the other payment method offered rewards or points. Another thing holding these wallets back are the very real physical limitations they all face. Each of them require a particular type of phone, operating system, or store (in the case of Walmart Pay) to work. Interestingly, PayPal was not included in the survey because its partnerships with Discover, Mastercard, and Visa are still relatively new. However, these partnerships allow PayPal to be accepted at physical retail locations using these payment networks' tokenization services. Once these partnerships begin manifesting themselves into specific banking institutions (and they already have) PayPal's app might well become the digital wallet of choice because it won't be hampered by the same operating system or phone manufacturer restrictions these other mobile wallets face. Customers can now order pizza from Domino's by tweeting an emoji or through Facebook Messenger. Image source: Domino's Pizza, Inc. Another interesting development has been the onslaught of different retailers' mobile apps. For instance, Starbucks customers can now use the coffee house's app to order their favorite caffeinated beverage while they're still miles away. Upon arrival, customers can pop in, grab their drink, and rush back out. Pizza lovers can order pizzas using their phones by tweeting pizza emojis or tapping one button on Domino's Pizza's app. These and other merchants' proprietary apps have surely stolen at least some of the mobile wallets' thunder. There can be little doubt that the world of payments and commerce are undergoing a seismic shift, the likes of which has probably not been seen since those little plastic rectangles were first introduced to our wallets decades ago. This change can be hard to categorize at times as the boundaries between digital commerce and traditional sales at brick-and-mortar retailers are increasingly blurred. Mass innovation can sometimes seem maddeningly deliberate as consumer habits can be slow to change. Yet, as time marches on, consumer trust in new technology tends to increase. While it might not take the shape we originally envisioned, phones will almost undoubtedly be used more to pay for purchases. Whether that's through retailers' own apps, as in the cases of Domino's and Starbucks, or through mobile wallets remains to be seen. What is clear thus far is that Alphabet's, Apple's, Samsung's, and Wal-Mart's mobile wallet efforts are not enough to ensure their future success. ","

One way investors can achieve outsized gains is by catching an emerging trend and investing in key players as it evolves. To that end, there are very few trends that can match the enormous and growing potential of e-commerce. Online sales in the U.S. amounted to $322 billion in 2016, and that figure is expected to climb to $485 billion by 2021, according to Statista. While the current trend has been over 20 years in the making, it's still far from over and represents a compelling opportunity for investors. eMarketer recently released data detailing the top online retailers in the U.S., which provides a starting point for those interested in investing in e-commerce. The companies that took the top three spots were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT). E-commerce represents a growing trend and a compelling opportunity. Image source: Pixabay. No discussion of e-commerce is complete without addressing the 800-pound gorilla in the room. The largest player in e-commerce, bar none, is Amazon. Over the trailing-12-month period, Amazon had total revenue of nearly $136 billion, and e-commerce accounted for 70% of that amount, or nearly $95 billion. The company's online sales grew 20% last year, while total revenue grew 27%. In addition to e-commerce sales, Amazon has several other prosperous businesses, including its cloud-computing segment, Amazon Web Services; its Prime membership service; and a thriving artificial-intelligence segment led by Alexa, the company's virtual personal assistant. Alexa powers a growing number of Amazon products, including its Echo family of smart speakers, as well is the Fire TV, Fire Stick, and Fire Tablets. Apple may not immediately come to mind when you think e-commerce, but there are several factors at play. Many of the company's flagship phones and computer products are ordered online. Add to that its signature iTunes, app store and its growing Apple Pay payments business, and it's no wonder Apple took the second spot. Its e-commerce sales grew an estimated 40% to nearly $17 billion, which represents nearly 8% of Apple's total revenue of $218 billion over the trailing 12 months. CEO Tim Cook revealed in Apple's most recent earnings conference call that the company planned to double revenue from its services segment by the end of 2020, and that development should serve to increase the company's share of e-commerce as well. Top picks in e-commerce. Image source: Getty Images. With the rise of Amazon, many had discounted Wal-Mart in the realm of e-commerce, but that pronouncement may have been premature. While physical stores still account for 97% of Wal-Mart's revenue, its online sales grew 9% to over $14 billion for the trailing 12 months. The company signaled to investors that it was serious about e-commerce with its recent acquisition of online retailer Jet.com, as well as Modcloth and Moosejaw with their e-commerce sites. In the company's most recent earnings press release, Wal-Mart's president and CEO, Doug McMillon, stated: We're moving with speed to become more of a digital enterprise and better serve customers. We had a very solid fourth quarter, with U.S. comp sales growth of 1.8% and U.S. e-commerce GMV [gross merchandise volume] growth of 36%. It's important to note that of the top 25 retailers eMarketer ranked by online sales, Amazon's total e-commerce contribution exceeded that of the next 24 combined. Data released by Slice Intelligence estimates that 43% of all online retail sales in 2016 happened on Amazon's website, and the e-commerce giant captured more than half of all online sales growth last year. It's unlikely that Amazon's position at the top will be in jeopardy anytime soon, but there is still plenty of growth for the industry, as online sales account for only 8.3% of total sales for last year.

Rich Smith,05112017,Fool,05042017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. That could soon change -- because Gordon Haskett is storming onto Wall Street today with no fewer than 10 brand-new stock ratings in the retail sector. Of these, a couple stand out for their audacity: a big buy rating on Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), and an even bigger recommendation to sell Wal-Mart's archrival, Target (NYSE:TGT). Here are three things you need to know about these ratings. One analyst just painted a bullseye on Target. Image source: Getty Images. Tuesday dawned dark and foreboding for shareholders of Target stock, when Gordon Haskett put out a very negative note on the retailer -- a retailer that, one gets the impression, GH would really like to see succeed, but fears will fail instead. GH lays out its sell thesis by first accentuating the positive. Target has a relatively new CEO in Brian Cornell, and Cornell is making ""all the right decisions"" to try to save Target from the twin threats posed by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) in e-tail, and Wal-Mart (in both e-tail and retail). Already, Target has reset its earnings guidance for the current year, such that analysts are now on the same page, and predicting declining same-store sales and profits of only about $4 a share this fiscal year. Target plans to spend about $1 billion this year on remodeling stores and cutting prices on its wares (to better compete with Wal-Mart). It's also positioned to profit from the wave of smaller retailers (Gander Mountain, hhgregg, and Limited Stores, just to name a few) going out of business and leaving their customers with few options (other than Target) to shop at. That's the good news. Now here's the bad. Target is ""moving ... too slow"" to fix what's wrong with it. More importantly, Gordon Haskett has seen this movie before, where retailers such as Kroger and Wal-Mart itself had to remake their business models and lower their prices to better compete in the age of Amazon. But GH notes ominously that it took Kroger ""several years"" to accomplish its makeover, and Wal-Mart ""2+ years to get its act together."" Thus, while many analysts are taking it on faith that Target will right its ship within this year, and won't need to spend more than $1 billion to fix its business, GH is not sold on that idea. Rather, the analyst worries that this ""will likely be a multi-year journey"" and one that will depress Target's earnings for years to come. In the very short term, GH warns that Wall Street's expectation of a return to profits growth ($4.03 in earnings projected for fiscal 2018) is overoptimistic, and earnings could instead decline 10% next year (to $3.60). If and when that happens, Target shareholders could be in for a shock. GH advises the better move is to sell the stock today, rather than be unpleasantly surprised by its performance next year. In a buy recommendation out this morning, positing a $90 price target for Wal-Mart stock, GH argues that the once-reviled retailer ""is not your father's Wal-Mart anymore."" Rather, Wal-Mart is ""building a digital ecosystem that should have tangible benefits across the enterprise,"" and help the company to compete better against not just Target, but Amazon.com as well. Investments in IT, says GH, are giving Wal-Mart advantages in better ""access to customer data"" and creating ""cross-over benefits for in-store traffic."" And the proof is in the pudding: Whereas Target's same-store sales are dropping, GH notes that Wal-Mart is growing same-store sales, and in particular, attracting more millennial shoppers to its stores. While Target's profits slump, Gordon Haskett sees Wal-Mart's earnings rising, and even exceeding other analyst estimates. This year, GH predicts that Wal-Mart will earn about $4.37 per diluted share ($0.05 more than the Wall Street consensus). That would price the stock at about 17.6 times current-year earnings at Wal-Mart's share price today. What's more, GH says its predictions could prove ""a touch conservative"" -- in which case, Wal-Mart's stock is even cheaper than it looks. ","

Shares of Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), an industry leader in fuel-cell solutions, soared last month as investors celebrated the company's announcement of a strategic agreement with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Following the successful deployment of Plug Power's fuel-cell solution at one of its warehouses in the fourth quarter of 2016, Amazon will now transition its forklifts to hydrogen power at several other distribution centers. According to Plug Power's press release, the recently signed deal with Amazon could be worth as much as $70 million in revenue for fiscal 2017 and $600 million overall. Considering Plug Power reported $86 million in revenue for fiscal year 2016, and the company currently has a market cap of about $494 million, it's clear why investors took so kindly to news of the deal. Image source: Getty Images. Plug Power, as part of the agreement, also provided Amazon with a warrant to purchase up to 55,286,696 shares. Approximately 35 million shares will have an exercise price of $1.1893 per share; however, the exercise price of the remaining shares will be determined at a later date. According to the deal, the warrant is exercisable through April 4, 2027. Those bullish on Plug Power may see the deal with Amazon as vindication -- proof that fuel-cell solutions are a valid alternative to traditional power sources. But people interpreting the deal as a harbinger of profitability must temper their enthusiasm and recall the company's deal with Wal-Mart. Forged in 2013, the relationship has led to significant top-line growth for Plug Power but unremarkable bottom-line growth. PLUG Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts. Investors should be circumspect about the deal -- not just in terms of annual revenue, but how it affects shareholder value. For all of its financial woes, Plug Power has managed to operate without burdening itself with substantial debt. Unable to generate positive operational cash flow, though, the company has relied on raising equity to keep the lights on. The deal with Amazon further exemplifies this. Currently, Plug Power has about 233 million shares outstanding, according to Morningstar; however, the deal with Amazon could result in notable dilution: The share count could rise by as much as 24%.

Income investors love stocks that pay healthy dividends, and one of the biggest achievements a dividend stock can reach is to become a Dividend Aristocrat. The S&P Dividend Aristocrats include those stocks that meet the requirements that S&P Dow Jones Indices imposes. To qualify, a stock must have raised its annual dividend payment for at least 25 consecutive years, and it must be a member of the S&P 500 Index (SNPINDEX:^GSPC). Below, you'll see a complete list of current S&P Dividend Aristocrats, along with their current dividend yields. Stock Years of Consecutive Dividend Increases Current Dividend Yield 3M (NYSE:MMM) 59 2.4% Aflac (NYSE:AFL) 34 2.3% AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) 45* 4% Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) 45* 2.4% Air Products & Chemicals (NYSE:APD) 35 2.7% Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) 42 2.8% AT&T (NYSE:T) 33 5% Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) 42 2.2% C.R.

Finance. * Abbott Labs spun off AbbVie; AbbVie's inclusion assumes carry-forward of Abbott's dividend streak, while Abbott's continuing inclusion accounts for spinoff. There are a few things that investors need to keep in mind about the list of S&P Dividend Aristocrats. First of all, there's a little bit of controversy about whether every stock on this list should be included. For instance, both Abbott Labs and AbbVie appear on the list, because the methodology for the index assumes that the spun-off AbbVie should inherit the original dividend streak of former parent Abbott Labs. But one could just as easily disqualify either, or both, on the basis of the spinoff. Image source: Getty Images. On the flip side, some stocks that arguably could appear on the list don't. Altria Group (NYSE:MO) is a good example, with 50 dividend increases over the past 47 years. The problem, though, is that Altria did spinoffs of various business units, including its Kraft food unit and its international tobacco business, Philip Morris International. Because of those moves, Altria doesn't appear on the list despite it being one of the most important dividend stocks of the past half-century. Finally, notice that, just because a stock is a Dividend Aristocrat, it doesn't mean that it has a particularly high yield. Several stocks on the list have yields of 1.5% or less, which is considerably below the market average. Moreover, there's no minimum amount by which a company must raise the dividend in order to qualify as an increase. That leads some companies to do token increases to extend a streak, and while small boosts are better than nothing, it's unclear whether such moves are really consistent with the spirit of S&P Dividend Aristocrat membership. Even with these caveats, the stocks that are part of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats have proven themselves to be able to boost their dividend payouts in strong economies and in recessionary conditions. With that kind of resilience, Dividend Aristocrats deserve the reputation they have, and also are worth a closer look from dividend investors, generally. ","

Rachel Koning Beals,05112017,MarketWatch,05042017,"Published: May 4, 2017 5:36 a.m. ET Realistic looking toy guns have become a problem for law enforcement By It’s not just real gun violence that’s killing people. Highly detailed realistic toy guns are increasingly putting the public and law enforcement in danger. That’s according to at least one major metropolitan police union, prompting its officers to go after the toy companies themselves. The Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association, through its lawyer, said this week it plans to file a federal lawsuit in the coming months against toy gun manufacturers. The realistic look of toy guns has been a supercharged issue since the 2014 shooting death in Cleveland of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. In that case, police were called to a recreation center after a witness saw Rice playing with what turned out to be a toy gun that shoots pellets. One of the responding officers shot and killed Rice within seconds of arriving at the scene. And it was the genuine look of the toy that in part prompted prosecutors not to charge the officers. (The city of Cleveland has agreed to pay Rice’s family $6 million.) The quick shooting was also one of many high-profile, officer-involved deaths that have exposed the sometimes tumultuous relationship between police forces and minorities in the communities they serve. A Washington Post study released in December, drawing from a national database of fatal police shootings, found that from 2015 to the point in 2016 when the study was conducted, police had killed 86 people in the U.S. who were brandishing guns that looked real but were fake. Read: Cleveland to pay $6 million to settle Tamir Rice wrongful-death suit Such action by a police union appears to be rare. The Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association hopes that other major police unions, including Columbus and Dallas, will join in its suit, the association’s attorney, Henry Hilow, told Cleveland’s News 5. He said the civil lawsuit will not seek financial damages, rather design restrictions. (Hilow did not say which toy companies would be targeted by the lawsuit or when exactly the lawsuit will be filed.) In Columbus, in 2016, 13-year-old Tyre King was shot and killed by officers after the teen, according to the police account, pulled a gun from his waistband that officers said looked much like their own department-issued Smith & Wesson

                                   semiautomatic pistol, complete with laser sight. It turned out to be a BB gun. The Washington Post’s count of these types of incidents even included a senior citizen in a motorized scooter shot while “waving” a pellet gun, the report said. Often, the shootings happened at night and, according to police reports, because the fake guns were pointed at officers. The Toy Industry Association was not immediately available for comment. It previously released a lengthy statement stating that toys themselves do not promote aggressive behavior. “Quite often, military and other role-play items may help kids work through or cope with what is happening in the world around them through play rather than through outwardly aggressive behavior,” it said. “There have been a number of unfortunate incidents where items have been mistaken by law enforcement for real guns, often resulting in tragedy ...Toys are subject to stringent federal marking requirements that mandate the use of brightly-colored markings; these other items are not.” The National Rifle Association (NRA), a pro-gun lobby, through an education arm, says parents have the responsibility to teach their children the difference between a toy gun and a real gun, and the difference between “pretend” and real life. The group argues that realistic-looking guns add to the element of play. And, authenticity overall teaches juveniles to respect guns, the NRA has said. Don’t miss: This is how much gun injuries cost the U.S. every year But other groups, including Moms Demand Action, have been critical of the NRA’s reluctance to get behind design restrictions for toys and for the more sophisticated air guns that do fire projectiles — for instance, laws that require toys to be only brightly colored or include other noticeably distinguishable features, such as fluorescent strips. Federal statutes do mandate that air guns have an orange plug inserted in the gun’s barrel, but they can be removed. State laws on air gun regulation tend to vary widely, with some states treating them as regular firearms. The NRA has said that brightly colored air guns may cause children to respect them less than they do real guns, which could pose dangers. “Just like real” was the convincing tag line on most toy gun ads from the 1940s to 1980s. In fact, early toy guns were often made by the same companies that made the firearms they were modeled after and toy gun sales tended to rise after each world war. But sales of those guns began to fall after the Vietnam War was broadcast into people’s homes, wrote Penn State historian Gary Cross in his book, “Kids’ Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood.” Hasbro

Bill Bischoff,05112017,MarketWatch,05042017,"Published: May 8, 2017 10:15 a.m. ET But how much of this will actually become law? By Last week, the GOP-controlled House passed the American Health Care Act -- the AHCA -- to “repeal and replace” Obamacare. However, the bill still has to get through the Senate to become law, and that may not happen without some significant modifications. Assuming something is eventually passed by the Senate, it’s a good bet that the final product will include most or all of the AHCA’s proposed tax changes. Here are the most important proposed tax changes that would affect individuals. Repeal of “individual mandate” penalty on those without “adequate” health insurance coverage The Obamacare legislation imposed the so-called individual mandate, which is really a tax penalty on individuals and families without government-approved health insurance coverage. The penalty was phased in over several years. For 2017, the penalty is generally the greater of: (1) $695 for each uninsured household member ($347.50 for members under 18), subject to a maximum of $2,085 or (2) 2.5% of your income in excess of the applicable 2017 federal income tax return filing threshold, which depends on your filing status. Repeal effective date: The AHCA would repeal the individual mandate penalty, effective this year. Repeal of premium tax credit and replacement with new tax credit regime The Obamacare legislation established the so-called premium tax credit (PTC) to help lower- and middle-income folks pay for their Obamacare health insurance premiums. The PTC is basically a health insurance subsidy that is laundered through the federal income tax system. Effective in 2020, the AHCA would repeal the existing PTC and replace it with a new health insurance coverage credit. This would be another subsidy laundered through the tax system. The new credit would be calculated monthly, based on the taxpayer’s qualified coverage in effect for that month. At this point, it’s not worth going into further detail on this -- because if anything is sure to be substantially changed by the Senate, it is the new health insurance credit regime. Repeal effective date: As stated, the existing PTC would be replaced by the new health insurance coverage credit in 2020. Repeal of additional 0.9% Medicare tax on salaries and self-employment income earned by people who earn over a certain amount Before Obamacare, the Medicare tax on salary and/or self-employment (SE) income was a flat 2.9%. If you are an employee, 1.45% was withheld from your paychecks, and the other 1.45% was paid by your employer. If you are self-employed, you paid the whole 2.9% yourself. The Obamacare legislation imposed an extra 0.9% Medicare tax charged on: (1) salary and/or SE income above $200,000 for an unmarried individual, (2) combined salary and/or SE income above $250,000 for a married joint-filing couple, and (3) salary and/or SE income above $125,000 for those who use married filing separate status. For self-employed individuals, the additional 0.9% Medicare tax hit comes in the form of a higher SE bill. Repeal effective date: The AHCA would repeal the 0.9% Medicare tax, beginning in 2023. Repeal of 3.8% Medicare surtax on investment income on people who make over a certain amount Before Obamacare, investment income was not subject to any sort of Medicare tax. The Obamacare legislation imposed a 3.8% Medicare surtax on all or part of your net investment income, including long-term capital gains and dividends. Therefore, under the current rules, the maximum federal rate on long-term gains and qualified dividends is actually 23.8% (20% for the “regular” capital-gains tax plus 3.8% for the net investment income tax) versus the advertised 20% maximum rate. The 3.8% surtax does not hit you unless your adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds: (1) $200,000 if you’re unmarried, (2) $250,000 if you’re a married joint-filer, or (3) $125,000 if you use married filing separate status. If you are affected, the 3.8% surtax applies to the lesser of your net investment income or the amount of AGI in excess of the applicable threshold. For example, a married joint-filing couple with AGI of $325,000 and $100,000 of net investment income would pay the 3.8% surtax on $75,000 (the amount of excess AGI). If the same couple has AGI of $400,000, they would pay the 3.8% surtax on $100,000 (the entire amount of their net investment income). Repeal effective date: The AHCA would repeal the 3.8% Medicare surtax on net investment income, beginning this year. That’s more like it! Repeal of cap on health care FSA contributions Before Obamacare, there was no tax-law limit on annual contributions to your employer’s health care flexible spending account (FSA) plan (although many plans imposed their own limits). Amounts you contribute to a health care FSA are subtracted from your taxable salary. Then you can use the funds to reimburse yourself tax-free to cover qualified medical expenses. The Obamacare legislation imposed an annual $2,500 cap -- with inflation adjustments -- on health care FSA contributions for each employee. The inflation-adjusted cap for 2017 is $2,600. Repeal effective date: The AHCA would repeal the health care FSA contribution cap, beginning this year. Repeal of increased threshold for itemized medical expense deductions and establishment of new lower threshold Before Obamacare, you could claim an itemized deduction for medical expenses paid for you, your spouse, and your dependents, to the extent those expenses exceeded 7.5% of your AGI. The Obamacare legislation raised the deduction threshold to 10% of AGI. This unfavorable change was phased in over several years, depending on your age. Under current law, the 10%-of-AGI deduction threshold applies to taxpayers of all ages for 2017 and beyond. Repeal effective date: The AHCA would repeal the 10%-of-AGI deduction threshold and establish a new lower threshold of 5.8% of AGI, beginning this year. Higher deductible contributions to health savings accounts (HSAs) Starting in 2018, the AHCA would increase the maximum annual contribution amounts to tax-smart health savings accounts (HSAs). HSA contributions are deductible for federal income tax purposes. You can then take tax-free HSA withdrawals to reimburse yourself for qualified medical expenses. Under current law, the maximum HSA contribution for 2017 is $3,400 for self-only coverage and $6,750 for family coverage (anything other than self-only coverage). The AHCA would greatly increase the maximum annual deductible contribution amounts, starting in 2018. Next year, the maximums would be $6,650 for self-only coverage and $13,300 for family coverage. The maximums for later years would be increased for inflation. Maximum contribution amounts are increased by $1,000 for HSA owners who are age 55 or older. For a primer on how HSAs work under the existing rules, see Obamacare may be making health savings accounts more popular. ",How Trump’s health care bill would impact your taxes - MarketWatch

Tuesday’s stock gain has added $150 million in losses to the $216.4 million of losses shorts have suffered in 2017, according to Igor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3. “We will see over the next few weeks whether Wayfair short sellers hold onto their positions, begin to buy to cover in the face of additional losses, or see this rally as an entry point to increase their exposure,” Dusaniwsky wrote in a note. “But because stock-borrow availability is beginning to get tight, additional shorting will become more expensive. Short sellers will hope that their thesis is correct and correct quickly.” One analyst said the company’s path to profitability is not a sure thing. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, questioned whether Wayfair is generating growth that will prove sustainable, and said his sense is that the company is spending heavily on marketing and advertising, a common way for internet companies to acquire new customers. Wayfair has added 2.8 million new active customers to its user base in the last year, but it spent $429.7 million to do so, he said. “This means the cost of customer acquisition is running at around $153 per head,” he said. “Although a crude calculation as the advertising drives other things, given that customers only spend an average of $394 in a year, this seems absurdly high and means that once other costs are taken into account, there is no scope for profit.” If Wayfair were to cut back on its ad spend, it would likely lose repeat customers, suggesting its business model is not sustainable, said Saunders. Then there’s the competitive threat from other online retailers that are moving into the home space and making that market more challenging. These include At Home Group Inc.

"I provide insights on economics, politics and markets.",05112017,MarketWatch,05042017,"(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) The momentum, ETF, indexing, park-your-brains-at-the-door market continues to rise despite a weak economy and mixed corporate earnings. There have been some positive earnings surprises, but these only lead investors to drive up already overvalued stocks to more unsustainable levels (i.e. CMG). Naturally the economically illiterate financial press continues to fudge the facts by reporting non-GAAP rather than GAAP earnings, emphasize positive rather than negative news, misrepresent the true state of the economy, and generally embarrass itself in the eyes of anyone with a functioning frontal cortex. It’s a race to the bottom between the mainstream political press and the financial press, but anybody depending on either one to learn what’s going on in the world is a fool. The latest example of this type of intellectual fraud was the treatment of the first quarter earnings of Caterpillar (CAT), a chronic underperformer that underperformed again in the first quarter by reporting year-over-year GAAP earnings down 30%. Naturally Barron’s jumped on the bandwagon with a front page article touting the company, a sure sign of more bad news to come. You heard little about this because all that the so-called financial journalists could croon about was that non-GAAP earnings, flattered by enormous restructuring charges, beat Wall Street expectations, leading equally clueless investors to bid up CAT stock. But non-GAAP earnings are fake news and GAAP earnings are real news, so CAT’s business continues to struggle while investors chase a ghost. This is typical of the type of mindless momentum-chasing behavior we see in a market that grows more overvalued every day. This is what happens when investors don’t have to buy individual stocks (or even know what individual companies do) but merely buy ETFs and when the average wealth manager and ETF manager has no business being in the investment business.  Five companies accounted for 45% of the Nasdaq’s year-to-date gains: Apple (AAPL) – 15.3%; Amazon.com (AMZN) – 7.6%; Facebook (FB) – 7.5%; Alphabet (GOOG) – 6.5% and Microsoft (MSFT) – 4.5%. These five stocks now account for 10% of total U.S. market capitalization. The same five companies accounted for 28% of the gains in the S&P 500 as of April 28: Apple (up 25% year-to-date and 11% of S&P gains); Facebook (up 27% year-to-date and 5% of S&P gains); Amazon (up 21% and 4% of S&P gains before trading began on April 28, the day after its earnings release); Alphabet (up 12% year-to-date and 4% of S&P gains before trading began on April 28, the day after its earnings release); and Microsoft (up 10% year-to-date and 3% of S&P earnings). Shorts have been driven out of the market. Fred Hickey points out that last month, J.P. Morgan’s equity strategist reported that short positions in stocks, ETFs and equity futures fell to their lowest level in ten years. And Washington Service, which tracks insider trading data, reported that the ratio of corporate insider buyers to sellers declined in February to its lowest level since 1988 (something legendary investor Seth Klarman pointed out in warning that the market is looking dangerous). The executives borrowing massive amounts of low cost debt to buy back their own overvalued stock know that they are engaging in a dangerous game and want to sell as much of that stock as possible before the music stops. Despite the flight of the short sellers, I see little of interest on the long side and far more opportunity on the short side in individual stocks.  There is no value in the market but there is a lot of overvalue . I would not short the market as a whole despite my strong belief that stocks are seriously overvalued and in a bubble. Valuation is a poor guide to the timing of any correction or crash. If you feel compelled to take a stand, you should do so with out-of-the-money puts or calls on the S&P 500, but this period of euphoria could continue for a while.

Try creating a portfolio around revenue or volatility By Every investor knows that a diversified portfolio is key to managing risk and increasing the odds of holding a winning investment, but beyond spreading their money across different asset types, experts say that increasing diversity within asset classes — or even individual indexes — can mean the difference between lackluster and gangbuster returns. The default option for a lot of investors — at least based on the popularity of passive instruments — is indexes weighted by market capitalization, where the largest companies have the biggest influence on day-to-day movements. Such construction is reflective of the equity market’s make-up, as the biggest companies have the most money allocated to them, but heavy concentration within a few names can leave investors at risk.

                                   the five largest names account for 42% of the index.) A strategy biased toward those names has done well of late. Those five largest components have posted returns ranging from 26% to 65% over the past 12 months, exceeding the broader market and accounting for a sizable portion of the S&P’s nearly 17% advance over the same period. “When you invest in a market-cap weighted index, the performance and risk profile are driven by a small group of stocks at the top, which raises the question of whether you’re getting actual exposure to the entire stock market, or just to the sliver where the most capital is,” said Mannik Dhillon, president of VictoryShares and Solutions. But he added, “Unless these names keep going up, this isn’t a diverse or risk-aware way to invest.” Related: One big hurdle for smart-beta funds — a market bereft of cycles To avoid this kind of risk, investors can consider products that still track indexes like the S&P 500, holding all the same components, but differ in that the way they are weighted is determined by metrics other than market cap. One popular alternative is equal-weighted funds, where every component has the same influence on the overall index, regardless of size. What this essentially means is that the smallest companies — which also tend to be the most volatile — have an outsized influence. In periods of rising markets, this form of index construction posts appreciably stronger returns, as the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF

Learn more: How a more balanced S&P 500 can lead to richer returns Beyond that, fund providers have been offering more complex methodology for weighting, looking at more fluid metrics to determine how large they should loom within a portfolio. Dhillon’s VictoryShares, for example, offers a suite of volatility-weighted exchange-traded funds. The group, which has about $1.2 billion in combined assets, gives a larger presence to the companies that move the least. “The goal is the same — increased diversification — but what you’re essentially doing is putting all the components on an equal footing for their risk,” he said. “Risk isn’t concentrated in a few names, as in a market-cap-weighted fund, and it isn’t spread like peanut butter, like you get in equal-weighting.” The tech names that dominate the upper echelon of the S&P 500 are in the VictoryShares US 500 Volatility Wtd ETF

Over the past 12 months, the ETF is up 18.2%, compared with the 16.6% rise of the S&P 500. A third alternative is revenue-weighting, which provides larger exposure to companies that grow revenue at a faster pace relative to the overall market. “Unlike market capitalization, a revenue-weighted strategy does not take into account a company’s stock price. Stock prices are often driven by investor sentiment, and historically that has been a notoriously bad indicator of a stock’s future returns,” wrote OppenheimerFunds in a research report. The firm offers a number of funds constructed along these lines. “Unlike earnings, revenue cannot be easily manipulated by accountants without serious consequences, and unlike dividends, it is not subject to a decision by the company’s management.” OppenheimerFunds, citing data from Ned Davis Research, said that fully 100% of revenue-weighted small- and mid-cap funds outperformed their benchmark over a 10-year period, while 95% of large-cap funds did.

Wal-Mart and analysts said the company is benefiting from a $2.7 billion investment to increase entry-level wages and enhance the training of its workforce, which has led to better stocked shelves and cleaner stores. It said store visits rose 1.5 percent, the tenth consecutive quarterly increase. Earlier in the day, shares of Wal-Mart rose to $77.40 - a 52-week high. They were trading at $77 in mid-day. Wal-Mart’s efforts to close the gap with rival Amazon.com has started gaining momentum even as other retailers like department store chains struggle. Online sales for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer rose 63 percent in the first quarter, which was higher than 29 percent growth in the fourth quarter and 20 percent in the third quarter. Online sales added 0.8 percentage points to the first quarter comparable sales gain. Growth in the business has been picking up after Wal-Mart said in October it would slow down new store openings to focus on expanding its e-commerce business. U.S. e-commerce chief Marc Lore told reporters in a call that online sales growth was boosted by offering free two-day shipping without membership fees, and higher repeat orders. “We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we’re capable of,” said Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon. The company said most of the internet sales growth was from existing online operations rather than from acquisitions. Wal-Mart, which acquired Jet.com in 2016, this year alone has snatched up online retail startups Shoebuy, Moosejaw and Modcloth, and is currently in talks with small online clothing retailer Bonobos. “Wal-Mart’s long string of investments in labor and e-commerce, including acquisitions, are enabling modest market share gains,” John Zolidis, director equity research with the Buckingham Research Group said. Wal-Mart’s performance, along with rival Target’s results on Wednesday, bucked a string of weak results from retailers Macy’s Inc and J.C. Penney. Target reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings and sales. Wal-Mart said sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.4 percent, excluding fuel price fluctuations, and was the 11th consecutive quarterly increase. Analysts were expecting a 1.3 percent increase, according to Consensus Metrix. Wal-Mart is aggressively investing in making prices more competitive compared to rivals. It has asked vendors to offer grocery prices that are 15 percent lower than competitors. Wal-Mart’s U.S. Chief Executive Greg Foran said comparable sales in food and grocery improved during the quarter on lower food deflation, without sharing details. Grocery accounts for nearly 53 percent of overall revenue for the retailer. “Wal-Mart’s commitment to value pricing is driving traffic and growth in grocery and aggressive online strides are impacting comparable sales,” Cowen & Co’s senior research analyst Oliver Chen said in a note. Earnings per share was $1 for the quarter ended on April 30, exceeding the analysts’ average estimate of 96 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Consolidated net income fell to $3.04 billion from $3.08 billion due to a higher tax rate. Quarterly revenue rose 1.4 percent to $117.5 billion, slightly lower than analysts expectations of $117.7 billion due to a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of overseas sales. Revenue grew 2.8 percent on a currency neutral basis. For the second quarter, Wal-Mart expects an increase of 1.5 percent to 2 percent in U.S. same-store sales. It forecast earnings per share of $1 to $1.08, against market expectations of $1.07. ","

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday ordered Wal-Mart Stores Inc Chief Executive Douglas McMillon to submit to questioning in a lawsuit by shareholders hoping to learn what he knows about suspected bribery by the world’s largest retailer in Mexico. U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Arkansas,  said McMillon’s “direct and personal involvement” in matters underlying a class-action lawsuit justified requiring him to sit for a deposition by the shareholders’ lawyers. McMillon had been president of Wal-Mart International during a period when shareholders led by a Michigan pension fund said the retailer concealed suspected bribery by its Wal-Mart de Mexico unit to government officials, to speed up store openings. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer had argued that McMillon lacked the “unique or special knowledge” to justify burdening him with a deposition. But the judge said McMillon, who became chief executive in February 2014, took part in several meetings, saw dozens of communications, and had certified many public statements by Wal-Mart about the alleged bribery. “It appears to the court that McMillon has unique knowledge of relevant issues in this litigation that only he can explain,” Hickey wrote. A deposition could last four hours, she added. Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said: “We are reviewing the order and contemplating our next steps.” Jason Forge, a lawyer for the lead plaintiff City of Pontiac General Employees’ Retirement System, said in an email: “We’re determined to try this case in court.” Wal-Mart’s market value slid $17 billion over three days in April 2012 after the New York Times reported the alleged bribery and said it had been first discovered internally in 2005. Shareholders accused Wal-Mart and Mike Duke, who preceded McMillon as chief executive, of downplaying the scheme even after learning about the Times’ investigation. The class period runs from Dec. 8, 2011 to April 20, 2012. Earlier this week, Bloomberg News said Wal-Mart may pay about $300 million to settle a U.S. government probe into suspected bribery in Mexico, India and China, citing people familiar with the matter. A $300 million payment would represent about one week of profit for Wal-Mart. The case is City of Pontiac General Employees’ Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Arkansas, No. 12-05162. ","

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"(Reuters) - Two former Wal-Mart Stores Inc employees have filed a lawsuit accusing the retailer of treating thousands of pregnant workers as “second-class citizens” by rejecting their requests to limit heavy lifting, climbing on ladders and other potentially dangerous tasks. The proposed class action lawsuit was filed in federal court in Illinois on Friday by Talisa Borders and Otisha Woolbright, who say that until 2014, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart had a company-wide policy that denied pregnant women the same accommodations as workers with other disabilities. The class could include at least 20,000 women and possibly up to 50,000 who worked at Wal-Mart while pregnant before the policy change, according to the lawsuit. The company in a statement provided by spokesman Randy Hargrove denied the women’s claims and said Wal-Mart’s pregnancy policies “have always fully met or exceeded both state and federal law.” The company said a separate anti-discrimination policy it maintains has long listed pregnancy as a protected status. “Walmart is a great place for women to work,” the company said. Borders and Woolbright say that Wal-Mart’s old policy violated a federal law requiring employers to treat pregnancy as a temporary disability and provide work accommodations to pregnant women. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 2015 case involving United Parcel Service, said employers cannot treat pregnant workers differently from those with other disabilities or medical conditions. Wal-Mart, the largest private U.S. employer, changed its policy in 2014 to treat pregnancy as a disability. But lawyers for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit say the changes did not go far enough, and they were planning a separate lawsuit involving the new policy. Woolbright says her manager at a Florida Wal-Mart told her pregnancy was “no excuse” for not doing heavy lifting. She says she was fired from her job in the deli department after injuring herself lifting trays that weighed up to 50 pounds and inquiring further about the company’s pregnancy policies. Borders, who worked at an Illinois Wal-Mart, says she was reprimanded for asking coworkers to climb ladders and lift heavy boxes while she was pregnant, and forced to go on unpaid leave. When she returned, she says, she was paid $2.00 less per hour. The case is Borders v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, No. 3:17-cv-00506. ","

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - German discount supermarket chain Lidl is set to open its first set of U.S. stores this summer, raising the stakes for American  grocery chain operators who have been caught in an intense price war. Lidl said in February it planned to open its first 20 U.S. stores in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, with 80 more to follow in the United States within the first year. Another rival, German discounter Aldi Inc, is aiming for prices 21 percent below its U.S. competition and is aggressively expanding its presence. Lidl (which rhymes with “needle”) is owned by Germany’s privately held Schwarz Group. It operates more than 10,000 stores in 27 countries. The German chain’s U.S. CEO, Brendan Proctor, will address Lidl’s U.S. expansion plans at a New York press event on Tuesday. According to the company’s website, it is hiring workers in 38 cities in the eastern U.S. states of Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia. “The growth of Aldi and Lidl will require existing U.S. grocery retailers to start asking themselves how they can do things differently to control costs – from marketing and merchandising to operations and logistics,” Bill Bishop, co-founder of retail consultancy Bricks Meets Clicks, said in an interview on Friday. Lidl is expected to post U.S. sales of roughly $1 billion in 2018, $2 billion in 2019 and $4 billion 2020, assuming it opens just under 100 stores per year, according to a recent note by retail think tank Fung Global Retail and Technology. This would put Lidl in close range of U.S. grocery chains like Ingles market, which had revenue of $3.2 billion in 2016; Sprouts Farmers Market with $4.3 billion in sales last year and SuperValu Inc SVU.N, which posted sales of $4.8 billion, the report said. Analyst estimates suggest Lidl is eyeing more than 330 U.S stores by 2020. The retailer has opened three distribution centers in Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia. ","

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"BEIJING/LONDON (Reuters) - The WannaCry “ransomware” cyber attack hobbled Chinese traffic police and schools on Monday as it rolled into Asia for the new work week, while authorities in Europe said they were trying to prevent hackers from spreading new versions of the virus. In Britain, where the virus first raised global alarm when it caused hospitals to divert ambulances on Friday, it gained traction as a political issue just weeks before a general election. The opposition Labour Party accused the Conservative government of leaving the National Health Service vulnerable. Shares in firms that provide cyber security services rose with the prospect that companies and governments would have to spend more money on defences. Some victims were ignoring official advice and paying the $300 ransom demanded by the cyber criminals to unlock their computers, which was due to double to $600 on Monday for computers hit by Friday’s first wave. Brian Lord, managing director of cyber and technology at cyber security firm PGI, said victims had told him the hackers offered good service, with helpful advice on how to pay: “One customer said they actually forgot they were being robbed.” But the hackers do not appear so far to have been well rewarded: only about $50,000 has been transferred to their online wallets so far, according to Elliptic Labs which tracks transactions using the internet currency bitcoin. Although the virus’s spread was curbed over the weekend in most of the world, France, where carmaker Renault was among the world’s highest profile victims, said more attacks were likely. “We should expect similar attacks regularly in the coming days and weeks,” said Giullaume Poupard, head of French government cyber security agency ANSSI. “Attackers update their software ... other attackers will learn from the method and will carry out attacks.” Companies and governments spent the weekend upgrading software to limit the spread of the virus. Monday was the first big test for Asia, where offices had already mostly been closed for the weekend before the attack first arrived. British media were hailing as a hero a 22-year-old computer security whiz who appeared to have helped stop the attack from spreading by discovering a “kill switch” - an internet address which halted the virus when activated. China appeared over the weekend to have been particularly vulnerable, raising worries about how well the world’s second largest economy would cope when it opened for business on Monday. However, officials and security firms said the spread was starting to slow. “The growth rate of infected institutions on Monday has slowed significantly compared to the previous two days,” said Chinese Internet security company Qihoo 360. “Previous concerns of a wide-scale infection of domestic institutions did not eventuate.” Qihoo had previously said the attack had infected close to 30,000 organisations by Saturday evening, more than 4,000 of which were educational institutions. Yang Lin, a journalism student at China’s Zhejiang University of Media and Communications, told Reuters she had lost her work from four years of study. She had just finished revising her thesis late on Friday when her screen went black and the hackers’ message appeared. “I was connected to the university network. I didn’t open any link,” she said. “I just cried. I was afraid to believe it, but had to accept it.” The virus hit computers running older versions of Microsoft software that had not been recently updated. Microsoft released patches last month and on Friday to fix a vulnerability that allowed the worm to spread across networks. In a blog post on Sunday, Microsoft President Brad Smith appeared to tacitly acknowledge what researchers had already widely concluded: the attack made use of a hacking tool built by the U.S. National Security Agency and leaked online. Russian President Vladimir Putin, noting the technology’s link to the U.S. spy service, said it should be “discussed immediately on a serious political level”. “Once they’re let out of the lamp, genies of this kind, especially those created by intelligence services, can later do damage to their authors and creators,” he said. Infected computers appear to largely be out-of-date devices that organisations deemed not worth the price of upgrading. Some have also been machines involved in manufacturing or hospital functions, difficult to patch without disrupting operations. “The government’s response has been chaotic, to be frank,” the British Labour Party’s health spokesman Jon Ashworth said. “They’ve complacently dismissed warnings which experts, we now understand, have made in recent weeks.” “The truth is, if you’re going to cut infrastructure budgets and if you’re not going to allow the NHS to invest in upgrading its IT, then you are going to leave hospitals wide open to this sort of attack.” Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) is the world’s fifth largest employer after the U.S. and Chinese militaries, Walmart and McDonald’s. The government says that under a previous Labour administration the trusts that run local hospitals were given responsibility to manage their own computer systems. Asked if the government had ignored warnings over the NHS being at risk from cyber attack, Prime Minister Theresa May told Sky News: “No. It was clear warnings were given to hospital trusts.” An official from Cybersecurity Administration China (CAC) told local media on Monday that while the ransomware was still spreading and had affected industry and government computer systems, the spread was slowing. Chinese government bodies from transport, social security, industry watchdogs and immigration said they had suspended services ranging from processing applications to traffic crime enforcement. It was not immediately clear whether those services were suspended due to attacks, or for emergency patching to prevent infection. “If a system supports some kind of critical processes those systems typically are very hard to patch ... We don’t have a precedent for something of this scale (in China),” said Marin Ivezic, a cybersecurity expert at PwC in Hong Kong. Affected bodies included a social security department in the city of Changsha, the exit-entry bureau in Dalian, a housing fund in Zhuhai and an industry watchdog in Xuzhou. Energy giant PetroChina said payment systems at some of its petrol stations were hit, although it had been able to restore most of the systems. Elsewhere in Asia, the impact seems to have been more limited. Japan’s National Police Agency reported two breaches of computers in the country on Sunday - one at a hospital and the other case involving a private person - but no loss of funds. Industrial conglomerate Hitachi Ltd. said the attack had affected its systems at some point over the weekend, leaving them unable to receive and send e-mails or open attachments in some cases. In India, the government said it had only received a few reports of attacks on systems and urged those hit not to pay attackers any ransom. No major Indian corporations reported disruptions to operations. At Indonesia’s biggest cancer hospital, Dharmais Hospital in Jakarta, around 100-200 people packed waiting rooms after the institution was hit by cyber attacks affecting scores of computers. By late morning, some people were still filling out forms manually, but the hospital said 70 percent of systems were back online. South Korea’s presidential Blue House office said nine cases of ransomware were found in the country, but did not provide details on where the cyber attacks were discovered. A coal port in New Zealand shut temporarily to upgrade its systems. Graphic on cyber attack tmsnrt.rs/2qIUckv ","

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"LONDON (Reuters) - The most disruptive cyber attack in the history of Britain’s National Health Service propelled a debate over state hospital funding to the center of the election campaign on Monday, though officials said there had been no second wave of infections. The “WannaCry” worm global attack, which locks computers and demands a $300 ransom, sowed chaos on Friday through the computer systems of some NHS hospitals which canceled operations and reduced non-emergency care. Although experts had voiced fears that a second wave of attacks could strike systems on Monday, the British authorities said this appeared to have been avoided. “Across the globe, events today have been at the lower end of our expectations,” said Ciaran Martin, the head of the National Cyber Security Centre which is part of Britain’s surveillance spy agency GCHQ. “We’re continuing to investigate a small number of potential cases but there is nothing new to report,” Martin said. Scores of organizations inside the NHS, which provides free medical care for all and is a source of pride for Britons, were hit by the ransomware on Friday. On Monday, the opposition Labour Party said Prime Minister Theresa May’s response to the crisis had been poor and her government was to blame for failing to invest to keep the service secure. Some hospitals still asked patients on Monday to seek treatment only for life-threatening emergencies. Opinion polls show the NHS is the issue voters care most about, ahead even of Britain’s exit from the European Union and the economy, before the June 8 national election. “The government’s response has been chaotic, to be frank,” Labour’s health spokesman Jon Ashworth said. “They’ve complacently dismissed warnings which experts, we now understand, have made in recent weeks. “The truth is, if you’re going to cut infrastructure budgets and if you’re not going to allow the NHS to invest in upgrading its IT, then you are going to leave hospitals wide open to this sort of attack,” he added. Britain spends about 145 billion pounds ($187 billion) a year on health, or about a fifth of its state budget. Spending is projected to rise in real terms, although Labour says the government’s plans do not provide enough to prevent a looming health crisis due to an ageing population. The NHS, which was showcased in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games, employs more than 1.5 million people, making it the world’s fifth biggest employer after the U.S. and Chinese militaries, Walmart and McDonald’s. Officials struggled to explain why some NHS computers had not been “patched” with Microsoft updates to close the vulnerability that allowed the worm to spread across its networks. “There are things you can do that everyone can do (...) in particular making sure that our data is properly backed up and making sure that we are using the software patches,” said Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Security Minister Ben Wallace said the government used to contract for computer services across the entire NHS but that in 2007 - when the Labour Party was in power - that was stopped and left to the local trusts that run hospitals. In a snap election campaign which May has dominated so far, the debate over the cyber attack on the NHS forced her onto the defensive, although it was not immediately clear what impact, if any, it would have on her popularity. Britain’s spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, warned in 2014 that some NHS organizations had “limited understanding of the threat and they do not yet understand what would represent an appropriate level of threat protection”. Asked if the government had ignored warnings over the NHS being at risk from cyber attack, May told Sky News: “No. It was clear (that) warnings were given to hospital trusts.” She said the attack had not been focused on the NHS but was part of a wide international issue, and said the government had invested 2 billion pounds in cyber security. “We take cyber security seriously,” said May, who was responsible for domestic security for six years as home secretary before becoming prime minister last year. A poll on Monday found three-quarters of Britons thought the NHS was in a bad condition and more than 50 percent blamed the Conservatives for its current woes. Government ministers were due to hold an emergency response meeting later on Monday to deal with the crisis. A spokesman for May said the annual information technology budget in the NHS was 4.2 billion pounds and that an extra 50 million pounds had been allocated for updating cyber security. ","

The German grocery store chain, with 1,600 locations in the U.S., offers prices that are 21 percent lower than its rivals like Wal-Mart Stores, a gap that CEO Jason Hart says he plans to maintain. Aldi’s sales have doubled in the past five years in the U.S. (See also: Wal-Mart CEO’s Compensation Increases to $22.4 Mln.) Hart wants to add more private-label products to lure price-sensitive customers and anchor in its role in a grocery store market where 18 companies have gone bankrupt in the past three years.

Lauren Thomas,05182017,CNBC,05112017,"Here's what the company reported vs. what the Street was expecting: Wal-Mart's U.S. business is thriving in a challenging environment, as aggressive pricing helped bring more shoppers into stores, while efforts to expand its digital business are paying off in robust growth. The retailer's U.S. comparable sales — an important metric for retail stocks — grew for the 11th consecutive quarter, climbing 1.4 percent compared with a FactSet estimate for 1.3 percent growth. Notably, Wal-Mart was also able to increase traffic to its U.S. stores again, at a time when others are seeing fewer shoppers. The retailer said its comparable sales traffic grew 3 percent, on a two-year stacked basis. Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales rose a whopping 63 percent, compared with 29 percent growth last quarter. Despite making a number of acquisitions, the majority of these sales were organic through Walmart.com, the company said. Shares of Wal-Mart were up 2.7 percent to $77.15 in early trading Thursday. Wal-Mart's total fiscal first-quarter revenue grew 1.4 percent, to $117.54 billion, falling slightly short of a $117.74 billion forecast by analysts. Earnings per share rose 2 percent to $1.00, up from 98 cents a year ago. The profit was higher than a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate for 96 cents a share. ""Inside the company we can see that we're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers, but we can also see plenty of room to improve,"" Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said on Thursday's earnings conference call. The big-box retailer has been making strides to expand and improve its e-commerce platform. The company recently acquired Jet.com, bringing in new talent to help manage its digital operations. Jet.com's founder, Marc Lore, is now the CEO of Wal-Mart's e-commerce division. This comes at a time when Wal-Mart is locked in an online battle with players like Amazon and Target. Wal-Mart recently rolled out free two-day shipping for online orders over $35, prompting Amazon to slash its free-shipping threshold for shoppers who don't have a Prime membership. ""We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we're capable of — so that's what we're focused on,"" McMillon went on. During the first quarter, Wal-Mart's online gross margin values rose 69 percent, management added. ""E-commerce is working [for Wal-Mart],"" Barclays food and staples retail analyst Karen Short told CNBC on Thursday morning. ""And it's not coming at the expense of brick-and-mortar, because you need both to survive."" Despite Amazon wanting to eat everyone's lunch, Wal-Mart stands out from its peers in being able to capture customers online, Short said. After its purchase of Jet.com, smaller acquisitions of sites like ModCloth and Moosejaw are evidence of this, she added. ""Wal-Mart is definitely a winner."" At U.S. stores, the company said its grocery business continued to improve, with food categories delivering the strongest quarterly comparable sales performance in more than three years, due in part to a lack of market deflation in food. ""From our data, Walmart is ... also picking up some customers from mainstream grocers,"" GlobalData Retail managing director Neil Saunders wrote in a note to clients. ""The response to Walmart flexing its price muscles has been good, and we expect further small gains over the rest of this year. A more disciplined focus on low prices is also important as Aldi, and now Lidl, expand into the market."" However, Wal-Mart's heavy discounting, coupled with lower sales of higher-ticket items at the start of the quarter, resulted in a slight decline in average ticket amounts. Meanwhile, all of Wal-Mart's U.S. store formats showed positive comparable sales to start the year, the company said. For example, Wal-Mart's Sam's Club's comparable sales, excluding fuel, rose 1.6 percent, while traffic grew by 1.1 percent. Digital growth at Sam's Club ""Club Pickup"" increased nearly 30 percent, the company reported. With respect to its international locations, sales were $27.1 billion for the first quarter, a decrease of 3.5 percent. Wal-Mart no longer reports an overarching global figure for its e-commerce growth, instead choosing to focus on the U.S. market. Its domestic online performance has been outpacing results overseas, the retailer has said. Seven of Wal-Mart's 11 international markets reported positive comps to start the year, CFO Brett Biggs told analysts and investors on the conference call. ""There is a sense that Walmart is getting to grips with some of the issues, but we believe it will be some time before all parts of international make a solid contribution,"" Saunders said in the note. Wal-Mart said it now expects to earn between $1 and $1.08 per share during the second quarter, excluding a net benefit from the sale of Suburbia, the retailer's apparel format in Mexico. Thomson Reuters analysts had forecast earnings of $1.07 a share for this period. During the same period, U.S. same-store sales, excluding fuel, should grow between 1.5 and 2 percent, the company said. Sam's Club comparable sales are estimated to rise between 1 and 1.5 percent. ""In our view, Walmart's investments in price, its focus on service in stores, and its omnichannel push are all paying dividends,"" Saunders added. ""The delay in tax refunds, which resulted in lower sales of higher ticket merchandise over the early part of the quarter, put a small dent in growth, but not by enough to cause serious concern."" For fiscal 2018, Wal-Mart has said it expects to earn between $4.20 and $4.40 a share. ""Overall, [Wal-Mart's] investments have resulted in positive comparable store sales trends and improving traffic,"" Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan wrote in a recent note to clients. ""Walmart's success, along with broadly weakening brick and mortar shopping trends, has caused competing retailers to respond with their own pricing actions."" On Wednesday, big-box retail rival Target reported earnings, sales and comparable sales that topped Street expectations. Target is in the midst of a multiyear turnaround effort, as it attempts to compete with Wal-Mart's ""Everyday Low Price"" strategy and Amazon's encroaching presence over the industry. ""While [Target] is not trying to directly undercut Walmart on prices, it is trying to use everyday lower prices on daily use items to drive customers into remodeled stores that provide a better experience than Walmart,"" Astrachan said. As of Wednesday's close, shares of Wal-Mart have climbed nearly 19 percent over the past 12 months and are up about 9 percent for the year-to-date period.

Annie Pei,05182017,CNBC,05112017,"Tech giants Alphabet and Amazon are neck and neck in the race to $1,000 a share, with both stocks opening Monday trading between $955 and $960. But chart-minded trader Todd Gordon believes that Alphabet is likely to hit quadruple digits first. Gordon first tackles the question by examining the ""ratio"" of one stock to another. Dividing the share price of Alphabet by the share price of Amazon yields an upward-moving line, ""indicating the outperformance of Google relative to Amazon,"" he explained Monday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" Such outperformance could suggest that Alphabet continues to be the better bet. But as Gordon also points out, the line has flattened in the last few weeks as Amazon continued to hit new highs while Alphabet has more or less consolidated.Gordon next turns to the stock charts of both.""What's of concern here is Amazon has already tried to make the move, and we're starting to see some hesitation,"" he said. ""What I mean is we have three pushes [that happened over the past few weeks], and it feels like Amazon is starting to run out of momentum here.""On the other hand, the consolidation in Alphabet leads Gordon to believe that a breakout is on the way for the tech giant. ""It seems to be that Google is ready to break this consolidation, push higher and probably reach $1,000,"" he said. ""So it's just kind of the idea of Google sort of waiting for the correct time.""In order to capitalize on a move to $1,000, Gordon favors selling a put spread on Alphabet. This is an options trades that gives the trader some money immediately, and allows them to keep it so long as the stock closes above a given level upon the trade's expiration.To be sure, not everyone is betting on Alphabet. Monday on CNBC's ""Squawk Alley,"" Elevation Partners co-founder Roger McNamee made the case that Amazon's increasing dominance could eventually spell trouble for ad-reliant tech giants.""Eventually they're going to be such a large percentage of the retail business that when Facebook and Google are going to try to sell ads the only guy on the other side is going to be Amazon,"" giving Facebook and Alphabet little pricing power, McNamee said.

Stephanie Landsman,05182017,CNBC,05112017,"Closely watched hedge fund manager Dan Niles is taking note of unsettling activity that's getting more ominous every time the stock market hits a new high. Niles, formerly a top chip analyst on Wall Street, says there's too much complacency among investors, especially when it comes to semiconductor stocks. If those stocks see a sell-off, it could drag down the rest of the market, the founding partner at AlphaOne Capital Partners said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""The longer it keeps climbing and the higher valuations go, the more nervous I become,"" Niles said. ""We're long overdue for a correction. This is the second-longest bull market since World War II."" The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF has soared 67 percent in the past 52 weeks, a growth rate that Niles says is unsustainable. ""If you look at semiconductors — which is where I have the real problem — the semiconductor index in 2016 was up 37 percent. The revenue growth was 2 percent. This year, the semiconductor index is up 18 percent, and the revenue growth is maybe 5 percent,"" said Niles. The three best performing stocks in the S&P 500 over the last year are all semiconductor companies. Shares of NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices and Micron are all up nearly 200% or more in that period. Semiconductor companies, which are considered a highly cyclical area of tech, are facing serious demand challenges, according to Niles. Not only are they trying to cope with a PC industry that's on track to see its sixth-straight year of softer sales, a struggling auto industry could also cause semis to come home to roost as early as summer, he said. ""China's auto sales last year were really stimulated by the fact that they cut taxes down to 5 percent from 10. So that went ahead and really ramped up auto sales last year into the double digits. The most recent month, it went negative,"" said Niles. ""In the U.S., we all know what is going on with Ford."" Ford is planning to cut about 10 percent of worldwide workforce, sources told CNBC. Niles made his comments hours after Bank of America Merrill Lynch put out new research showing that the Nasdaq is the most ""crowded"" trade on the planet right now. ""This market is very concentrated to say the least. But I think you do have to look at the individual names within the market,"" said Niles, who's still positive longer-term on internet stocks, particularly Facebook and Alphabet. ""This is nowhere near 2000 where you had stocks selling pet food on the internet that were over a billion dollars,"" Niles said. ""Quite honestly, I am not as worried about the internet companies because here you're talking names that are growing 20 percent-plus. If you can think about it logically, if they go up 20 percent a year, they are just keeping up with their growth rates. In fact, if Facebook [stock] doesn't go up 40 percent, it's getting cheaper every year."" Long-time money manager Bob Doll is warning investors that stocks could breach October's correction lows.

Evelyn Cheng,05182017,CNBC,05112017,"Industrial giant Caterpillar is on the cusp of a big year of earnings growth and potential new business strategy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said Thursday. BofAML upgraded the stock to buy from neutral and raised its price target to $120, nearly 20 percent above where Caterpillar closed Wednesday. The stock, which traded flat Thursday morning, is up 8.2 percent this year, already beating the S&P 500. ""CAT is set up to beat all year long,"" research analysts Ross Gilardi, Michael Feniger and Natalie O'Dea said in the note. They said the consensus estimate for second-quarter adjusted earnings is $1.10 a share, flat from the prior year and down 14 percent from the first quarter. Such a decline is historically rare. Since 1995, Caterpillar's second-quarter earnings have rose an average 35 percent from the prior quarter and only fallen twice, in 2011 and 2015, the BofAML analysts said. They expect second-quarter earnings of $1.28 a share.

Daniel B. Kline,05182017,Fool,05112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) spent $3.3 billion to purchase Jet.com, it was buying a money-losing company with no clear path to profitability. Yes, the company had grown fast, reaching $1 billion in sales, but it was spending heavily to get there. It's possible Jet would have become a success on its own, but it's more likely that was never the end goal. The company, run by CEO Marc Lore, together with co-founders Mike Hanrahan and Nate Faust, almost certainly considered that if it got big enough, Wal-Mart -- or another brick-and-mortar retailer looking for digital answers -- would come calling. They may have even been counting on it. That's exactly what the trio had done with Quidsi, the parent company of e-commerce sites Diapers.com, Soap.com, and Wag.com. They built it up into a threat, albeit a money-losing one, and then sold it to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), with Wal-Mart also bidding. In this case, Wal-Mart may not even want Jet.com, though it's still running it as a standalone brand. What it wanted was Lore, who now runs Walmart.com, along with Jet.com and, to a lesser extent, his team. Marc Lore is charged with revamping Wal-Mart's online operations. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart may be No. 2 to Amazon when it comes to online sales, but that's a bit like saying after The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, Oasis is the best band to come out of England. It may be technically true (though not a provable fact), but the gulf between the top tier and the next one is very large. In this case, Wal-Mart bought Jet.com to hire Lore to inject start-up thinking into a brand that was simply not wired that way. To the company's credit, Lore said in his speech at the March ShopTalk conference that Wal-Mart had ""gone all in with him."" By that, he explained that the company, from CEO Doug McMillon on down, showed a willingness to break past habits and infuse digital-first thinking into the whole operation. McMillon laid out his logic for buying Jet.com in a press release when the deal was announced. What he notably did not do is try to justify the price: We're looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment, and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience, because that's what our customers want. We believe the acquisition of Jet accelerates our progress across these priorities. Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we're pursuing will happen quicker, and we'll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time. Our customers will win. It's another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Wal-Mart. My shock at the deal is not from a belief that Lore should not be running WalMart.com. He's a smart pick for the job and has shown a boldness in being willing to move fast, abandon bad ideas, and try new ones. The problem is not Lore or his team; it's that Wal-Mart bought Jet.com for $3.3 billion to get them. Wal-Mart essentially bought an executive team, some technology, a growing customer base that Jet paid dearly to acquire, and vendor relationships that enhance Wal-Mart's offering. Wal-Mart could have done all of this on its own for a fraction of the price. Jet.com's shopping cart is innovative, but Wal-Mart could clearly have built something similar. and as the world's largest retailer, the company could have created any vendor relationships it wanted to have while also pushing down prices. Lore is smart, and a good leader, but it's hard to believe he's $3.3 billion unique when it comes to solving Wal-Mart's logistics problems. Basically, the company has to figure out how to best modify a supply chain built to stock stores into one that can do that while also shipping individual orders quickly. That's a vexing problem, and one that Lore may well fix, but it's also one that could have been solved without buying Jet.com, a company that probably would have burned out or been bought by some other brick-and-mortar retailer desperate for a digital guru to tell it how to fix things. Lore will at first push Wal-Mart's digital sales higher while pushing margin down because of shipping costs. He will probably succeed in breaking some of company's ingrained thinking, and he will almost certainly frame it as a positive when the company shuts down Jet.com to better focus on its core brand. That's not something Wal-Mart has hinted at, but it's usually how these things go. This deal could end up being a success because Lore should be able to better integrate the retailer's physical and digital operations. That will be a slow process, and in the end the company will still be No. 2 behind Amazon -- a stronger No. 2, but No. 2 nonetheless. This deal feels like a panic move. Wal-Mart bought a failing competitor that never proved it had a viable model, in order to hire its team. That team may well succeed at Wal-Mart, but to accept this deal being worth what the company paid for Jet.com, you have to believe Lore was $3.3 billion better than anyone else Wal-Mart could have hired, and that's a hard pill to swallow.

    A Foolish Take: The Chart That Defines Wal-Mart -- The Motley Fool

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,05182017,Fool,05112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) controls one of the biggest portfolios of consumer product franchises in the world. Its brands span core industry segments like grooming, baby care, and household cleaning -- covering products that millions of consumers use every day. Below, we'll take a closer look at where most of this blue-chip giant's profits come from. P&G competes across 10 product categories that the company rolls into five reportable business segments: beauty, healthcare, fabric care, grooming, and baby, feminine, and family care. Image source: Getty Images. Fabric care is its single biggest division, responsible for just under one-third of sales and 27% of profits last year. Thanks to the Tide, Ariel, and Downy brands, the company is the global market share leader in laundry, with 30% of the industry under its thumb. P&G also dominates the grooming segment, where its Gillette franchise delivers an incredible 65% of the global market for razors and blades. That's down from 70% a few years ago, though, thanks to rising competition from value-based brands and online subscription services. Pampers is P&G's single biggest brand. The diaper franchise was worth $9 billion, or 14%, of revenue last year and is the category leader in the U.S. market. Rival Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) sits in second place with the Huggies brand. Procter & Gamble has operations in 70 countries and its products are sold in over 180 countries and territories. Yet most of its revenue -- 44%, to be exact -- is generated in the United States. That proportion is growing, too. In fiscal 2014, the figure stood at 39%. The heavy reliance on developed economies helps keep P&G more profitable, but also slower-growing, than peers. Unilever (NYSE:UL) gets 60% of its business from emerging markets in places like Latin America and Southeast Asia. It enjoyed 4% organic sales gains last year, compared to P&G's 1% uptick. Procter & Gamble's 21% operating margin is well ahead of Unilever's 15%, and Kimberly-Clark's 18%. UL Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. Like its rivals, P&G's global business exposes it to currency swings and to economic disruptions outside of the U.S. In fiscal 2016, for example, exchange rate swings lopped 6 percentage points off reported sales. In the prior year, the company had to take a nearly $2 billion hit in its profits from exiting the Venezuelan market amid economic turmoil. P&G gets 15% of its revenue, or about $10 billion, from Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). That's slightly more than Kimberly-Clark, which counted 14% of its business from the world's biggest retailer last year. The relationship between P&G and Wal-Mart has grown more complicated lately. In response to declining customer traffic, the retailing giant made three strategic changes that have pinched P&G's top and bottom lines. First, it has whittled down its selection of brands on display in a bid to create a more streamlined, cleaner shopping experience for customers. That's left less room on shelves for P&G to show off improvements in its core brands. Wal-Mart has also pressured its partner to lower prices so that it can better compete against rival supermarket chains. And third, the retailer is pouring resources into in-store brands that in some cases directly challenge P&G's dominance in categories like laundry, home care, and paper goods. The changes appear to be working, as they've helped deliver increasing customer traffic for Wal-Mart over the past year. For P&G, though, they've added urgency to its e-commerce initiative. Last quarter's 30% spike in that channel was a bright spot in an overall weak report. But the gain still left the digital segment at 5% of P&G's overall business. That number will need to rise significantly over the next few years for the company to maintain market share as customers do more of their shopping online. ","

Rich Smith,05182017,Fool,05112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon.com could swallow Plug Power whole -- or it might just chew it up. Image source: Getty Images. Investors in Plug Power initially applauded Plug Power's deal with Amazon, bidding Plug Power stock up 73% on the day it was announced. On the plus side, Plug Power did reaffirm its guidance for the rest of this year. With Amazon expected to begin buying Plug power units in Q2 and thereafter, Plug confirmed that it expects to book $130 million in revenue this year and earn gross profit margins of between 8% and 12% on this revenue. Think about those numbers with me for a bit. Plug Power is saying it expects to record revenue of $130 million this year, and that Amazon will spend $70 million. This means that Amazon will account for more than half Plug's business this year. If Amazon doubles its purchases of fuel cells next year, at a minimum that should mean sales of $140 million to Amazon, sales of $60 million to everyone else (if all else remains equal), and therefore Amazon comprising 70% of Plug Power's business. And yet, all else will not remain equal, says Roth Capital. This morning, investment banker Roth announced it is downgrading Plug Power stock to sell. And one of its reasons for doing so, as explained in a write-up on StreetInsider.com this morning, is that the more Plug Power begins to look like a captive supplier to Amazon, the less likely Amazon competitors will be to patronize Plug Power. Already, Roth says it expects Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) to ""dramatically reduce"" purchases of Plug Power products this year. That's a big blow for Plug Power, which according to its latest 10-K filing with the SEC, derived more than 34% of its $85 million in 2016 revenue from Wal-Mart. What would losing Wal-Mart's business do to Plug Power? As Plug admits in its own 10-K, ""a loss or decline in business with [Wal-Mart] could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations."" If that's the way things play out, Amazon may never need to buy the 23% of Plug Power's stock that it's entitled to acquire through the terms of last month's contract. Comprising fourth-fifths of Plug Power's business, Amazon would be able to essentially dictate terms to its supplier, and acquire Plug's products at whatever price it wanted to pay -- no matter how unprofitable this might be for Plug. Reading all these tea leaves, Roth Capital has come to the conclusion that far from being ""additive"" for Plug, the Amazon contract has the potential to be ""dilutive"" to Plug Power's earnings going forward. Between the ""obvious customer attrition"" that is now coming to light, and the ""poor quality of revenue, earnings, and gross margins"" that Roth expects to see ""going forward,"" Roth recommends that investors sell Plug Power stock now -- before the stock plunges to its new price target of $1.30 per share. In light of this warning, and my own long-held reservations about Plug Power stock, I'm inclined to agree with that assessment. ","

Big-box retailers have come under pressure in recent years from a mix of forces, including e-commerce, fast fashion, and declining mall traffic. As a result, many traditional retailers have cut back on store growth, or even closed stores. Still, there are plenty of good dividend plays available in the sector. While the highest yields may be found among department store chains and struggling businesses like Macy's, Kohl's, and Barnes & Noble, dividend investors are better sacrificing some yield for companies that can still consistently grow profits. Below are five worth considering. Image source: Getty Images. In many ways, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is the archetypical big-box retailer. The company's supercenters average around 190,000 square feet, and the chain has become the world's biggest retailer due to its combination of low prices and breadth of merchandise, which includes groceries, apparel, hardware, electronics, and other categories. Like its peers, Wal-Mart has faced increasing competition from Amazon.com, which has forced it to retrench by investing in cleaning up stores, increasing wages, and expanding its e-commerce presence by opening grocery pick-up sites and acquiring Jet.com. As a result, comparable sales have improved for 10 quarters in a row, and management expects profit growth to return next year. Wal-Mart is a Dividend Aristocrat, with more than 25 consecutive years of dividend hikes, and offers a 2.7% dividend yield at the current stock price. And with a payout ratio -- the percentage of income that goes to dividends -- of less than 50%, the company still has plenty of room to raise its quarterly payouts. With a dividend yield of just 1.2%, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) stock may not be at the top of very many dividend lists, but you can't trust the headline number in this case. In addition to a quarterly dividend that it's steadily increased by 10% or more every year since 2004, the warehouse retailer has also paid out a special dividend three times since 2012. In fact, Costco announced a $7 one-time special dividend in late April. Though the record date has already passed, investors should factor the likelihood of another special payout in a few years into their decision, as Costco also paid a $7 one-time dividend in 2012 and a $5 one in 2015. This year, the $7 payout is good for more than a 4% yield. Costco's core business remains strong. The company has delivered consistent same-store sales growth and has been able to open new stores, as its membership model offers it some protection from the turmoil rocking the rest of the retail sector. Costco's payout ratio is also less than 40%, so investors should continue to expect robust dividend increases. Like Wal-Mart, Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is a Dividend Aristocrat, having raised its quarterly payout for 54 years in a row. In recent years, the company has ridden the housing recovery wave -- its stock has tripled over the last five years amid rising comparable sales and profits. Lowe's has been able to raise its dividend aggressively during that time and the quarterly payout has more than doubled in the last four years. Today, Lowe's stock offers a modest 1.6% yield, but the strong recent growth is a promising sign for investors. While the housing recovery won't last forever, millennials reportedly tend to spend more money on home improvements than their parents, and the home improvement retail sector has shown itself to be Amazon-proof, as delivering large and heavy building materials through e-commerce is not feasible. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) finds itself on the top of the big-box dividend list for many of the same reasons as Lowe's. Home Depot's stock has also tripled over the last five years on the strength of the housing recovery. The home improvement retailer has chosen a different strategy from Lowe's, as it's resisted opening new stores and instead invested in e-commerce and in-store improvements, as well as returning capital to shareholders. Home Depot stock now offers a dividend yield of 2.3%, and it has more than doubled the payout over the last four years. Earlier this year, the company lifted its dividend 29% to $0.89 a quarter. With management's commitment to returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, investors should expect more aggressive dividend hikes, especially as the company benefits from the same trends as Lowe's. While it may not technically be a big-box chain, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and Home Goods, is subject to the same forces as the companies above. But off-price retail has proven to be a rare brick-and-mortar winner in the apparel sector, and TJX shares have thrived. The stock has doubled over the last five years, and the company has become a reliable dividend payer over that period. It now offers a 1.6% yield, and its dividend has more than tripled in the last year. Earlier this year, the company lifted its dividend 20%, and with a payout ratio of less than 30%, TJX is likely to continue raising its dividend aggressively. Add in a store expansion plan and consistently rising comparable sales and profits and you've got a solid dividend stock for years to come. ","
      
    The 5 Best Dividend Stocks In Big-Box Retailer Industry -- The Motley Fool

  "
Todd Campbell,05182017,Fool,05112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett's stock-picking prowess is envy-inspiring, but his recent comments to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) investors suggest to me that Main Street investors ought to press the pause button before buying shares in IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and individual airline stocks, such as United Continental (NYSE:UAL). IBM has been pushing hard into next-generation, cloud-based solutions, but despite fast growth in these strategic segments, the company's legacy businesses continue to falter, and that's weighing down sales and profit. IMAGE SOURCE: MOTLEY FOOL Warren Buffett has been one of IBM's biggest supporters, but last weekend, he admitted he's cut his massive stake in IBM shares by one-third. He remains one of IBM's biggest shareholders (Berkshire Hathaway owned about  81 million shares exiting the first quarter), but in the past, when he starts selling, he continues selling until he doesn't own any more shares (exhibit A: Wal-Mart). In explaining his decision to sell a big chunk of his IBM shares, he explained that once shares hit $180, he felt they were valued at levels that made sense to sell, not buy. He also acknowledged on CNBC last week that IBM has ""run into some very tough competition."" IBMs shares have fallen to about $151, and when Buffett was asked if he's selling more shares at these prices, he replied, ""I don't think we will be selling."" The word ""think"" leads me to believe he's not against the idea, and it suggests to me that if shares climb, he could sell more of his position. Since he's still sitting on over 50 million shares, the risk that he'll sell on a rally makes buying IBM less attractive to me. Buffett's made a lot of money buying Apple, but his recent comments about the company's valuation suggest he's sitting on his current position, not buying more shares. He first bought Apple stock after weak iPhone sales caused shares to drop in 2015. At those post-drop prices, Buffett said last week that Apple ""didn't have to do a lot better in the future than they were doing at the current time"" to justify the price he was paying. Today, that may not be the case anymore. Buffett probably isn't going to be selling his Apple shares anytime soon, but he was noncommittal when he was asked last week if he's still a buyer. Instead, he hinted that buying Apple at today's prices is difficult, because, in his words, ""I'm cheap ... and there's always an anchoring problem with buying stocks. We used to buy 'em, at X, and actually it's harder to buy 'em at higher prices."" Apple's shares are up 68% since last April, so it's understandable that Buffett might be struggling to justify paying more to buy Apple shares today. After all, he owns a ton of shares already. According to filings, he's got $19 billion riding on the company. Overall, while Apple is a Motley Fool recommendation, his comments suggest to me that if you're long Apple already, the best bet is to stay put. If you haven't bought it yet, perhaps waiting until valuation gets Buffett-worthy is wise. Buffett surprised everyone when he became a big investor in America's biggest airlines, including United Continental, last year. His buying was arguably out of character, given that he's joked in the past that a surefire way to become a millionaire is to start out as a billionaire and then invest in an airline. Perhaps that's why he decided to buy a slate of airline stocks, rather than concentrate his risk in just one of them. After all, he describes his past investment in U.S. Air, an airline that went broke twice, as a ""really dumb investment."" His interest in airline stocks nowadays isn't a mystery. Bankruptcies and mergers have removed excess capacity and boosted load factors, improving pricing power, and undeniably, that's helping airlines deliver greater growth. However, airlines still face inherent risks that make picking individual airline stocks hard, and it isn't easy for individual investors to diversify across the industry the way Buffett did. Furthermore, I don't think airlines will be a long-term investment for Berkshire Hathaway. Instead, I think it's more of an opportunistic investment that's similar to how Buffett has invested in oil stocks in the past. Despite its changes, the airline industry remains fiercely competitive, and price transparency removes a lot of an airline operator's ability to price seats at a premium to its competitors. The industry also faces risks associated with payroll costs and volatile jet-fuel prices. Furthermore, innovation is difficult, because the minute one airline does something right, it's bound to be copied quickly. In short, while airlines enjoy tailwinds because of a strong economy, there's no shortage of things that could go wrong and ultimately make these stocks less attractive to Buffett. If I'm right, then Berkshire Hathaway could as easily become a seller of these stocks in the future as it was a buyer, and Buffett will have sold his position long before you get a chance.

    Warren Buffett Stocks You Shouldn't Be Buying Right Now -- The Motley Fool

Keith Speights,05182017,Fool,05112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The digital health industry includes many Silicon Valley start-ups specializing in biomedical and medical solutions, mobile health, and virtual care. Some of the best and most promising companies, like Proteus Digital Health, aren't yet publicly traded, but these three stocks could be especially promising investing options. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Why do Wall Street analysts have such great expectations for Castlight Health (NYSE:CSLT), Evolent Health (NYSE:EVH), and Tabula Rasa Healthcare (NASDAQ:TRHC)? Here's why these three digital health companies appear to be poised for sizzling growth over the next few years. Image source: Getty Images. Castlight provides a health benefits platform that helps employees make better health decisions, and enables employers to communicate and measure their benefit programs. The company combines big data analytics, software and services delivery models, and consumer-oriented web and mobile products with the goal of reducing waste and inefficiencies in employers' healthcare spending. Although Castlight isn't yet profitable, its revenue and gross profit have grown quickly after its initial public offering (IPO) in 2014. Castlight is on track to be breakeven on a cash flow basis by the end of 2018. That projection includes the impact of the company's acquisition earlier this year of Jiff, which markets an enterprise benefits platform that allows employees to choose from over 50 pre-integrated services. Castlight's growth strategy relies on being able to improve several key problems that current result in poor health decisions and over-spending for healthcare. Its research has found that 73% of employees don't fully understand their health benefits, and that employees can sometimes pay up to 10 times more than other employees for the same service. The company has already attracted more than 240 employers as customers, including Walmart. Evolent Health completed its IPO in 2015 but was founded in 2011. The company is a pioneer in using digital health technologies to enable health systems to succeed in value-based payment models. Evolent's products include technology platforms for managing care workflows, patient engagement, population health, and financials. The company's adjusted revenue has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 138% over the last five years. Evolent made several strategic acquisitions last year that should drive revenue even higher. The largest of these acquisitions was the purchase in October 2016 of Valence Health, which provides value-based administration, population health, and advisory services. Evolent's bottom line is improving as the company grows revenue. That growth should continue thanks to a continued transformation of the nation's healthcare system from a fee-for-service model to an outcomes-based, value-based payment model. Tabula Rasa Healthcare is a healthcare technology company focused on decreasing medication-related risk, reducing adverse drug events, enhancing compliance and quality of care, and improving medication outcomes. The company was founded in 2011 and completed its IPO in October 2016. Like Castlight and Evolent, Tabula Rasa isn't profitable, but it is on the right track. Its revenue grew 94% from 2014 to 2016. The company's adjusted EBITDA soared 359% during the same period. By the end of 2016, Tabula Rasa claimed 133 customers focused on populations with complex healthcare needs and extensive medication requirements. These customers include healthcare organizations, Medicare managed care plans, self-insured employers, and post-acute care providers. Tabula Rasa Healthcare's growth strategy consists of three core initiatives. The company intends to attract new customers in its current largest market, Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). PACE is a Medicare/Medicaid program that provides medical and social services to elderly individuals. Tabula Rasa is also looking for strategic acquisitions that would allow it to enter new markets, and it is continuing to develop new technologies and services. ","

                                   , in either direction, after Wal-Mart reports its first-quarter results early Thursday. Goldman analyst Katherine Fogertey believes that expected move is too small, she said, considering the stock’s post-earnings trading history and the current retail environment. Read more: Here are some of the retailers most at risk of default On the day of the past eight quarterly reports, Wal-Mart’s stock has moved with a range of plus or minus 2% to plus or minus 10%, Fogertey said, while the average move during that time was 4%, according to FactSet data. “We believe option investors are overly complacent on [Wal-Mart’s stock] ahead of earnings and recommend investors position with straddles to profit if shares trade up or down more than the low level of implied move on earnings currently priced into options,” Fogertey wrote in a note to clients. A straddle is a pure volatility play, which involves the simultaneous buying of bullish and bearish options with the same strike price set at current levels. Buyers of Wal-Mart straddles, which expire Friday, would begin making money if the stock moves up more than 3%, or falls more than 3%. Fogertey said that while a “bull case” is emerging for the shares, the Goldman analyst covering Wal-Mart, Matt Fassler, doesn’t believe this is a true “breakout” story, according to Fogertey. Although the company’s move to two-day free shipping for orders over $35 likely helped Wal-Mart grow online market share, Fassler cautioned investors that the retail giant’s online efforts are small relative to the rest of its business, and may come at a cost to margins. “[Fassler] does not believe investors will welcome continued headwinds from online investments,” Fogertey wrote.

Don’t miss: How Amazon conquered books, electronics and the cloud Now the same trend is playing out in clothing and accessories, with online sales nearing the 20% threshold, said Smith. But the 20% milestone is proving more and more challenging to reach — nowhere more so than in the food and grocery market. What 20% means for Amazon’s foray into fashion The consumer transition to Amazon for clothing is happening fast, according to an April 28 report by Morgan Stanley. Amazon is the second largest U.S. apparel retailer, behind only Wal-Mart, with Amazon taking share from department stores and Target as it rises in prominence. Nearly half of 1,000 adults surveyed in Morgan Stanley’s latest Alphawise survey (46%) reported having bought clothing from Amazon in the past year. About the same percentage (47%) said they expected to buy more clothes from Amazon and fewer clothes from other retailers in the next 12 months. See also: Amazon’s stock price target raised above $1,000 by yet another analyst Online retailers have overcome much of the resistance to clothing sales with perks like free shipping and the ability to use your home as a fitting room, rather than actually having to trek to a store — and Amazon has capitalized on those benefits over the years through its Prime program. Cowen & Co. estimates Prime membership at about 50 million as of the fourth quarter of 2016. Traditional retailers, meanwhile, are struggling to win the business of young shoppers who say they’d rather spend money doing things than buying things, and remain disenchanted with the experience of shopping in physical stores. As a result, retailers that expanded their businesses by building more stores are now scaling back. More than 3,500 closures have been announced by department stores including Macy’s Inc.

                                   , are gearing up to fight Amazon for market share, with both companies putting billions of dollars behind the effort. Wal-Mart invested on the price side of the equation. The company made a $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com and, more recently, scooped up a number of niche fashion sites, including ModCloth and Moosejaw. The company is also said to be in talks to purchase men’s-wear retailer Bonobos. Also: Wal-Mart is beating the pants off Amazon in apparel, and it’s fighting to keep it that way Plus: Wal-Mart to offer discounts for online orders collected at stores Target, meanwhile, keeps adding to its list of private labels, with exclusivity central to its $7 billion overhaul strategy, along with store remodels and a competitive-pricing push. Read: Target is adding stores, but analysts say it should be cutting locations instead Amazon‘s head start, though, could make it all but impossible to dislodge. “Amazon is the main beneficiary of e-commerce growth,” Smith said. KeyBanc Capital Markets estimates that Amazon already has at least 14 private-label brands. “We think that apparel may serve as one of the single biggest incremental growth opportunities in Amazon’s retail business,” KeyBanc analysts including Managing Director Edward Yruma wrote in a March note. Amazon’s private-label goods range from men’s dress shirts to women’s underwear. “These categories lend themselves to repeat purchases, have fewer national wholesale brand competitors, and can leverage Amazon’s data advantage,” the note said. Also:  The retail sector is shedding jobs like it’s a recession Amazon declined to comment on its fashion strategy. Apparel is more complex than the media or electronics categories that Amazon tackled early on, so the company is going after items that are “highly commoditized,” like socks and shoes, said Smith. But even though online sales of clothing are nearing the 20% mark, Amazon still faces many challenges in the category. Recent research by Cowen & Co. found that 76% of consumers polled preferred to go to a store for clothes, shoes and accessories. “While longer term, we anticipate consumer preferences will likely continue to shift online, we believe traditional stores will continue to play an integral role in the retail experience,” they said. Still, with opinion shifting about Amazon’s style credibility, shopping habits are following suit. The number of people saying that style is not an Amazon attribute is shrinking. “We think this speaks to how Amazon’s fashion efforts are having an impact on consumer behavior and their willingness to shop for fashion on the site, which over time could lead to even faster apparel growth,” said the Morgan Stanley report. See: Amazon’s most sought-after clothing brands include Nike, Adidas and Under Armour Companies that aren’t being steamrolled are doing something that Amazon can’t. Brands like Everlane and Warby Parker, for example, offer something unique — and that breeds loyalty. Everlane promises “radical transparency,” explaining why items are priced as they are, with a breakdown of such line items as material and labor costs. Eyeglasses purveyor Warby Parker will ship five frames to customers for free to try at home. And there are some experiences that can’t be replicated online. For example, the success of off-price retailers like T.J. Maxx, a TJX Cos.

                                  can be attributed to what experts call the “treasure hunt” nature of shopping in those stores, analysts say. “Most pockets of retail success today have some sort of protective moat around their business that helps them fend off Amazon,” said Jared Wiesel, partner at Revenue Analytics. “Take home improvement. While I can certainly buy a power drill online, if I am starting a kitchen remodel, Amazon is unlikely to reap any of my spend.” Fewer and fewer categories nowadays have the cushion that home improvement enjoys. Food fight If changing consumer behavior is key to getting people to buy goods online, there’s a long way to go before online grocery shopping goes mainstream, or reaches the 20% threshold that favors Amazon’s prospects. Online sales account for less than 1% of the $1 trillion grocery market in the U.S., one of the lowest online market shares in all of retail, according to a Moody’s note in March. The credit-rating agency doesn’t expect this online market to grow to more than a 2% or 3% share over the next five years. The company’s standard playbook may not be as effective in the food space, analysts say. Read:  Bottled water is now more popular than soda — why you should avoid both “We think most of the growth in online grocery sales will be limited to certain densely populated metropolitan areas, where income levels are more conducive to higher-priced online grocery purchases,” the Moody’s report said. Building a grocery business is going to require major investments in distribution centers, delivery trucks that can bring perishables to customer doorsteps, and other logistical developments that will hamper profits. Curbside pickup is one online model that Moody’s analysts believe can lead to online grocery success. Wal-Mart has planted its flag in the online food and consumer-goods area with its Jet purchase and with curbside pickup, which the company continues to expand. With this service, shoppers pull up to a store, but don’t even need to get out of their cars as a Wal-Mart staffer loads groceries into the vehicle. Recently, Amazon announced the launch of AmazonFresh Pickup, which remains in beta at just two Seattle locations. “It’s going to be a slower disruption than [in] consumer electronics and media,” L2’s Smith said. “But I wouldn’t bet against Amazon’s efforts to disrupt groceries.” Amazon shares have gained nearly 27% in 2017, while the S&P 500

Investors are wary of the turnaround effort, Summers wrote, and Macquarie expects greater transparency and more detailed explanations from the retailer. “While we have confidence the moves are directionally correct, there is no certainty intended outcomes are achieved,” the note said. “Moreover, sustained concerns over ‘earnings power’ will persist as investments are absorbed and will only begin to mitigate as same-store sales improve (potentially turning positive in fourth quarter 2017/first quarter 2018).” Macquarie rates Target share outperform with a $77 price target.

Mark Hulbert,05182017,MarketWatch,05112017,"Published: May 16, 2017 4:48 p.m. ET A look at whether low-volatility stocks will continue to live up to their impressive past By CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — Some skeptics recently have argued that low-volatility stocks are forming a bubble that’s about to pop — and financial advisers therefore need to stop recommending them to their clients. And since a lot is riding on this disagreement, it’s important to get to the bottom of it. Low-volatility stocks are those that have exhibited low levels of historical price volatility. Though there is no one way in which analysts define volatility, the definition used by the late Robert Haugen — the finance professor who devoted much of his three-decade academic career to documenting the impressive performance of such stocks — is the standard deviation of monthly returns over the trailing two years. Such stocks exhibit two characteristics that make them valuable to investors. The first: They tend to continue being low volatility and less risky than the overall market. In fact, one of the strongest patterns statisticians have documented in the stock market is the high correlation between a ranking of stocks based on their volatility in one period and a ranking based on their volatility in a subsequent period. This means that investors can reliably expect that a portfolio of stocks with low past volatility will continue to exhibit low volatility. The second notable characteristic of low-volatility stocks is even more extraordinary: In the past they on average performed every bit as well as the market as a whole, if not better, and significantly better than the highest-volatility stocks. Professor Haugen was met with considerable skepticism when he first reported this result, since it flew directly in the face of what Finance 101 taught us about the relationship between risk and return. But this pattern was the consistent finding of a number of subsequent studies, both of U.S. stocks but also of stocks around the world. Taking these two characteristics together, it meant that you could equal the market, if not beat it, while incurring substantially below-market risk. That’s a winning combination. No wonder that financial planners have been urging low-volatility stocks to their risk-averse clients. Imagine such an investor who has previously concluded he should allocate only 50% of his portfolio to the broad stock market. For ease of illustration, assume that this client has allocated the other 50% of his portfolio to a money-market fund. To appreciate what low-volatility stocks can do for this investor, consider the iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA ETF

                                   , which is the largest of the several ETFs that invest in such stocks in the U.S. Its beta is 0.74, according to MSCI, which means that it historically has fallen 26% less than the S&P 500 during bear markets. Yet since the index’s inception in 1988, it has produced a 10% annualized return, versus 9.74% for the S&P 500. Assuming the future is like the past, that client could instead invest 68% of his portfolio in the USMV and incur no additional risk. But his return would be dramatically better, since 18% of his portfolio that was otherwise earning a money market rate would now be earning an expected rate of 10.0% annualized. But will the future continue to be like the past? That is the $64,000 question, since no strategy works forever in the wake of ever-increasing popularity. One adviser who believes we’ve reached that point is Richard Moroney, editor of Dow Theory Forecasts. Earlier this month, he wrote to clients that low-volatility stocks are in a bubble, since their average P/E ratios currently are much higher than in the past. For an additional perspective, I checked in with Nardin Baker, who co-authored with Professor Haugen many of the seminal research studies into the performance of low-volatility stocks. Baker currently is Chief Strategist at South Street Investment Advisors in Boston; he previously was a global equity manager at Guggenheim Partners. Mr. Baker acknowledged in an interview that low-volatility stocks today are trading at higher valuations than they often have in the past. But, Mr. Baker quickly added, that doesn’t mean the low-volatility approach isn’t still compelling. That’s for two reasons. The first: Low volatility isn’t merely a proxy for low P/E. If that were the case, then it would be more alarming that low-volatility stocks are now trading for higher P/E ratios. But the low-volatility approach is more than that. To be sure, there have been times in the past when the lowest-volatility stocks also sported some of the lowest P/Es. This was the case in the early aughts, for example, when value stocks dominated the low-volatility universe. But in recent years the low-volatility universe has drawn fairly evenly from both the value- and growth-stock camps, and as a result such stocks’ average P/E has risen. But that’s no reason to conclude that the low-volatility approach has stopped working. The second reason that Mr. Baker argues the low-volatility approach remains compelling: Such stocks would have to trade at much higher valuations before it would be rational to avoid them. Imagine, for purposes of illustration, that low-volatility stocks in the future lag the S&P 500 by a percentage point per year. That would represent a change, of course, since historically such stocks have equaled or beaten the broad market. But notice that they would still handily beat the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis: They will forfeit 10% of the market’s return while immunizing followers from 26% of the risk. That means you still will be able to improve your long-term returns, without any additional risk, by increasing your allocation to low-volatility stocks. How much more expensive would low-volatility stocks have to become before they would no longer hold out the potential of beating the broad market on a risk-adjusted basis? Mr. Baker estimates that their average P/E ratios would have to be 30% higher than the S&P 500’s before this would be the case. Since they currently are just 5% higher, Mr. Baker concludes that low-volatility stocks still have a lot to offer. To be sure, none of this discussion should be taken to mean that P/E ratios don’t also matter. Between two low-volatility stocks between which you are otherwise indifferent, the one with the lower P/E would certainly seem the better alternative. By the same token, however, you shouldn’t automatically avoid a low-volatility stock with a higher P/E ratio just because of that higher ratio. The easiest way to invest in low-volatility stocks is via ETFs such as the USMV. The second-largest such ETF that invests in U.S. equities is the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio ETF

,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday reported higher-than-expected quarterly sales at established U.S. stores, as investments to bring more customers into the discount retailer paid off and a bigger push into e-commerce boosted online purchases, sending its shares flirting near a 52-week high. Wal-Mart and analysts said the company is benefiting from a $2.7 billion investment to increase entry-level wages and enhance the training of its workforce, which has led to better stocked shelves and cleaner stores. It said store visits rose 1.5 percent, the tenth consecutive quarterly increase. Earlier in the day, shares of Wal-Mart rose to $77.40 - a 52-week high. They were trading at $77 in mid-day. Wal-Mart’s efforts to close the gap with rival Amazon.com has started gaining momentum even as other retailers like department store chains struggle. Online sales for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer rose 63 percent in the first quarter, which was higher than 29 percent growth in the fourth quarter and 20 percent in the third quarter. Online sales added 0.8 percentage points to the first quarter comparable sales gain. Growth in the business has been picking up after Wal-Mart said in October it would slow down new store openings to focus on expanding its e-commerce business. U.S. e-commerce chief Marc Lore told reporters in a call that online sales growth was boosted by offering free two-day shipping without membership fees, and higher repeat orders. “We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we’re capable of,” said Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon. The company said most of the internet sales growth was from existing online operations rather than from acquisitions. Wal-Mart, which acquired Jet.com in 2016, this year alone has snatched up online retail startups Shoebuy, Moosejaw and Modcloth, and is currently in talks with small online clothing retailer Bonobos. “Wal-Mart’s long string of investments in labor and e-commerce, including acquisitions, are enabling modest market share gains,” John Zolidis, director equity research with the Buckingham Research Group said. Wal-Mart’s performance, along with rival Target’s results on Wednesday, bucked a string of weak results from retailers Macy’s Inc and J.C. Penney. Target reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings and sales. Wal-Mart said sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.4 percent, excluding fuel price fluctuations, and was the 11th consecutive quarterly increase. Analysts were expecting a 1.3 percent increase, according to Consensus Metrix. Wal-Mart is aggressively investing in making prices more competitive compared to rivals. It has asked vendors to offer grocery prices that are 15 percent lower than competitors. Wal-Mart’s U.S. Chief Executive Greg Foran said comparable sales in food and grocery improved during the quarter on lower food deflation, without sharing details. Grocery accounts for nearly 53 percent of overall revenue for the retailer. “Wal-Mart’s commitment to value pricing is driving traffic and growth in grocery and aggressive online strides are impacting comparable sales,” Cowen & Co’s senior research analyst Oliver Chen said in a note. Earnings per share was $1 for the quarter ended on April 30, exceeding the analysts’ average estimate of 96 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Consolidated net income fell to $3.04 billion from $3.08 billion due to a higher tax rate. Quarterly revenue rose 1.4 percent to $117.5 billion, slightly lower than analysts expectations of $117.7 billion due to a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of overseas sales. Revenue grew 2.8 percent on a currency neutral basis. For the second quarter, Wal-Mart expects an increase of 1.5 percent to 2 percent in U.S. same-store sales.

Donna Fuscaldo,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Fidget spinners, the colorful toys that keep children’s active hands busy and sell for anywhere from $2.50 to $25, are a huge hit, and major retailers, including Wal-Mart (WMT) and Toys R Us, are struggling to keep up with the demand. While the toy has been all the rage for several months now, the demand has not abated with Wal-Mart resorting to air freight to get the spinners directly out of Chinese plants and into the stores at a faster clip. Michelle Malashock, a spokesperson for the firm, told the Financial Times it’s the “biggest craze” the retailer has seen in the past five years. Meanwhile, Toys R Us, which is owned by Bain Capital Partners LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR) and Vornado Realty Trust (VNO), was late to the party and their first shipments hit shelves in the first week of May, according to a Chicago Tribune report. The company is also airfreighting spinners to stores. ""They're pretty much evaporating the minute they get on shelves,"" said Richard Barry, executive vice president and chief merchandising officer, to the newspaper. The company will roll out DC Comics and Marvel spinners alongside light up, metallic and glow in the dark ones, the report said. The toy retailer hopes to turn what could easily be a short lived fad into something kids want to collect. (See more: Discount Retailers Whip Out Surprise Earnings) What makes fidget spinners so interesting is that the trend wasn’t created by a huge toy manufacturer but was born on the Internet. According to the Financial Times, Catherine Hettinger, an engineer, made the first version of the gadget in 1997 but let her patent expire in 2005.  More recently new versions of it started showing up on Alphabet’s (GOOG) YouTube and Facebook's (FB) Instagram. That spawned an industry for individuals and small toy companies to start shipping the devices from China and into the hands of consumers in the U.S. and elsewhere. Currently fidget spinners are everywhere from toy stores to gas stations. “It’s the wild west,” said Josh Loerzel, vice president of marketing at Zing, a toy manufacturer that ships to Wal-mart and Toys R Us in an interview with the Financial Times. “The biggest toy I’ve seen in at least 10 years, and it’s been a total free-for-all. It’s not a big-bucks driven, premeditated thing. It blew up the opposite way.” The executive noted Zing is gearing up to ship between 4 million and 5 million of the toy in 2017 alone. (See also: The Hottest Toy This Season: The Hatchimal) It’s not surprising that everyone in the toy industry would be going after the latest craze. For starters, there are no patents, which mean no costly licensing fees. There's also huge margins on the product for merchants and retailers when it is made in China. It also shows how the toy industry is no longer just the domain of the big manufacturers. For Toys R Us, its strategy to turn fidget spinners into collectibles might work out. After all, collectible toys are big business for retailers with NPD Group, the market research firm, finding sales of the category increased 33% in 2016, accounting for $1.8 billion or 9% of the toy industry sales. In the Chicago Tribune story, the company acknowledged that kids' tastes can be fickle but that it’s bullish on the whole trend of creating gadgets that keep kids’ fingers and hands busy. Richard Barry, Toys R Us executive vice president and chief merchandising officer said the retailer is seeing a sales increase of other toys like that, including Rubik’s Cubes and yo-yos.

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs For brick-and-mortar retailers to survive and thrive in the age of giant online merchant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), they must develop differentiated products and services. Among those that have what it takes are Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), The Home Depot Inc. (HD), Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY), Nordstrom Inc. (JWN) and Lowe's Cos. (LOW), according to Barron's. The task is daunting, since online retail sales are growing at a 15% annual clip, and, as of April, account for 22% of all general merchandise purchases excluding food, gasoline, autos and restaurants, per U.S. Bureau of Census data cited by Barron's. In turn, an estimated 40% of these online sales are garnered by Amazon, Barron's adds. While online merchants offer convenience, traditional in-person shopping has its own advantages. Touching and scrutinizing goods are important elements of many buying decisions. Moreover, many people still enjoy traditional shopping for its own sake. Meanwhile, as Barron's points out, the late 1990s were rife with hasty predictions that big-box stores such as Wal-Mart soon would wipe away all competition, much as today some observers are too quick to conclude that virtually all retail is headed online. As for Wal-Mart, it has responded to the dual challenges from online sellers like Amazon and membership-only, bulk-selling warehouse club stores like Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) by acquiring Jet.com. Barron's attributes much of Wal-Mart's 63% rise in digital sales during the latest quarter to this move, while Costco.com registered only 12% growth. Through its Sam's Club warehouse stores, Wal-Mart already has a brick-and-mortar sales channel competing with Costco. That's a big advantage for home improvement retailers Lowe's and Home Depot. Much of what they sell is not conveniently sized for shipping, and their customer base includes professional contractors who prefer to buy in-store, to be sure about exactly what they're getting. Consumers faced with the sudden failure of a key home appliance, or contractors short of supplies in the midst of a job, are unlikely to wait for a shipment, even when feasible. Additionally, on Thursday, the National Association of Realtors forecasted that this year sales of existing homes will be at their highest level in 10 years, Barron's reports, another positive indicator for these building supply and home improvement retailers. (For more, see also: What's Driving the Boom in Home Building Stocks.) In a recent report, Credit Suisse hailed Nordstrom as ""best in breed"" among department stores. Brad Liff, managing director at investment research firm Bespoke Investment Group, LLC, concurs, telling Barron's that Nordstrom is the best-situated and most likely to succeed among its peers. Bespoke’s “Death By Amazon” index was created in 2014 as a way to track the performance of the companies most affected by the rise of Amazon.com. Among the things that set Nordstrom apart, according to Barron's: top-notch customer service, an excellent in-store experience and exclusive products for fashion-focused customers. Customer service at Nordstrom, Barron's adds, includes placing online orders for customers who can't find what they want in-store. For those who write off department stores as an outdated concept, Barron's cites Nordstrom as a prime counter-example. (For more, see also: Why These 5 Consumer Stocks Will Outperform.) Electronics retailer Best Buy was left for dead by many observers just a few years ago. However, with the demise of Circuit City, it pretty much has the field of electronics-only stores all to itself, TheStreet noted last year, making it the only destination for many people who want to touch and feel new gadgets before buying. Meanwhile, by aggressively matching the prices offered by Amazon and big-box retailers, Best Buy has increased the odds that consumers who look there will buy there, Barron's says. Moreover, its Geek Squad tech support team allows Best Buy to compete on service. TheStreet mentions that Best Buy also is a big seller of large appliances, positioning it to profit from a housing recovery. As proof positive that traditional brick-and-mortar stores are not headed for complete extinction anytime soon, Amazon already has opened six physical bookstores in the U.S., with six more currently planned, according to the company's website. That's quite an ironic twist, given that Amazon, which started as an online book seller, is responsible for the demise of numerous physical bookstores, both independents and chains such Borders, while venerable bookseller Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS) continues to strain under the competition. Amazon also is rolling out other physical stores, in other merchandise categories, both in the U.S. and abroad, as reported by The New York Times, and by Fortune. While the press is filled with reports of physical retailers retreating to online-only sales, even some smaller companies are bucking the trend. One such example is MM.LaFleur, a New York-based seller of business attire for women. Founded in 2011 by Sarah LaFleur, who previously worked in private equity, the company is rolling out physical stores after operating strictly online, a business model that seemed to fit its target market of time-constrained professionals, the Washington Post reports.

Adam Hayes,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Last month, online giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN​) inked a deal with Plug Power, Inc. (PLUG​) marking a major investment in the struggling alternative power company and sending its shares up over 70% just after the news was announced. The deal allows for the fuel cell company to grant Amazon warrants to buy up to 55.3 million shares, or around one quarter of the company's outstanding shares, which could be worth up to $600 million according to some analysts. In addition, Amazon committed to purchase up to $70 million of Plug Power fuel cell products for use in its enormous warehouses and distribution centers. What does an online retailer and cloud-computing technology company want with a struggling alternative energy producer? The answer may lie in its physical distribution centers, or it may lie elsewhere. We will outline Amazon's motivations for the deal here. (For more, see: Plug Power Skyrockets on News of Amazon Interest.) When Amazon and Plug Power announced this deal in April, many analysts' first thought was to Amazon's growing network of expansive warehouses and distribution centers. Amazon has invested heavily in its so-called fulfillment centers, allowing Amazon Prime members to receive guaranteed two-day shipping on the house—a move meant to drive orders and keep people buying online rather than from the convenience of a brick-and-mortar store like Walmart Stores Inc. (WMT​) or Target Corp (TGT). Amazon’s fulfillment centers have already been outfitted with custom built robots—tens of thousands of them which pick, sort and pack across global facilities with an aggregate square footage of more than than 700 football stadiums. Their use has reduced Amazon's operating expenses by some 20% since its CEO Jeff Bezos spent $775 million in 2012 to acquire robotics manufacturer Kiva for this express purpose. (For more, see also: Amazon: 10 Secrets You Didn't Know.) At Amazon's fulfillment centers, robots and human beings work side by side in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. Like any other warehouse, forklifts are a key piece of equipment used to stock and move inventory. It is this often overlooked tool that Plug Power can most easily increase the efficiency of Amazon's operations. According to a report by Green Tech Media, ""Amazon’s fuel-cell play is an extension of the flanking strategy it used to great effect with Amazon Web Service (AWS), which allowed the company to insert itself into the value chains of countless businesses it would never otherwise supply."" In doing so, Green Tech points out three salient reasons why fuel cell based forklifts make sense for the company: 1. Reclaimed space: At a distribution center, battery recharging stations and infrastructure generally consume around 5% to 10% of the overall floor space, much of which can be re-purposed for more profitable uses such as inventory by storage by switching to hydrogen fuel cell power. In aggregate this means not needing as many facilities as more floor space is reclaimed in existing centers. 2. Faster forklifts: traditional electric batteries’ voltage drops as they discharge, slowing forklifts over time and causing a productivity decline in the process. Plug Power on its website estimates that battery forklifts’ speed drops an average 14% in the second half of an eight-hour shift. Problems are made worse in the case of refrigerated warehouses, where electric batteries may only last half as long. In contrast, fuel-cell forklifts can achieve a steady “pick rate,” so inventory can be turned over more quickly. 3. Leaner operations: Whereas separate personnel are needed to oversee lead-acid battery recharging and swapping, forklift drivers can refuel the hydrogen themselves, saving labor costs. (For more, see also: Why Is Amazon Interested in Plug Power?) While that case makes sense for Amazon's own use, it doesn't necessarily explain such a large investment. But Amazon's competitors, and in particular Wal-Mart, already use Plug Power forklifts in their distribution centers and warehouses. This means that Amazon will have a say in how these other companies that are Plug Power customers—many of whom are direct or indirect competitors of Amazon—conduct their inventory operations. Yet, none of these players has ever expressed even the slightest interest in taking a stake in Plug Power. Amazon engaged in a similar strategy when it entered the cloud-computing market, where it has grown to become the largest web hosting and services provider on the planet—by investing in and eventually taking over infrastructure resources that it relies heavily on—but which its competitors do as well. Amazon's investment in Plug Power and its hydrogen fuel cell technology may also have something to do with the company's stated goal of entering the logistics market. Currently, Amazon relies on third-party shippers such as FedEx and UPS to deliver its items. Amazon has announced a number of strategies, including autonomous delivery drones—but also getting into the traditional logistics business, and fuel cells may provide a cheaper and more efficient alternative to gasoline or diesel.

Lauren Thomas,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"Here's what the company reported vs. what the Street was expecting: Wal-Mart's U.S. business is thriving in a challenging environment, as aggressive pricing helped bring more shoppers into stores, while efforts to expand its digital business are paying off in robust growth. The retailer's U.S. comparable sales — an important metric for retail stocks — grew for the 11th consecutive quarter, climbing 1.4 percent compared with a FactSet estimate for 1.3 percent growth. Notably, Wal-Mart was also able to increase traffic to its U.S. stores again, at a time when others are seeing fewer shoppers. The retailer said its comparable sales traffic grew 3 percent, on a two-year stacked basis. Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales rose a whopping 63 percent, compared with 29 percent growth last quarter. Despite making a number of acquisitions, the majority of these sales were organic through Walmart.com, the company said. Shares of Wal-Mart were up 2.7 percent to $77.15 in early trading Thursday. Wal-Mart's total fiscal first-quarter revenue grew 1.4 percent, to $117.54 billion, falling slightly short of a $117.74 billion forecast by analysts. Earnings per share rose 2 percent to $1.00, up from 98 cents a year ago. The profit was higher than a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate for 96 cents a share. ""Inside the company we can see that we're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers, but we can also see plenty of room to improve,"" Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said on Thursday's earnings conference call. The big-box retailer has been making strides to expand and improve its e-commerce platform. The company recently acquired Jet.com, bringing in new talent to help manage its digital operations. Jet.com's founder, Marc Lore, is now the CEO of Wal-Mart's e-commerce division. This comes at a time when Wal-Mart is locked in an online battle with players like Amazon and Target. Wal-Mart recently rolled out free two-day shipping for online orders over $35, prompting Amazon to slash its free-shipping threshold for shoppers who don't have a Prime membership. ""We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we're capable of — so that's what we're focused on,"" McMillon went on. During the first quarter, Wal-Mart's online gross margin values rose 69 percent, management added. ""E-commerce is working [for Wal-Mart],"" Barclays food and staples retail analyst Karen Short told CNBC on Thursday morning. ""And it's not coming at the expense of brick-and-mortar, because you need both to survive."" Despite Amazon wanting to eat everyone's lunch, Wal-Mart stands out from its peers in being able to capture customers online, Short said. After its purchase of Jet.com, smaller acquisitions of sites like ModCloth and Moosejaw are evidence of this, she added. ""Wal-Mart is definitely a winner."" At U.S. stores, the company said its grocery business continued to improve, with food categories delivering the strongest quarterly comparable sales performance in more than three years, due in part to a lack of market deflation in food. ""From our data, Walmart is ... also picking up some customers from mainstream grocers,"" GlobalData Retail managing director Neil Saunders wrote in a note to clients. ""The response to Walmart flexing its price muscles has been good, and we expect further small gains over the rest of this year. A more disciplined focus on low prices is also important as Aldi, and now Lidl, expand into the market."" However, Wal-Mart's heavy discounting, coupled with lower sales of higher-ticket items at the start of the quarter, resulted in a slight decline in average ticket amounts. Meanwhile, all of Wal-Mart's U.S. store formats showed positive comparable sales to start the year, the company said. For example, Wal-Mart's Sam's Club's comparable sales, excluding fuel, rose 1.6 percent, while traffic grew by 1.1 percent. Digital growth at Sam's Club ""Club Pickup"" increased nearly 30 percent, the company reported. With respect to its international locations, sales were $27.1 billion for the first quarter, a decrease of 3.5 percent. Wal-Mart no longer reports an overarching global figure for its e-commerce growth, instead choosing to focus on the U.S. market. Its domestic online performance has been outpacing results overseas, the retailer has said. Seven of Wal-Mart's 11 international markets reported positive comps to start the year, CFO Brett Biggs told analysts and investors on the conference call. ""There is a sense that Walmart is getting to grips with some of the issues, but we believe it will be some time before all parts of international make a solid contribution,"" Saunders said in the note. Wal-Mart said it now expects to earn between $1 and $1.08 per share during the second quarter, excluding a net benefit from the sale of Suburbia, the retailer's apparel format in Mexico. Thomson Reuters analysts had forecast earnings of $1.07 a share for this period. During the same period, U.S. same-store sales, excluding fuel, should grow between 1.5 and 2 percent, the company said. Sam's Club comparable sales are estimated to rise between 1 and 1.5 percent. ""In our view, Walmart's investments in price, its focus on service in stores, and its omnichannel push are all paying dividends,"" Saunders added. ""The delay in tax refunds, which resulted in lower sales of higher ticket merchandise over the early part of the quarter, put a small dent in growth, but not by enough to cause serious concern."" For fiscal 2018, Wal-Mart has said it expects to earn between $4.20 and $4.40 a share. ""Overall, [Wal-Mart's] investments have resulted in positive comparable store sales trends and improving traffic,"" Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan wrote in a recent note to clients. ""Walmart's success, along with broadly weakening brick and mortar shopping trends, has caused competing retailers to respond with their own pricing actions."" On Wednesday, big-box retail rival Target reported earnings, sales and comparable sales that topped Street expectations. Target is in the midst of a multiyear turnaround effort, as it attempts to compete with Wal-Mart's ""Everyday Low Price"" strategy and Amazon's encroaching presence over the industry. ""While [Target] is not trying to directly undercut Walmart on prices, it is trying to use everyday lower prices on daily use items to drive customers into remodeled stores that provide a better experience than Walmart,"" Astrachan said. As of Wednesday's close, shares of Wal-Mart have climbed nearly 19 percent over the past 12 months and are up about 9 percent for the year-to-date period.

Jeff Daniels,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"Wal-Mart Stores is gaining a bigger slice of the $800 billion market and momentum picked up in the recent first quarter, according to a new report. ""Wal-Mart is taking back share from the traditional supermarket at an accelerating rate,"" according to Loop Capital analyst Andrew Wolf, who estimates the retailer now has a 21.5 percent market share in the U.S. traditional grocery industry. In a report this week, Wolf said the world's biggest retailer's domestic grocery same-store sales beat U.S. supermarkets by 2.9 percent in the first quarter, which represented a stronger pace from 1.6 percent outperformance in the fourth quarter of 2016. ""Wal-Mart's last period of sustained outperformance versus the supermarkets was 2009-2010, while from 2013 through Q3'2016, the supermarkets outperformed Wal-Mart at same stores,"" Wolf said. Added the analyst, ""Thus, the last quarter of outperformance appear to mark a potential major inflection point for Wal-Mart after having been a (same-store) share donor since 2013."" Wal-Mart's strong performance in the first quarter was helped in part of lower deflation but also by continued pricing investment by the Arkansas-based company as it seeks to better against Kroger, European-based discounter Aldi and other grocers. In the past month, there have been reports of price drops at Wal-Mart supermarkets in major U.S. markets where Kroger and others compete. ""Kroger has discussed that while certain markets are indeed more competitive, such as those in which Wal-Mart is changing prices, certain other markets are less competitive than normal,"" said Wolf. Wal-Mart didn't respond to a request for comment. Kroger declined comment. Still, Wolf said Kroger still is showing some strength even as it faces more competition from Wal-Mart and others, including Amazon's push into the online grocery market. Kroger has its own online grocery strategy, which includes both delivery through third-party delivery services as well an in-store pickup option. Wal-Mart too is aggressively pushing into the online grocery segment. ""Like Wal-Mart, Kroger is pursuing an e-commerce grocery 'click and collect' model, for which customers order online and pick up their orders at store,"" Wolf said. ""We believe this will be an increasing feature of U.S. grocery shopping going forward.""

Khairiyah Ramthan,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"Wal-Mart reported earnings that beat analyst expectations this week, proving to be a positive note in a challenging retail environment. Other brick and mortar retailers can only hope to achieve similar success if they commit to changing with the times, one analyst said Friday. ""When you talk to brick and mortar retailers, they're really very much stuck in what they used to do. So there isn't much technology being used in the retail scenario,"" Kenny Yeo, senior industry analyst at Frost & Sullivan, told CNBC's ""The Rundown"" on Friday. ""Having a census and data would enable the brick and mortar retailers to understand the customer better so they can give better customer service,"" he added. He said, however, that the only pieces of data retailers really have are from the point of sales system, as well as counters where people are walking in and out of the store. Where the data is lacking, he explained, is where customers go once they enter a store. ""So frankly, I see that the strategy Wal-Mart is taking is really something that consumers want,"" he said. The changing face of retail is mainly due to the rise of e-commerce, and although Wal-Mart's physical stores generated most of its sales, its digital sales increased by 63 percent from the previous year. So as the retail industry veers further towards e-commerce, retailers need to adapt to meet new customer demands. ""Today's consumer is really different. When we go to a store, the first thing we do is pop out a phone and check what competitors are charging for the same item,"" Yeo said. ""Habits are changing so much so that you use both online and offline (avenues) at the same time,"" he added. ""Wal-Mart has an interesting strategy where it's embracing both. That's very interesting and is the way forward,"" he said. According to Yeo, there are three key technological drivers — automation, awareness and immersion — that traditional retailers should focus on. Firstly, automation helps with basic standard tasks, such as stock-taking, which allows for more time for staff to interact with consumers. Awareness allows retailers to use technology such as online trackers to detect both the physical interaction of customers in stores as well as shopping habits on websites. This allows them to understand the consumer's buying behavior. Lastly, immersion gives retailers the power to influence customers' buying habits in store and online by using previously collected information from tracking services. This can happen through the use of apps, location services and even augmented reality. ""They know what we're looking at and what we're clicking on, so that they are able to amend and change the page to optimize the experience,"" he said. The incorporation of technology into bricks and mortar would create a better retail experience for the customer, and ""so that in the end, is what the customer wants- better customer service from both digital and in the store itself,"" Yeo said. ","Here's what brick-and-mortar retailers need to do, according to one analyst"

Lauren Thomas,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"Retail, man. After two weeks chock full of retailers' earnings — largely disappointing Wall Street and missing analysts' expectations — the S&P 500's Retail ETF (XRT) was trading in the slumps Friday afternoon, on pace for its worst week of the year. The index was falling as much as 3.3 percent week-to-date, on pace for its worst week of the year dating back to December 2016 when the XRT lost 4.2 percent over a five-day period. Leading the declines were names like Ascena Retail Group, Foot Locker, American Eagle and Sears. Ascena — the parent of clothing companies such as Ann Taylor and dressbarn — saw its shares plunge more than 30 percent earlier in the week, after it adjusted its second-half outlook to reflect worse-than-expected business conditions. ""The specialty retail sector is in a period of unprecedented secular change that is disruptive to traditional business models, and we believe operating conditions in our sector are likely to remain challenging for the next 12 to 24 months,"" Ascena CEO David Jaffe said. Meanwhile, Foot Locker's same-store sales are falling short of expectations — what seems to be a growing trend across the retail industry. Off-price retailer TJX, which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods stores, was expected to be an upbeat outlier for the week, but even its first-quarter comparable sales couldn't match Street estimates. Jefferies analyst Randal Konik wrote in a note to clients that the miss should mark a ""yellow caution flag,"" with TJX posting numbers that ""seem to be headed down not up."" As shoppers shy away from brick and mortar, store closures and bankruptcies will continue to emerge, Retail Metrics' Ken Perkins wrote in an updated report this week. E-commerce growth is looking solid for some players, but margins remain lower overall, Perkins added. Wal-Mart, for example, posted digital sales growth of 63 percent for the first quarter, hinting that investments in its online platform are paying off. ""This is the most confusing first quarter I have ever seen,"" Sam Poser of Susquehanna told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" during an interview Friday. ""It's one big train wreck."" With Friday's declines, the XRT has fallen about 7 percent for the year, compared to the S&P 500's 6.5 percent gain. The retail EFT is down nearly 5 percent for the month of May. More retail earnings are on tap next week from Lowe's, Tiffany & Co., Abercrombie & Fitch and Best Buy, to name a few. Lowe's report will follow Home Depot's positive comparable sales results, which climbed a whopping 6 percent during the first quarter, blowing past a 4.3 percent estimate compiled by analysts who cover the company. Home improvement retail might be the sector's saving grace after all. As retailers' woes are growing, many of the industry's landlords — real estate investment trusts, or REITs — are being dragged down, too. Simon, Tanger, CBL & Associates, Seritage and Washington Prime are all trading in red territory for the month-to-date period. Some of these REITs' portfolios include locations of embattled department store chains Sears, Kohls and J.C. Penney. News of Payless ShoeSource and teen clothing retailer Rue21 recently filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy has cast a larger shadow over the industry, prompting many investors to fear REITs will have a hard time filling vacant shops, as news of store closures intensifies. ""The mall space has to change and is changing,"" retail investment research firm founder Jane Hali told CNBC in an interview. Mall owners, like GGP and Simon, are looking to restaurants, service-related concepts and grocery stores to bring traffic back to the mall now, Hali said. Watch: Retail earnings roundup ",Ouch!

Annie Pei,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"Stocks recovered on Friday from their biggest selloff of the year, and market watcher Nick Colas has a suggestion for investors who may be anxious about another pullback. Convergex's chief market strategist suggested that instead of running away from the market whenever stocks fall, investors should instead keep buying the dips until a sudden 2 percent drop. In a note released Thursday morning, Colas mentioned that if investors are wondering if it's safe to buy another dip in the market, they only need to look for three key trends. ""[We would have to see] more of the same of what we've seen over the past couple of days that led to [Wednesday's] selloff,"" said Colas this week on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" First, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) needs to remain below 20. The so-called ""fear index"" plunged after Donald Trump's election victory in November, and has since stayed low —even hitting its lowest level in over 20 years earlier in the month. Second, the tech rally needs to continue. The tech sector has been the main driver of the market's stellar run this year so far, and Colas believes that as long as the big tech names like Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet, to name a few, can hold on, the market should be on its way up again. Finally, Colas also believes that as long as consumer stocks continue to outperform, it would be an indication that the market still has momentum to move up. However, Colas also emphasized Thursday political drama could still derail the rally in the long run, with investors beginning to fret whether President Donald Trump will have the political capital necessary to press ahead with his agenda. ""A kind of churning news cycle about Russia, and the FBI, and Trump...begins to take confidence out of the market that we will get tax reform in 2018,"" Colas said. Even with political turmoil out of D.C., there's no question in Colas' mind that until that sudden 2 percent drop happens, buying every dip in the market would be an ideal strategy.

Stephanie Landsman,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"There's an under-the-radar trend which could push stocks further into record territory, and it appears most of Wall Street doesn't even know about it. ""I think inflation will be the big surprise,"" said Joseph Zidle, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors on CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" this week. His leading indicator: A tightening labor market that is driving up wages. ""This economy is really based on consumption, so it puts more money in the hands of consumers,"" he said, thus giving a boost to U.S. companies selling products and services. Zidle referred to Commerce Department data showing the number of people voluntarily leaving their jobs, relative to the amount of people getting fired. ""More and more people are quitting their jobs right now,"" he observed. ""In the law of large numbers, the only reason why people quit their jobs in big numbers is because they have something better lined up and something that pays more."" The scenario could help drive inflation to three to four percent, a number that's considered a sweet spot for companies' profits, explains Zidle. ""If we do start to see this inflation, I think it's very good for cyclicals because they have pricing powers — your energy, materials, tech, financials, small companies. I think it's very, very good for them,"" he said. Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding. Although it isn't a situation that appears to be on the Federal Reserve's radar right now, that doesn't mean it couldn't soon surface as an issue. The Fed has been taking a slow and steady approach to raising rates. The Wall Street consensus predicts the next quarter point interest rate hike will happen at the culmination of its next meeting on June 14. However, the threat of rising prices could alter the Fed's deliberative approach. ""It could force the Fed's hand. The Fed historically tends to get behind the curve, and the economy tends to grow faster than what they're thinking,"" Zidle said. ""It could cause the Fed to hike more aggressively than people think."" Long-time money manager Bob Doll is warning investors that stocks could breach October's correction lows.

Stephanie Landsman,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"UBS Wealth Management is taking a new look at value in a strategy shift, shying away from growth stocks. Jeremy Zirin, the firm's head of investment strategy, recently upgraded large-cap value stocks. Both the S&P 500 Value Index and Russell 1000 have been up just two percent so far this year, compared to their broader counterparts, which are up more than seven percent. ""One interesting trade that we've implemented as of last week is that we've gone value over growth large cap U.S. equities,"" Zirin said on Wednesday's ""Trading Nation."" He cites the record-breaking moves in the Nasdaq, where technology stocks have grabbed big gains. The index has only seen three negative sessions so far this month. ""Valuation is now more attractive given the fact that value has underperformed and earnings actually were better in the first quarter for value than for growth,"" he said. Overall, Zirin remains ""reasonably positive"" on the U.S. market and expects the S&P 500 to reach 2,450 over the next six months. His forecast comes as the S&P closed at a fresh record high, recording its fifth positive session in a row. ""We're likely to see between 2.5 and 3 percent GDP growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis over the course of the rest of the year. That should also provide a tailwind for value,"" said Zirin. His newest call also involves picking up a couple of frequently talked-about laggards. ""What's been left behind in this market has largely been energy and financials. Energy and financials make up almost 40 percent of the value index, and we think the risk reward around those two sectors look quite attractive,"" Zirin said.

Rebecca Ungarino,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"Following a session of record highs for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, which turned in gains despite a plunge in crude oil prices, Dennis Davitt of Harvest Volatility Management breaks down three key market themes for investors heading into the week's final trading day. 1. Crude oil Crude oil prices plunged more than 5 percent in Thursday trading, below $49 per barrel for its biggest daily drop in three weeks, as OPEC's decision to extend output cuts through next March disappointed investors' expectations. ""With the big sell-off in crude oil we saw on Thursday, and the corresponding sell-off in the energy stocks, it's going to be really important to see if that sell-off follows through,"" Davitt said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" Falling crude oil prices dragged energy-related stocks down with them; the XLE, an ETF that tracks energy stocks, fell by nearly 2 percent. ""If the energy stocks can hold their own over the next two days, that's going to bode well for the entire overall equity market,"" he said. 2. Consumer sentiment Monthly Surveys of Consumers data, a broad measurement of consumer sentiment published by the University of Michigan, is due out Friday at 10 a.m. ET. ""It'll be interesting to see how retail stocks react to this consumer sentiment number. If they hold their own, it's going to be a true indication of how the consumer is feeling in the market today,"" Davitt said. The survey's consumer sentiment index and index of consumer expectations are both expected to show month-over-month gains, while its current economic conditions reading is expected to remain unchanged. The report's reading in April was 97.0, and the projected figure for this month is 97.7. 3. European bonds Davitt is closely monitoring the relationship between German government bond yields and Greek yields. He notes that they've begun to converge, as Greek yields fall substantially, while German yields rise moderately. ""If this continues to collapse, I'm then going to figure out if it's more confidence in Greece … or if the German economy is actually starting to overheat,"" he said.

Annie Pei,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"Crude's five-day win streak came to an end on Wednesday, and one trader believes the drop is a sign that oil's comeback is done. Looking at the oil-tracking ETF USO, Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com says the chart is ""moving into technical resistance,"" implying that further upside for crude may be hard to come by. ""If we were to connect the most recent highs, you can see that crude oil has got some overhead resistance or ceiling to contend with right at about the $10.75 mark here in the USO,"" Gordon said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation,"" as the ETF traded at about $10.60. And even if USO had more room to run, it would only reach the $11 mark, according to Gordon. The trader got to the $11 level by using a Fibonacci retracement technique to identify ""the end of correction"" for oil, determining that the commodity would only hit the 75 percent retracement mark from its May 8 low before falling.To play for a short-term drop in USO, Gordon is buying the June 9 weekly 11-strike put and selling the June 9 weekly 10-strike put for 43 cents, or $43 per options spread. If USO were to keep climbing and close above $11 on June 9 expiration, the $43 Gordon paid to make the trade would be the amount he would lose.If USO were to close below $10.57 on June 9, however, Gordon would make money on the trade— all the way up to a maximum reward of $57, which the trade will return should USO close at or below $10 on expiration.WTI crude oil is up 4 percent from last week, remaining above $51 even after Wednesday's drop.

Joe Tenebruso,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) reported fiscal 2018 first-quarter results on May 19. The retail giant's e-commerce strategy is gaining momentum, boosted by recent acquisitions and a renewed focus on its online operations. Metric Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $117.542 billion $115.904 billion 1.4% Operating income $5.237 billion $5.275 billion (0.7%) Earnings per share $1.00 $0.98 2% Data source: Wal-Mart Stores Q1 2018 earnings press release. Image source: Wal-Mart Stores. Total revenue rose 1.4% to $117.5 billion, and 2.5% on a constant currency basis. U.S. comparable-store sales -- excluding the impact of fuel prices -- edged up 1.4%, driven by a 1.5% increase in traffic. Fueling these results was a staggering 69% surge in Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales. The retailer moved aggressively in August to acquire fast-growing e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion, and soon after installed Jet co-founder and CEO Marc Lore as head of its U.S. e-commerce business. Since that time, Wal-Mart has scooped up several other online retailers, including ShoeBuy.com, outdoor gear retailer Moosejaw, and women's apparel seller ModCloth. Wal-Mart is also reportedly in talks to buy e-commerce apparel company Bonobos. Yet CEO Doug McMillon says that these acquisitions have only supplemented Wal-Mart's strong organic e-commerce growth: The acquisitions have received a lot of attention but our plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success. The majority of our growth is and will be organic. The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up. E-commerce sales growth at Walmart U.S. was 63%, the company reported, with the majority organic through Walmart.com. McMillon went on to note that Wal-Mart.com continues to ramp up its selection of goods, and now has 50 million items for consumers to choose from compared to 10 million a year ago. Additionally, Wal-Mart recently introduced free two-day shipping for orders of $35 or more, and launched a new service that allows customers to order products online and receive a discount for picking them up at its stores. ""We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers,"" said McMillon during Wal-Mart's earnings call. Those efforts appear to be succeeding, as evidenced by Wal-Mart's explosive online growth and steady in-store traffic gains. Still, the investments Wal-Mart is making in its digital and store-improvement initiatives are weighing on its margins; first-quarter operating income fell 0.7% year over year to $5.2 billion. Despite the lower profits, Wal-Mart's cash generation remains strong, with the retail titan generating $5.4 billion in operating cash flow and $3.4 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter. That -- combined with the more than $6.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet -- allowed Wal-Mart to return $3.7 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. For the second quarter, Wal-Mart expects comparable-store sales growth (excluding fuel) of 1.5% to 2% for its U.S. locations and 1% to 1.5% at its Sam's Club locations. The company also anticipates earnings per share will be between $1.00 and $1.08. ""We're encouraged with our start to the year,"" added McMillon. ""We have momentum across the business. We're making progress and we know we're on the right track."" ","

Adam Levy,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) saw its online sales growth fall into single digits last year before it decided to actually do something about it. When Wal-Mart reported just 7% growth in e-commerce sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the backlash may have been the impetus it needed to start making major e-commerce acquisitions like Jet.com. That move brought on Marc Lore, a serial digital entrepreneur, to head up Wal-Mart's e-commerce business. It seems the moves are starting to pay off. Lore has made several major moves, and Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales grew a whopping 63% in the first quarter of 2018. What's more, CEO Doug McMillon says that most of that sales growth stems from Walmart.com, not the string of acquisitions it's made over the last year or so. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart made an aggressive move at the beginning of the year, offering free two-day shipping on select items for orders over $35. The company did away with its previous shipping program, ShippingPass, which competed directly with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime. Wal-Mart's free shipping is available on over 2 million items. That's well short of Amazon's 50 million Prime-eligible items. Still, Wal-Mart is betting that it has a wide enough selection to fulfill most customers' needs. The second move Wal-Mart made was to offer discounts on certain items shipped to a nearby store. If Wal-Mart wants to successfully compete with Amazon it needs to use its physical stores. That strategy could be particularly valuable for big-ticket items where shipping the last mile is often costly due to weight, and customers can save a noticeable amount of money. The selection of items on Walmart.com has grown from 10 million at this time last year to 50 million today. The growth stems largely from third-party sellers on Wal-Mart's platform. Third-party sales account for the difference in gross merchandise value(GMV)  growth and sales. Last quarter, GMV grew 69% and sales grew just 63%. Those numbers indicate third-party sales continue to increase their share of sales on Walmart.com. Third-party sales don't generate as much revenue, but Wal-Mart could generate higher profit margins from each sale since it doesn't have to handle inventory or shipping. Amazon, likewise, has seen a lot of growth from third-party merchants recently. Its Fulfillment by Amazon service takes the traditional marketplace one step further by allowing merchants to store products at Amazon's warehouses and take advantage of Amazon's shipping. That's how Amazon quickly grew the number of Prime-eligible items to 50 million. Considering Wal-Mart also has a large fulfillment network, it may consider copying Amazon's strategy. As mentioned above, McMillon said the majority of Wal-Mart's e-commerce growth is organic. Moreover, he said the ""plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success."" So, if Walmart.com is growing fine on its own, why does it need to make so many acquisitions? McMillon stated, ""The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up."" Acquisitions like Modcloth and Moosejaw give Walmart immediate expertise in some high-margin categories. Wal-Mart is historically associated with low quality and low margins. Snatching up some high-end properties could help it sell higher-quality products with higher margins. That said, all of its acquisitions follow a similar pattern: It's buying up young brands at a discount after they've struggled to raise more funding due to slowing sales. By their nature, Wal-Mart shouldn't expect significant growth to come from the acquisitions after they've been incorporated into its e-commerce revenue. Considering the size of Walmart.com, they'll hardly move the needle for Wal-Mart, and Wal-Mart's brand may still hold it back from incorporating higher-priced and higher-margin items on its main website. So, if Walmart.com is growing so well, why bother spending investors' money on e-commerce acquisitions? Overall, it was a great quarter for Wal-Mart's online business, but the company's acquisition strategy is still puzzling. ","
      
    Wal-Mart's Online Sales Just Exploded -- The Motley Fool

Timothy Green,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In a retail environment that's causing trouble for many of its smaller competitors, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is shining. The company extended its long streak of comparable sales growth in the U.S. during the first quarter, and it managed to grow earnings per share despite making significant investments in its business. The big surprise in Wal-Mart's first-quarter report was e-commerce. Online sales in the U.S soared 63% year over year, more than double the 29% growth the company managed during the fourth quarter, and more than quadruple the rate at which Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) grew product sales during the first quarter. Amazon is still far ahead in e-commerce, but that won't be true for long if Wal-Mart can maintain its momentum. How did Wal-Mart do it? There were two main drivers behind the company's explosive first-quarter e-commerce growth. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart closed on the $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com in September of last year, so e-commerce growth was in part driven by revenue from the new addition. Jet was reportedly on pace to generate around $500 million of revenue over the next year at the time of the acquisition. Wal-Mart doesn't disclose the size of its U.S. e-commerce business, but third-party estimates put it at $13.7 billion in 2015. Jet.com founder Marc Lore was placed in charge of Wal-Mart's entire e-commerce businesses, and he's made a few more acquisitions in recent months. Wal-Mart acquired Shoebuy, Modcloth, and Moosejaw earlier this year, and it's reportedly in talks to acquire clothing start-up Bonobos. Wal-Mart doesn't plan to go crazy with acquisitions. According to CEO Doug McMillon, the recent acquisitions were meant to improve Wal-Mart's assortment and give it expertise in higher-margin categories like shoes and apparel. McMillon drove that point home in the conference call: ""The acquisitions have received a lot of attention but our plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success."" Wal-Mart is focused on growing the e-commerce businesses organically, and that's what drove most of e-commerce growth during the first quarter. Wal-Mart stated in its earnings press release that the majority of its e-commerce growth came from organic growth through Walmart.com. This was driven by a few different initiatives. First, Wal-Mart has been increasing the number of products available on its website in an effort to catch up with Amazon. Walmart.com had 50 million different items available at the end of the first quarter, up from just 10 million one year ago. That's still far behind the hundreds of millions of items sold by Amazon, but the gap is closing. Second, Wal-Mart introduced free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more during the first quarter. This aggressive move prompted Amazon to slash the minimum on its own non-Prime free shipping offer twice, and it made Amazon's $99 annual Prime membership less attractive for those who care only about its free shipping benefits. Wal-Mart also introduced pick-up discounts to customers who order certain items online and choose to pick up their order in a store. Wal-Mart is far more efficient shipping products to its stores than it is shipping individual orders to customers, allowing it to provide a sometimes-sizable discount for in-store pick-up. According to the company, 90% of the U.S. population is within 10 miles of a Wal-Mart store. Beyond standard online sales, Wal-Mart has continued to expand its online grocery service, which allows customers to place a grocery order online and pick it up curbside at a Wal-Mart location for free. The service is now available at 670 locations in the U.S., and Wal-Mart plans to grow that number in 2017 while expanding to other countries. Online grocery sales are included in Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales figures. Amazon has had incredible success with its Prime membership program, offering unlimited two-day shipping, a growing catalog of streaming video, and plenty of other perks. The only way Wal-Mart can succeed online is to do what it's been doing since it was founded: offer the absolute lowest prices. But low prices alone aren't enough. The free two-day shipping offer is critical to get customers to even consider shopping on Walmart.com, especially those used to shopping on Amazon by default. Based on Wal-Mart's first-quarter results, free two-day shipping is doing exactly that. Wal-Mart remains a distant second behind Amazon in the race for online sales. But the company is making big strides, and if it can maintain anything close to its explosive growth rate during the first quarter, that gap will quickly shrink. Amazon certainly has something to worry about. ","
      
    Here's What Drove Wal-Mart's Explosive Online Growth -- The Motley Fool

In October 2015, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) slashed its profit guidance for the following year, saying it would invest in higher wages and cleaner stores in order to ensure long-term success. Management said, ""As a result of investments in wages and training as well as our commitment to further developing a seamless customer experience, we expect earnings per share to decline between 6% and 12% in fiscal 2017 (calendar 2016),"" adding that EPS would rebound with a 5% to 10% increase in fiscal year 2019 (calendar 2018). Image source: Wal-Mart. Wall Street responded with a massive sell-off as the stock fell more than 8%, its worst one-day performance since the recession. Clearly, the market saw Wal-Mart's move as a sign of weakness as it caved to pressure from Amazon.com, and analysts seemed skeptical that Wal-Mart would be able to return to steady growth. However, Wal-Mart's latest quarterly report a year-and-a-half later makes it clear that the company is well on its way to fulfilling that promise. The retail giant delivered its first quarter of profit growth in more than two years last week as earnings per share increased 2% to $1, coming at the top end of the company's guidance and beating analyst estimates. Wal-Mart also posted its 11th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth, a streak that many retailers have been unable to match, including rivals like Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Target (NYSE:TGT), each of whom reported same-store sales declines in their most recent quarters. In order to maintain that streak of same-store sales growth, Wal-Mart has had to overcome challenges including e-commerce competition and food deflation that have crushed sales growth at its supermarket peers. Wal-Mart, which derives more than half of its domestic sales from groceries, has lowered its prices to grab more market share in the category, one of many savvy strategic moves the company has recently made. The company has set a goal of having grocery prices 15% below the competition 80% of the time. As a result, it has clawed back market share it had previously lost to grocers like Kroger as well as the dollar store chains. When Wal-Mart cut its profit forecast in 2015, it did something that almost all publicly trade companies are reluctant do. It sacrificed short-term performance for long-term gains, and, as it often does, Wall Street punished for it doing so. But there is now sufficient evidence that those moves are paying off as the increase in profits indicates. Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales skyrocketed last quarter, jumping 63% on the strength of its decision in January to offer free two-day shipping on orders over $35. Expanding its online inventory from 10 million to 50 million and increasing the number of grocery pickup kiosks also drove the surge in online sales. Last summer, Wal-Mart acquired Jet.com for $3.3 billion, bringing its Founder Marc Lore into the fold. Lore now runs Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce division and has been the force behind much of the recent improvements. Investments like that and expansion of the grocery pickup program will continue to pay off much in the same way that investing in higher wages and better training has led to higher customer satisfaction in its stores. As long as same-store sales continue to increase and e-commerce grows at a robust pace, Wal-Mart's profits will move higher. The company has made the bulk of the needed investments to ensure its success and investors can now begin reaping the benefits. The stock has already bounced back 37% since the sell-off in 2015. Wal-Mart is flexing its muscle again and Wall Street is back on board. ","
      
    Wal-Mart Is Turning the Corner -- The Motley Fool

Daniel B. Kline,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The robots are coming. That's a reality for the American workforce, and in some fields, like high-end factory production, they are already here. It's easy to see how robots will help with manufacturing, order-taking, and even running back-end operations for retailers, restaurants, and many other businesses. However, robots have not yet, and likely won't in the near future, replace human workers in customer service or in many public-facing retail jobs. Yes, a mechanized worker can make sure you get your Big Mac with no onions and extra pickles more reliably than a human can, but robots lack certain attributes their human counterparts have. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has taken note of that and has not only increased compensation for its workers, it has also dramatically scaled up training. The company has not forsaken technology or even decided to not use robots, but it's spending heavily to prepare its human workforce for the changing environment they work in. CEO Doug McMillion talked about those efforts in the company's Q1 2018 earnings call on May 17. In his remarks, he detailed his experience at the grand opening of the chain's 100th training academy, in Edmond, Okla. ""I met associates there who were new to Wal-Mart and were quickly learning about our business. I also met associates who have been with us for 30, 35 and even 40 years, and they were learning about new processes and tools,"" he said. ""We plan to graduate approximately 225,000 associates from our U.S. academies this year."" Wal-Mart's academies mix classroom and in-store training. Image source: Wal-Mart. About 75% of Wal-Mart management in the United States started as hourly employees, according to McMillion. The chain promotes over 150,000 workers to jobs with higher pay and more responsibilities each year. That flow of entry-level workers into increasingly higher-level jobs makes training a benefit not only to employees, but also the company. All entry-level employees take a basic training course called Pathways. As people work their way up at the company, they have the opportunity to learn new skills at the chain's academies, dedicated teaching facilities where employees take 2- to 6-week classes in advanced retail skills. The academies have dedicated teaching staff and Wal-Mart expects to double their number to over 200 by the end of 2017. The academies teach front-line hourly supervisors, department managers, and assistant managers, helping them gain new skills they bring back to their stores. This has become especially important as Wal-Mart has been making major shifts in how it operates in order to better integrate its physical and digital operations. ""It's exciting to see our people feeling confident and even more empowered to take charge of their careers,"" wrote the CEO in a post on the company's website. ""Our customers are seeing a benefit, too. As these graduates are going back to their stores and implementing their new skills, they're helping transform our shopping experience to be a consistently positive one."" Wal-Mart, under new digital boss Marc Lore, has been working to align its stores to a reality where consumers may order online and pickup in the store or buy something at a store for delivery at home. It's a fluid environment that requires a changed supply line system and employees better-versed in inventory management than simply looking in the stockroom for an item. Robots will have a part in that future helping with order picking, packing, and shipping at the chain's distribution centers. In addition, robot drones will take inventory and technology will be used in countless ways to enhance what human workers can do. While technology will help Wal-Mart reach its goals, the chain is acknowledging that front-line employees, store management, department leaders, and others will remain people. By investing in training those employees, Wal-mart not only builds better workers, it lowers turnover by showing people a path to advancement. Well-trained employees will not only be happier, they will do their jobs better, which is ultimately needed to get the most out of cost-saving technology advancements. ","

Free shipping has become an expected perk in many cases when consumers shop online. The challenge for retailers, of course, is to deliver items for free without taking too big a hit while doing so. To make that happen, companies like Target (NYSE:TGT), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) all set a minimum order threshold for a customer to qualify for free shipping. But while these brands offer it in some form, how they define the concept varies. So when it comes to shopping with these major retailers, it is important to understand where each company sets its order threshold to qualify for free shipping and when customers can actually expect their delivery. Wal-Mart is using its stores to ship some digital orders. Image source: Wal-Mart. As it turns out, the estimated 65 million Prime members in the U.S. spend ""on average about $1,200 per year, compared with about $600 per year for non-member customers,"" according to a November report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Target's deal, on the other hand, is a mixed bag. The company requires consumers to spend $35 to get free shipping, but the order reaches your door in three to five business days. The retailer also offers this free standard shipping to anyone who uses its REDcard debit or credit card to pay for an online order. Last but not least, Wal-Mart similarly has a $35 free-shipping threshold, but customers who reach that minimum get two-day shipping. That's a perk Amazon customers pay for and one that the brick-and-mortar giant used to charge $50 for under its now-defunct ShippingPass program. Excluding the Amazon Prime membership, Wal-Mart has the best deal for consumers who want to get their orders in two days at no extra charge. Keep in mind, however, that Amazon Prime offers more than 50 million eligible items for its two-day service, while Wal-Mart can only boast around two million. For shoppers who really need their orders now, both Amazon and Target are pushing faster shipping options. Free two-hour delivery is already available to Prime members on some items in limited markets, and Target has been testing one-day delivery on what it calls ""essentials"" for an as yet unnamed fee. These programs are still in their early days, and for most people, two days is fast enough. It's easy to see why millions of people happily pay for an Amazon Prime membership. In addition to streaming music and video services, being able to place even a tiny order and have it shipped out in two days is very convenient. But if you can survive with a smaller product selection, Wal-Mart has what is currently the best free-shipping offer. The free two-day shipping from Wal-Mart should aid the company's ongoing efforts to grow its digital customer base, but it will take its toll on margins. Amazon has shown a willingness to play the long game, sacrificing short-term profits to build a loyal customer relationship. Wal-Mart seems to be adopting a similar mindset, but it's hard to know if the company will stick to its shipping offer after a few quarters of e-commerce growth are matched by decreasing profitability.

Rick Munarriz,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) turned 20 as a public company earlier this year, and the stock is being celebrated for its monstrous game-changing wealth creation. The stock is a 660-bagger since going public at a split-adjusted price of $1.50 on May 15, 1997. Shares of the leading online retailer hit new all-time highs this year, and it's easy to wonder when the stock will split again. Amazon stock has been weaving over and under the $1,000 mark, and while these transactions aren't as important as they used to be -- individual investors can buy a share at $1,000 just as easily as they can buy 100 shares of the same stock at $10 -- there are a couple of compelling reasons for the dot-com darling to consider executing what would be its fourth stock split as a public company. Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon went through three stock splits during the sudsy days before the dot-com bubble popped. The company wasn't profitable. It would go on to post a massive $1.4 billion deficit in 2000. However, Amazon was growing, and it was an internet stock at a time when investors valued eyeballs over actual financial results. Amazon rolled out the three splits in a 15-month window that began a year after its 1997 IPO. It's now been 18 years since its last split, and one would think that lowering its share price in a zero-sum transaction is long overdue. The first three splits were announced when the stock was in the high double-digits, or just crossing into the triple-digits. Why wouldn't it go this route now that it's approaching quadruple-digits? The easy explanation is that Amazon doesn't have to declare a stock split. The shares have soared roughly 660-fold, so it's not as if the stock's buoyant share price has been a detriment to capital appreciation. There's also some vanity associated with a chunky share price. It's a sign of success. You can blame Warren Buffett for that, even if he's obviously not as flashy as some of the tech giants that have been racing alongside Amazon. Thankfully for folks rooting for a stock split, there are two good reasons for the country's most valuable retailer to consider a split. Let's start with accessibility. Stock commissions are cheaper than they were in the late 1990s, and it's as easy to buy a single share of a stock as it is to buy a round lot of 100 these days. However, with Amazon approaching $1,000 per share, it's a realistic hurdle for some individual investors trying to take advantage of low commissions to initiate positions and diversify within a modest portfolio. Perhaps the bigger reason to consider a split now -- or at least the moment the stock crosses four figures -- is index inclusion. Amazon is naturally a member of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices, but it's not in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow 30 is a price-weighted index, which, unlike the S&P 500 and most of the other popular market gauges, bases a stock's weighting in the index by its share price. Amazon may have topped Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) to command the largest market cap in the retail industry two summer ago, but it's not getting into the Dow at its current price. A $1,000 price tag makes it more than four times as valuable as the stock that is currently the Dow's highest-priced component. More to the point, Amazon's stock price is worth more than its 15 lowest-priced components combined. A move by Amazon stock if it was in the Dow would be more than enough to offset a similar move going the other way for the lower-priced half of the Dow 30. Obviously there are no guarantees that Amazon will be tapped for Dow inclusion if it does execute a stock split, but it's not a coincidence that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) wasn't added until it finally gave up the race to $1,000 and announced a 7-for-1 split in 2014. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos didn't get as far as he did by being conventional. He's not going to buckle to the clamoring for stock splits. However, making the share price more accessible to entry-level investors and opening up the possibility for joining Wal-Mart in the Dow are compelling reasons to consider the move. We'll have to wait and see what the company decides. ","

T.J. Maxx parent TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) has earned rave reviews from investors and retail analysts in recent years. The stock has nearly doubled over the last five years, while much of the apparel retail has been stuck in seemingly permanent decline. Department store chains like Macy's and J.C. Penney have been forced to close hundred of stores and are now trading at five-year lows. Other mall-based staples like Gap Inc have struggled. Few traditional retailers seem to have the right formula to fend off e-commerce threats like Amazon.com and fast-fashion upstarts like H&M and Uniqlo. Off-price brands like T.J. Maxx and its sister brand Marshall's appear to be in a sweet spot, though. The discounted name-brand clothing they offer promises shoppers something new and surprising every time they come in the store, the so-called ""treasure hunt"" effect, and the model has been difficult to replicate online. TJX has been able to consistently deliver comparable sales growth, though that figure was flat in its most recent quarter. As a result, TJX is now nearly twice as big by market cap as Macy's, Gap, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), J.C. Penney, and Sears. However, while TJX has come to define the off-price space, it may not be the best operator in the sector. Though a number of peers in the space like Ross Stores and Burlington Stores have also seen their stocks surge, Nordstrom Rack, whose performance is hidden within the larger department-store chain, might be a hidden gem. Though Nordstrom is best known for its high-end department stores, its off-price Rack brand has become an increasingly important part of the business. Nordstrom now has 220 Rack stores, nearly double the number of full-line department stores, and by one key metric they are more successful than TJX's brands. Image source: Nordstrom. According to sales per square foot, which shows how efficiently a retailer is using its space, Nordstrom Rack does better than T.J. Maxx and Marshall's. In 2016, Nordstrom Rack stores delivered $474 of revenue per square foot of space, better than the return of its full-line stores at $330 per square foot. Nordstrom Rack contributed 31% of the parent company's revenue last year, and that number continues to grow each year. At T.J. Maxx and Marshall's, by comparison, sales per square foot was $404 per square foot last year. While many retailers have been forced to shutter stores or even declare bankruptcy, both Nordstrom Rack and TJX have promised aggressive expansions. Nordstrom has already added six new off-price locations this year, with plans to open at least twelve, a move that would increase the base by more than 5%. TJX, meanwhile, is the much bigger chain, with more than 2,000 T.J. Maxx and Marshall's stores across the U.S. and 3,800 total locations globally, including Home Goods. The company sees that rising to 5,600 in the future. Macy's recently blamed its woes not on e-commerce, but on off-price brands like T.J. Maxx, as it said would expand its own off-price brand, Backstage, inside its department stores. But comparable sales have slowed lately at T.J. Maxx and Nordstrom Rack, indicating that off-price retail may be plateauing. While T.J. Maxx and Marshall's had flat comparable sales last quarter, Nordstrom Rack's fell 0.9%. As more retailers shutter stores that trend could improve, but the future of off-price retail may not be as rosy as the last few years. Amazon is now the country's biggest online apparel retailer, and even Wal-Mart is making strides in the space with acquisitions of ShoeBuy, ModCloth, Moosejaw, and potentially Bonobos. Despite Nordstrom's better sales per square foot metric, TJX is the much bigger of the two and has unbeatable profits with an operating margin of 14%. That spells opportunity for Nordstrom, though, as its off-price brand could lead the stock's comeback. ","

,06012017,Reuters,05252017,"Marc Lore, head of Wal-Mart’s e-commerce operations, said in a blog post on Thursday the step will cut shipping costs, speed the delivery of packages and allow workers to earn additional compensation. Wal-Mart’s stores are within 10 miles (16 km) of 90 percent of the U.S. population, Lore said. “Imagine all the routes our associates drive to and fro from work and the houses they pass along the way. It’s easy to see why this test could be a game changer,” he said. Since he joined in August, Lore has helped spearhead some aggressive moves intended to boost the retailer’s online business. Wal-Mart completed its $3 billion acquisition of Lore’s former company, internet retailer Jet.com, in September. Lore has overseen Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of three online retailers and made other e-commerce changes. Wal-Mart now offers free two-day shipping on online orders above $35, without any membership fees, to compete with Amazon’s popular Prime shipping program. Wal-Mart said on Thursday its trucks deliver packages to a retail location for store pickup and the same trucks can bring additional orders a worker can sign up to deliver. The delivery program is voluntary for store workers and allows them to sign up for a maximum of 10 deliveries a day. The retailer did not share details on compensation of workers who sign up. The test is limited to three stores in New Jersey and Arkansas. Wal-Mart will hold its annual shareholder meeting on Friday in Arkansas.

JOHN’S, N.L.—One of the largest oil developments to be approved in Canada this year lit up Newfoundland and Labrador’s bleak economic outlook as Husky Energy announced an expanded West White Rose project. “It’s a happy day,” Malcolm Maclean, senior Atlantic vice president for Husky, told reporters Monday. There will be hundreds of jobs plus royalties, equity and tax benefits expected to top $3 billion for a province that has reeled since the oil price collapse. “We’d like to start work almost immediately.” The $2.2-billion project is to produce first oil in 2022, using a fixed wellhead platform tied to the SeaRose floating production, storage and offloading vessel about 350 kilometres east of St. John’s, N.L. Peak production is estimated to reach rates of about 75,000 barrels per day by 2025. “Increasing the amount of oil that we thought we could recover from the platform helped the economics,” Maclean said of a project that’s now larger than when the company delayed it in 2014 as oil prices tanked. Brent crude fell from $115 (U.S.) a barrel in mid-2014 to below $30 before rebounding. It was trading Monday at around $52. “We’re confident we can recover more than twice the oil that was originally expected to be recovered from the field in 2005,” Maclean said. That initial amount was estimated at 230 million barrels. “We’ve always liked our operations in the White Rose field and we see it becoming bigger and bigger,” Maclean said. The location and setup allow for easier shipments, he added. “Recently cargoes have been going from Newfoundland and Labrador to as far away as China. Western Canada has got issues with pipeline capacity which, fortunately, we don’t have.” The new wellhead will be designed to last at least 25 years and could have another use: Husky also announced Monday an additional discovery well drilled about 11 kilometres from the SeaRose vessel. The Northwest White Rose shows a light oil column of more than 100 metres. Maclean was tight-lipped otherwise, saying the company is still assessing the size of the find. Premier Dwight Ball said construction on the concrete gravity structure will start in Argentia, N.L., this year. It will employ at least 700 people at peak, he said. Design and building of the accommodation module, helideck, life boat stations and flare boom will add hundreds more jobs, he said. Maclean said the topsides will be built, as negotiated in 2013, in the Gulf of Mexico. A contractor has not been named. Ball believes there is much more oil off Newfoundland to tap: “Our future is bright.” Environmental activists say such reserves should be left in the ground in favour of cleaner energy sources. The province is building the $11.7-billion Muskrat Falls hydro project in Labrador but is also intent on exploiting its offshore oil. “We have a world right now that still uses oil, still uses petroleum products,” Ball said. Last year’s call for bids by the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board drew eight bidders that committed to exploration work worth almost $758 million. Of eight parcels awarded, four were in the newly identified West Orphan Basin, two in the Flemish Pass Basin and two in the Jeanne D’Arc Basin where the White Rose, Hibernia and Terra Nova sites already operate. First oil from the new Hebron development is to flow later this year. Husky said incremental operating costs at West White Rose are expected to be less than $3 per barrel over the first 10 years with the tie-back to the SeaRose operation. It’s expected to create about 250 permanent platform jobs once operational. “After much delay, it’s wonderful to see this happen here,” said Andrew Bell, chairman of the Newfoundland and Labrador Oil & Gas Industries Association. “Not a lot of projects are getting sanctioned globally.” Ivan Gedge, regional manager of the Atlantic Canada Regional Council of Carpenters, Millwrights and Allied Workers, said work at Argentia will help fill a major gap left as construction of the Hebron development wrapped up earlier this year. It will mean pay cheques for at least three years, he told reporters Monday. “Hopefully it will keep people in the province, and keep our tradespeople working.”          Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Courtney Reagan,06012017,CNBC,05252017,"Walmart.com and Jet.com shoppers in three U.S. cities now have a new delivery person, and it's not employees of one of the major shipping companies like FedEx or UPS or a delivery start-up like Instacart or Deliv. It's a Wal-Mart store employee. ""Unlike crowdsourced delivery, where the driver has to travel (often out of the way) to pick up the package, then drive the full distance to deliver it, our associates are starting at the same place as the packages,"" said Marc Lore, president and CEO of Walmart eCommerce U.S., in a blog post for the retailer. It all works through a proprietary app the retailer built for this test. The app matches online order delivery addresses with employees' driving routes home from work, built to minimize any more driving than what the employee would do anyway to get home. Delivering is completely voluntary, and the employees can choose when they want to deliver, how many packages they can take and what size. ""Once they're done working at the store for the day, they pick up the packages from the backroom, load them into their vehicle, enter the delivery addresses into the GPS on their phone and head towards home,"" Lore said. Wal-Mart compensates the employees for it but declined to elaborate how it works. The discount retailer said the test has only been in progress for a month but so far ""hundreds"" of deliveries have been completed in two locations in New Jersey and one in Arkansas. So far, ""the response from associates and customers has been great,"" Lore said. Its locations and labor — some 4,700 U.S. stores with 1.3 million employees — are quite an asset that Lore has been working on further integrating with its digital operations. The retailer says 90 percent of the country's population live within 10 miles of a Walmart store. While the retailer does not provide a delivery cost breakdown, it's the last leg — commonly referred to as the ""last mile"" — that is the most expensive when it comes to fulfilling and shipping online orders. Consultant group McKinsey & Company estimates ""the last mile"" can sometimes be more than half of an item's total delivery cost. Last month, Wal-Mart Stores said it would offer shoppers a discount for 10,000 online-only orders that are picked up by shoppers in store rather than delivered to their homes. The discount, Marc Lore said, is ""meant to be equivalent to what the last-mile delivery costs are,"" which in most cases averages to about a 4 percent discount per item.The store pickup option saves Wal-Mart delivery costs, which it passes on to shoppers in the form of discounts, but the new employees-as-delivery-service test does not offer shoppers a discount. Wal-Mart said the benefit is that most orders are delivered the next day. ",Wal-Mart employees can now also deliver your online orders
Tom DiChristopher,06012017,CNBC,05252017,"President Donald Trump is expected to pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement on Thursday, ignoring many of the nation's leading companies, who say the country should stick with the deal. Trump and the anti-Paris Agreement camp have levied a number of criticisms against the international accord, which aims to mitigate the effects of climate change by preventing global temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. They say Obama-era policies and regulations that would help the United States meet its commitments to the Paris Agreement will dampen economic growth and kill jobs. Critics also complain the deal holds countries like China and India to a lower standard and forces the U.S. to sacrifice its sovereignty. But many businesses say the United States will become more competitive and stands to grow its economy under the Paris Agreement. In April, a group of 16 companies — including Apple, Google, Walmart, mining company BHP Billiton, and oil majors BP and Shell — laid out exactly why the Paris Agreement will help U.S. companies. ""U.S. business interests are best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced global response. We believe the Paris Agreement provides such a framework,"" the CEOs said. Among the benefits the Paris accord provides to U.S. firms, according to the companies: Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff on Wednesday tweeted out a letter signed by about two dozen companies again asking Trump to stick with the Paris Agreement. @Benioff: Dear President Trump, as some of the largest companies in the US, we strongly urge you to keep the US in the Paris Agreement. On Thursday, Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman urged Trump to keep the United States in the Paris Agreement, warning he is putting the U.S. role in the high-tech job market at risk. ""This is not in the best interest of Americans. We need to own the next generation of jobs, and whether that's clean energy, 3-D printing or immunotherapy, this is an arena that America should lead and must lead,"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" ""I think this will be a big mistake if he withdraws from the Paris climate accord."" Oil majors including U.S. energy giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron say the accord offers a framework for tackling global warming and gives the United States a role in steering the global response to climate change. ""The Paris agreement and the initial Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) pledged by its signatories reflect the dual challenge of minimizing greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring the world has adequate access to affordable and reliable supplies of energy,"" Exxon said in a statement in November. To be sure, these companies are big players in natural gas development and stood to benefit from Obama-era regulations that have already expedited the retirement of some coal-fired plants and would likely continue that trend. Trump and Republicans have started rolling back many of those policies. But even some coal producers like Cloud Peak Energy and Peabody Energy argued the U.S. should remain a party in order to negotiate coal's future in the global energy mix. Many investors have also advised the president to keep the U.S. in the accord. Last month, 214 institutional investors with $15 trillion of assets under management pushed Trump to implement the U.S. commitment, which aims to reduce the nation's greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. ""As long-term institutional investors, we believe that the mitigation of climate change is essential for the safeguarding of our investments,"" they said.

Stephanie Landsman,06012017,CNBC,05252017,"UBS Wealth Management is taking a new look at value in a strategy shift, shying away from growth stocks. Jeremy Zirin, the firm's head of investment strategy, recently upgraded large-cap value stocks. Both the S&P 500 Value Index and Russell 1000 have been up just two percent so far this year, compared to their broader counterparts, which are up more than seven percent. ""One interesting trade that we've implemented as of last week is that we've gone value over growth large cap U.S. equities,"" Zirin said on Wednesday's ""Trading Nation."" He cites the record-breaking moves in the Nasdaq, where technology stocks have grabbed big gains. The index has only seen three negative sessions so far this month. ""Valuation is now more attractive given the fact that value has underperformed and earnings actually were better in the first quarter for value than for growth,"" he said. Overall, Zirin remains ""reasonably positive"" on the U.S. market and expects the S&P 500 to reach 2,450 over the next six months. His forecast comes as the S&P closed at a fresh record high, recording its fifth positive session in a row. ""We're likely to see between 2.5 and 3 percent GDP growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis over the course of the rest of the year. That should also provide a tailwind for value,"" said Zirin. His newest call also involves picking up a couple of frequently talked-about laggards. ""What's been left behind in this market has largely been energy and financials. Energy and financials make up almost 40 percent of the value index, and we think the risk reward around those two sectors look quite attractive,"" Zirin said.

Rebecca Ungarino,06012017,CNBC,05252017,"Following a session of record highs for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, which turned in gains despite a plunge in crude oil prices, Dennis Davitt of Harvest Volatility Management breaks down three key market themes for investors heading into the week's final trading day. 1. Crude oil Crude oil prices plunged more than 5 percent in Thursday trading, below $49 per barrel for its biggest daily drop in three weeks, as OPEC's decision to extend output cuts through next March disappointed investors' expectations. ""With the big sell-off in crude oil we saw on Thursday, and the corresponding sell-off in the energy stocks, it's going to be really important to see if that sell-off follows through,"" Davitt said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" Falling crude oil prices dragged energy-related stocks down with them; the XLE, an ETF that tracks energy stocks, fell by nearly 2 percent. ""If the energy stocks can hold their own over the next two days, that's going to bode well for the entire overall equity market,"" he said. 2. Consumer sentiment Monthly Surveys of Consumers data, a broad measurement of consumer sentiment published by the University of Michigan, is due out Friday at 10 a.m. ET. ""It'll be interesting to see how retail stocks react to this consumer sentiment number. If they hold their own, it's going to be a true indication of how the consumer is feeling in the market today,"" Davitt said. The survey's consumer sentiment index and index of consumer expectations are both expected to show month-over-month gains, while its current economic conditions reading is expected to remain unchanged. The report's reading in April was 97.0, and the projected figure for this month is 97.7. 3. European bonds Davitt is closely monitoring the relationship between German government bond yields and Greek yields. He notes that they've begun to converge, as Greek yields fall substantially, while German yields rise moderately. ""If this continues to collapse, I'm then going to figure out if it's more confidence in Greece … or if the German economy is actually starting to overheat,"" he said. Long-time money manager Bob Doll is warning investors that stocks could breach October's correction lows.

ARE YOU SEEING ANY IMPACT FROM AMAZON AND HULU'S INVESTMENT IN THESE NEW SHOWS LIKE HULU HAS HANDSMAIDS TALE? HASTINGS: BOTH OF US, AMAZON, US, HULU AND A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS, SKY AND GLEAM AND OTHERS ARE INVESTING IN ORIGINAL CONTACT. PEOPLE WANT ON DEMAND. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL WHEN AND HOW THEY WATCH. WITH THAT, WE ARE GROWING A WHOLE INDUSTRY. SO IT IS A MIX OF YES, IT IS COMPETITION THAT HURTS AND ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS GETTING INTERNET VIEWING MORE POPULAR WITH EVERYONE. BOORSTIN: YOU SAID YOU ARE GOING TO SPEND $6 BILLION ON ORIGINAL CONTENT THIS YEAR. HOW MUCH IS THAT GOING TO HAVE TO INCREASE IN LIGHT OF EVERYONE ELSE GETTING INTO THIS GAME AS WELL? HASTINGS: A LOT. AS WE GROW THE MEMBERSHIP BASE, WE WANT TO GROW THE CONTENT BUDGET. THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT SHOWS ON NETFLIX BUT THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT SHOWS WE DON'T YET HAVE. WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE AS WE GROW THE MEMBERSHIP BASE TO TRY TO GET MORE SHOWS AND MORE MOVIES. BOORSTIN: CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW MUCH THAT SPENDING IS GOING TO RAMP AND HOW MUCH OF THAT RAMP WILL BE BECAUSE OF COMPETITION FOR THAT CONTENT? IS THAT GOING TO PUSH PRICES UP? HASTINGS: IT REALLY HAS. BEEN GREAT FOR TALENT AND WRITERS FOR EVERYONE. THERE IS SO MUCH COMPETITION NOW BETWEEN ALL THE NEW PLAYERS PLUS THE EXISTING PLAYERS, LIKE HBO, ARE BEGINNING TO GROW. IT IS THIS NEW AGE OF TELEVISION. NOBODY IS SURE WHERE IT IS GOING, EXCEPT FOR THE QUALITY OF MOVIES AND TV SHOWS IS CONTINUING TO DECLINE. BOORSTIN: THE QUALITY MAY BE CONTINUING TO DECLINE. THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON THE MOVIE BUSINESS? MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND THE U.S. BOX OFFICE HAD ITS WORST WEEKEND IN 18 YEARS. IS THAT BECAUSE OF NETFLIX? HASTINGS: IT IS PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET, NOT JUST NETFLIX BUT PEOPLE WATCHING ON YOUTUBE AND AMAZON AND NETFLIX. ALL OF THE INTERNET CONSUMPTION IS GETTING BETTER OR IT MAY BE JUST THERE WAS NO GREAT BIG MOVIE OPENING. JON FORTT: REED, TELL ME THE IMPACT OF COMEDY. DAVE CHAPPELLE WAS PROBABLY BIG FOR YOU GUYS. I SAW MINAGE JUST LAUNCHED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, ALI WONG HAS BEEN BUZZY. IS THIS A TYPE OF CONTENT THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO TALK ABOUT IN A CERTAIN WAY OR MAYBE TO REPEAT WATCH? HOW DOES THAT AFFECT YOUR SUBSCRIBERS? HASTINGS: FIRST, YOU DID COMEDY LIKE MASTER OF NONE AND KIMMY SCHMIDT AND COMEDY SERIES AND THEN THERE IS STANDUP COMEDY WE ARE DOING REALLY WELL IN. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING MORE TALENT YOU TRY TO DEVELOP TALENT WHEN THEY ARE EARLY IN THEIR CAREER LIKE ALI WONG AND WHEN THEY ARE EPIC LIKE DAVE CHAPPELLE AND FIRST TIME BACK IN POPULAR TELEVISION 10-15 YEARS. FORTT: DO PEOPLE WATCH IT DIFFERENTLY THOUGH? HASTINGS: THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE INTERNET IS THEY WATCH IT HOW AND WHEN THEY WANT. SOME PEOPLE WATCH IT ON THE PHONE. SOME PEOPLE WATCH IT ON THE BIG SCREEN TV AND PEOPLE DO REPEAT WATCH THOSE SHOWS IN PARTICULAR. BOORSTIN: ONE OF THE OTHER CATEGORIES YOU HAVE BEEN MOVING INTO IS MOVIES, WAR MACHINE, COST YOU $60 MILLION AND YOU ALSO PUT IT IN THEATERS LAST WEEKEND. WAS THAT INVESTMENT WORTH IT, PUTTING IT IN THEATERS AND SPENDING $60 MILLION JUST TO MAKE IT. HASTINGS: SOME PEOPLE LOVE TO WATCH IN THE MOVIE THEATRES AND THAT'S FINE. WE WANT TO HAVE CONSUMERS BE ABLE TO CHOOSE. SO FAR, THE LARGE CHAINS IN THE US LIKE AMC AND REGAL HAVE NOT CARRIED THESE FILMS, SO THEY ARE IN VERY SMALL THEATERS. WE HOPE OVER TIME THAT THE THEATERS WILL WAKE UP AND SAY WE SHOULD PROVIDE CONSUMERS CHOICE. WE ARE INTO GIVING CONSUMERS CHOICE. THEY CAN WATCH IT ON NETFLIX OR IN THE THEATERS ON THE SAME DAY. BOORSTIN: DO YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PRESSURE THEATERS TO CHANGE THE WHOLE MODEL AND TAKE MOVIES THE SAME DAY THEY ARE ON NETFLIX? HASTINGS: CONSUMERS MAY PRESSURE THE THEATRES IT IS NOT REALLY FOR US TO DO. WE ARE TRYING TO PRODUCE THE GREATEST CONTENT AND HAVE IT BE ON NETFLIX. WE ARE ALSO OPEN TO THE MOVIE SOME PEOPLE WOULD PREFER THE BIG SCREEN EXPERIENCE. THAT'S FINE. BOORSTIN: DO YOU THINK OTHER STUDIOS WILL FOLLOW SUIT AND TRY TO CLOSE THAT WINDOW BETWEEN THEATRICAL RELEASE AND HOME VIDEO? HASTINGS: THERE ARE SOME GREAT ARTICLES FROM 2011. FOUR STUDIOS HAVE AGREED FOR THE MOVIE TO DO X AND IT NEVER HAPPENS. IT IS HARD TO SAY. IT IS A SLOW MOVING INDUSTRY. QUINTANILLA: THERE HAS BEEN SOME SELL SIDE RESEARCH LATELY THAT ARGUES THE STREET MAY BE DRAMATICALLY UNDERESTIMATING YOUR LONG-TERM? HASTINGS: UNDERESTIMATING. THAT'S A DIFFERENT QUESTION. QUINTANILLA: I KNOW. MAYBE UNDERCOUNTING YOUR LONG-TERM SUB-BASE AT LEAST DOMESTICALLY. WHY AREN'T YOU MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THE STREET AND PROMISING MORE AT LEAST ON THE OUT YEARS? HASTINGS: EXCEPT FOR VISITING WITH YOU GUYS ONCE A YEAR, I DON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THE STREET. IT IS FOCUSED ON HOW DO WE MAKE THE BEST EXPERIENCE POSSIBLE AND THAT WILL DETERMINE OUR GROWTH. WE FOCUS ON THE SHOWS, STREAMING, INTERFACE ALL OF THOSE THINGS. QUINTANILLA: IS THE RATE OF CORD CUTTING WHICH IS ACCELERATING, IS THAT FORCING YOU TO RECALIBRATE YOUR LONG-TERM EXPECTATIONS OF SUB GROWTH? HASTINGS: VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE CUT THE CORD. WE ARE ABOUT 50 MILLION IN THE U.S. WE HAVE SEEN MAYBE 2 MILLION OR 3 MILLION OF 50 CUT THE CORD. DON'T THINK OF IT AS A BIG OVERLAP THAT WE ARE DRIVING CORD CUTTING THAT IS PROBABLY MOSTLY FROM PRICING. IN GENERAL IF YOU LOOK AT CORD CUTTING, IT IS LIKE 2%-3% PER YEAR, LIKE BROADCAST RATINGS OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS. IT WILL TAKE A VERY LONG, SLOW, SECULAR DECLINE NO BIG CALAMITY AND THEN THEY WILL ADJUST THE ECONOMICS. BOORSTIN: DO YOU THINK YOU ARE NEARING SATURATION HERE IN THE U.S.? YOU ARE INVESTING IN AGGRESSIVELY EXPANDING ABROAD. DO YOU THINK HERE YOU ARE REACHING SATURATION? HASTINGS: ABSOLUTELY IF WE KEPT THE PRODUCT THE SAME, WE SAID NO MORE IMPROVEMENTS THEN WE WOULD SATURATE BUT WE ARE CONTINUING TO IMPROVE NETFLIX. WE ARE MAKING THE STREAMING INCREDIBLE NOW WE HAVE HD, 4 K AND HDR. IF YOU BUY A NEW TV, IT IS INCREDIBLE HOW IT LOOKS. IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN A MOVIE THEATER. WE ARE ADDING MORE AND MORE SHOWS. WE KEEP PUSHING OFF THAT SATURATION. BOORSTIN: AS YOU IMPROVE THE PRODUCT, ARE YOU GOING TO NEED TO RAISE THE PRICES AS YOU HAVE IN THE PAST? HASTINGS: WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS KEPT OUR BASE PRICE, $7.99. IT HAS BEEN EIGHT YEARS. WE HAVE MOVED THE HD AND THE UPPER TEARS BUT THE BASE TIER HAS STADIUM THE SAME PRICE FOR EIGHT YEARS. YOU GET ALL THE CONTENT. IT IS COMPLETELY UNLIMITED VIEWING. FORTT: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT DEVICES. HOW MUCH VOLATILITY IS THERE IN THE WAY PEOPLE ARE WATCHING, WHETHER IT IS ON THE COUCH WATCHING A BIG SCREEN TV OR WATCHING A MOBILE DEVICE, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT YOU CAN SAVE THE CONTENT AND VIEW IT OFFLINE? HASTINGS: THE OFFLINE VIEWING IS GREAT FOR AIRPLANES AND THOSE KIND OF SITUATIONS. MOST OF THE VIEWING IS STILL ON THE BIG SCREEN, ON THE TELEVISION. FORTT: THERE IS NOT A BIG SHIFT TOWARD MOBILE DEVICES? IT IS PRETTY STABLE MOST OF THE VIEWING IS ON TV? HASTINGS: IT HAS BEEN REMARKABLE OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS OF STREAMING, IT HAS BEEN ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THE VIEWING IS ON LARGE SCREEN TELEVISIONS, EITHER FROM YOUR XBOX OR PLAYSTATION OR DIRECTLY WITH THE SMART TV. BOORSTINS: IS THE SAME THING TRUE OVERSEAS OR ARE YOU SEEING DIFFERENT VIEWING HABITS IN INDIA? HASTINGS: IN ASIA, IT IS MUCH MORE MOBILE PHONE CENTRIC. BOORSTIN: DOES THAT CHANGE THE WAY YOU PROGRAM WHEN YOU EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE WATCHING ON THEIR PHONE AND NOT ON THEIR TELEVISION. HASTINGS: WHEN YOU GET USED TO WATCHING ON A MOBILE PHONE, YOU WATCH ALL KINDS OF CONTENT AND SPORTS ON A PHONE. YOU ADAPT TO THAT. WE ARE JUST DOING GREAT CONTENT AND IT IS AVAILABLE ON ANY SCREEN. FORTT: WHAT'S THE EFFECT OF 4K ON THE VOLUME OF CONSUMPTION? IF SOMEBODY HAS THAT BIG, RICH SCREEN, ARE THEY GOING TO WATCH MORE NETFLIX BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE 4K CONTENT THAN ELSEWHERE? HASTINGS: YOU PAID $1,000 FOR A NEW TELEVISION, YOU ARE GOING TO USE IT. YOU LOOK FOR THE SHOWS AND THE IMAGES. WITH THAT AND WITH HDR, WHICH HAS A COLOR INTENSITY. IT MAKES THE TV JUST POP. FORTT: SHOULD WE LOOK AT 4K TV SALES AS A LEADING INDICATOR AS FAR AS ENGAGEMENT IN NETFLIX? HASTINGS: ABSOLUTELY. 4K TRANSFORMS THE IN-HOME EXPERIENCE. THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG DRIVERS AND WITH MOBILE ON THE LOW END. QUINTANILLA: WE TALK A LOT ABOUT MACHINE LEARNING, ESPECIALLY AT THIS CONFERENCE. HOW MUCH BETTER NOW IS THE ALGORITHM AT HAVING A SUGGESTION FOR YOU THAN IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO? HASTINGS: YOU KNOW, IT IS HARD TO BE PRECISE ON IT, BUT IT FEELS A LOT BETTER. AND SOME OF THAT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE SHOWS THAT IT CAN CHOOSE FROM AND SOME OF THAT IS BECAUSE THE ALGORITHM ITSELF IS BETTER. AND LIKE LOTS OF COMPANIES, WE ARE INVESTING HEAVILY IN THOSE AREAS BECAUSE WE WANT IT TO BE YOU TURN ON NETFLIX AND THERE'S A ROW, THERE'S LIKE FOUR CHOICES, AND YOU JUST WANT TO WATCH THEM ALL. AND SO, TO GET TO THAT CONSISTENT VIEW IS WHERE WE ARE TARGETING. QUINTANILLA: I WONDER IF YOU EVER FIND YOURSELF WATCHING NETFLIX AT HOME AND SCROLLING THROUGH DOZENS AND DOZENS OF THINGS AND YOU DON'T WANT TO WATCH ANY OF THEM? HASTINGS: YOU KNOW, I HAVE OBSCURE TASTE. SO LIKE, I JUST WATCHED THIS SWEDISH MOVIE WE HAVE ON NETFLIX, FORCE MAJEURE. AND IT IS REALLY TRAGIC BECAUSE IT IS A FAMILY THEN AN AVALANCHE COMES AND THE DAD PANICS AND RUNS AWAY, LEAVING THE FAMILY TO DIE. WELL, THEN, THE AVALANCHE TURNS AND DOESN'T KILL THEM AND THEN THEY HAVE TO PIECE TOGETHER BACK THEIR MARRIAGE AFTER THIS DRAMATIC EVENT. SO YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE OBSCURE TASTE. BOORSTIN: NOT NECESSARILY A RECOMMENDATION. HASTINGS: FORCE MAJEURE, IT'S GREAT. BOORSTIN: NOW, OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS, YOU HAVE REALLY TRANSFORMED THE COMPANY IN DIFFERENT WAYS. WHAT IS GOING TO BE YOUR NEXT ACT? DO YOU NEED TO INVEST IN NEWS AND SPORTS AS SORT OF THE NEXT THING FOR NETFLIX? HASTINGS: YOU KNOW, NO PLANS ON NEWS AND SPORTS. THOSE ARE TOUGH BUSINESSES AND WE'VE GOT A LOT OF ROOM TO GROW IN MOVIES AND TV SHOWS. EXPANDING INTO STANDUP COMEDY. UNSCRIPTED. SO, WE ARE GOING TO REALLY FOCUS ON THAT ON A GLOBAL BASIS. BOORSTIN: BUT WHAT ABOUT GLOBALLY? IS THERE ANY WAY YOU INVEST IN, SAY, CRICKET RIGHTS IN INDIA OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF INTERNATIONAL SPORTS RIGHTS RATHER THAN BIDING FOR NFL RIGHTS HERE? HASTINGS: YOU KNOW, WE WOULD DO MOVIES ABOUT SPORTS. THAT WOULD BE A GOOD AREA FOR US. BUT IT IS THINGS YOU WANT TO REPEAT VIEW. IT'S THINGS THAT YOU DON'T ONLY WANT TO CONSUME ONCE. WHEREAS THE WARRIORS AND THE CAVALIERS ARE GOING UP AGAIN AND PEOPLE WILL BE INTENSE ON THAT AND THEN IT WON'T – YOU KNOW, AFTERWARDS, THERE IS NO AFTER VIEWING. WHEREAS OUR SHOWS, THERE REALLY IS. BOORSTIN: BUT AS AMAZON PRIME VIDEO TRIES TO RECREATE A LOT OF WHAT NETFLIX IS DOING, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THEM BUYING THOSE NFL RIGHTS FOR TEN GAMES NEXT SEASON? HASTINGS: WELL, THEY ARE SO SCARY. I MEAN, EVERYTHING AMAZON DOES IS JUST SO AMAZING. I MEAN, HOW ARE THEY DOING SO MANY DIFFERENT BUSINESS AREAS SO WELL? IT'S LIKE THEY ARE TRYING TO REPEAL THE BASIC LAWS OF BUSINESS OF LIMITED CAPABILITY. SO, WE ARE CONTINUING TO WATCH THEM AND BE IMPRESSED WITH THEM. AND THEY ARE HELPING TO GROW THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE THEY ARE INVESTING IN THE CONTENT. BOORSTIN: BUT ARE THEY SCARIER – ARE THEY YOUR BIGGEST THREAT? HASTINGS: THEY'RE AWFULLY SCARY, I WOULD SAY. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE THE BIGGEST, BUT THEY ARE AWFULLY SCARY. QUINTANILLA: IN TERMS OF STREAMING OPTIONS, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT, JON, SUBSCRIPTION FATIGUE FOR A LONG TIME. YOU THINK WE'VE TOPPED OUT ON THAT? ARE THERE TOO MANY OPTIONS TO STREAM RIGHT NOW? HASTINGS: NO, I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF NEW PROVIDERS LIKE, IN THE U.S., CBS ALL-ACCESS. AROUND THE WORLD THERE'S ALL KINDS OF NEW OPTIONS COMING UP THAT GIVE PEOPLE OPPORTUNITY. IT IS LIKE SAYING THERE ARE TOO MANY MOBILE PHONE APPS. YOU KNOW, THERE'S 100,000 BUT YOU PROBABLY ONLY PAY ATTENTION TO 30. BUT DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF THEM. SO, I THINK IT IS GREAT. FORTT: DO YOU THINK ABOUT LEVERAGING YOUR SUBSCRIBER BASE IN DIFFERENT WAYS? I MEAN, PEOPLE TALK ABOUT CREDIT CARDS ON FILE AS BEING AN ENORMOUSLY VALUABLE ASSET. AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF THEM. I MEAN, YOU COULD BOLT ON OTHER PEOPLE'S SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES THAT PERHAPS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH CONTENT. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT? HASTINGS: YOU KNOW, IF WE TRY TO OUT-AMAZON AMAZON, THEN THAT'S A LOSING BATTLE. SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS BE THE SPECIALTY PLAY. WE ARE TRYING TO BE STARBUCKS AND THEY ARE TRYING TO BE WALMART. SO, WE HAVE TO HAVE BRAND INTENSE LOVE AND FOCUS. AND WHAT THEY DO IS INCREDIBLE AT THEIR BREADTH. SO NO, WE WOULDN'T FOCUS ON THOSE THINGS. WE WOULD FOCUS ON HOW DO WE BE, REALLY, THE EMBODIMENT OF ENTERTAINMENT, AND JOY, AND MOVIES AND TV SHOWS. BOORSTIN: WHAT ABOUT INTERNATIONALLY? LAST JANUARY, YOU LAUNCHED IN 130 NEW MARKETS AT THE SAME TIME. WAS THAT TOO MUCH TO DO AT ONCE? HASTINGS: MAYBE, BUT IT WAS FUN. BOORSTIN: BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT SOME OF THE MARKETS YOU ARE REALLY PUSHING INTO NOW LIKE INDIA AND SOUTH KOREA, THEY ARE A LOT MORE COMPLICATED. IS IT HARDER? IS IT GOING TO REQUIRE MORE INVESTMENT IN EACH OF THESE NEW MARKETS TO MASTER THE LOCAL LANGUAGE CONTENT? HASTINGS: IT DEFINITELY IS MORE COMPLICATED FOR A U.S. COMPANY. BUT FOR AN INDIAN COMPANY, THEY FEEL FINE ABOUT IT. BOORSTIN: NO, BUT FOR YOU, IS THIS GOING TO BE A BIGGER BARRIER TO GROW TO THOSE MARKETS? HASTINGS: YEAH, I THINK SO. WE STILL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN. NOW, WE'VE DONE AWFULLY WELL IN LATIN AMERICA AND IN EUROPE AND, OF COURSE, IN NORTH AMERICA. SO, WE'VE LEARNED SOME THINGS. BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF ROOM TO GROW IN ASIA AND A LOT TO FIGURE OUT STILL. BOORSTIN: WHAT ABOUT CHINA? YOU ARE LICENSING TO CHINA. BUT ARE YOU STILL TRYING TO LAUNCH THERE OR IS THAT OFF THE TABLE? HASTINGS: I THINK THAT'S OFF THE TABLE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. QUINTANILLA: IS THE TREND TOWARD PRODUCING IN COUNTRY OR TRYING TO AMORTIZE YOUR COST – THE SAME PRODUCT ACROSS MANY COUNTRIES AND LANGUAGES? AND ALSO, IS THE TREND TOWARD HIGHER BUDGET – MARCO POLO-ISH TYPE THINGS – OR TRY TO KEEP THAT UNDER CONTROL? HASTINGS: NO, IT IS GOING BIG BUDGET, FOR SURE. BECAUSE AS WE GET A BIGGER DISTRIBUTION, WE CAN AFFORD MORE SPECTACULAR ENTERTAINMENT. WE HAVE A GERMAN SERIES, ""DARK,"" THAT IS COMING OUT IN A FEW MONTHS. THAT IS SCIENCE FICTION AND VERY, I THINK, WILL BE A BIG GLOBAL WINNER. OF COURSE, ""3%"" OUT OF BRAZIL HAS BEEN VERY POPULAR AROUND THE WORLD. SO, WE ARE DOING A NUMBER OF SHOWS OUTSIDE OF HOLLYWOOD AND WE'RE DOING A LOT OF SHOWS INSIDE OF THE HOLLYWOOD SYSTEM. FORTT: HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO HAVE A REALLY GOOD BATTING AVERAGE AND GOOD DATA BEHIND IT IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THOSE BIG BUDGET BETS? BECAUSE, I MEAN, A BUNCH OF THOSE WILL SINK A STUDIO. HASTINGS: YEAH, AND YOU KNOW, WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS I HOPE OUR HIT RATIO IS WAY TOO HIGH RIGHT NOW. SO, WE'VE CANCELLED VERY FEW SHOWS. BOORSTIN: BUT IT IS HARD WHEN YOU DON'T GIVE US RATINGS OR VIEWER NUMBERS. HASTINGS: WELL, YOU CAN TELL WHEN WE CANCEL A SHOW. SO, I'M ALWAYS PUSHING THE CONTENT TEAM, WE HAVE TO TAKE MORE RISK, YOU HAVE TO TRY MORE CRAZY THINGS, BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE A HIGHER CANCEL RATE OVERALL. BECAUSE THEN, WHAT YOU GET IS YOU GET SOME WINNERS THAT ARE JUST UNBELIEVABLE WINNERS LIKE ""13 REASONS WHY"" OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS HAS BEEN A BIG HIT FOR US. AND YOU KNOW, IT SURPRISED US TOO. I MEAN, IT WAS A GREAT SHOW, BUT WE DIDN'T REALIZE JUST HOW IT WOULD CATCH ON. FORTT: WHAT'S THE HIGH WATER MARK OF CRAZY? HASTINGS: THAT WOULD BE VERY FAR OUT. I DON'T KNOW. I WILL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT. BOORSTIN: BUT YOU DEFINE A SHOW NOT BY HOW MANY PEOPLE WATCH IT, BUT BY HOW MANY NEW SUBSCRIBERS YOU GET? HASTINGS: IT'S A MIX. MOSTLY, IT IS HOW MANY PEOPLE WATCH IT BECAUSE – BUT THOSE ARE VERY CONNECTED. QUINTANILLA: BUT YOU SAY YOU WERE SURPRISED AT ""13 REASONS."" HASTINGS: YEAH. QUINTANILLA: I MEAN, ARE YOU NOT – ARE YOU GREEN LIGHTING BY GUT? OR ARE YOU USING METRICS AND A.I., OSTENSIBLY TO – HASTINGS: WELL, FORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT MY GUT. IT'S TED SARANDOS, WHO HAS BEEN JUST BRILLIANT AT THIS AND HIS TEAM OF FINDING THINGS. AND THERE'S SOME ANALYSIS THAT GOES ON, BUT I WOULD SAY IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY A CREATIVE BET. AND THEN WE GET TO SEE IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME HOW IT WORKS. BOORSTIN: I HAVE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT NET NEUTRALITY. I KNOW YOU ARE A BIG ADVOCATE FOR NET NEUTRALITY. HASTINGS: YEAH. BOORSTIN: HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S AND HIS ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO CHANGE THE RULES? HASTINGS: YOU KNOW, WE WILL SEE IF THEY DO CHANGE THE RULES. THAT WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE, BUT IT IS PROBABLY GOING TO HAPPEN. AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE A BIG DEAL. I THINK THE PRINCIPLES OF NET NEUTRALITY ARE VERY WELL ACCEPTED BY ALL THE LARGE ISPs AROUND THE WORLD – NOT JUST IN THE U.S. AND IN MANY COUNTRIES, WE DON'T HAVE NET NEUTRALITY LAWS, BUT WE DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS EITHER. BOORSTIN: BUT WILL IT RAISE YOUR COSTS IF THE RULES ARE CHANGED? HASTINGS: I DON'T THINK SO. THAT WOULD BE VERY UNLIKELY. SO AGAIN, NET NEUTRALITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT, BUT I THINK BASICALLY THERE IS A CONSENSUS AMONGST ISPs AROUND THE WORLD TO FOLLOW THOSE RULES. AND SO, EVEN IN COUNTRIES WHERE THERE AREN'T LAWS, WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE PROBLEMS. FORTT: IF ANYBODY IN SILICON VALLEY SHOULD BE FREAKING OUT ABOUT TITLE 2 GOING AWAY, IT SHOULD BE YOU. SO, WHY IS EVERYBODY ELSE FREAKING OUT? IF YOU ARE SAYING, UH, PROBALBY NOT A BIG DEAL. AND I AM GUESSING YOU ARE SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOUR SUBSCRIBERS WOULD PITCH A FIT IF YOU TOLD THEM YOUR ISP IS GETTING INBETWEEN YOU AND YOUR ""HOUSE OF CARDS."" HASTINGS: YEAH, WE ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST SUPPLIERS OF STREAMING. AND SO, WE ARE PROBABLY RELATIVELY INSULATED. THE REAL IMPACT AROUND NET NEUTRALITY WOULD BE ON SMALL FIRMS, YOU KNOW, THE NETFLIX OF TEN YEARS AGO. SO, IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT, AGAIN, FOR THE SOCIETY. BUT I THINK EVEN IF THEY UNWIND THE TITLE TWO RULES, MY GUESS WOULD BE THAT THE NET NEUTRALITY PRINCIPLES ARE STILL FOLLOWED. BOORSTIN: WE ARE HEARING A LOT ABOUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HERE AT THE CODE CONFERENCE. ARE THERE ANY OTHER ISSUES THAT YOU ARE WATCHING OR ARE CONCERNED ABOUT, SUCH AS IMMIGRATION? HASTINGS: YOU KNOW, THERE ARE MANY ISSUES GOING ON, BUT FOR THE MOST PART WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE ENTERTAINMENT SIDE OF IT. THE ""HOUSE OF CARDS"" ASPECT. GIVE PEOPLE A LITTLE RELIEF FROM ALL OF THE STRESS. FORTT: IS IT HARDER TO FIND STORY LINES IN POLITICS THAT ARE UNREASONABLE OR ENTERTAINING ENOUGH THAT YOU AREN'T WRITING THEM DOWN? HASTINGS: YEAH, SEE, I THINK YOU COULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED THE CURRENT SITUATION. BOORSTIN: WELL, DO YOU SEE VIEWING HABITS CHANGING IN LIGHT OF THE POLITICAL CLIMATE? ARE PEOPLE TRYING TO WATCH DIFFERENT KINDS OF SHOWS AS A RESULT OF IT? HASTINGS: NO, AND REMEMBER WE ARE VERY GLOBAL. SO, WE ARE ABOUT 50% OF THE MEMBERS ARE INTERNATIONAL. AND SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. SO, NO BIG CHANGE ON ENTERTAINMENT. IT IS REALLY DRIVEN BY THE INTERNET AND THE EXPANSION OF STREAMING. BOORSTIN: LAST TIME WE SPOKE, YOU SAID YOU WERE MOST EXCITED ABOUT ""THE CROWN."" WHAT'S THE SHOW YOU ARE MOST EXCITED ABOUT NOW AND THAT YOU THINK COULD HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT ON NETFLIX? HASTINGS: BIGGEST IMPACT ON NETFLIX. ""GLOW."" IT IS A FOLLOW-ON FROM JENJI TO ""ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK."" IT'S A SET OF WOMEN WRESTLERS FROM THE 1970s. AND IT IS BOTH SPOOF AND FUNNY. AND THAT WILL BE COMING OUT A FEW WEEKS AFTER ""ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK."" QUINTANILLA: HAVE PEOPLE COME TO TERMS WITH ADAM SANDLER'S SUCCESS ON NETFLIX? HASTINGS: THEY HAVE. QUINTANILLA: I MEAN, IT'S MONSTROUS. HASTINGS: AND THEN ADAM SANDLER WON GREAT CRITICAL AWARDS IN THE REPORT AT THE CANNES FILM FESTIVAL AS TALENT. SO, HE IS SO VERSATILE. PEOPLE WANT TO BOX HIM IN AND THINK HE IS JUST A CERTAIN GUY. AND HE IS MUCH BROADER THAN THAT AND REALLY ENTERTAINING. QUINTANILLA: BUT WHAT MADE – I GUESS TED, ONCE AGAIN, RIGHT? SORT OF GOING WITH CASTING OFF TYPE IN A WAY, RIGHT? HASTINGS: TED ""GENIUS"" SARANDOS. THAT'S RIGHT. QUINTANILLA: IS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU WHETHER OR NOT A FILM IS ABLE TO BE CONSIDERED AT CANNES? THAT WAS A BIT OF A CONTROVERSY GOING INTO THIS LAST FILM FESTIVAL. HASTINGS: SURE. I MEAN, LOOK, THE ESTABLISHMENT OFTEN CLOSES RANK AGAINST THE INSURGENT. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT DYNAMIC AND FRANKLY WE PLAY IT FOR ALL ITS WORTH. IT IS A GREAT SYSTEM FOR US TO GET THESE FILMS OUT. OCHA WAS FEATURED AT THE CANNES FILM FESTIVAL. IT IS COMING OUT IN A MONTH. IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY FILM FROM A WELL-KNOWN KOREAN DIRECTOR. AND I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF FILMS THAT YOU SEE THIS YEAR. THANK YOU SO MUCH. BOORSTIN: ALRIGHT, WELL WE KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO ON STAGE NOW. REED HASTINGS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

",CNBC Transcript: Netflix Founder and CEO Reed Hastings Speaks with CNBC’s Julia Boorstin on “Squawk Alley” Today from the Code Conference
Adam Levy,06012017,Fool,05252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) saw its online sales growth fall into single digits last year before it decided to actually do something about it. When Wal-Mart reported just 7% growth in e-commerce sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the backlash may have been the impetus it needed to start making major e-commerce acquisitions like Jet.com. That move brought on Marc Lore, a serial digital entrepreneur, to head up Wal-Mart's e-commerce business. It seems the moves are starting to pay off. Lore has made several major moves, and Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales grew a whopping 63% in the first quarter of 2018. What's more, CEO Doug McMillon says that most of that sales growth stems from Walmart.com, not the string of acquisitions it's made over the last year or so. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart made an aggressive move at the beginning of the year, offering free two-day shipping on select items for orders over $35. The company did away with its previous shipping program, ShippingPass, which competed directly with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime. Wal-Mart's free shipping is available on over 2 million items. That's well short of Amazon's 50 million Prime-eligible items. Still, Wal-Mart is betting that it has a wide enough selection to fulfill most customers' needs. The second move Wal-Mart made was to offer discounts on certain items shipped to a nearby store. If Wal-Mart wants to successfully compete with Amazon it needs to use its physical stores. That strategy could be particularly valuable for big-ticket items where shipping the last mile is often costly due to weight, and customers can save a noticeable amount of money. The selection of items on Walmart.com has grown from 10 million at this time last year to 50 million today. The growth stems largely from third-party sellers on Wal-Mart's platform. Third-party sales account for the difference in gross merchandise value(GMV)  growth and sales. Last quarter, GMV grew 69% and sales grew just 63%. Those numbers indicate third-party sales continue to increase their share of sales on Walmart.com. Third-party sales don't generate as much revenue, but Wal-Mart could generate higher profit margins from each sale since it doesn't have to handle inventory or shipping. Amazon, likewise, has seen a lot of growth from third-party merchants recently. Its Fulfillment by Amazon service takes the traditional marketplace one step further by allowing merchants to store products at Amazon's warehouses and take advantage of Amazon's shipping. That's how Amazon quickly grew the number of Prime-eligible items to 50 million. Considering Wal-Mart also has a large fulfillment network, it may consider copying Amazon's strategy. As mentioned above, McMillon said the majority of Wal-Mart's e-commerce growth is organic. Moreover, he said the ""plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success."" So, if Walmart.com is growing fine on its own, why does it need to make so many acquisitions? McMillon stated, ""The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up."" Acquisitions like Modcloth and Moosejaw give Walmart immediate expertise in some high-margin categories. Wal-Mart is historically associated with low quality and low margins. Snatching up some high-end properties could help it sell higher-quality products with higher margins. That said, all of its acquisitions follow a similar pattern: It's buying up young brands at a discount after they've struggled to raise more funding due to slowing sales. By their nature, Wal-Mart shouldn't expect significant growth to come from the acquisitions after they've been incorporated into its e-commerce revenue. Considering the size of Walmart.com, they'll hardly move the needle for Wal-Mart, and Wal-Mart's brand may still hold it back from incorporating higher-priced and higher-margin items on its main website. So, if Walmart.com is growing so well, why bother spending investors' money on e-commerce acquisitions? Overall, it was a great quarter for Wal-Mart's online business, but the company's acquisition strategy is still puzzling. ","
      
    Wal-Mart's Online Sales Just Exploded -- The Motley Fool

Travis Hoium,06012017,Fool,05252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Big-box retailers like Target (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are some of the most affected by the changing retail landscape, highlighted by Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) growing dominance in e-commerce. But there's still value in brick-and-mortar retail stores if companies can figure out how to bring value to customers while augmenting their online purchases. Rumors that Target would buy Casper earlier this month were strange for a company that's never been a mattress company. Instead of buying Casper, it led the company's funding round. When you look at it through the lens of customers moving to online retail and going direct to brands and manufacturers -- like Casper -- the deal could make some sense and be a blueprint for the future. In one move, Target could create a showroom for Casper while also benefiting from the company's online business model. And with some other interesting partnerships starting to pay dividends, we may see Target making an important change in its business model. Image source: Getty Images. There's no question Amazon is a disruptive force in retail and Target and Wal-Mart need to adapt with more online offerings for customers to compete. But I don't think Amazon is the real threat to the big-box model long-term. I wrote earlier this year that brand companies are now finding it easier to launch and thrive in a direct-to-consumer model and retailers who are trying to keep sales in-store are struggling as a result. And for these direct-to-consumer companies, Amazon isn't their path to consumers; they go directly to the source. Think of companies like Dollar Shave Club, Blue Apron, Casper, Harry's, and Bevel, just to name a few. Rather than fight the direct-to-consumer trend, Target appears to be embracing it. The company has partnered with Bevel and Harry's in men's grooming, and they appear to be very successful partnerships so far. The brand companies get a foot into retail, expanding their market very quickly, and Target gets new, hip products and sometimes a stake in their potential upside. Target has said that it's going to invest more than $7 billion in capital over the next three years and focus its growth efforts on over a dozen exclusive brands. If Target can become the exclusive retailer for both internally owned brands and companies it has a stake in, that could be a great way to leverage the company's retail footprint and still not miss out on the direct-to-consumer and online retail trends. Target has had its fair share of challenges adapting to the new world of retail, mainly in making missteps with its own online store (which is still behind the competition). If Target can improve stores to match consumers' shopping needs, partner or buy growing exclusive brands that sell online and can showroom in existing stores, and improve its online shopping experience, it could be a good proposition for customers and investors. Target still has a place in the world, whether it's parents urgently needing diapers or those who want to grab some toiletries and a Starbucks coffee on their way to work. And understanding where the company fits as a provider of necessities and a showroom for brands would be a welcome change for the retailer. Whether consumers are shopping in-store or online, Target should just want them buying products it's providing or has a stake in. And buying into brand start-ups may be a great way to leverage the big-box business and finally create a future in a retail world Amazon seems to be dominating more by the day. ","

Shares of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:WFM) aren't looking as fresh as they once were. The one-time stock market darling is still trading down nearly 50% from its 2013 peak, and much of the recent news has been negative. The organic grocer reported its seventh straight quarter of declining comparable sales last month and expects same-store sales to fall for the full year. Profits for the year are also expected to drop. Image source: Whole Foods. It's clear what's going on. Traditional supermarket chains including Kroger (NYSE:KR), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), and Costco have horned in on Whole Foods' traditional strength: organic and natural foods. Kroger's Simple Truth brand, which launched in 2012, reached $1 billion in sales in just two years, and the company now has more than $10 billion in annual sales of organic and natural products. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has been devoting more space to selling fresh food such as produce and has been aggressively lowering prices, and Costco is the nation's largest seller of organic food, according to some metrics. Whole Foods has struggled to respond to this renewed competition, despite a change in its management structure and efforts to lower prices, launch a loyalty program, and open a new discount banner, Whole Foods 365. While some investors, such as activist hedge fund Jana Partners, seem to think Whole Foods offers opportunity after the recent stock slide, there are reasons to think its performance will continue to be challenged. It's not only entrenched players that are on the move in the grocery space. While Wal-Mart's efforts to expand its online grocery-pickup program to nearly 1,000 stores is winning plaudits from customers, new competitors are also jumping into the giant $800 billion U.S grocery market. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is accelerating its grocery ambitions, too. It expanded its Amazon Fresh delivery service to a number of new cities last year, is testing the cashier-less Amazon Go convenience-store concept, and just made its first two Amazon Fresh Pickup locations open to the public. Amazon has already upended a number of retail sectors and is focused on penetrating the grocery market. Expect increasing investments from the e-commerce giant. Another entrant expected to threaten a swath of the industry is German grocery giant Lidl, which will open its first stores in the U.S. in June. Lidl has already squeezed Wal-Mart subsidiary Asda in the U.K. and plans to open as many as 600 stores in the United States.  Known for rock-bottom prices, Lidl isn't a direct competitor of Whole Foods, but it's likely to put more price pressure on the industry, which could carry over to Whole Foods. Ten years ago, Whole Foods was dominating the organic-food sector it pioneered, posting double-digit comparable-sales growth. The company's brand and unique approach to groceries gave it a competitive advantage, allowing it to charge higher prices and reap a higher margin. But the mainstreaming of organic food brought increased competition from traditional grocers, alternative concepts such as Trader Joe's, and farmers' markets and community-supported agriculture programs. Whole Foods still has an edge in gourmet, specialty, and prepared foods that its customers seek out, but when it comes to organic produce and other such goods that used to set Whole Foods apart, that difference no longer exists. The advantage it once had isn't coming back. Despite Whole Foods' manifest challenges, the stock is still overpriced compared with its peers. Whole Foods trades at a P/E ratio of 28 today, and that value is likely to expand as profits decline. Kroger, meanwhile, carries a P/E of 15; Wal-Mart trades at a P/E of 18, and Supervalu has a P/E of just 10. While its traditionally higher margin may be some justification for the premium, investors seem to be betting on Jana Partners' ability to engineer a sale or a turnaround in the business. With a market cap of $11 billion, Whole Foods won't have an easy time finding a buyer, and sales continue to decline despite a number of initiatives to turn around the business. Considering the stock's valuation and the company's problems, the stock is likely to head lower. ","
      
    Here's Why the Worst Is Yet to Come for Whole Foods Market, Inc. -- The Motley Fool

Jeremy Bowman,06012017,Fool,05252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Perhaps no publicly traded company is more culturally at odds with Wall Street than Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY). The online crafts fair hosts thousands of artisans selling quirky products like portraits made out of gummy bears, creepy puppets, and a vial of dead bees.  It's a progressive-minded B corporation, and its headquarters are a hipster haven with monthly craft classes, free snacks, a printmaking studio, a community loom, and beautiful rooftop views of Downtown Manhattan. Image source: Etsy. Ironically, just across the water from Etsy's offices is the embodiment of the polar opposite of the company's communitarian, anti-corporate embrace of commerce -- and Wall Street sees opportunity in its new neighbor. Just two years after Etsy's IPO, activist investors are already coming after the crafty online marketplace, claiming costs are bloated and looking to turn a quirky, hand-crafted machine into a well-oiled, cash-generating one. Etsy stock has traded below its $16 IPO price for most of that two-year history, and while the company continues to put up impressive sales growth -- revenue increased 33.4% last year -- the company is still not profitable on a GAAP basis. With a sagging stock price, bloated corporate expenses, and a unique brand, it's no surprise that Wall Street has pounced on the stock. Etsy stock spiked 22% the day news broke that two activist hedge funds, TPG Capital and Dragoneer, had taken stakes in the fourth most visited e-commerce site. Those moves followed an announcement on May 2 by Black-and-White Capital, which disclosed a stake in the company and said it would push for a sale. TPG, which took a 4.3% stake in Etsy and also holds positions in Airbnb and Spotify, said it seeks to ""engage in discussions regarding strategic alternatives,"" adding, ""Etsy is a unique company whose success derives from the creativity and commitment of its community."" Etsy CEO Josh Silverman responded to the activists by saying the company is ""focused on the most value-enhancing near- and long-term opportunities. We will prudently invest in areas that deliver the greatest returns."" He also touted the strength of the Etsy model, saying that it's created a strong technology platform and cultivated powerful loyalty. General and administrative expenses, or the cost of management and other corporate employees, rose 25% last year to $86 million. While that was slower than the company's revenue growth, it still accounted for nearly a quarter of the company's revenue last year. That's a greater percentage than the company spends on marketing or product development, two components that seem more closely tied to the business' performance. At EBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), the largest pure-play online marketplace, just about 10% of revenue is devoted to general and administrative expenses, while more than a quarter of revenue is spent on sales and marketing. At Latin American marketplace MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), G&A expenses made up slightly more than 10% of revenue. Etsy may be able to learn something from those peers, both of whom are handily profitable, and Etsy's marketplace model should lead to the same profitability. At its simplest, the business model allows the company to collect commissions from sales on its website with little to do other than ensure the functionality of the site and market it. But there are signs the company is already heeding activist calls. Following the advice of Seth Wunder of Black-and-White Capital, Etsy fired former CEO Chad Dickerson and laid off 80 employees, or about 8% of its staff. Pushing for a sale could be the next step if they can't drive significant profits. Whether they would be able to find a buyer is an open question, but the most willing partner could be Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), fresh off a string of e-commerce acquisitions, including Jet.com for $3.3 billion, ShoeBuy, ModCloth, and Moosejaw. Such a tie-up with the retail behemoth would likely be anathema to Etsy loyalists, but the company is at the mercy of shareholders. Whether or not a sale takes place, the stock should be better off for the activist input. Laying off staff, especially those in roles with little effect on the underlying business who perform tasks such as tracking office waste, is the right thing to do. Etsy's brand is strong and sales on the site continue to grow. With some cost-cutting and more efficient management, the business should eventually turn profitable.   ","

Penney’s ‘smart’ B2B push into hotels is an encouraging sign for investors While Amazon offers everything with free two-day shipping, other retailers still charge for bulky items. That means, it might not be the cost of the item but the cost to have it delivered that is prohibitive. “Buy-online-pickup-in-store in general has really taken off in the marketplace,” said Jim Prewitt, vice president of retail industry strategy at JDA Software, a retail and supply chain software company. He highlighted the “barriers” around delivering items that are large or fragile. “For a company like Best Buy to offer a full range of products online, to offer them with in-store pickup is also a benefit.” And once a big appliance, like a washer and dryer, is in your home, most people don’t want to have to deal with a return.

Crew at risk - and it’s not all Amazon’s fault “There’s a factor of convenience, being able to see the product you’re buying and get one last chance to see if it’s what you want before you walk out. Perhaps talk to a salesperson and find out if you need a different cable or a stand,” said Stefan Weitz, chief strategy officer at Radial, a retail technology provider. Weitz warns against stores “bombarding” customers as they come in for a pickup in an attempt to generate an upsell. However, it’s an opportunity to have a “high-touch, high-value interaction,” no matter how brief, that will be useful to the customer. Even with the pickup advantage, Wedbush is sticking with its underperform rating on Best Buy shares. Wedbush’s price target is $29, about 48% below its current trading level. “Cost cuts and share repurchases have masked continuing revenue declines, but we expect comp declines to persist due to a lack of compelling new products while the possibility of heightened competition is a constant threat to gross margin,” analysts wrote in a Monday note. “With declining revenues and fewer cost cuts going forward, Best Buy has few levers other than buybacks to drive EPS growth in fiscal year 2018.” SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said the company had a lot of hurdles in the first quarter, including the delayed tax refund and pressure from the HHGregg Inc.

,06082017,Reuters,06012017,"Marc Lore, head of Wal-Mart’s e-commerce operations, said in a blog post on Thursday the step will cut shipping costs, speed the delivery of packages and allow workers to earn additional compensation. Wal-Mart’s stores are within 10 miles (16 km) of 90 percent of the U.S. population, Lore said. “Imagine all the routes our associates drive to and fro from work and the houses they pass along the way. It’s easy to see why this test could be a game changer,” he said. Since he joined in August, Lore has helped spearhead some aggressive moves intended to boost the retailer’s online business. Wal-Mart completed its $3 billion acquisition of Lore’s former company, internet retailer Jet.com, in September. Lore has overseen Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of three online retailers and made other e-commerce changes. Wal-Mart now offers free two-day shipping on online orders above $35, without any membership fees, to compete with Amazon’s popular Prime shipping program. Wal-Mart said on Thursday its trucks deliver packages to a retail location for store pickup and the same trucks can bring additional orders a worker can sign up to deliver. The delivery program is voluntary for store workers and allows them to sign up for a maximum of 10 deliveries a day. The retailer did not share details on compensation of workers who sign up. The test is limited to three stores in New Jersey and Arkansas. Wal-Mart will hold its annual shareholder meeting on Friday in Arkansas.

,06082017,Reuters,06012017,"FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc executives on Friday reassured workers they remained integral to the company’s success as they highlighted investments in online sales and other technology to compete with rivals like Amazon.com Inc. Wal-Mart is successfully using e-commerce to boost sales but does not want to alienate workers who have helped drive gains with improved customer service and higher morale following a rise in base pay to $10 an hour. “We will compete with technology, but win with people,” Chief Executive Doug McMillon said at Wal-Mart’s annual shareholder meeting where all the company’s board member nominations were approved. “We will be people-led and tech-empowered.” The nod to store employees and the retail workforce was a departure from past years when the company focused shareholder presentations on the technology it was adopting to close the online gap with Amazon and beat other competitors. The shift followed complaints by labor groups that Wal-Mart had to do more for workers, despite the company’s $2.7 billion investment in employee training and wages in 2015 and the 2016 wage increase to $10. McMillon’s comments capped a three-day media event during which the company announced initiatives like a test program that allows store workers to deliver packages ordered on the retailer’s website and the use of blockchain technology to ensure safety in its food supply chain. Wal-Mart’s investments in technology helped deliver a 63 percent rise in first quarter online sales, up from 29 percent growth in the fourth quarter and 20 percent in the third quarter. Its results have also outshined rivals like Target Corp, department-store chains and apparel retailers. The shareholders meeting at the Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Arkansas, 30 miles from the company’s headquarters in Bentonville, was packed with 14,000 people, including workers from around 27 countries and shareholders. The company tapped Blake Shelton to host the show which included pop stars like Gwen Stefani, Mary J. Blige and Rachel Platten. Wal-Mart’s shareholders approved all 11 company-recommended board members and voted in-line with company wishes. None of the four shareholder proposals put forward were approved. One from Making Change at Wal-Mart, part of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, called for an independent chairman to act in the interests of Wal-Mart’s hourly workers. “How can any Wal-Mart associate build a better life when they have been with the company for five years or more and they make $9 or $10 an hour,” said Amy Ritter from the labor group, who presented the proposal. For years, influential proxy advisory firms have recommended shareholders vote in favor of an independent board chairman without ties to management or the founding family, ever since bribery allegations several years ago exposed serious board oversight failures. About 51 percent of Wal-Mart’s stock is controlled by the Walton family and current Chairman of the Board Greg Penner is married to the grandaughter of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton. ","

Britain’s general election as it maps its exit from the European Union, the European Central Bank’s policy meeting and former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony before a Senate panel could all affect investor sentiment. Comey was investigating whether Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia colluded to sway the 2016 U.S. election when he was fired by Trump in May. His testimony could dampen already flagging momentum for the U.S. President’s agenda of rolling back regulations and overhauling the tax code. British Prime Minister Theresa May could increase her parliamentary majority, an opinion poll showed on Tuesday, shortly after another survey suggested the race with the opposition Labour Party was neck-and-neck.

,06082017,Reuters,06012017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg submitted a statement to the United Nations on Monday that over 1,000 U.S. governors, mayors, businesses, universities and others will continue to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement abandoned by President Donald Trump last week. Bloomberg, who is the U.N. Secretary-General’s special envoy for Cities and Climate Change, submitted the “We Are Still In” declaration to U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. He also launched a process to work with local governments and non-state entities to formally quantify the combined - and overlapping - emissions reduction pledges, which will be known as “America’s Pledge,” and submit the report to the United Nations. “Today, on behalf of an unprecedented collection of U.S. cities, states, businesses and other organizations, I am communicating to the United Nations and the global community that American society remains committed to achieving the emission reductions we pledged to make in Paris in 2015,”  Bloomberg said in a statement. Signatories to the new initiative include 13 Democratic and Republican governors, 19 state attorneys general, over 200 mayors, and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and small businesses. Trump on Thursday pulled the United States from the landmark 2015 agreement designed to fight climate change, fulfilling a major campaign pledge despite entreaties from U.S. allies and corporate leaders. Although the formal process to withdraw from the Paris agreement takes four years, Trump said the United States will not honor the pledge the Obama administration submitted, known as the nationally determined contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by the year 2025. To fill the void, “America’s Pledge” will be submitted to the UNFCCC as a “Societal NDC.” “The UNFCCC welcomes the determination and commitment from such a wealth and array of cities, states, businesses and other groups in the United States to fast forward climate action and emissions reductions in support of the Paris Climate Change Agreement,” said Espinosa. The coalition will align a number of different efforts to show U.S. support for the Paris agreement, including a commitment of over 260 corporations including Kellogg , Pepsi Co. and Walmart  to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in line with the latest science. Thirteen governors have also pledged to continue to honor the Paris pledges. “It will be up to the American people to step forward-and in Virginia we are doing just that,” said Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.

For the fifth year in a row, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT), a company with an outsized physical store presence, has taken the top spot in Fortune magazine's ranking of the top 500 companies. The Arkansas-based company, which is also the world's largest retailer, reported revenue of $485.8 billion last year. That figure is more than double the $223.6 billion revenue of second-place company on the list, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-A). With reported revenue of $215.6 billion, tech behemoth Apple Inc. (AAPL) rounded out the top three. Energy giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) dropped two places from last year to the fourth position, and pharma company McKesson Corporation (MCK) placed fifth. (See also: Fact Sheet: What Is the Fortune 500 List?) In recent years, investor sentiment has turned bearish toward Wal-Mart's future growth largely because the company has been slow on the uptake as far as e-commerce is concerned. However, an outsized revenue is not a guarantee of overall profits. On an overall basis, Wal-Mart ranked 11th in profits. The top spot in that category was taken by Apple, which reported profits of $45.7 billion. (See also: Wal-Mart to Consolidate Buying Operations.) Healthcare and pharma firms accounted for three of the top 10 largest companies in America, according to Fortune. Meanwhile, General Motors Company (GM) and Ford Motor Company (F) represented the automotive sector on the list. The tech sector, which has powered much of the S&P 500's growth this year, had only one company – Apple – within the top ten. In a display of the margins and efficiency that are possible within the tech sector, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) joined Apple among the top five most profitable companies. (See also: The Tech Bubble Will Burst: The Question Is When.) A change in the presidential administration has also brought about a change in priorities for Fortune 500 companies. According to a survey conducted by the publication, the rapid pace of tech innovation has displaced the threat of increased regulation as the most pressing concern for American CEOs.

(WMT) is already the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer and its internet ambitions in taking on its digital nemesis, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), have captured the imagination of Wall Street (For more, see also: Walmart E-Commerce Intimidating Amazon.) But investors should keep an eye on a pair of other threats that are moving in on the retail giant's turf. German discount retailers Lidl and Aldi are expanding and upgrading their respective footprints in the U.S. Privately held supermarket operator Lidl is poised to open its first stores stateside this month, according to an article in Bloomberg. German discounter Aldi, which opened its first U.S. stores four decades ago, is spending $1.6 billion to upgrade and expand its 1300 stores and add 650 new locations, according to the Wall Street Journal. And as the Bloomberg story points out, Walmart's U.K. grocery arm, Asda, has lost market share and sales to the German rivals. It adds that Asda has been the worst performing of the U.K.'s four largest supermarket chains.  In fact, Asda sales have been sliding for more than three years according to Kantar Retail in the WSJ story. It also notes that Aldi and Lidl have a 12% share of the U.K. market, eating the lunch of other grocers who are seeing sales and their shares sliding. Meanwhile back stateside, food prices have been falling and eating into grocery earnings for the past year and a half, the Journal states that's the longest drop in retail food price declines in six decades. American grocery giant Kroger had its first decline in quarterly same-store sales in 13 years and Publix Super Markets recently posted its first sales drop since the recession, per the WSJ. In other words, cutting prices has consequences in the long run, cutting revenue and pressuring margins (For more, see also: Why Walmart's Growth Is No Longer a Given.) Still Walmart may have to cut grocery prices more to compete, at least initially, with the German imports. One area where Walmart, and Amazon, may have an advantage is the omnichannel opportunity presented by its online platform to order groceries for kiosk pickup. They could also offer specialty or gourmet products that the discounters don't, and Bloomberg adds that pharmacy and financial product businesses may help differentiate Walmart from its rivals. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told the Wall Street Journal that the company's prepared to face off with high-powered, low-price grocers; it's fine-tuning Walmart-brand offerings, cutting some prices, and making sure the customer experience is smooth with faster checkout lines. The article also notes Walmart is testing a system allowing shoppers to scan products with their smartphones to avoid the registers. And it's worth noting as the story points out, Aldi has been in the U.S. for more than 40 years but still only has a 1% market share. So investors should keep an eye on just how much the German rivals affect Walmart's pricing in the store aisles while the retail kingpin battles Amazon in cyberspace.

Courtney Reagan,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"Walmart.com and Jet.com shoppers in three U.S. cities now have a new delivery person, and it's not employees of one of the major shipping companies like FedEx or UPS or a delivery start-up like Instacart or Deliv. It's a Wal-Mart store employee. ""Unlike crowdsourced delivery, where the driver has to travel (often out of the way) to pick up the package, then drive the full distance to deliver it, our associates are starting at the same place as the packages,"" said Marc Lore, president and CEO of Walmart eCommerce U.S., in a blog post for the retailer. It all works through a proprietary app the retailer built for this test. The app matches online order delivery addresses with employees' driving routes home from work, built to minimize any more driving than what the employee would do anyway to get home. Delivering is completely voluntary, and the employees can choose when they want to deliver, how many packages they can take and what size. ""Once they're done working at the store for the day, they pick up the packages from the backroom, load them into their vehicle, enter the delivery addresses into the GPS on their phone and head towards home,"" Lore said. Wal-Mart compensates the employees for it but declined to elaborate how it works. The discount retailer said the test has only been in progress for a month but so far ""hundreds"" of deliveries have been completed in two locations in New Jersey and one in Arkansas. So far, ""the response from associates and customers has been great,"" Lore said. Its locations and labor — some 4,700 U.S. stores with 1.3 million employees — are quite an asset that Lore has been working on further integrating with its digital operations. The retailer says 90 percent of the country's population live within 10 miles of a Walmart store. While the retailer does not provide a delivery cost breakdown, it's the last leg — commonly referred to as the ""last mile"" — that is the most expensive when it comes to fulfilling and shipping online orders. Consultant group McKinsey & Company estimates ""the last mile"" can sometimes be more than half of an item's total delivery cost. Last month, Wal-Mart Stores said it would offer shoppers a discount for 10,000 online-only orders that are picked up by shoppers in store rather than delivered to their homes. The discount, Marc Lore said, is ""meant to be equivalent to what the last-mile delivery costs are,"" which in most cases averages to about a 4 percent discount per item.The store pickup option saves Wal-Mart delivery costs, which it passes on to shoppers in the form of discounts, but the new employees-as-delivery-service test does not offer shoppers a discount. Wal-Mart said the benefit is that most orders are delivered the next day. ",Wal-Mart employees can now also deliver your online orders
Rachel Abrams,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"A report released Thursday by a workers' advocacy group says Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, routinely refuses to accept doctors' notes, penalizes workers who need to take care of a sick family member and otherwise punishes employees for lawful absences. The report, based on a survey of more than 1,000 employees, accuses Walmart of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act, among other worker-protection laws. The group argued in a lawsuit filed last month, and in an earlier complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that Walmart discriminated against pregnant workers. ""Walmart should fully comply with the law so that no one is illegally punished for a disability-related absence or for taking care of themselves or a loved one with a serious medical condition,"" said Dina Bakst, a founder and president of A Better Balance, the advocacy group that prepared the report. More from The New York Times:  How Twitter Is Being Gamed to Feed MisinformationAirbnb Is Popular, but Renting Out Your Car? That's Another StoryUber Says It Just Noticed Error on Pay, but It Was No Secret Walmart said that it had not reviewed the report but disputed the group's conclusions, and said that the company's attendance policies helped make sure that there were enough employees to help customers while protecting workers from regularly covering others' duties. ""We understand that associates may have to miss work on occasion, and we have processes in place to assist them,"" Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Walmart, said. The company reviews each employee's circumstances individually, he said, ""in compliance with company policy and the law."" Katie Orzehowski says her miscarriage last fall almost cost her a job. A cashier at the Walmart in North Huntingdon, Pa., Ms. Orzehowski said she tried to use doctors' notes and hospitalization records to excuse her missed shifts, to no avail. Worried that another absence would get her fired, she went back to work. ""I still had a lot of bleeding going on, and that's embarrassing,"" Ms. Orzehowski, 26, said. Her account is one of dozens included in the report, which clashes with the company's recent efforts to project a more worker-friendly image. Walmart has long been known for its penny-pinching attention to detail and its opposition to organized labor. But in the past couple of years, the company has announced that it would raise its minimum wage to $10 an hour and has pledged to invest heavily in training and paying workers. Workers' advocates have expressed skepticism about the retailer's commitment to improving the lives of its more than one million employees. Around the same time that Walmart lifted wages, it cut merit raises and introduced a training program that could keep hourly pay at $9 an hour for up to 18 months. In November, A Better Balance filed a complaint with the employment commission on behalf of Arleja Stevens, a Walmart employee who said she was fired after missing too many shifts because of complications from her pregnancy. In that filing, the group accused Walmart of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The employment commission is investigating the accusation, Ms. Bakst said. Mr. Hargrove said the company disagreed with Ms. Stevens's claims. A Better Balance also participated in a separate lawsuit last month alleging that Walmart discriminated against pregnant employees The company has disputed the claims of the two women at the center of the suit. A Better Balance wrote the survey questions used for Thursday's report. The questions asked employees whether they believed that Walmart had a problem of regularly punishing people for absences relating to an illness or disability, and about how the company treated absences. The group worked with the labor group OUR Walmart, which promoted the survey to workers who listed Walmart as their employer on Facebook, according to Andrea Dehlendorf, a director of OUR Walmart. ""Although this system is supposed to be 'neutral' and punish all absences equally, along the lines of a 'three-strikes-and-you're-out' policy, in reality, such a system is brutally unfair,"" the report says of Walmart's absence-control policy. ""It punishes workers for things they cannot control and disproportionately harms the most vulnerable workers."" Walmart assigns disciplinary points for unexcused absences and other infractions. Nine points in a six-month period can result in an employee's being fired, according to a copy of the company's absence policy reviewed by The New York Times. New employees may be fired for accruing four points in their first six months. While Walmart has written guidelines for how managers and supervisors should respond to employees who need help because of medical issues, those policies are not always followed, according to the report. ""They just straight up tell you, 'We don't accept excuses,'"" said Ms. Orzehowski, who still works for the company. In a follow-up email, Mr. Hargrove said that the company did ""not have any information that would support that Ms. Orzehowski advised us of a medical reason for her absences."" ""If that were the case, she could have used those medical records to apply for a leave or accommodation,"" he said. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires businesses with 15 or more employees to make reasonable accommodations for disabled workers. In 2008, the definition of a disabled worker was expanded, to include temporary medical conditions like complications relating to a pregnancy. The Family and Medical Leave Act protects eligible workers — those who have been employed for 12 months at a company with 50 or more employees — who need to take time off to care for themselves or a family member. Under the A.D.A., employers must work with employees to determine if workers are eligible for such accommodations. Dismissing doctors' notes or otherwise refusing to consider the reason for a worker's absence could potentially be ""skirting the analysis"" in which employers are required to engage, according to Michelle Caiola, the director of litigation for Disability Rights Advocates, a nonprofit group, and a former senior trial lawyer for the E.E.O.C., which enforces federal worker protections. ""A company as big as Walmart, it's surprising that they don't have the appropriate training for the personnel that would be overseeing these sorts of leaves,"" Ms. Caiola said. Mr. Hargrove said that the company had worked with ""countless"" employees to successfully authorize their absences from work. ",Walmart is accused of punishing workers for sick days
Kathleen McLaughlin and Diane Regas,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"As the pace of business accelerates, the need to be nimble and quickly shift direction to stay competitive becomes all the more important. But there are some initiatives that require a truly long-term commitment – areas where ""short-termism"" simply won't cut it…where companies need to stay the course despite the shifting winds of business or policy requirements. That is certainly the case with Project Gigaton, which our two organizations – Walmart and the Environmental Defense Fund – unveiled earlier this spring at Walmart's annual Sustainability Milestone Summit. The project goal is ambitious: To reduce one gigaton of greenhouse gas emissions (the equivalent to taking over 211 million cars off of U.S. roads and highways for a year) from Walmart's supply chain. And the 2030 time horizon is truly long-range. After all, by 2050, the global population will reach 9.5 billion. Millennials will be aging and Gen-Z at mid-life. They will be expecting our global environment to be as thriving as our global economy. The key to achieving these twin goals will be our ability to encourage, embrace and insist on powerful collaborations that will significantly amplify our individual efforts over time. We feel strongly that if retailers and suppliers across global supply chains work closely with NGOs to improve sustainability efforts then multiple stakeholders – consumers, communities and businesses – stand to benefit. Why the rosy view? Because consumers are listening to their hearts and taking action with their wallets.  The Consumer Report: From Marketing to Mattering, a global study by the United Nations Global Compact and Accenture, discovered that based on a survey of 30,000 consumers worldwide, approximately 64 percent of mothers and 66 percent of 18- to 34-year-old shoppers actively buy sustainable brands and recommend brands that behave responsibly. We see this happening first-hand, every day. And it's hardly a passing fad. Throughout our 10 years of close collaboration, Walmart and EDF have found that sustainability initiatives like Project Gigaton can drive emissions reductions and business value. This occurs through improved operations, reduced waste and cost, and revenue acceleration from supportive consumers. But are enough organizations thinking sufficiently long-term about these issues – and putting in place the strategies that are designed to ensure their success beyond the next quarter or annual meeting? In Walmart's case, it wasn't until 2005 when Hurricane Katrina – that ""one hundred year storm"" – struck the U.S. Gulf Coast. The company embraced its unexpected role as an early responder, providing thousands of truckloads of supplies and donated goods, while also helping coordinate relief efforts. In Katrina's aftermath, the company vowed to consider the long-term implications of the storm and to try to become a ""positive, difference-making company every day."" It started an ambitious journey to lower emissions, cut waste, and sell more sustainable products in its stores. Fast-forward to today. Project Gigaton is simply the most recent manifestation of that strategic direction, another in an evolving series of practices designed to help address long-term global challenges and improve people's lives. Yet at its core is an important realization: organizations of all sizes can make a noticeable, sustainable impact on the environment as well as improve business performance over the long term. According to a joint report published by the World Wildlife Fund and CDP, U.S. businesses that commit to annually cutting their carbon emissions can collectively reap as much as $190 billion in savings from reduced energy bills, increased productivity and other associated benefits. Another study found that companies devoted to sustainability efforts reported significantly higher mean sales growth, return on assets, profit before taxation, and cash flows from operations compared to sustainability slackers. So what's stopping more companies from focusing on ways to improve their sustainability and capturing the associated economic benefits? One factor may be the belief that their contributions are meaningless given the size and complexity of environmental issues. But that is flawed thinking. All contributors can make an impact, and collectively can reduce emissions that are having such a negative effect on our world. For Project Gigaton, Walmart and EDF collaborated with NGOs and other like-minded organizations to create an emissions reduction toolkit that offers a business case for cutting emissions. While designed for the company's supply chain, the principles embedded in these strategies, resources and implementation tactics can easily be customized and adopted for other like-minded organizations. We're happy to share it, just as we all share the same environment. And we encourage you to look anew at your own operations and supply chain for sustainable ways to improve them. 2030 is coming sooner than you think.

Tom DiChristopher,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"President Donald Trump is expected to pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement on Thursday, ignoring many of the nation's leading companies, who say the country should stick with the deal. Trump and the anti-Paris Agreement camp have levied a number of criticisms against the international accord, which aims to mitigate the effects of climate change by preventing global temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. They say Obama-era policies and regulations that would help the United States meet its commitments to the Paris Agreement will dampen economic growth and kill jobs. Critics also complain the deal holds countries like China and India to a lower standard and forces the U.S. to sacrifice its sovereignty. But many businesses say the United States will become more competitive and stands to grow its economy under the Paris Agreement. In April, a group of 16 companies — including Apple, Google, Walmart, mining company BHP Billiton, and oil majors BP and Shell — laid out exactly why the Paris Agreement will help U.S. companies. ""U.S. business interests are best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced global response. We believe the Paris Agreement provides such a framework,"" the CEOs said. Among the benefits the Paris accord provides to U.S. firms, according to the companies: Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff on Wednesday tweeted out a letter signed by about two dozen companies again asking Trump to stick with the Paris Agreement. @Benioff: Dear President Trump, as some of the largest companies in the US, we strongly urge you to keep the US in the Paris Agreement. On Thursday, Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman urged Trump to keep the United States in the Paris Agreement, warning he is putting the U.S. role in the high-tech job market at risk. ""This is not in the best interest of Americans. We need to own the next generation of jobs, and whether that's clean energy, 3-D printing or immunotherapy, this is an arena that America should lead and must lead,"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" ""I think this will be a big mistake if he withdraws from the Paris climate accord."" Oil majors including U.S. energy giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron say the accord offers a framework for tackling global warming and gives the United States a role in steering the global response to climate change. ""The Paris agreement and the initial Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) pledged by its signatories reflect the dual challenge of minimizing greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring the world has adequate access to affordable and reliable supplies of energy,"" Exxon said in a statement in November. To be sure, these companies are big players in natural gas development and stood to benefit from Obama-era regulations that have already expedited the retirement of some coal-fired plants and would likely continue that trend. Trump and Republicans have started rolling back many of those policies. But even some coal producers like Cloud Peak Energy and Peabody Energy argued the U.S. should remain a party in order to negotiate coal's future in the global energy mix. Many investors have also advised the president to keep the U.S. in the accord. Last month, 214 institutional investors with $15 trillion of assets under management pushed Trump to implement the U.S. commitment, which aims to reduce the nation's greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. ""As long-term institutional investors, we believe that the mitigation of climate change is essential for the safeguarding of our investments,"" they said.

Amanda Diaz,06082017,CNBC,06012017," One of the best-performing stocks in the last 30 years is about to see an ""explosive"" move higher, according to a top technician. On CNBC's ""Options Action"" Friday, Cornerstone Macro's Carter Worth explained that after two years of consolidation, biotech stocks are about to play catch up to the market, and one way to take advantage of the move is with one of its top constituents – Amgen. ""What we know about biotech is it was the leading single place you could be from 2011 to 2015,"" Worth explained. The Nasdaq biotech ETF, the IBB, soared more than 330 percent between January 2011 and July 2015. ""Then it drew down 38 percent … if it's ever going to catch up this is the time it's going to do it."" Targeting at Amgen specifically, Worth looked at a chart dating back to 1984 and compared it to the S&P 500 as well as other ""mature growth"" stocks, including McDonald's, Nike, Home Depot and Apple. Over the time period, Amgen rallied close to 100,000 percent, far outperforming the S&P 500's 1,373 percent move, McDonald's nearly 6,000 percent rise, Nike and Home Depot's more than 20,000 percent move and Apple's 35,163 percent rally.  Worth added that if one had invested $10,000 in Amgen in 1984, it would have returned nearly $10 million. ""This is arguably the single best-performing equity over the past 30 years,"" said Worth. ""It's ready to go again, having rested for two or three years."" After the years of consolidation, Worth noted that a wedge pattern has formed on the chart.""To my eye we are going to explode out to the upside,"" he said. ""I think big gains … and a setup for a powerful advance from the No. 1 stock ever,"" Worth added. ""This is arguably the single best-performing equity over the past 30 years,"" said Worth.

Annie Pei,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"Beware of what you're seeing with small-cap stocks, says Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com, because the group is pointing to trouble ahead for the broader market. While the major market indexes have rallied to numerous all-time highs this year, small-cap stocks have been stuck in a bind. The Russell 2000-tracking ETF (IWM) may be up 3 percent year to date, but small caps have actually been caught in a tight range since December while large-cap stocks have left them behind. That has left Gordon with an ""uneasy feeling,"" especially on a day like Tuesday when it seemed that only big-cap tech stocks were moving. The lack in movement from the small caps could suggest that the market rally may not be as broad based as investors may think. ""When you don't get small caps confirming where large caps are going, that's a problem, and not many people are talking about it,"" he said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" Since small caps are stuck in such a tight range, Gordon believes that trading the long-term-bond-tracking ETF TLT would actually be a better way to profit.""[We could short the IWM], but I am concerned from a trading point of view, our ability to time the breakdown of this range, so that's a low probability trade,"" explained Gordon.

Ylan Mui,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"The White House proposal to overhaul the U.S. food stamp program — and the deep cuts it would make to benefits for the poorest households — has sparked public outrage on both sides of the aisle. But there's another change tucked into the proposal that businesses say caught them off guard — and could wind up costing them more than $2 billion. That provision is a new fee that the White House wants to charge retailers that accept food stamps, which is now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Office of Management and Budget said the fee would be assessed when stores sign up and would require renewal after five years. The budget office said the amount would depend on the size and type of retailer, but the president's budget estimates that the fee would generate $2.4 billion in revenue over the next decade. An OMB official described the fee as ""modest"" and ""reasonable,"" emphasizing that some large retailers redeem a billion dollars or more in food stamp benefits each year. ""Although a small number of stores may choose to leave the program rather than pay the fee, we do not expect that this will affect access to authorized stores,"" the official said. The proposal surprised the grocery industry, which is already fighting to block the controversial border adjustment tax on Capitol Hill. That measure would lower the cost of exports but raise the price of imports and has been widely opposed by chain retailers. Trump's food stamp fee, however, would fall squarely on supermarkets. Grocers oppose the ""flawed policy of imposing fees on food retailers in order to reduce the cost of the federal government's nutrition assistance benefits to the most needy in our society,"" said Leslie G. Sarasin, president of the Food Marketing Institute, which represents the industry. Beyond the new fee, the Trump administration is proposing $191 billion in cuts over the next decade to the food stamp program. The U.S. budget office said the reductions would come from tightening the work requirement to qualify for the benefits, but said the details would be left up to individual states. The administration also expects states to make up some of the lost funding. The existing system ""is a formula for waste and growth rates and costs that are simply unsustainable,"" budget director Mick Mulvaney said during testimony on Capitol Hill last month. ""The total spending should not go down. Or if it does, it goes down because of efficiencies and not because of reductions."" But the proposed changes are already running into obstacles on Capitol Hill — even among Republicans. Rep. Michael Conaway of Texas and Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, the chairmen of the House and Senate agriculture committees, have signaled they would fight the measure. ""We need to take a look at our nutrition assistance programs to ensure that they are helping the most vulnerable in our society,"" they said in a statement. Food stamps accounted for about 5.8 percent of the estimated $669 billion in annual sales at grocery stores, according to the Food Marketing Institute. But for some retailers, it accounts for a much larger share of revenue. Wal-Mart is the largest supermarket in the country, and retail analyst Craig Johnson of Customer Growth Partners estimates it rings up $16 billion in food stamp sales each year. That accounts for about 23 percent of federal spending on food stamps. Wal-Mart declined to comment. But after the government restricted food stamp benefits in 2013, the company reported a 0.9 percent hit to its quarterly grocery sales. ""They may be calling it out as an excuse for underperformance,"" Johnson said. ""But it will be a small marginal impact."" Walmart is a massive retailer that can weather those small hits, but grocers overall operate on notoriously thin margins. Smaller stores — particularly the bodegas and independent retailers that serve poor neighborhoods — would likely feel more pain. ""Certainly, they would see it in their bottom line,"" said Brian Lang of The Food Trust, a Pennsylvania nonprofit. Lang directs a campaign to make healthy food more accessible. ""Implementing cuts to that extent are going to have stark consequences for retailers, especially in low-income communities."" ",Trump wants to start charging stores to accept food stamps
Matt Maley,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"Stocks are opening the week with a sigh, as the S&P 500 hovers around unchanged levels. But the index still managed to hit a narrow new all-time high in morning trading, following the 1.1 percent rally seen on Thursday and Friday. Even more important than the fact that stocks rose was that the S&P 500 broke meaningfully above its prior resistance level of 2,400. First hit on March 1, that level was the upper end of its multi-month sideways trading range. Why does this matter? Because since the February 2016 lows, in the three times that the S&P has broken out of a multi-month sideways range, it has gone on to rally another 4 to 5 percent. If we see a similar rally this time around, it would take the S&P slightly above 2,500. That does not mean the path will come in a straight line. It's worth noting that those prior three rallies came without much of a dip, or even a pause. However, this time around, we wouldn't be surprised to see the S&P take at least a short ""breather"" over the next few days. First, volume on Friday was quite low — just over three billion shares were traded on composite volume — and breadth on the S&P 500 was barely positive. It was a bit better for the Nasdaq, which outperformed again on Friday, but the market's breadth was not anywhere near as strong as it had been on other days in which the market saw a nice rally. Additionally, daily sentiment data, which measures futures traders' short-term market views, shows that bullishness on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq has reached the 89 percent level. That type of level tends to indicate that many of the people who were considering buying into stocks have already done so. This is a reason why a ""breather"" would not surprise us at all. If we had one glaring concern right now, it would be the state of the Treasury bond market. The 10-year Treasury yields is near this year's lows, while short-term yields have been rising thanks to the Fed's hiking plans; as a result, the yield curve is at its flattest since October. These divergences don't appear to matter at the moment, but as the old saying goes, ""It doesn't matter until it does."" One strategy we think investors should strongly consider is a ""bar-bell"" method. The strategy looks like this: Buy technology (and a few other big momentum plays) at one end of the risk spectrum while buying up defensive names (such as utilities, consumer staples and healthcare) at the opposite end of the risk spectrum. We've been harping on the defensive stocks most of this year. One of the reasons we like this strategy is we think there is a high likelihood that technology will see a meaningful decline at some point this year given the group's overbought condition. To be sure, this does not mean we're worried the group is going to collapse. A 12 percent decline would still leave the group in its upward-sloping channel from early 2016. But owning those defensive names could — and should — provide some cushion if the technology stocks do see a 10 percent correction. We understand why institutional investors need to stay in these overbought technology names, as the stocks are working too well to avoid them. But with the XLK information technology ETF overbought on a daily, weekly and even monthly basis, including these defensive groups in one's investment mix is a good idea. Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding. Long-time money manager Bob Doll is warning investors that stocks could breach October's correction lows. Semiconductor stocks are getting wrecked, but one market watcher says there could be more trouble for the group. Not the same as cheap ""value"" stocks, these are companies with less debt, stable businesses and some defensive characteristics in a tougher market or economy.

,06082017,Reuters,06012017,"Marc Lore, head of Wal-Mart’s e-commerce operations, said in a blog post on Thursday the step will cut shipping costs, speed the delivery of packages and allow workers to earn additional compensation. Wal-Mart’s stores are within 10 miles (16 km) of 90 percent of the U.S. population, Lore said. “Imagine all the routes our associates drive to and fro from work and the houses they pass along the way. It’s easy to see why this test could be a game changer,” he said. Since he joined in August, Lore has helped spearhead some aggressive moves intended to boost the retailer’s online business. Wal-Mart completed its $3 billion acquisition of Lore’s former company, internet retailer Jet.com, in September. Lore has overseen Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of three online retailers and made other e-commerce changes. Wal-Mart now offers free two-day shipping on online orders above $35, without any membership fees, to compete with Amazon’s popular Prime shipping program. Wal-Mart said on Thursday its trucks deliver packages to a retail location for store pickup and the same trucks can bring additional orders a worker can sign up to deliver. The delivery program is voluntary for store workers and allows them to sign up for a maximum of 10 deliveries a day. The retailer did not share details on compensation of workers who sign up. The test is limited to three stores in New Jersey and Arkansas. Wal-Mart will hold its annual shareholder meeting on Friday in Arkansas.

,06082017,Reuters,06012017,"FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc executives on Friday reassured workers they remained integral to the company’s success as they highlighted investments in online sales and other technology to compete with rivals like Amazon.com Inc. Wal-Mart is successfully using e-commerce to boost sales but does not want to alienate workers who have helped drive gains with improved customer service and higher morale following a rise in base pay to $10 an hour. “We will compete with technology, but win with people,” Chief Executive Doug McMillon said at Wal-Mart’s annual shareholder meeting where all the company’s board member nominations were approved. “We will be people-led and tech-empowered.” The nod to store employees and the retail workforce was a departure from past years when the company focused shareholder presentations on the technology it was adopting to close the online gap with Amazon and beat other competitors. The shift followed complaints by labor groups that Wal-Mart had to do more for workers, despite the company’s $2.7 billion investment in employee training and wages in 2015 and the 2016 wage increase to $10. McMillon’s comments capped a three-day media event during which the company announced initiatives like a test program that allows store workers to deliver packages ordered on the retailer’s website and the use of blockchain technology to ensure safety in its food supply chain. Wal-Mart’s investments in technology helped deliver a 63 percent rise in first quarter online sales, up from 29 percent growth in the fourth quarter and 20 percent in the third quarter. Its results have also outshined rivals like Target Corp, department-store chains and apparel retailers. The shareholders meeting at the Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Arkansas, 30 miles from the company’s headquarters in Bentonville, was packed with 14,000 people, including workers from around 27 countries and shareholders. The company tapped Blake Shelton to host the show which included pop stars like Gwen Stefani, Mary J. Blige and Rachel Platten. Wal-Mart’s shareholders approved all 11 company-recommended board members and voted in-line with company wishes. None of the four shareholder proposals put forward were approved. One from Making Change at Wal-Mart, part of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, called for an independent chairman to act in the interests of Wal-Mart’s hourly workers. “How can any Wal-Mart associate build a better life when they have been with the company for five years or more and they make $9 or $10 an hour,” said Amy Ritter from the labor group, who presented the proposal. For years, influential proxy advisory firms have recommended shareholders vote in favor of an independent board chairman without ties to management or the founding family, ever since bribery allegations several years ago exposed serious board oversight failures. About 51 percent of Wal-Mart’s stock is controlled by the Walton family and current Chairman of the Board Greg Penner is married to the grandaughter of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton. ","

,06082017,Reuters,06012017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg submitted a statement to the United Nations on Monday that over 1,000 U.S. governors, mayors, businesses, universities and others will continue to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement abandoned by President Donald Trump last week. Bloomberg, who is the U.N. Secretary-General’s special envoy for Cities and Climate Change, submitted the “We Are Still In” declaration to U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. He also launched a process to work with local governments and non-state entities to formally quantify the combined - and overlapping - emissions reduction pledges, which will be known as “America’s Pledge,” and submit the report to the United Nations. “Today, on behalf of an unprecedented collection of U.S. cities, states, businesses and other organizations, I am communicating to the United Nations and the global community that American society remains committed to achieving the emission reductions we pledged to make in Paris in 2015,”  Bloomberg said in a statement. Signatories to the new initiative include 13 Democratic and Republican governors, 19 state attorneys general, over 200 mayors, and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and small businesses. Trump on Thursday pulled the United States from the landmark 2015 agreement designed to fight climate change, fulfilling a major campaign pledge despite entreaties from U.S. allies and corporate leaders. Although the formal process to withdraw from the Paris agreement takes four years, Trump said the United States will not honor the pledge the Obama administration submitted, known as the nationally determined contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by the year 2025. To fill the void, “America’s Pledge” will be submitted to the UNFCCC as a “Societal NDC.” “The UNFCCC welcomes the determination and commitment from such a wealth and array of cities, states, businesses and other groups in the United States to fast forward climate action and emissions reductions in support of the Paris Climate Change Agreement,” said Espinosa. The coalition will align a number of different efforts to show U.S. support for the Paris agreement, including a commitment of over 260 corporations including Kellogg , Pepsi Co. and Walmart  to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in line with the latest science. Thirteen governors have also pledged to continue to honor the Paris pledges. “It will be up to the American people to step forward-and in Virginia we are doing just that,” said Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.

For the fifth year in a row, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT), a company with an outsized physical store presence, has taken the top spot in Fortune magazine's ranking of the top 500 companies. The Arkansas-based company, which is also the world's largest retailer, reported revenue of $485.8 billion last year. That figure is more than double the $223.6 billion revenue of second-place company on the list, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-A). With reported revenue of $215.6 billion, tech behemoth Apple Inc. (AAPL) rounded out the top three. Energy giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) dropped two places from last year to the fourth position, and pharma company McKesson Corporation (MCK) placed fifth. (See also: Fact Sheet: What Is the Fortune 500 List?) In recent years, investor sentiment has turned bearish toward Wal-Mart's future growth largely because the company has been slow on the uptake as far as e-commerce is concerned. However, an outsized revenue is not a guarantee of overall profits. On an overall basis, Wal-Mart ranked 11th in profits. The top spot in that category was taken by Apple, which reported profits of $45.7 billion. (See also: Wal-Mart to Consolidate Buying Operations.) Healthcare and pharma firms accounted for three of the top 10 largest companies in America, according to Fortune.

German discount retailers Lidl and Aldi are expanding and upgrading their respective footprints in the U.S. Privately held supermarket operator Lidl is poised to open its first stores stateside this month, according to an article in Bloomberg. German discounter Aldi, which opened its first U.S. stores four decades ago, is spending $1.6 billion to upgrade and expand its 1300 stores and add 650 new locations, according to the Wall Street Journal. And as the Bloomberg story points out, Walmart's U.K. grocery arm, Asda, has lost market share and sales to the German rivals. It adds that Asda has been the worst performing of the U.K.'s four largest supermarket chains.  In fact, Asda sales have been sliding for more than three years according to Kantar Retail in the WSJ story. It also notes that Aldi and Lidl have a 12% share of the U.K. market, eating the lunch of other grocers who are seeing sales and their shares sliding. Meanwhile back stateside, food prices have been falling and eating into grocery earnings for the past year and a half, the Journal states that's the longest drop in retail food price declines in six decades. American grocery giant Kroger had its first decline in quarterly same-store sales in 13 years and Publix Super Markets recently posted its first sales drop since the recession, per the WSJ. In other words, cutting prices has consequences in the long run, cutting revenue and pressuring margins (For more, see also: Why Walmart's Growth Is No Longer a Given.) Still Walmart may have to cut grocery prices more to compete, at least initially, with the German imports. One area where Walmart, and Amazon, may have an advantage is the omnichannel opportunity presented by its online platform to order groceries for kiosk pickup. They could also offer specialty or gourmet products that the discounters don't, and Bloomberg adds that pharmacy and financial product businesses may help differentiate Walmart from its rivals. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told the Wall Street Journal that the company's prepared to face off with high-powered, low-price grocers; it's fine-tuning Walmart-brand offerings, cutting some prices, and making sure the customer experience is smooth with faster checkout lines. The article also notes Walmart is testing a system allowing shoppers to scan products with their smartphones to avoid the registers. And it's worth noting as the story points out, Aldi has been in the U.S. for more than 40 years but still only has a 1% market share. So investors should keep an eye on just how much the German rivals affect Walmart's pricing in the store aisles while the retail kingpin battles Amazon in cyberspace.

Courtney Reagan,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"Walmart.com and Jet.com shoppers in three U.S. cities now have a new delivery person, and it's not employees of one of the major shipping companies like FedEx or UPS or a delivery start-up like Instacart or Deliv. It's a Wal-Mart store employee. ""Unlike crowdsourced delivery, where the driver has to travel (often out of the way) to pick up the package, then drive the full distance to deliver it, our associates are starting at the same place as the packages,"" said Marc Lore, president and CEO of Walmart eCommerce U.S., in a blog post for the retailer. It all works through a proprietary app the retailer built for this test. The app matches online order delivery addresses with employees' driving routes home from work, built to minimize any more driving than what the employee would do anyway to get home. Delivering is completely voluntary, and the employees can choose when they want to deliver, how many packages they can take and what size. ""Once they're done working at the store for the day, they pick up the packages from the backroom, load them into their vehicle, enter the delivery addresses into the GPS on their phone and head towards home,"" Lore said. Wal-Mart compensates the employees for it but declined to elaborate how it works. The discount retailer said the test has only been in progress for a month but so far ""hundreds"" of deliveries have been completed in two locations in New Jersey and one in Arkansas. So far, ""the response from associates and customers has been great,"" Lore said. Its locations and labor — some 4,700 U.S. stores with 1.3 million employees — are quite an asset that Lore has been working on further integrating with its digital operations. The retailer says 90 percent of the country's population live within 10 miles of a Walmart store. While the retailer does not provide a delivery cost breakdown, it's the last leg — commonly referred to as the ""last mile"" — that is the most expensive when it comes to fulfilling and shipping online orders. Consultant group McKinsey & Company estimates ""the last mile"" can sometimes be more than half of an item's total delivery cost. Last month, Wal-Mart Stores said it would offer shoppers a discount for 10,000 online-only orders that are picked up by shoppers in store rather than delivered to their homes. The discount, Marc Lore said, is ""meant to be equivalent to what the last-mile delivery costs are,"" which in most cases averages to about a 4 percent discount per item.The store pickup option saves Wal-Mart delivery costs, which it passes on to shoppers in the form of discounts, but the new employees-as-delivery-service test does not offer shoppers a discount. Wal-Mart said the benefit is that most orders are delivered the next day. ",Wal-Mart employees can now also deliver your online orders
Rachel Abrams,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"A report released Thursday by a workers' advocacy group says Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, routinely refuses to accept doctors' notes, penalizes workers who need to take care of a sick family member and otherwise punishes employees for lawful absences. The report, based on a survey of more than 1,000 employees, accuses Walmart of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act, among other worker-protection laws. The group argued in a lawsuit filed last month, and in an earlier complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that Walmart discriminated against pregnant workers. ""Walmart should fully comply with the law so that no one is illegally punished for a disability-related absence or for taking care of themselves or a loved one with a serious medical condition,"" said Dina Bakst, a founder and president of A Better Balance, the advocacy group that prepared the report. More from The New York Times:  How Twitter Is Being Gamed to Feed MisinformationAirbnb Is Popular, but Renting Out Your Car? That's Another StoryUber Says It Just Noticed Error on Pay, but It Was No Secret Walmart said that it had not reviewed the report but disputed the group's conclusions, and said that the company's attendance policies helped make sure that there were enough employees to help customers while protecting workers from regularly covering others' duties. ""We understand that associates may have to miss work on occasion, and we have processes in place to assist them,"" Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Walmart, said. The company reviews each employee's circumstances individually, he said, ""in compliance with company policy and the law."" Katie Orzehowski says her miscarriage last fall almost cost her a job. A cashier at the Walmart in North Huntingdon, Pa., Ms. Orzehowski said she tried to use doctors' notes and hospitalization records to excuse her missed shifts, to no avail. Worried that another absence would get her fired, she went back to work. ""I still had a lot of bleeding going on, and that's embarrassing,"" Ms. Orzehowski, 26, said. Her account is one of dozens included in the report, which clashes with the company's recent efforts to project a more worker-friendly image. Walmart has long been known for its penny-pinching attention to detail and its opposition to organized labor. But in the past couple of years, the company has announced that it would raise its minimum wage to $10 an hour and has pledged to invest heavily in training and paying workers. Workers' advocates have expressed skepticism about the retailer's commitment to improving the lives of its more than one million employees. Around the same time that Walmart lifted wages, it cut merit raises and introduced a training program that could keep hourly pay at $9 an hour for up to 18 months. In November, A Better Balance filed a complaint with the employment commission on behalf of Arleja Stevens, a Walmart employee who said she was fired after missing too many shifts because of complications from her pregnancy. In that filing, the group accused Walmart of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The employment commission is investigating the accusation, Ms. Bakst said. Mr. Hargrove said the company disagreed with Ms. Stevens's claims. A Better Balance also participated in a separate lawsuit last month alleging that Walmart discriminated against pregnant employees The company has disputed the claims of the two women at the center of the suit. A Better Balance wrote the survey questions used for Thursday's report. The questions asked employees whether they believed that Walmart had a problem of regularly punishing people for absences relating to an illness or disability, and about how the company treated absences. The group worked with the labor group OUR Walmart, which promoted the survey to workers who listed Walmart as their employer on Facebook, according to Andrea Dehlendorf, a director of OUR Walmart. ""Although this system is supposed to be 'neutral' and punish all absences equally, along the lines of a 'three-strikes-and-you're-out' policy, in reality, such a system is brutally unfair,"" the report says of Walmart's absence-control policy. ""It punishes workers for things they cannot control and disproportionately harms the most vulnerable workers."" Walmart assigns disciplinary points for unexcused absences and other infractions. Nine points in a six-month period can result in an employee's being fired, according to a copy of the company's absence policy reviewed by The New York Times. New employees may be fired for accruing four points in their first six months. While Walmart has written guidelines for how managers and supervisors should respond to employees who need help because of medical issues, those policies are not always followed, according to the report. ""They just straight up tell you, 'We don't accept excuses,'"" said Ms. Orzehowski, who still works for the company. In a follow-up email, Mr. Hargrove said that the company did ""not have any information that would support that Ms. Orzehowski advised us of a medical reason for her absences."" ""If that were the case, she could have used those medical records to apply for a leave or accommodation,"" he said. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires businesses with 15 or more employees to make reasonable accommodations for disabled workers. In 2008, the definition of a disabled worker was expanded, to include temporary medical conditions like complications relating to a pregnancy. The Family and Medical Leave Act protects eligible workers — those who have been employed for 12 months at a company with 50 or more employees — who need to take time off to care for themselves or a family member. Under the A.D.A., employers must work with employees to determine if workers are eligible for such accommodations. Dismissing doctors' notes or otherwise refusing to consider the reason for a worker's absence could potentially be ""skirting the analysis"" in which employers are required to engage, according to Michelle Caiola, the director of litigation for Disability Rights Advocates, a nonprofit group, and a former senior trial lawyer for the E.E.O.C., which enforces federal worker protections. ""A company as big as Walmart, it's surprising that they don't have the appropriate training for the personnel that would be overseeing these sorts of leaves,"" Ms. Caiola said. Mr. Hargrove said that the company had worked with ""countless"" employees to successfully authorize their absences from work. ",Walmart is accused of punishing workers for sick days
Kathleen McLaughlin and Diane Regas,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"As the pace of business accelerates, the need to be nimble and quickly shift direction to stay competitive becomes all the more important. But there are some initiatives that require a truly long-term commitment – areas where ""short-termism"" simply won't cut it…where companies need to stay the course despite the shifting winds of business or policy requirements. That is certainly the case with Project Gigaton, which our two organizations – Walmart and the Environmental Defense Fund – unveiled earlier this spring at Walmart's annual Sustainability Milestone Summit. The project goal is ambitious: To reduce one gigaton of greenhouse gas emissions (the equivalent to taking over 211 million cars off of U.S. roads and highways for a year) from Walmart's supply chain. And the 2030 time horizon is truly long-range. After all, by 2050, the global population will reach 9.5 billion. Millennials will be aging and Gen-Z at mid-life. They will be expecting our global environment to be as thriving as our global economy. The key to achieving these twin goals will be our ability to encourage, embrace and insist on powerful collaborations that will significantly amplify our individual efforts over time. We feel strongly that if retailers and suppliers across global supply chains work closely with NGOs to improve sustainability efforts then multiple stakeholders – consumers, communities and businesses – stand to benefit. Why the rosy view? Because consumers are listening to their hearts and taking action with their wallets.  The Consumer Report: From Marketing to Mattering, a global study by the United Nations Global Compact and Accenture, discovered that based on a survey of 30,000 consumers worldwide, approximately 64 percent of mothers and 66 percent of 18- to 34-year-old shoppers actively buy sustainable brands and recommend brands that behave responsibly. We see this happening first-hand, every day. And it's hardly a passing fad. Throughout our 10 years of close collaboration, Walmart and EDF have found that sustainability initiatives like Project Gigaton can drive emissions reductions and business value. This occurs through improved operations, reduced waste and cost, and revenue acceleration from supportive consumers. But are enough organizations thinking sufficiently long-term about these issues – and putting in place the strategies that are designed to ensure their success beyond the next quarter or annual meeting? In Walmart's case, it wasn't until 2005 when Hurricane Katrina – that ""one hundred year storm"" – struck the U.S. Gulf Coast. The company embraced its unexpected role as an early responder, providing thousands of truckloads of supplies and donated goods, while also helping coordinate relief efforts. In Katrina's aftermath, the company vowed to consider the long-term implications of the storm and to try to become a ""positive, difference-making company every day."" It started an ambitious journey to lower emissions, cut waste, and sell more sustainable products in its stores. Fast-forward to today. Project Gigaton is simply the most recent manifestation of that strategic direction, another in an evolving series of practices designed to help address long-term global challenges and improve people's lives. Yet at its core is an important realization: organizations of all sizes can make a noticeable, sustainable impact on the environment as well as improve business performance over the long term. According to a joint report published by the World Wildlife Fund and CDP, U.S. businesses that commit to annually cutting their carbon emissions can collectively reap as much as $190 billion in savings from reduced energy bills, increased productivity and other associated benefits. Another study found that companies devoted to sustainability efforts reported significantly higher mean sales growth, return on assets, profit before taxation, and cash flows from operations compared to sustainability slackers. So what's stopping more companies from focusing on ways to improve their sustainability and capturing the associated economic benefits? One factor may be the belief that their contributions are meaningless given the size and complexity of environmental issues. But that is flawed thinking. All contributors can make an impact, and collectively can reduce emissions that are having such a negative effect on our world. For Project Gigaton, Walmart and EDF collaborated with NGOs and other like-minded organizations to create an emissions reduction toolkit that offers a business case for cutting emissions. While designed for the company's supply chain, the principles embedded in these strategies, resources and implementation tactics can easily be customized and adopted for other like-minded organizations. We're happy to share it, just as we all share the same environment. And we encourage you to look anew at your own operations and supply chain for sustainable ways to improve them. 2030 is coming sooner than you think.

Tom DiChristopher,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"President Donald Trump is expected to pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement on Thursday, ignoring many of the nation's leading companies, who say the country should stick with the deal. Trump and the anti-Paris Agreement camp have levied a number of criticisms against the international accord, which aims to mitigate the effects of climate change by preventing global temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. They say Obama-era policies and regulations that would help the United States meet its commitments to the Paris Agreement will dampen economic growth and kill jobs. Critics also complain the deal holds countries like China and India to a lower standard and forces the U.S. to sacrifice its sovereignty. But many businesses say the United States will become more competitive and stands to grow its economy under the Paris Agreement. In April, a group of 16 companies — including Apple, Google, Walmart, mining company BHP Billiton, and oil majors BP and Shell — laid out exactly why the Paris Agreement will help U.S. companies. ""U.S. business interests are best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced global response. We believe the Paris Agreement provides such a framework,"" the CEOs said. Among the benefits the Paris accord provides to U.S. firms, according to the companies: Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff on Wednesday tweeted out a letter signed by about two dozen companies again asking Trump to stick with the Paris Agreement. @Benioff: Dear President Trump, as some of the largest companies in the US, we strongly urge you to keep the US in the Paris Agreement. On Thursday, Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman urged Trump to keep the United States in the Paris Agreement, warning he is putting the U.S. role in the high-tech job market at risk. ""This is not in the best interest of Americans. We need to own the next generation of jobs, and whether that's clean energy, 3-D printing or immunotherapy, this is an arena that America should lead and must lead,"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" ""I think this will be a big mistake if he withdraws from the Paris climate accord."" Oil majors including U.S. energy giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron say the accord offers a framework for tackling global warming and gives the United States a role in steering the global response to climate change. ""The Paris agreement and the initial Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) pledged by its signatories reflect the dual challenge of minimizing greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring the world has adequate access to affordable and reliable supplies of energy,"" Exxon said in a statement in November. To be sure, these companies are big players in natural gas development and stood to benefit from Obama-era regulations that have already expedited the retirement of some coal-fired plants and would likely continue that trend. Trump and Republicans have started rolling back many of those policies. But even some coal producers like Cloud Peak Energy and Peabody Energy argued the U.S. should remain a party in order to negotiate coal's future in the global energy mix. Many investors have also advised the president to keep the U.S. in the accord. Last month, 214 institutional investors with $15 trillion of assets under management pushed Trump to implement the U.S. commitment, which aims to reduce the nation's greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. ""As long-term institutional investors, we believe that the mitigation of climate change is essential for the safeguarding of our investments,"" they said.

Amanda Diaz,06082017,CNBC,06012017," One of the best-performing stocks in the last 30 years is about to see an ""explosive"" move higher, according to a top technician. On CNBC's ""Options Action"" Friday, Cornerstone Macro's Carter Worth explained that after two years of consolidation, biotech stocks are about to play catch up to the market, and one way to take advantage of the move is with one of its top constituents – Amgen. ""What we know about biotech is it was the leading single place you could be from 2011 to 2015,"" Worth explained. The Nasdaq biotech ETF, the IBB, soared more than 330 percent between January 2011 and July 2015. ""Then it drew down 38 percent … if it's ever going to catch up this is the time it's going to do it."" Targeting at Amgen specifically, Worth looked at a chart dating back to 1984 and compared it to the S&P 500 as well as other ""mature growth"" stocks, including McDonald's, Nike, Home Depot and Apple. Over the time period, Amgen rallied close to 100,000 percent, far outperforming the S&P 500's 1,373 percent move, McDonald's nearly 6,000 percent rise, Nike and Home Depot's more than 20,000 percent move and Apple's 35,163 percent rally.  Worth added that if one had invested $10,000 in Amgen in 1984, it would have returned nearly $10 million. ""This is arguably the single best-performing equity over the past 30 years,"" said Worth. ""It's ready to go again, having rested for two or three years."" After the years of consolidation, Worth noted that a wedge pattern has formed on the chart.""To my eye we are going to explode out to the upside,"" he said. ""I think big gains … and a setup for a powerful advance from the No. 1 stock ever,"" Worth added. ""This is arguably the single best-performing equity over the past 30 years,"" said Worth.

Annie Pei,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"Beware of what you're seeing with small-cap stocks, says Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com, because the group is pointing to trouble ahead for the broader market. While the major market indexes have rallied to numerous all-time highs this year, small-cap stocks have been stuck in a bind. The Russell 2000-tracking ETF (IWM) may be up 3 percent year to date, but small caps have actually been caught in a tight range since December while large-cap stocks have left them behind. That has left Gordon with an ""uneasy feeling,"" especially on a day like Tuesday when it seemed that only big-cap tech stocks were moving. The lack in movement from the small caps could suggest that the market rally may not be as broad based as investors may think. ""When you don't get small caps confirming where large caps are going, that's a problem, and not many people are talking about it,"" he said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" Since small caps are stuck in such a tight range, Gordon believes that trading the long-term-bond-tracking ETF TLT would actually be a better way to profit.""[We could short the IWM], but I am concerned from a trading point of view, our ability to time the breakdown of this range, so that's a low probability trade,"" explained Gordon. ""So I think what we can do is use a risk-aversion vehicle that's already in motion, which is TLT.""To determine the levels for the trade, Gordon connected the lows and the highs of TLT over the past few months to create a ""parallel channel.""

Ylan Mui,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"The White House proposal to overhaul the U.S. food stamp program — and the deep cuts it would make to benefits for the poorest households — has sparked public outrage on both sides of the aisle. But there's another change tucked into the proposal that businesses say caught them off guard — and could wind up costing them more than $2 billion. That provision is a new fee that the White House wants to charge retailers that accept food stamps, which is now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Office of Management and Budget said the fee would be assessed when stores sign up and would require renewal after five years. The budget office said the amount would depend on the size and type of retailer, but the president's budget estimates that the fee would generate $2.4 billion in revenue over the next decade. An OMB official described the fee as ""modest"" and ""reasonable,"" emphasizing that some large retailers redeem a billion dollars or more in food stamp benefits each year. ""Although a small number of stores may choose to leave the program rather than pay the fee, we do not expect that this will affect access to authorized stores,"" the official said. The proposal surprised the grocery industry, which is already fighting to block the controversial border adjustment tax on Capitol Hill. That measure would lower the cost of exports but raise the price of imports and has been widely opposed by chain retailers. Trump's food stamp fee, however, would fall squarely on supermarkets. Grocers oppose the ""flawed policy of imposing fees on food retailers in order to reduce the cost of the federal government's nutrition assistance benefits to the most needy in our society,"" said Leslie G. Sarasin, president of the Food Marketing Institute, which represents the industry. Beyond the new fee, the Trump administration is proposing $191 billion in cuts over the next decade to the food stamp program. The U.S. budget office said the reductions would come from tightening the work requirement to qualify for the benefits, but said the details would be left up to individual states. The administration also expects states to make up some of the lost funding. The existing system ""is a formula for waste and growth rates and costs that are simply unsustainable,"" budget director Mick Mulvaney said during testimony on Capitol Hill last month. ""The total spending should not go down. Or if it does, it goes down because of efficiencies and not because of reductions."" But the proposed changes are already running into obstacles on Capitol Hill — even among Republicans. Rep. Michael Conaway of Texas and Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, the chairmen of the House and Senate agriculture committees, have signaled they would fight the measure. ""We need to take a look at our nutrition assistance programs to ensure that they are helping the most vulnerable in our society,"" they said in a statement. Food stamps accounted for about 5.8 percent of the estimated $669 billion in annual sales at grocery stores, according to the Food Marketing Institute. But for some retailers, it accounts for a much larger share of revenue. Wal-Mart is the largest supermarket in the country, and retail analyst Craig Johnson of Customer Growth Partners estimates it rings up $16 billion in food stamp sales each year. That accounts for about 23 percent of federal spending on food stamps. Wal-Mart declined to comment. But after the government restricted food stamp benefits in 2013, the company reported a 0.9 percent hit to its quarterly grocery sales. ""They may be calling it out as an excuse for underperformance,"" Johnson said. ""But it will be a small marginal impact."" Walmart is a massive retailer that can weather those small hits, but grocers overall operate on notoriously thin margins. Smaller stores — particularly the bodegas and independent retailers that serve poor neighborhoods — would likely feel more pain. ""Certainly, they would see it in their bottom line,"" said Brian Lang of The Food Trust, a Pennsylvania nonprofit. Lang directs a campaign to make healthy food more accessible. ""Implementing cuts to that extent are going to have stark consequences for retailers, especially in low-income communities."" ",Trump wants to start charging stores to accept food stamps
Matt Maley,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"Stocks are opening the week with a sigh, as the S&P 500 hovers around unchanged levels. But the index still managed to hit a narrow new all-time high in morning trading, following the 1.1 percent rally seen on Thursday and Friday. Even more important than the fact that stocks rose was that the S&P 500 broke meaningfully above its prior resistance level of 2,400. First hit on March 1, that level was the upper end of its multi-month sideways trading range. Why does this matter? Because since the February 2016 lows, in the three times that the S&P has broken out of a multi-month sideways range, it has gone on to rally another 4 to 5 percent. If we see a similar rally this time around, it would take the S&P slightly above 2,500. That does not mean the path will come in a straight line. It's worth noting that those prior three rallies came without much of a dip, or even a pause. However, this time around, we wouldn't be surprised to see the S&P take at least a short ""breather"" over the next few days. First, volume on Friday was quite low — just over three billion shares were traded on composite volume — and breadth on the S&P 500 was barely positive. It was a bit better for the Nasdaq, which outperformed again on Friday, but the market's breadth was not anywhere near as strong as it had been on other days in which the market saw a nice rally. Additionally, daily sentiment data, which measures futures traders' short-term market views, shows that bullishness on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq has reached the 89 percent level. That type of level tends to indicate that many of the people who were considering buying into stocks have already done so. This is a reason why a ""breather"" would not surprise us at all. If we had one glaring concern right now, it would be the state of the Treasury bond market. The 10-year Treasury yields is near this year's lows, while short-term yields have been rising thanks to the Fed's hiking plans; as a result, the yield curve is at its flattest since October. These divergences don't appear to matter at the moment, but as the old saying goes, ""It doesn't matter until it does."" One strategy we think investors should strongly consider is a ""bar-bell"" method. The strategy looks like this: Buy technology (and a few other big momentum plays) at one end of the risk spectrum while buying up defensive names (such as utilities, consumer staples and healthcare) at the opposite end of the risk spectrum. We've been harping on the defensive stocks most of this year. One of the reasons we like this strategy is we think there is a high likelihood that technology will see a meaningful decline at some point this year given the group's overbought condition. To be sure, this does not mean we're worried the group is going to collapse. A 12 percent decline would still leave the group in its upward-sloping channel from early 2016. But owning those defensive names could — and should — provide some cushion if the technology stocks do see a 10 percent correction. We understand why institutional investors need to stay in these overbought technology names, as the stocks are working too well to avoid them. But with the XLK information technology ETF overbought on a daily, weekly and even monthly basis, including these defensive groups in one's investment mix is a good idea. Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding. Long-time money manager Bob Doll is warning investors that stocks could breach October's correction lows. Semiconductor stocks are getting wrecked, but one market watcher says there could be more trouble for the group. Not the same as cheap ""value"" stocks, these are companies with less debt, stable businesses and some defensive characteristics in a tougher market or economy.

Robert Cyran,06082017,CNBC,06012017,"Blue Apron, the meal-kit delivery firm that wants to go public, serves up delicious meals and tantalizing sales growth. But look closely at the ingredients. New-customer acquisition costs are surging, they are ordering fewer meals, and competitors abound. Like Groupon before it, this is a case where the product is fine but the stock is best avoided. The idea is simple and appealing. Deliver easily prepared meals to clients' doors. Young professionals and harried homemakers can appreciate not having to stop at stores or draw up menus. Budding cooks can try out new dishes. Customers with few restaurant options nearby can try out cool recipes. All of this helps explain why Blue Apron – which wisely changed its name from Petridish Media – has over 1 million customers and grew first-quarter revenue 42 percent to $245 million.
